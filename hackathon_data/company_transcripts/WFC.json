My name is Regina and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference.","John Campbell","Thank you, Regina. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO and President, Tim Sloan and our CFO, John Shrewsberry will discuss fourth quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our fourth quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I\u2019d also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today\u2019s call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our website.","I will now turn the call over to our CEO and President, Tim Sloan.","Tim Sloan","Thank you, John. Good morning. And thank you all for joining us today. 2018 was a year of continued transformation at Wells Fargo. We added impressive new leaders to our team, introduced new products and services for our customers, fundamentally improved risk management, invested billions of dollars in technology and innovation and substantially increased our capital return to shareholders.","At the same time, we earned $22.4 billion and $4.28 per diluted common share in 2018, the highest earnings per share in the company\u2019s history. While we faced challenges, I\u2019m so proud of the hard work and the perseverance of our team members.","I\u2019m going to highlight some of our accomplishments in 2018 on each of our six goals, starting with our goal to provide exceptional customer service and advice. We sent an average of more than 37 million monthly zero balance and customer specific balance alerts and helped over 2.3 million customers avoid overdraft charges through overdraft rewind in 2018. While these customer friendly initiatives lowered our revenues, they are consistent with our vision of helping our customers succeed financially in building long-term relationships.","We also implemented fee waivers for customers affected by natural disasters, including the California wild fires and East Coast hurricanes. And most recently we are supporting customers who are affected by the ongoing government shutdown through fee reversals and other assistance to those who are having difficulties making loan payments.","In addition, we\u2019ve made changes to better serve our customers and our branches as we are focused on conversations aimed at helping to better understand their financial needs. These improvements were reflected in both our customer loyalty and overall satisfaction with most recent visit branch survey scores reaching a 24-month high in December.","As part of our focus on team member engagement, we increased pay for entry level team members in the U.S. and granted restricted stock rights to approximately 250,000 team members which helps connect their success to what\u2019s important to our shareholders.","Our voluntary team member attrition improved to its lowest level in six years in 2018 and we continued to attract new team members from outside the company including our most recently announced Head of Technology Saul Van Beurden, who will join us and join our operating committee and will report to me in April.","Our progress on our goal of being a leader in innovation was demonstrated by launching many customer focused products and services in 2018, including our online mortgage application with 30% of all retail applications done online in December. Our CEO mobile for wholesale customers, with half of the users now using biometrics to authenticate; Control tower with more than 90% of debit card on\/off requests now handled digitally.","Propel, one of the most compelling no annual fee rewards cards in the industry, and most recently, a seven state pilot of Greenhouse, a mobile-first banking account app with innovative cash management functionality.","Leadership and Corporate citizenship is one of the six goals because we believe Wells Fargo should play a role in building stronger communities. In 2018, we exceeded our target of donating $400 million to communities across the country, up more than 40% from a year ago, making us one of the top corporate givers in the U.S.","A recent example is our holiday food bank program, which in partnership with our customers and team members provided over 50 million meals to those in need. Our goal of delivering long term shareholder value was demonstrated by returning $25.8 billion to shareholders in 2018, up 78% from 2017.","Last year, we also established dollar targets for non-interest expense for 2018, 2019 and 2020 to help our shareholders better follow the progress we\u2019re making to become more efficient. We achieved our 2018 expense target and we remain committed to meeting our expense targets for 2019 and 2020.","I\u2019ll now turn to risk management and an update on the asset cap, which is part of the consent order we entered into with the Federal Reserve Board in February of last year. There are two parts to the consent order, governance and oversight and compliance and operational risk management. We\u2019ve made meaningful progress on both.","We have hired new leaders in key roles including our new Chief Risk Officer, Chief Compliance Officer, Head of Regulatory Relations and Chief Operational Risk Officer and our corporate risk management team members grew by approximately 1,300 or 15% in 2018.","We invested $1.8 billion on important initiatives as part of our technology expense on cyber, data and risk management. We introduced our risk management framework, which we described in our third quarter 10-Q, which fundamentally transforms how we manage risk throughout the organization in a comprehensive, integrated and consistent manner, and involves team members throughout the company in every line of defense.","We changed the composition of our board, including reconstituting several board committees, and amending committee charters to sharpen focus and reduce duplication in the board\u2019s risk oversight. And we enhanced information flow and escalation of matters to the board as well as the reporting and analysis provided to the board.","We continue to have a constructive dialogue with the Federal Reserve on an ongoing basis to clarify expectations, receive feedback and assess progress. In order to have enough time to incorporate this feedback in our plans in a thoughtful manner and adopt and implement the final plans as accepted by the Federal Reserve and complete the required third party reviews, we\u2019re now planning to operate under the asset cap through the end of 2019.","Making the changes necessary to not only need, but to exceed regulatory expectation remains a top priority, as is continuing to serve our customers and help them succeed financially. We believe that we can achieve both of these priorities, while we operate under the asset cap and our growth in both loans and deposits in the fourth quarter demonstrated our ability to do so.","When I assumed the CEO role, I took responsibility for addressing the retail sales practices issue while also pledging to examine every business at Wells Fargo. I assured all of our stakeholders that we would be transparent in our actions and we\u2019ve done that. Nearly all the matters we have recently resolved reflect issues from our past, including the recently announced state attorneys general settlement last month.","Regardless of when they occurred, these past matters need to be resolved in the present. The settlements we\u2019ve reached last year and the remediation we provided to customers reflects important progress on our goal to move Wells Fargo forward as quickly as possible, while continuing to provide our customers with high quality service, and advice each and every day.","Over the past two years with the full support of our board of directors, we\u2019ve undertaken a massive effort to transform Wells Fargo. In 2019, we will continue to build the most customer focused, efficient and innovative Wells Fargo ever, characterized by a strong financial foundation, a leading presence in markets we serve, focused growth within a strong risk management framework, operational excellence, and highly engaged team members.","I\u2019m confident we will succeed, and that these efforts will result in even better Wells Fargo for all of our stakeholders. John Shrewsbury will now discuss our financial results in more detail.","John Shrewsberry","Thank you, Tim, and good morning everyone. We highlight our fourth quarter results on page two, including earning $6.1 billion or $1.21 per diluted common share and an ROE of 12.89% and an ROTCE of 15.39%. We once again had strong credit quality and high levels of liquidity and capital. We returned $8.8 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases, more than double the amount from a year ago.","And we had positive business momentum, including one, growing loans in deposits on both an average and period and basis from the third quarter; two, increasing primary consumer checking customers by 1.2% from a year ago net of the previously disclosed sale of 52 branches that closed in the fourth quarter, reducing this growth rate by 0.5%.","Three, increasing card usage with debit card purchase volume up 8% and consumer general purpose credit card purchase volume up 5% from a year ago; four, growing loan originations year-over-year in auto by 9%, home equity by 14%, small business by 19% and student lending by 16%. And five, reducing expenses and meeting our 2018 expense targets.","On Page three, we highlight noteworthy items in the fourth quarter. Our earnings of $6.1 billion included a $614 million gain on the sale of $.6 billion of Pick-a-Pay PCI mortgage loans, $432 million of operating losses, which included $175 million accrual for the agreement reached in December with all 50 state attorneys general and the District of Columbia regarding previously disclosed consumer matters, a $372 million adjustment, negative net MSR valuation adjustment for servicing and foreclosure costs, discount rates and prepayment estimates recognized as a result of recent market observations related to an acceleration of prepayments, including for VA loans and market participants current valuation of MSRs.","These adjustments were not related to our ongoing interest rate hedging, and so hedging program performed as intended to protect against interest rate changes in the fourth quarter. A $200 million reserve release reflecting continued improvement in the credit quality of the loan portfolio, and while it didn\u2019t impact our earnings, deferred compensation, which is impacted by equity market pricing reduced fees by $452 million and reduced expenses by $428 million in the fourth quarter.","Our effective income tax rate was 13.7% which included $158 million of net discrete income tax benefits primarily related to the results of state income tax audits and incremental state tax credits, and $137 million benefit related to revisions and our full year 2018 effective income tax rate made in the quarter.","We highlight our full year results on page four, compared with 2017, revenues declined from lower fee income, primarily driven by $1.3 billion decline in mortgage banking, primarily due to lower gains on mortgage originations, a $620 million decline in insurance reflecting the sale of Wells Fargo insurance services, and $395 million decline in deposit service charges driven by the customer friendly changes we\u2019ve implemented, which have reduced fees, together with a higher ECR for commercial customers.","The increase in net interest income was driven by a higher margin, which more than offset declines in earning assets and a shift in loan mix to lower yielding, higher quality assets. Expenses declined, driven by lower operating losses. We also had lower expenses in a number of other categories, including outside professional services, outside data processing and travel and entertainment.","We continued to have strong credit performance due to a number of factors including the efforts to de-risk the loan portfolio by running off or selling higher risk consumer loans while growing higher quality assets. And our capital levels remained quite strong, while we reduced common shares outstanding by 6%.","I\u2019ll be highlighting the balance sheet drivers on page 5 throughout the call, so I\u2019ll now turn to page six. On page six, I\u2019d like to highlight that our 2013 full year effective income tax rate was 20.2% or 18% before discrete items. We currently expect the effective income tax rate for full year 2019 to be approximately 18% excluding the impact of any unanticipated discrete items.","Average loans increased $6.8 billion from the third quarter, the first linked quarter increase since fourth quarter of 2016 with growth in the commercial portfolio partially offset by continued declines in consumer specifically auto and home equity. Period end loans increased $10.8 billion from the third quarter, but were down $3.7 billion from a year ago, as we sold or transferred to held for sale $8.4 billion of Pick-a-Pay PCI loans and reliable financial services loans in 2018.","Let me explain period end loan trends in more detail, starting with the commercial portfolio on page eight. Commercial loans grew $10 billion from a year ago, and $11.5 billion from the third quarter. C&I loans have grown for five consecutive quarters and increased $12.2 billion from the third quarter. This growth was broad based across a number of our wholesale businesses and was largely to investment grade, corporate credits and high quality middle market borrowers.","Our growth benefited from strong M&A based financing and to a lesser extent from weaker capital market conditions for debt issuances. Our pipeline suggests continued C&I growth in 2019 although not at the rate we have seen in the fourth quarter of 2018.","Commercial real estate loans were down $583 million from the third quarter and it declined for seven consecutive quarters, reflecting continued credit discipline and competitive in the highly liquid markets and pay downs of existing and acquired loans. We anticipate these market factors will continue to impact portfolio balances in the near term.","As we show on page nine, consumer loans declined $709 million from the third quarter and included the sale of $1.6 billion of Pick-a-Pay PCI mortgage loans in the fourth quarter. We had $4.9 billion of Pick-a-Pay PCI loans remaining at year-end.","Despite the PCI loan sale, the first mortgage loan portfolio increased $792 million from the third quarter. We had $9.8 billion of non-conforming mortgage loan originations in the fourth quarter excluding $562 million that were designated as held for sale in anticipation of future issuance of RMBS.","Junior lean mortgage loans continued to decline as originations were more than offset by pay downs, primarily by loans originated prior to 2009. Credit card loans increased $1.2 billion from the third quarter driven by seasonality as well as growth in active accounts including the Propel card.","Auto loan balances were down $1 billion from the third quarter due to expected continued run-off. Due to the sale of reliable, auto originations were down 1% from the third quarter, but they were up 9% from a year ago, reflecting our focus on growing high quality auto loans following the transformational changes we made to the business. We currently expect auto portfolio balances to begin growing by the middle of this year.","Other revolving credit and installment loans declined $776 million from the third quarter reflecting lower securities based lending, student loans and personal loans and lines.","Average deposits declined $42.7 billion from a year ago reflecting both lower wholesale banking deposits, including actions taken in the first half of the year to manage to the asset gap and lower wealth and investment management deposits as customers allocated more cash to higher rate alternatives.","Average deposits rose $2.5 billion from the third quarter as increases in wholesale banking deposits were partially offset by lower consumer and small business banking deposits, which included $1.8 billion of deposits associated with the sale of 52 branches at the end of November.","On page 11, we show what has happened with deposit beta since the Fed started increasing rates in 2015, our cumulative beta since the start of the cycle was 32% and the cumulative beta over the past year was 38% which was above the experience for the first 100 basis point increase in the fed funds rate. Wholesale deposit repricing was aligned with historical experience, while retail deposits have repriced slower than historical experience through the end of 2018.","On page 12, we thought we provide details on Period-end deposits which increased $19.6 billion from the third quarter. Wholesale banking deposits were up $10.6 billion from the third quarter, with strong inflows late in the period while consumer and small business banking deposits increased $8.5 billion, which included wealth and investment management, small business banking and retail banking.","Wealth and investment management deposits increased for the first time in three quarters, driven by higher retail brokerage sweep deposits, and private banking deposits partially reflecting our customers change in risk appetite given market volatility at the end of the quarter.","Net interest income increased $72 million from the third quarter, driven primarily by the benefits of higher average interest rates and favorable hedge ineffectiveness accounting results, partially offset by the impacts from balance sheet mix and lower variable income.","While the change in balance sheet mix negatively impacted net interest income, it also reflected an increasing proportion of higher quality lower risk loans on the balance sheet. Our NIM was stable linked quarter and up 10 basis points from a year ago.","Non-interest income declined $1 billion from the third quarter, driven by lower market sensitive revenue, mortgage banking fees, interest and investment fees partially offset by higher other income which included $117 million gain from the sale of 52 branches.","The decline in market sensitive revenue was driven by lower gains from equity securities, which declined $395 million. Deferred compensation reduced gains from equity securities by $570 million from the third quarter, which was partially offset by higher gains from our venture capital and private equity partnerships.","Trading gains declined $148 million and total trading revenue which we summarized on Page 32 of the supplement was down $123 million driven by credit spreads widening. It was a volatile market in the fourth quarter, however, our trading book performed as we would expect in that environment.","Mortgage banking revenue declined $379 million from the third quarter as a result of lower servicing income, and lower net gains on mortgage loans, originations and sales. The decline in servicing income was driven by the negative net MSR valuation adjustments that I highlighted earlier. The decline in mortgage origination gains reflected $8 billion of seasonally lower originations, and we expect originations in the first quarter to be seasonally low as well.","The production margin decreased to 89 basis points primarily due to lower retail margins, partially offset by a lower percentage of correspondent volume. We still have not seen any significant capacity being removed from the market and we expect the production margin in the first quarter to remain in the range of the past two quarters of 2018.","Given the ongoing competitiveness in the mortgage market, we\u2019re focused on improving the customer experience and reducing cost.","Trust in investment fees declined $111 million from the third quarter on lower investment banking results due to the lower advisory, equity and debt underwriting, and lower asset base fees from market valuations.","Turning to expenses on page 15, expenses declined from both the third quarter and a year ago. I\u2019ll expand the drivers in more detail starting on page 16. Expenses were down $424 million or 3% from the third quarter. The decline was driven by reduced compensation and benefits expense due to negative deferred compensation expense.","Expenses also declined due to lower running the business non-discretionary expense, driven by lower FDIC expense, following the completion of the FDIC special assessment. Also operating losses declined partially offset by a pension plan settlement expense in the fourth quarter.","Of the categories where expenses increased, many are typically higher in the fourth quarter including advertising and promotion, travel and entertainment and outside professional services. As we show on page 17, expenses were down $3.5 billion from a year ago, driven by lower operating losses.","On page 18, we show total non-interest expense in 2018, a $56.1 billion, which included $3.1 billion of operating losses. We met our 2018 expense target with $53.6 billion of non-interest expense, which excludes $2.5 billion of operating losses in excess of $600 million. We are on track to meet our expense targets for 2019 and 2020.","On page 19 we highlight some of the actions we took in 2018 to improve efficiency. There are three primary areas we are focused on as part of our efficiency efforts. Centralization and optimization includes the work we completed across the company centralizing staff functions as well as the work we started with our contact centers to improve the customer experience, which includes both the consolidation of centers into hub locations and technology simplification. Our work will continue during this year, which is expected to result in additional cost savings as well as reduced customer transfers and wait times.","We\u2019ve made significant changes in how we\u2019re running many of our consumer and wholesale businesses, including streamlining the retail mortgage sales organization, eliminating layers and reengineering the mortgage fulfillment process, which reduce home lending headcount by 5000 in 2018. The changes we\u2019ve made to our branches resulting from the changing from changing customer preferences reduce branch headcount by over 2800 in 2018, with additional reductions expected this year. We\u2019re also restructuring our wholesale businesses to be more aligned around the customer, which has reduced duplication and enabled greater consolidation of operations and applications.","Our third area of focus is on governance and controls, which includes reducing third party consulting spend, consolidating manager positions as part of a more consistent approach to span of control across the company and continuing to drive more efficient projects spend through a rigorous investment optimization process.","While we made meaningful progress on our efficiency in 2018 there are significant ongoing efforts being implemented across the company, reflecting changing customer preferences and our focus on efficiency.","Our goal is to realize sustainable cost reductions through operational excellence, which is expected to reduce headcount by 5% to 10% as we previously announced. Headcount reduction in 2018 included approximately 60% from voluntary team member attrition and future reductions are also expected to come from a combination of voluntary attrition and displacement.","Turning to our business segment starting on page 20, community banking earnings increased $353 million from the third quarter, driven by lower operating losses and income tax expense. On page 21, we provide updated community banking metrics.","Teller and ATM transactions declined 5% from a year ago, reflecting continued customer migration to digital channels. As planned, we completed 300 branch consolidations in 2018 and sold 52 branches in the fourth quarter. At year end, we had 29.2 million digital active customers up 4% from a year ago, which includes mobile active customer growth of 7%.","Primary consumer checking customers have grown year-over-year for five consecutive quarters and growth in new checking customers continue to be driven by digital. With new checking customers acquired from the digital channel more than doubling from a year ago.","On page 22, we highlight our strong growth in credit and debit card purchase volume. As Tim highlighted at the start of the call, both customer loyalty and overall satisfaction with the most recent visit branch survey scores reached a 24-month high in December with steady improvement over the past six months.","Turning to page 23, wholesale banking earnings declined $180 million from the third quarter driven by lower trading gains, investment banking fees and other income, which was partially, offset by higher loan fees and commercial real estate brokerage commissions.","Wealth and investment management earnings declined $43 million from the third quarter. Volatility in the equity markets during the fourth quarter impacted results, but helped to drive period end deposit growth.","Also, as a reminder, retail brokerage advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter, so fourth quarter results reflected the higher September 30th market valuations and first quarter 2019 results will reflect a lower December 31st market valuations.","Turning the Page 25, we recognize that this credit cycle has lasted longer than most, and we remain vigilant regarding credit risk. However, we continued to have strong credit results with a net charge-off rate of 30 basis points in the fourth quarter.","For the fifth consecutive quarter, all of our commercial and consumer real estate loan portfolios were in a net recovery position and non-performing assets declined $280 million or 4% from the third quarter and were down 16% from a year ago.","Turning to Page 26, our CET1 ratio fully faced phased-in declined 20 basis points from the third quarter due to common stock dividends and net share repurchases, but it remained well above regulatory minimums and is aligned with our plan of prudently managing toward our internal target of 10%.","We repurchased 142.7 million shares of our common stock in the fourth quarter some of which were purchased as a part of a 10b5-1 program we initiated during the quarter. While we were pleased to return $25.8 billion to shareholders in 2018 our CET1 ratio was down only 30 basis points from a year ago as RWA improvements, including the regulatory guidance covering high volatility commercial real estate, as well as declines in RWA from changes in balance sheet mix to lower risk assets benefited our capital position.","Similar to prior years, we will be assessing our current and projected level of access capital as one of the many key considerations in the evaluation of future capital distributions as part of our capital adequacy assessment in this year\u2019s capital plan.","So, in summary, in 2019 we plan to continue focusing on transforming Wells Fargo into a better bag, by improving risk management and customer service making Wells Fargo a great place to work, launching industry leading innovation, contributing to our communities and creating long term shareholder value.","We\u2019ll now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Erika Najarian","Hi, good morning.","Tim Sloan","Good morning, Erika.","Erika Najarian","Good morning. I wanted to ask first about the asset cap, because that seems to have taken your stock a leg down Tim when you announced it would be in place at the end of 2019. And I guess this is a two part question. One is the extension and expectation for the asset cap, does that reflect progress relative to your expectations towards the consent orders that are slower than you thought you would achieve regardless of the absolute level of progress?","And second, if you could remind investors especially given the different sales that you\u2019ve been doing in your Pick-a-Pay book, how the asset cap being in place in 2019, what any incremental impact that would have on the revenue outlook if any at all?","Tim Sloan","Sure. Both really good questions Erika, and thanks Erika. Thank you for asking them. Let me just level set right, in that a lot of the dialogue that we have with the Fed is covered by a confidential supervisory information, so I want to be very careful in the feedback I\u2019m providing. But, I want to reiterate that we continue to have very frequent and constructive dialogue with the Fed, and we\u2019re both working towards the same goal, which is that we want to have best-in-class risk management period.","As you would recall, the consent order has two main topics. One is corporate governance. And the second is compliance and operational risk management. And each of these have multiple work streams behind them. The plans that we provided are very comprehensive, involve extensive documentation, which takes time to review and to process. So the feedback that we\u2019re getting from the Fed is very detailed and the outlook we\u2019re providing uses the best judgment that we have in terms of how long the process will take.","But at the same time, we\u2019re continuing to actively work and implement the new risk management framework, as I mentioned, we detailed that in our third quarter 10-Q and as well as incorporating the input that we\u2019re getting back from the Fed along the way. And from my perspective, we\u2019re making good progress. It\u2019s just taking a little bit longer than what we had originally anticipated.","But, to your second question, I think the fourth quarter results reinforce our ability particularly when you look at loan growth, and you net out the impact of the legacy loan portfolios for example, in Pick-a-Pay from the asset sales or the decline in pre 2009 home equity portfolio.","But when we factor that out, what you saw is our ability to serve our customers by providing them credit. You saw our deposit growth continue. And so our view is that we\u2019re going to be able to operate under the asset cap, meet and exceed the expectations of the Federal Reserve as it relates to our requirements under the asset cap and serve our customers, because again, we\u2019re in complete agreement with the Fed about what needs to be done and we\u2019re in the midst of implementing that.","So we\u2019re making progress. It\u2019s just happening a little bit slower than we had originally anticipated, but we\u2019ll get there.","Erika Najarian","Thank you for that. My second question has to do with the expense outlook relative to the revenue outlook, which seems to be downgraded by the market for the bank, for banks in general. So if the Fed, we are in a Fed pause or a stop as of December, I\u2019m wondering if there would be any more flex in the expenses beyond what we\u2019ve been given -- given an absolute basis particularly as the market is getting a little bit more downbeat about market sensitive revenues.","Tim Sloan","Sure. So let me start and then John can jump in. I think first, we were really pleased to be able to achieve the expense targets that were promised to all last summer at Investor Day, right. And we want to reiterate today, and I hope you appreciated hearing that from both John and me, and I\u2019ll say it a third time that our goal is to hit and achieve the expense targets that we provided you not only for this year, but through 2020.","Having said that, we certainly appreciate that the market is dynamic, the economy is dynamic, there\u2019s lots of change that are going on, and to the extent that, that we see opportunities to take additional or make additional expense saves, we\u2019re going to go ahead and do that. That may be generated by the fact that we see the opportunities or if revenues might be a little bit lower. But when we look at the economy today, and we look at our performance for the fourth quarter, we feel cautiously optimistic about 2019. So again, I think that our goal is to meet the expectations that we set for you as it relates to expenses for 2019, and 2020. If we do need to do more, of course, we\u2019ll go ahead and do that.","John, I don\u2019t know if you want to provide any more\u2026","John Shrewsberry","And if there are specific areas of the business that because of something that\u2019s happening more broadly, are not living up to expectations that we would we would focus in on that and take the appropriate action to make sure that we were right sized for what the medium to long term opportunity is. But, there is a -- as you\u2019ll appreciate there is a list of literally hundreds of items that are underway to deliver the results that were, that were promising, and people are working hard to deliver that. Everything should be on the table. But there\u2019s -- there\u2019s a lot to do just to deliver against what we\u2019ve promised.","If as you described there is a certain business or a certain area, a certain sector of our business that\u2019s incrementally underperforming because of something is different in 2019 and 2020 than what we anticipated, and then we would take the appropriate action.","Erika Najarian","And one last question to slip in there. We ask this of your peers this morning. As we think about the Fed on pause, how should we think about the net interest income trajectory for 2019?","John Shrewsberry","Yes, so Fed on pause if it\u2019s true is part of it. I think every dealer I\u2019ve looked at, has two rate increases built into their forecasts for 2019. So we\u2019ll see whether that happens or not. But, just as important from my perspective is what happened to the long end of the curve, because it\u2019s come rallying back down, and that is critical, just because of the magnitude of our collective investment portfolios and reinvestment requirements that will make a difference.","What happens with deposit flows will matter, what happens especially in the retail space with deposit pricing among larger banks, which as we\u2019ve pointed out has sort of outperformed historical benchmarks. And then what the appetite is for loan growth. We saw great loan growth in the fourth quarter some of that I think was either seasonal or reflecting what was going on in markets in the fourth quarter, which caused people to turn to their banks even more than they otherwise would have.","But if we have -- if we have strongest loan growth that will be supportive, but if deposit prices start on the retail side start picking up, then that will -- that will run in the other direction. So I think we\u2019ll be, we\u2019ll be thrilled to see some, some measurable or even meaningful interest rate interest income growth in 2019. But a lot has to happen for that to work out.","Erika Najarian","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Tim Sloan","Morning, John.","John McDonald","Hi good morning guys. John, wanted to just follow up on Erika\u2019s last question there. So any change to your NII sensitivity that\u2019s occurred if you could give us an update there? And I guess, at the current level of deposit beta, do you see a modest benefit still from a hike, and then, you know if you don\u2019t see a hike, is it really just come down to the loan growth and what we know in a quarter where there\u2019s no rate hike, does NIM kind of trend flattish?","John Shrewsberry","Yes. So we\u2019re still \u2013 we\u2019re still in the middle of our \u2013 we\u2019ve actually taken some actions to remain in the middle of our -- of our forecast and guidance for interest rate sensitivity. And to the extent that there are no hikes, in my mind the big question is, well what happens with the catch up from prior hikes and deposit costs?","So if we -- if the market -- if big banks in particular, but if the market starts edging up what they\u2019re paying for deposits with Fed funds not moving, with new assets not repricing up at the same time. Then that would have a compressing outcome.","We haven\u2019t seen as much of that, but there was a belief that we were going to keep on this trajectory for a little bit longer in terms of rate hikes. I\u2019ll be interested to see what where things settle out. If the Fed funds target is not moving.","And then as you say, loan growth will be a part of it in what\u2019s happening. If the absence of hikes is a reflection of things slowing down, then you might expect to see that in a loan growth as well although we didn\u2019t see it in the fourth quarter. And then as I mentioned to Erika don\u2019t just kind of the importance of what\u2019s going on with loan rates, because the curve has been flattening well, short rates have been coming up especially in the fourth quarter when we -- when we came crashing down well below 3%, and that really contributes on all of this incremental liquidity that keeps getting reinvested. If it\u2019s getting reinvested, 50 basis points below where it might have been, or where you might have thought it was, at the beginning of December, then that has an impact also.","But we\u2019re still asset sensitive. An increase in the Fed funds target would have a predictable upward impact. The absence of it worried a little bit, but again, it depends on then what happens with deposit pricing.","John McDonald","Okay. And not trying to tie you down to a point estimate here, but just trying to get a sense of how you feel going into the year, you kept in 2018 and I was relatively flat with some ups and downs and rates and long growth. Do you feel better about the ability to grow net interest income in 2019 with maybe some of the abatement of runoff in the loan book and then the rate sensitivity that you just described? Do you feel like you can grow net interest income by some amount in 2019?","John Shrewsberry","I think we can. But it\u2019s the puts and takes as the things that as mentioned are all going to bear on that. I agree. We suffered a little bit of an interest income in 2018 by selling higher yielding assets, as part of this migration to higher credit quality profile overall. And so, there\u2019s some amount of that excess or extra interest income that is in 2018. It\u2019s a tough comp over 2017 and will be less of a -- we won\u2019t be comping over that in 2019. But, but I think, it has more to do with what happens with the general level of asset credit of loan growth and what happens to deposit pricing.","Tim Sloan","Hey, John. Just to reemphasize a point and that is I think we feel very good about our ability to impact net interest income in terms of what we can control, which is our ability to grow deposits. Our ability to provide good service to grow the number of primary checking account relationships our ability to grow loans, and as John pointed out, the lessening impact of the legacy portfolios or for example the credit decisions and the transformation that we made in our auto business, which John pointed out it\u2019s -- it's what we don\u2019t control, which is where the short end of the curve is going to be and the long end of the curve, and what the slope is going to be that is more of a question mark.","But in terms of our ability to serve our customers, and to provide them credit and grow deposits we feel good about that.","John McDonald","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead. ","Tim Sloan","Hi, Marty.","John Shrewsberry","Good morning, Marty.","Marty Mosby","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to touch base with you because, talking about revenues, but yet really the two catalysts for the improvement in profitability as you outlined last summer were really the ability to deploy capital and the ability to bring your expenses back in line with what you would think your long term kind of normalized level would be. You\u2019re making progress on the expenses and you\u2019re continuing to kind of push towards the goal that you had. Capital side in that last slide that you have you have here, you\u2019re talking about your Tier 1 common ratio. And while I was wanting to make sure is that as we\u2019re looking at that and we\u2019re thinking of eventually getting to CECL incorporation.","Going from 11.7 down to 10, are you already kind of mentally at least got an estimate that says okay, we have to reallocate a certain amount from this accounting principle, or how would you think about that between the 170 [ph] points between those two numbers?","John Shrewsberry","Yes actually, there\u2019s been a couple of opportunities over the last year as CECL\u2019s been coming into clearer focus as well as the what the stress capital buffer will mean when it\u2019s fully implemented. And it\u2019s caused us to say that the 10% which is our -- which is our current stated target probably has a bias slightly to the upside when those two things are fully understood especially in the stressed context.","You know sort of CECL and business as usual and then there\u2019s the impact of CECL and stress testing which is not fully understood yet. But it\u2019s our \u2013 it\u2019s our guess that before we get to 10% there\u2019s a likelihood that we readjust that target to be slightly higher than 10%. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s 10.25, or 10.375 [ph] or whatever the right number is. But, we\u2019ll know more as stress capital buffer is really finally understood. And as CECL on its own, and CECL in stress are fully understood.","At the moment in business as usual, the impact of CECL would not require any massive reallocation of our capital, it may cause us to think a little bit differently about loan structures or loan pricing for certain types of particularly longer dated things, and maybe even more particularly on the consumer side. But, but from a capital allocation process, outside of its impact and stress, which is not yet fully understood, it\u2019s hard to be more specific than that.","Marty Mosby","And then with the -- pullback in stock prices that we\u2019ve had, you were able to bring down your share count by 3% linked quarter, which is a 12% annualized type of number. So looking at the ability to actually bring down share account given kind of where we\u2019re trading now puts you up in that double digit ability to kind of bring down your share. So at least for the foreseeable future while you have excess capital above either of those types of targets, is that kind of the right pace, that you would think you\u2019d see in the share count reduction?","John Shrewsberry","I\u2019d be cautious about that. We mentioned when we had our capital plan not objected to that we were intentionally front end loading our share buybacks or more of it would happen in the first two quarters, which were Q3 and Q4 of 2018, and less of it would happen in the second two quarters, which is Q1 and Q2 of 2019 just to get the share count down, now that now because of what\u2019s happened to the market, to banks etcetera, our shares are even more attractive today.","But there isn\u2019t the capacity under our capital plan in Q1 and Q2 to take the countdown or to deploy the amount of capital that we were deploying in Q3 and Q4. That will be -- as I mentioned in my remarks we\u2019re now in the process of thinking about what our 2019 capital plan will be. And to the extent that that RWA growth rates are relatively constrained, we\u2019re predicting ample levels of organic capital generation etcetera, it\u2019s likely but it\u2019s not unlikely that our capital plan for next year looks something like what it did last year.","And so if we roll the tape forward, you might anticipate something like that. All other things being equal subject and not objection etcetera to get ahead of myself.","Marty Mosby","Oh well thanks. a lot. [indiscernible] worked out well with the way that the stock prices went then?","Tim Sloan","Well you can. I mean, when you\u2019re buying back that number of shares you can never really buy the bottom tech right. You have to be methodically maybe in the market every day. And, and so it\u2019s a \u2013 it\u2019s a math exercise to get it done.","Marty Mosby","Yes it is. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead.","John Pancari","Good morning. On the loan growth side I just want to see regarding the fourth quarter trends, wanted to get a little bit more color on how you\u2019re thinking about how much of that fourth quarter strength in growth is possibly transient given the moves in the bond markets and everything versus what\u2019s sticky, and what here can really gain? Can we really see gaining a momentum of from here on out or is there likely to be some moderation off of what is viewed as a very strong quarter in terms of production? Thanks.","Tim Sloan","Well I\u2019ll start and then John can jump in. I think to the extent that we had an impact from the capital markets shutting down in December. It happened obviously in the C&I book, and there was some portion of that. I think it\u2019s hard to say that it was exactly a billion dollars or exactly two billion dollars. But -- but there\u2019s no question there a portion of that was related to the market that the other another portion of it candidly was related to the fact that we saw some high quality deal activity that we were involved in.","Now I recall the first quarter tends to be a little bit seasonally lower for the entire industry. That may not happen this year. We don\u2019t know, but I think that\u2019s important to recognize. On the consumer side, obviously there was no impact, so that the consumer growth that we saw really across the board when you think about it with the exception of the slight pullback we had in an auto because of the sale of reliable, was actually pretty good.","So I think we continue to be optimistic about our ability to grow loans in throughout all of next year. But, if it was a few billion dollars, I think that\u2019s probably a reasonable estimate. John, I don\u2019t know if you have any more detail on that.","John Shrewsberry","So I do some of it was investment grade companies choosing not to pay up in the bond market and turning to the banks and using facilities, those I would assume would abate over a period of time, as high grade markets open up and people have easy and inexpensive access. Some of it\u2019s seasonal. We\u2019ve on the commercial side, we had deal or types of financing where people were building inventory and that will be a seasonal effect on the consumer side. Card tends to have a seasonal run up in the fourth quarter as people borrow for holiday related activities, so that might that might just naturally seasonally roll down.","But we\u2019re just moving forward into the first quarter. We\u2019re seeing more interesting M&A activity happening among our clients, than we saw in the fourth quarter. Some of that\u2019s going to lead to interesting on balance sheet financing opportunities for us. And so I wouldn\u2019t consider that to be as transitory as you might imagine.","John Pancari","Got it. Okay. Thanks. And then secondly on the -- on the credit side, a lot of concerns here around late cycle conditions in everything, and I just want to see if you can give a little bit of color on what you\u2019re seeing. Are you seeing any evidence anecdotally of late cycle behavior in your borrowers?","And then related to that, I know you can\u2019t comment on specific borrowers, but can you comment in general on utility exposure just given the PG&E bankruptcy? Thanks.","Tim Sloan","So in terms of the first part of your question, no, we\u2019re looking for signs of really being in the late cycle. I think we\u2019ve been all assuming and we\u2019ve -- I think we\u2019ve had this conversation now for the last four years that we\u2019ve been right in the cycle. And that hasn\u2019t changed. But we\u2019re really not seeing any significant evidence of significant increase in delinquencies, an increase in criticized classified. You saw non-performing numbers continue to go down, you know our commercial and residential real estate continues to be in a net recovery position.","John Shrewsberry","More commercial real estate activity is getting done away because of [indiscernible].","Tim Sloan","Exactly right. But having said that, I think one of the hallmarks of the risk management of this company is that we are very disciplined in terms of how we make credit risk decisions, period. We\u2019re not going to do anything that\u2019s going to put this company at risk regardless of where we think we are in the cycle. It means that we sometimes, we miss some of the highs, but we\u2019re absolutely there for the lows, for our customers just like in the quarter when the capital markets seized up, we were there providing credit to all of our customers that needed it. I don\u2019t have the total exposure to the utility industry that we have, clearly there\u2019s an idiosyncratic event that\u2019s going on with one of our customers PG&E, because of the horrific fires that occurred in Northern California in the last year. But that, that exposure is absolutely manageable for the company. I mean, don\u2019t forget we\u2019ve got a $950 billion loan portfolio and anyone credit is not going to drive the results of the company.","John Pancari","Right. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Tim Sloan","Hey, Matt.","John Shrewsberry","Hey Matt.","Matthew O\u2019Connor","Good morning. I was hoping to follow up on expenses. I appreciate there\u2019s a lot of moving pieces this quarter, but it seems like when we strip out some of the noise, the costs were coming in a little bit higher than we would have thought. And it\u2019s probably best illustrated on slide 17 here. When we look year-over-year and there really isn\u2019t progress being made when you exclude the unusually high operating losses.","And then the deferred compensation expense is kind of just an accounting thing as you mentioned its offset by lower revenues. So I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m thinking about that right. But, it doesn\u2019t, it seems like costs on a core basis maybe a little bit higher this quarter even though revenues a little bit weaker. So one, want to see if you\u2019d agree or if there\u2019s any other things and costs that maybe we\u2019re missing.","And then, the follow up would just be as we think about the trajectory in 2019, are the causes to be back ended or relatively even throughout the year.","John Shrewsberry","So there\u2019s a couple of things at work. One is, the actions taken during 2018 that that have a cost takeout happened throughout the course of the year. So the impact to them is felt partially in 2018 and more completely in 2019.","Incidentally, the same thing is true in 2019 where we\u2019ve got activity happening every month that contributes to the -- to the forecasted number for 2019 and is a stepping off point for the forecasted number in 2020. And there as I mentioned, hundreds of line items that contribute to that. The countervailing activity is the amount that we\u2019re continuing to invest in compliance risk management technology etcetera, some of which is some of which will create a permanent baseline and some of which is temporarily elevated to the extent that it\u2019s very project oriented or supplemented by people from the outside etcetera. All of those are captured in the full year hard dollar targets.","But you can\u2019t you, can\u2019t see the ins and outs of what\u2019s sort of the permanent cost takeout versus what\u2019s the 2018 or 2019 investment that\u2019s being made to build capability where we need it. So, so in our forecast for 2019 you\u2019ll see this, but we see the component pieces of these costs running off being based on actions that were taken previously and the impact of net new capability, new people we mentioned there were 1800 new risk personnel I think Tim mentioned that were added during the course of 2018, but all of those contribute to the, to the target for 2018, the target for 2019 and the target for 2020.","Matthew O\u2019Connor","Okay, and then just on this -- the deferred compensation expense, I think that helped the expense say hearings for 2018. Is that something we should be mindful that could go the other way in 2019, and increase the costs versus the target, or?","John Shrewsberry","You wouldn\u2019t expect a -- I mean we shouldn\u2019t expect a big, another 10% correction downtick in the market, which drove this particular outcome. On the other hand, you probably wouldn\u2019t expect, we wouldn\u2019t expect a full reversal and a commensurate rally on the other side. So I think it\u2019s harder to imagine it gapping upward, it\u2019s easy to imagine it gapping downwards, but it\u2019ll always \u2013 it\u2019s always been an adjustment that we, that we end up talking about, to the extent that it becomes the swing item in the quarter or for the year that we\u2019re pointing to say, but for that we would have hit our target or we won\u2019t, we certainly won\u2019t take credit for what you did, what we all know as a P&L neutral outcome to achieve a goal that is designed to be achieved the hard way, which is by managing expenses.","Matthew O\u2019Connor","Okay, yes, I\u2019m only harping on it because this quarter, if I add that back to your core costs it seems like the cost came in higher. But that\u2019s kind of the avenue is going down. Can I just ask as we think about full year 2019 and drivers of fee revenues, some categories are going to be market dependent, but can you just talk about which categories are optimistic in growing? There\u2019s been some changes as you mentioned on the checking account, and I think it\u2019s the rewind program, but you\u2019re probably lapping that. So maybe just tick off some of the bigger fee categories where you\u2019re hopeful of getting directionally some growth? Thank you.","John Shrewsberry","So as you mentioned and for the reasons you mentioned, I think in service charges, we should be lapping over the periods that where we introduced these customer friendly items. So I would expect that to represent the fact that we\u2019re adding more customers all the time and customers are doing more with us all the time.","Same with card fees. I -- just based on the way this year is beginning, I think there\u2019s an opportunity in investment banking. I think the market linked advisory type of revenue on both in wealth and asset management are going to reflect the S&P environment as you said those are market sensitive. Mortgage personnel, of course now we\u2019re because of the seasonality and this low gain on sale environment representing excess capacity will improve either because we do more volume or will and\/or will improve because capacity comes out of the system, and we can control to some extent the volume that we do we can\u2019t control the market clearing price for it. But we\u2019re always working hard to gain share. Lease on the income, I would expect to grow because we continue to put more assets on the books and to grow that business. So those are some of the bits and pieces is obviously the other fees, loan charges, cash network fees, wire transfers things like that, that should continue to represent us doing more business with customers.","Tim Sloan","Yes, Matt, the big question mark is mortgage. And it\u2019s about capacity, and the size of the market. We\u2019ve seen ups and downs in the mortgage business for the decades that we\u2019ve been a leader in it. We\u2019ll get through this. There\u2019s no question about it. But I just want to re-emphasize John\u2019s point, and that is that we have got to operate that business and I think Michael DeVito and Mary Mack are doing a great job in doing that. We\u2019ve got to operate that business for the environment we\u2019re in.","So given the environment we\u2019re in, as John mentioned in his comments, we\u2019ve got to continue to grow our share with our customer base by providing better service, which their folks are really focused on. And then by reducing costs period, right. And, and we believe, we\u2019re going to make progress in that environment. But again, as it relates to gain on sale margins, that\u2019s really going to be a function of capacity in the market.","Matthew O\u2019Connor","Okay, thank you very much.","Tim Sloan","Welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.","Tim Sloan","Hey, Brian.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Hey good morning. A couple of questions again on the expenses but is there a way to kind of flesh out the numbers with regards to what was showing up in the other I know you called out that there was a pension settlement in there, you also called out that there was lease impairment in there. But can you put some actual numbers around those items?","John Shrewsberry","Yes, the sum of the two of them were probably $250 million, $220 million. That\u2019s helpful.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay. And then also, was there any impact from leverage lending on the -- in this quarter as well and I\u2019m assuming [ph] you\u2019ve given your overall exposure, but can you give your overall exposure to leverage lending in the industry?","John Shrewsberry","Yes. So I think Perry, at the last Investor Day, had a particular slide that to demonstrate where our -- where we stand in terms of leadership positions in the most leverage LBO transactions in particular which just was to make the point that it\u2019s not really a core business of wholesale banking. It\u2019s a little tricky, because our bread and butter middle market customer often gets tagged under leveraged lending guidance as the leverage loan even though it doesn\u2019t exhibit the same either leverage characteristics or structural or governance or other characteristics of a -- of a sponsor owned LBO borrower.","We -- we don\u2019t have huge exposure, but particularly at the end of the year to two most recent LBO financings. We I think it was mentioned, it\u2019s been noteworthy that in the quarter we were on a ranger on -- on one deal that ended up getting hung because it was in the energy sector. We don\u2019t, we don\u2019t have much of a pipeline going into the fourth quarter for that. We don\u2019t consider it to be. It wasn\u2019t a contributor to loan growth in the fourth quarter and it\u2019s not a, it\u2019s not a core activity. So that\u2019s how I would describe it.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Good. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.","John Shrewsberry","Good morning, Gerard","Gerard Cassidy","Good morning, guys. Tim, you were very clear about the underwriting that Wells has done over the years, and your credit quality shows one of the best in the industry. Is there any truth -- or not truth or -- what are your thoughts we always get this end of cycle question that you heard today. And do you think the CCAR process has changed to this length of the cycle where the industry is just stronger now because everybody\u2019s been going through the stress tests every year aside from yourselves, of course?","Tim Sloan","Well I think it would go beyond just CCAR. Gerard, I mean, I think, I think the entire regulatory environment post the great recession has fundamentally changed the quality of assets on the balance sheets of the entire industry. I\u2019d love to tell you it\u2019s idiosyncratic to Wells Fargo, which by the way I still think it is. But in addition to that, I think the balance sheets of the banks today are stronger than they\u2019ve ever been. Not just only as it relates to credit, but certainly as it relates to liquidity. And there\u2019s no question that we take into consideration the new regulatory environment we are in, the rules, the regulations, whether it\u2019s CCAR or not in terms of how we think about operating the company, but in terms of how we fundamentally manage credit it really hasn\u2019t impacted how we fundamentally manage credit, which is in a very disciplined way. But overall, there\u2019s no question it has.","John Shrewsberry","I would -- I would be specific, because the leverage lending guidance has changed the behavior of large banks. And frankly, it\u2019s that\u2019s, that\u2019s good for us. It\u2019s brought the industry closer to where we were already operating in. And on the consumer side, if you give credence to the notion that putting low quality mortgages on the books of banks was approximate cause of their of their demise, or at least their credit woes, we\u2019ve seen plenty of examples of that. Those loans don\u2019t exist any longer.","And that\u2019s why it\u2019s more Dodd-Frank I would say than it is CCAR. But there\u2019s a complex web of incremental regulation has really strengthened the balance sheets of banks asset quality is better, capital levels are better. Liquidity is better, and the system benefits I think from that without a doubt.","Gerard Cassidy","And John, to follow up on what you pointed out on the leverage loan side on the regulatory front, what are you guys looking at for indirect or unintended consequences of these loans being outside the banking system but how they may revert back and impact some of your customers?","John Shrewsberry","Yes. So there\u2019s sort of two, at least two ways. One is, we are a participant in and financing some non banks. This has been a topic of conversation on our calls before, and so thinking about that we did it before. The last crisis, and we\u2019ve done it since, and we\u2019re very cautious about how we how we select customers, how we underwrite the credit that they\u2019re extending and the magnitude of the haircut that we require to protect our own advances.","So we were very familiar with what\u2019s going on. We\u2019re also an investor, a CLO triple investor and we\u2019re before the last crisis and have been today. And we think with the way loans are being originated, the way those deals are structured, and our understanding and stressing of them that that\u2019s good, that\u2019s good risk return for Wells Fargo. With respect to the impact that it has on customers, we don\u2019t have as customers a lot of middle market LBO candidates. We do have sponsors as customers and other asset managers, and as it relates to our core, the core wholesale middle market customer they tend not to be a borrower of those other, those other entities. And so I think that our, as Tim said, our willingness to stand ready to lend directly to people with whom we have a relationship that we understand, when to use other sources of liquidity, go away be something that we\u2019re probably taking advantage of in the event that we hit the end of the cycle. This was certainly true 10 years ago, and it might look similar this time.","Gerard Cassidy","And then just lastly, you mentioned the Pick-a-Pay portfolio, I think is about $4.9 billion. You\u2019ve had success, obviously, in selling that off and reporting gains. Should we expect over 2019 the remainder of that portfolio will be sold? Or is that something you plan to hold onto?","John Shrewsberry","There\u2019s some piece of it is probably unsalable. But if market conditions persist, it\u2019s my -- my sense is that will probably continue to do a little bit more. It\u2019s opportunistic, it\u2019s discretionary, it doesn\u2019t have to happen, but those are loans with loan structures and even borrowers who are a click riskier than the loans that we\u2019re making today in the ordinary course. And when this cycle does end, those are the loans that are probably going to have a higher default rate, and to the extent that we can find the right, the right buyer for those at prices that makes sense that will de-risk us from an operational risk perspective when that time comes, because there will be more will be more defaults.","Gerard Cassidy","Great, as always, appreciate the color. Thank you.","John Shrewsberry","Thanks, Gerard.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","John Shrewsberry","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Usdin","Hey, good morning guys. If I could just ask you quickly just on the commercial lending front again. I heard the points about the markets and the big corporate loans and that\u2019s showing up in everybody\u2019s results so far. But can you guys just take us kind of through some of the commercial segments, and just give us that sense of are you seeing the underlying business expansion move through middle markets, small business, just what\u2019s like the color you\u2019re getting from the field as you kind of look to that underlying outside of these kind of big credits that have been clearly showing up at the industry level?","Tim Sloan","I think the short answer is yes, but it's to your point, it really is a function of which business that you're referring to. So for example the bread and butter middle market and a commercial banking business that we\u2019re a leader in, we saw some nice growth in the quarter which we highlighted the small business loan growth year-over-year, it was in the mid-teens\u2026","Ken Usdin","Origination?","Tim Sloan","Originations, I\u2019m sorry. Good point. Originations. I think -- now to some extent that\u2019s a bit idiosyncratic to us just because we\u2019re seeing an improvement in referrals from the branches based upon all the work that we\u2019ve done with the team there. But again that\u2019s, I think that\u2019s indicative that was pretty strong. Having said that, as John pointed out, we saw some seasonality in our equipment finance business. We saw some seasonality in the businesses where we finance dealers or retailers in the growth in the expectation of what\u2019s going to happen over the holidays and alike. But, but I would say overall, we\u2019re seeing steady growth in the areas that you\u2019re referring to.","Ken Usdin","And in that context of the back to banks a little bit. Can you just also just comment what you\u2019re seeing then on the pricing side? Have there been any changes to the ability to get a little price back in that regard or is it just still tough out there with all the competition and still pretty good liquidity?","Tim Sloan","It\u2019s still competitive out there. I mean there\u2019s no question about that. I think that it\u2019s most competitive when you have a transaction size in which you have not only a large bank competing, you have a medium sized -- bank competing and you have a small bank and then throw in a non-bank just for docs and all of a sudden it can be pretty competitive. I think in particular it\u2019s very competitive where any of us are trying to work to maintain a long term relationship.","So I wouldn\u2019t say that the dislocation that occurred in the fourth quarter while it increased volume a bid for our large corporate customers it didn\u2019t necessarily have a big impact on pricing.","Ken Usdin","Understood. And last quick one, just -- as your trajectories for the turn in auto is that generally still intact as well?","Tim Sloan","Yes generally and specifically.","Ken Usdin","Okay. Very good. Thanks Tim.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Tim Sloan","Hey Kevin.","John Shrewsberry","Good morning.","Kevin Barker","Good morning. Just quick question on the equity gains and losses. I mean obviously we\u2019ve seen quite a bit of dislocation in the high yield market, and the last time that occurred maybe not on the scale that we saw back then, but in 2016 the private equity gains and the equity gains in general were relatively low compared to previous years.","Is your expectation that we may see a lull there if the market volatility continues in high yield market?","John Shrewsberry","Not so much. I mean what we\u2019re seeing from portfolios of NEP and NVP is still that it is a better time to be a seller than an investor notwithstanding. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s that many and certainly not on NVP and not even that many deals on any NEP side where things are getting sold to people who require high yield financing in order to make it work know like another sponsor for example it\u2019s more often that they're selling something to a strategic who\u2019s got their other sources of financing.","So I think that the -- if we continue in this elevated level of asset prices generally with scarcity of interesting assets and then you know not to over promise. But I -- my sense is that we'll still be a realizer of gains throughout the course of 2019.","Kevin Barker","Okay and then just a follow up on some of your mortgage comments. You mentioned that you start to see maybe a little bit better comps or a little bit improvement in the overall mortgage market as capacity adjust. Are you seeing signs that capacity is starting to adjust and then you\u2019re going to continue to see that improved throughout the year?","Tim Sloan","Yes. And so importantly my comments were hopeful not real not being realized. We would expect if capacity comes out of the system because smaller players are less efficient players are not making any money then there would be a I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s a return to what gains used to be that people in the industry that seem to believe that thinks you know snap back to some equilibrium level over and over again but this could be different. We haven\u2019t seen actual capacity come out we\u2019ve heard lots of stories about people who are closer to capitulating, but it hasn't seemed to happen.","And so we\u2019re as we said we\u2019re focusing on the customer experience focusing on taking cost out and trying to figure out how to make an attractive return in the environment that we\u2019re in. And then to the extent that the future unfolds the way I just described and that would be a upsized, but we\u2019re not there yet.","Kevin Barker","Okay, thanks for taking my question.","Tim Sloan","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Tim Sloan","Good morning.","Steven Chubak","Hi, good morning. So I was hoping to dig into some of the fee income trends that we saw in the quarter, and certainly an area where there\u2019s been a lot of investor attention, but if adjust for various special items in the quarter, it looks like we\u2019re starting with a jumping off point of about $8.5 billion or $34 billion annual license fee income. I recognize it was a very tough quarter in terms of some of the market sensitive businesses and you spoke of some of the growth areas within 2019, whether it be mortgage release income, but because you have some of those headwinds in the wealth side as well that you noted you told me you can maybe frame, what\u2019s the right jumping off point for the fee income to start the year? And what you believe is an achievable growth target for the remainder of 2019?","John Shrewsberry","Well that\u2019s an excellent question, but the jump -- the stepping off point is the some of the stories in each of the lines and we really don\u2019t sort of wrap that up and put a single growth rate on it because there\u2019s so many things that are driven by different forces, whether it\u2019s, as you said the S&P in the case of certain fee income lines, what\u2019s going on, in the mortgage market, what are competitive positioning is? What the growth rate of customer growth is? Account growth is? All of those things matter.","For some of the reasons we describe the valuation adjustment to the MSR and then the deferred comp hedging program I guess, I would say that those are unlikely to recur in that way as we roll forward.","And then I would adjust as for what\u2019s happened in the S&P just as a proxy for the line items that are keyed on that not some of those have repriced right through the fourth quarter and some as I mentioned reprice after the fourth quarter and so the impact of what happened in the fourth quarter will be felt until the first quarter there.","And then its reasonable people will take different approaches to the trending of other things that just represents sort of the ongoing everyday accumulation of millions and millions of transactions etcetera or interactions with customers. And I think we\u2019ll arrive at a slightly different starting off point. Definitely committed to working on each individual line and the drivers of it to be as growth oriented and frankly even expense oriented as we can and contributing to it, but there is no elegant way to just put a number.","Steven Chubak","Right. Fair enough. I appreciate all the color, John and maybe just one follow up for me on through the cycle loss guidance and expectations have to credit you guys for being one of the few banks to actually give any sort of guidance on through the cycle loss rate expectations and mainly, you\u2019ve also cleansed the balance sheet, you\u2019ve also significantly derisk selling down some Pick-a-Pay loans and other higher risk loans. I was hoping you can maybe update us on whether that 60 to 70 basis points are still the appropriate through the cycle level you\u2019re thinking about. And a question I\u2019ve had quite often is what are some of the underlying assumptions across the different loan buckets as you think about framing that 60 to 70?","John Shrewsberry","Yes. So it\u2019s -- it is the number that we have out there from our last Investor Day and we\u2019d probably update it again at our next Investor Day. So in the meantime, I think that\u2019s good guidance.","As we\u2019ve described in a couple of areas, at the margin that many of the things that we\u2019ve done in the last year have increased the average credit quality not that averages account for everything but have increased credit quality on the balance sheet, both in commercial and in consumer. We\u2019ve been operating in this 25 to 30 basis point range now for a while in terms of losses some of that is influenced by the fact that we have line items that have been in net recovery and so they don\u2019t really reflect what's going on with the loans \u2013 today\u2019s loans that are getting charged off.","So if you zeroed out net recovery, you probably end up a few basis points higher than the recent run rate. So I would stick with the guidance that we gave. Unfortunately also, we never actually through the cycle, right. We\u2019re either better than the average or we\u2019re worse than the average and we\u2019re either building maybe especially under seasonal building, building, building. And so our results will reflect that even if the charge offs are measured a little bit differently.","But I do think the next time that we update that guidance based on what that mix is in our portfolio and what the risk rating is in each of the categories, my sense is we\u2019re its safer overall portfolio than it was the last time we measured it and it\u2019s not unlikely that we\u2019d reflect that in the average, which we haven\u2019t updated it since last Investor Day.","Tim Sloan","Well, a big driver of those results is it going to be \u2013 what\u2019s the cause of the downturn, right. And how deep a downturn we might experience. So some of it\u2019s a little bit beyond our control, but I sure would agree with John when you look at the quality of our loan portfolio today versus where we are five years ago and 10 years ago, it's markedly better.","Steven Chubak","Thank you very much. It\u2019s a very helpful color.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line up of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","John Shrewsberry","Hi, Vivek.","Tim Sloan","Hi, Vivek.","Vivek Juneja","Hi, John. Hi, Tim. Couple of questions. One is, John you referred to the level of over collateralization or haircuts a couple of times, can you -- on those loans to non-bank financial or whatever in that category of loans that you talked about that you\u2019ve given detail previously. Can you give us some sense of what is that -- what is that percentage, is that 15%, is that 20% haircut, well, what kind on average?","John Shrewsberry","It\u2019s a good question. So there\u2019s a variety of different underlying loans in those books of business, there\u2019s consumer, there\u2019s commercial, there\u2019s secured, there\u2019s unsecured, and each of them are structured to reflect what we think the lost content is of the underlying portfolio. So I want to \u2013 I\u2019m estimating though, I haven\u2019t looked that at all, but on average it would be call it 30% to 40% in terms of a haircut, and on average the credit quality of that portfolio would correspond to a to a single A or single A minus, our exposure.","So it\u2019s -- the loans there on their probability of default and loss given default terms are substantially higher credit quality than the average loan on our books overall. They do tend to be a little bit bigger and does a little bit more concentrated there, they\u2019re actively managed because there are loans going in and loans coming out etcetera, but as a result we\u2019ve taken these extra precautions. And that\u2019s how they would pencil out from an agency equivalency point of view.","Tim Sloan","And Vivek, the other point I would make on that portfolio are a couple of other points. One, the under -- that their the exposure that we have is in industries that we\u2019re comfortable with. So we\u2019ve got experience, that\u2019s number one.","Number two to emphasize John\u2019s point, we\u2019ve got approval rights going in to the facilities and then kick out rights in many of the facilities on the way out if there\u2019s an underlying loan that we\u2019re concerned about. So, we look very comfortable with the underlying risk in that portfolio.","Vivek Juneja","Okay. Good. Thanks. A different question completely. The ROTCE target of 17% you\u2019ll have given any color on that, can you give us an update especially given where revenues have gone, given level of rates and yield curve and etcetera, etcetera. How are you thinking about that?","John Shrewsberry","Well, we\u2019re still working toward 15 and 17, I\u2019m more of an ROE guy than a ROTCE guy, but they work together. The combination of the range of revenue expectations that we have the specific expense guidance that we\u2019ve given, and the capital plan, last year\u2019s capital plan that we\u2019ve enacted and our expectation for the next capital plan etcetera, and where we where we might be, we\u2019ve had to put an estimate in that process for where we\u2019d be in credit at the time because I think we estimated it would be somewhat more normal than the better than normal environment we\u2019ve been in for the last couple of years, all work together to drive to that outcome and we\u2019re continuing to drive to that outcome.","Vivek Juneja","And just remind me that 15 and 17 when you originally put it out, you\u2019re assuming flattish revenues, was that -- am I right?","Tim Sloan","Yes. It worked with less than flat revenue but the point that we made in that presentation was don\u2019t assume any revenue growth, we don\u2019t require you to assume any revenue growth because we would have just turned to focusing on that. So it works with revenue at a lower level than 2017 revenue which was the -- what was on the slide for the basis of that discussion.","Vivek Juneja","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Tim Sloan","Thank you.","Operator","I will now turn the conference back over to management for any further remarks.","Tim Sloan","Great. Hey, I want to thank all of you for spending time with us today. And I also want to thank our team members as I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, there\u2019s been a tremendous amount of hard work and effort to achieve not only the financial results, but from a long term standpoint the fundamental transformation that\u2019s going on at the company. So I want to thank them and also want to thank you for your time and your interest in the company. Have a great rest of the day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect."],"21902":["Wells Fargo & Co.

My name is Regina and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference.","John Campbell ","Thank you, Regina. Good morning. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO and President, Tim Sloan; and our CFO, John Shrewsberry, will discuss third quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our third quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I would also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today\u2019s call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our website.","I will now turn our call over to CEO and President, Tim Sloan.","Tim Sloan","Thank you, John. Good morning. I want to thank you all for joining us today. Over the past year, we have made fundamental changes at Wells Fargo in order to build a better and stronger bank. And John and I'll be highlighting our progress throughout the call. But first I want to discuss our financial performance. ","In the third quarter, we earned $0.84 a share; including the impact of a $1 billion discrete litigation accrual for previously disclosed mortgage related regulatory investigations. This is not tax deductible and reduced our EPS by $0.20. This accrual was for a pre financial crisis mortgage related regulatory matter. While this accrual impacted our financial performance in the quarter, the commitment of our team members to put our customers first and help them to succeed financially remains strong and was demonstrated by average deposits growing 4% from a year ago, client assets reaching record levels in wealth and investment management, debit card purchase volume increasing 5% from a year ago, balances in our consumer and general purpose credit card portfolio also growing 5%. And illustrating the benefit of the GE Capital acquisitions and strong collaboration across our wholesale businesses, we led more syndicated asset base loans in any other firm in the third quarter. ","As part of our priority of rebuilding trust, we provided expanded disclosure in our second quarter 10-Q filing, detailing our efforts to identify and address other areas and instances where customers may have experienced financial harm. Let me update you on a few recent actions and milestones. At the end of August, we announced the completion of an expanded third party review of retail banking accounts covering 165 million accounts over a nearly eight year period. As we committed to a year ago we reviewed more accounts over a longer period of time and identified additional customers who may have been impacted. All customers identified as having potentially unauthorized accounts are being notified directly as to how they can participate in a $142 million class action settlement and we are refunding customers for any of these accounts that experienced fees and charges. Last week we completed another around of broad customer outreach via email in 43 million statement notifications to encourage anyone with questions about their accounts regardless of when they were opened to let us know so we could address their questions. ","We also announced in August a plan to remediate auto loan customers who may have been financially harmed due to issues related to collateral protection insurance policies which we purchased on their behalf when customers' insurance policies lapsed. We discontinued our CPI program last year and we began issuing checks to affected auto loan customers this month. Last week, we announced plans to reach out to all home lending customers who paid fees for mortgage rate lock extensions requested from September 16th of 2013 through February 28th of 2017 and to refund customers who believe they shouldn't have paid those fees. ","In March of this year, we changed how we managed the mortgage rate lock extension process by establishing a centralized review team that reviews all rate lock extension request for a consistent application of our policies. We are working diligently to make things right for our customers. We will continue to be transparent and we will be reporting more progress in months ahead. ","We are working hard to transform Wells Fargo into a better bank for our customers, our team members, shareholders and our communities. I'm proud of the progress our team members have made to strengthen our culture, improve our business practices and risk management. We made fundamental changes to our business model, organizational structure and compensation and performance management programs. One reason I am confident that we are on the right path is it in the third quarter total team member attrition at Wells Fargo reached its lowest level in over six years. Within Community Banking, attrition is also at its lowest level in over six years and it has improved every quarter over the past year. Our customers are also responding positively to the changes we've made. While branch customer loyalty and satisfaction with most recent visit scores decline slightly in September after our announcement of the completion of the expanded third party account review, both metrics had reached individual post sales practices settlements high earlier in the quarter. And we saw improvement in loyalty scores near the end of the September.","We also continue to invest in innovation to better serve our customers. Let me highlight a few examples. Since launching the Zelle person-to-person experience in June, we've seen significant growth in both the number of transactions and the dollar sent. In the third quarter, P-to-P payment sent by our customers increased 46% from a year ago. We've recently launched a pilot of our online mortgage application. It combines the power of Wells Fargo data with the digital interface to create a know-me customer experience. We expect a complete rollout in the first quarter of next year.","Later this month, we'll rollout Intuitive Investor, a new digital advisory offering providing low cost allocation, portfolio selection and rebalancing. We launched CEO Mobile Token which allows our treasury management customers a secured, convenient way to provide secondary authentication anytime they need to complete a transaction. Since the first quarter when we became the first large bank in the US to offer card free access to all of our ATMs through a one time access code, our customers have used card free ATM access codes 3 million times. And just this last we week announced than more than 40% of our ATMs are now NFC- enabled which allows our debit card customers to use their mobile wallet at the ATM providing another option for card free access. ","Citing our card free ATMs along with a number of new capabilities, Wells Fargo was also recognized as the industry leader in Business Insider's mobile banking study that was released this week. ","Before turning the call over to John, I want to acknowledge the devastation many of our communities have faced from the recent hurricanes. To help our impacted customers in those areas recover we are providing payment relief and proactively waiving fees. Our mobile response unit was deployed to impacted areas in Texas a month ago and we are deploying three additional units to Florida so customers can receive in person assistance from Wells Fargo disaster recovery specialist. The Wells Fargo Foundation donated $2.6 million for hurricane relief efforts in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico, and our customers have generously donated over $2.6 million to the American Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund through our ATMs nationwide. We are also working with our customers impacted by the wildfires in California and the Wells Fargo Foundation made a donation to help these communities this week. ","John Shrewsberry will now discuss our financial results in more detail. ","John Shrewsberry","Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. We earned $4.6 billion in the third quarter, down $1.2 billion from the second quarter. This decline was driven by higher operating losses from the $1 billion discrete litigation accrual that Tim described. Linked-quarter trends were also impacted by the $100 million reserve release we had in the second quarter. This quarter we did not have a release as improvements and credit performance in certain portfolios were offset by a $450 million of reserve coverage for potential hurricane related losses based on initial review of our portfolio. As a reminder, our result in the second quarter also reflected a $309 million gain on the sale of Pick-a-Pay PCI loan portfolio. ","On Page 3, we highlighted our results compared with a year ago. While net interest income increased $524 million, revenue declined $402 million reflecting lower non-interest income, driven by lower mortgage results. Average loans declined 1% from a year ago as grown in our commercial loans was more than offset by lower consumer loans, while average deposits increased 4% from a year ago. And we've maintained exceptionally strong capital levels even as we've returned more capital to shareholders including $96 million reduction in common shares outstanding through net share repurchases. ","Turning to Page 4, I'll be highlighting trends in loans deposits and credit later on the call, so let me just call out a few items from this slide. Cash and short-term investments increased to $7.4 billion, reflecting lower loan balances and growth in deposits. With our strong liquidity levels we could deploy tens of billions of dollars and remain LCR compliant. ","Investment securities increased $5 billion in the quarter, we had approximately $31.2 billion of gross investment purchases in the quarter, primary agency MBS in the available for sale portfolio which were largely offset by run-off in sales.","Turning to the income statement overview on Page 5, I'll describe revenue and expense trends later on the call. So let me just highlight that our effective income tax rate in the third quarter was 32.4%. This included net discrete tax expense of $186 million primarily resulting from the non deductible treatment of the $1 billion discrete litigation accrual, partially offset by discrete tax benefits arising from favorable resolutions of prior period matter of certain state tax authorities. ","As shown on Page 6, the benefit from higher rates increased average loan yields 5 basis points in the quarter, the seventh consecutive quarter of increasing loan yields. Average loan yields were down $5.2 billion from a year ago with growth in commercial loans offset by declines in consumer loans and down $4.6 billion from the second quarter with declines in both commercial and consumer loans. H.8 data continue to indicate that there was softness across the industry, particularly in certain categories like C&I, but they're also specific actions that we've taken, primarily driven by our own risk discipline, which have impacted our growth.","Let me explain the primary factors in more detail. Starting with commercial loans on Page 7, lien utilization rate remain stable at approximately 40% in the third quarter and balance is increased $3.7 billion from a year ago, but declined $5.7 billion from the second quarter. We've previously highlighted expected run-off within our consumer portfolio but we've also had expected run-off in certain portfolios of commercial loan. We provided $6.5 billion of financing relating to our government guarantee student loan sale in the fourth quarter of 2014 which is then securitized in several tranches over the past couple of years with $1.3 billion remaining at the end of the third quarter down approximately $800 million from the second quarter. ","We fully anticipated the run down of a couple of loan portfolios we acquired from GE Capital and pay downs have totaled $7.9 billion over the past 18 months including $1.7 billion in the third quarter with approximately half of the reduction in the quarter in C&I and half in commercial real estate. On this slide we provide details on the individual loan portfolios that drove commercial loan trends this quarter. ","We summarize our consumer loan portfolios on Page 8. This portfolio declined $13.1 billion from a year-ago, primarily due to $7.4 billion of lower auto loans and $7 billion of lower junior lien mortgage loans. However, consumer loans increased $200 million from the second quarter with growth in first mortgage loans and credit card.","Our first mortgage loans increased $3.6 billion from the second quarter, reflecting $7.5 billion of growth in non-conforming mortgage loans, partially offset by the continued run-off of higher yielding legacy portfolios.","Our junior lien mortgage loan portfolio continued to decline as expected as pay-downs more than offset new originations. In terms of credit card portfolio, over the past three years our annual growth rate was the largest among the large banks. Clearly the sales practice announcement last year had an impact but we started gain a bit of momentum. Our credit portfolio increased $944 million linked quarter driven by higher spend per active account. We've invested in our rewards program and had continued our migration to digital acquisition while staying within our risk appetite. In fact, 42% of card openings in the third quarter were through digital channels, up from 17% in the full year of 2016. Our auto portfolio continued to decline as expected and was down $2.5 billion from the second quarter as a result of tightening underwriting standards. We expect auto loans to continue to decline.","Other revolving credit and installment loans declined $252 million from the second quarter driven by declines in personal loans and lines which we expect to continue to decline due to lower branch referrals over the past year. ","As highlighted on Page 9, average deposits were $1.3 trillion, up $44.9 billion or 4% from a year-ago and up $5.2 billion from the second quarter. Based on the latest FDIC data, we retained our number one ranking in retail deposits. Our deposit cost was 26 basis points in the third quarter, up 5 basis points from the second quarter and up 15 basis points from a year ago. We've not made material changes in rates paid on consumer and small business banking deposits within our retail bank with the majority of our peers also holding these rates steady. We have implemented some incremental deposits repricing for commercial and wealth and investment management customers as market rates have increased. ","Net interest income increased $524 million, or 4% from a year-ago primarily driven by growth in earnings assets and higher interest rates. However, net interest income declined $7 million from the second quarter as the impacts of lower investment portfolio yields driven by accelerated prepayments and lower average loan balances were largely offset by the impact of one additional day in the quarter and a modest benefit from all other growth and repricing. ","The net interest margin declined 3 basis points to 2.87% as the impact of lower investment portfolio yields driven by accelerated prepayments, lower average loan balances, growth in average deposits and growth in trading assets and related funding were partially offset by lower average long-term debt and a modest benefit from all other growth and repricing.","For the first nine months of the year, we've growth net interest income by 5% which is consistent with our previously stated expected of low to mid-single digit growth for the full year 2017. ","Non-interest income declined $926 million from a year-ago, driven by lower mortgage banking revenue and was $236 million from the second quarter. Let me highlight few of the drivers of this decline. Card purchase volume increased but card fees declined $19 million from the second quarter due to higher reward expense. We offered competitive rewards and our expense is increased due to high purchase volume, more spending on our highest reward card and higher acquisition bonuses. ","Mortgage banking non-interest income declined $102 million from the second quarter. Servicing income declined $91 million from the second quarter primarily due to higher on reimburse direct servicing cost driven by an increased and estimated cost for aged FHA foreclosures while origination volume increased, residential mortgage origination revenue decline due to a lower repurchase reserve release. Residential mortgage origination volume was $59 billion in the third quarter, up 5% from the second quarter and higher refinancing volume. The production margin on residential held for sale mortgage origination was 124 basis points in the third quarter consistent with the second quarter. Compared with the second quarter there was a favorable impact of $72 million from net hedge ineffectiveness accounting. The FASB has issued new hedge accounting guideline that we will adopt in the fourth quarter which will significantly reduce the interest rate related to foreign currency related ineffectiveness associated with our long-term debt hedges due to the way we structured our hedging instruments, we may continue to experience some ineffectiveness volatility primarily related to require differences in the discount rates for our foreign currency denominated long-term debt and associated cross - currency interest rate swaps. ","On Page 12, we provide details on trading related revenue and the impact to net interest income and non-interest income. Despite decline in customer trading activity, revenue driven by lower volatility and seasonally lower trading volumes, trading related revenue increased $52 million from the second quarter. Trading related revenue was down $29 million from a year ago, reflecting lower volatility and lower transaction volume. ","As shown on Page 13, expenses increased $810 million from the second quarter, driven by $1 billion litigation accrual. The discrete litigation accrual increased our efficiency ratio by 456 basis points in the third quarter. Last quarter we said that we expected our efficiency ratio to improve in the second half of the year and that our full year efficiency ratio was expected to be 60% to 61% in 2017 not including any potential non-recurring expenses including not get accrued litigation expense. We currently expect our full year 2017 efficiency ratio to be plus or minus 61% excluding the $1 billion discrete litigation accrual and any other non-recurring expenses including not yet accrued litigation expense. The reason why our 2017 efficiency ratio is now expected to be higher than we anticipated last quarter is due to lower than expected earning asset growth and higher than expected expenses, primarily for cyber regulatory initiatives and data modernization. These expenses are part of a building a better bank. However, we are fully committed to improving our efficiency ratio and achieving our target of total of $4 billion of expense reductions.","As you can see on Page 14, we had linked quarter declines across many of our expense categories except for revenue related expenses and running the business non discretionary expenses which is a category impacted by the $1 billion litigation accrual. The increase in revenue related expenses was primarily due to higher commissions and other incentive compensation driven by wholesale banking and brokerage. The $24 million decline in compensation expense was driven by seasonally lower payroll tax expense. Third party service expense declined $82 million from the second quarter driven by lower project related, legal and outside data processing expense. Running the business discretionary expense was down $34 million from second quarter primarily from lower TNE and advertising expense. ","On Page 15, we showed the drivers of the year-over-year increase and expenses. Compensation and benefit expense increased $338 million driven by higher salaries from annual salary increases and higher health benefit expenses. Also these expenses in the third quarter of 2016 were reduced by the forfeiture of unvested equity award. Revenue related expense declined $131 million from lower commission and incentive compensation driven by lower mortgage and wholesale banking activity. ","Third party service expense increased to $184 million, driven by higher project spending and legal expense, approximately $80 million of this expense was sales practices related in the third quarter. The $665 million increase in running the business in non-discretionary expense was driven by higher operating losses reflecting the $1 billion litigation accrual.","We've previously described the main drivers of the first $2 billion of targeted expense saves by the end of 2018 and we've now identified initiatives and programs for the total $4 billion of expense target. On Page 16, we summarize these initiatives and the expense categories that will be impacted and we are committed to achieving these reductions. This leverage have evolved slightly from Investor Day but are still focused on areas like centralization and optimization and evaluating capacity to achieve savings in areas such as corporate properties and workforce optimization. As you can see on this page, some of these initiatives will generate savings throughout the periods while others unexpected to be realized until later. ","We are making progress and work that needs to be done on these initiatives but many of the changes that drive savings are longer term efforts and are in the early stages of being realized. For example, while we are seeing benefits from centralizing our functional areas, the saving for corporate property including savings from 200 branches we plan to close in 2017. We are on track as we closed 145 branches during the first nine months of this year. However, there are minimal immediate savings recognized from branch closure due to initial closing cost. Therefore, most of the expense benefit from the branches we close this year will not be realized until next year. It's also important to note that these initiatives do not include the benefit of the expected run-off of core deposit intangibles by 2019 which resulted in $640 million of expenses in the first nine months of the year. It also doesn't include the expected completion of the FDIC special assessment in 2018. And finally it doesn't include the expense savings due to the sale of businesses we've announced including commercial insurance and shareowner services businesses which are expected to close in the fourth quarter and first quarter respectively. ","On Slide 17, we provide details on the expected timing of our target expense reductions. We expect to achieve 21% of the $4 billion of the annual expense saves by the end of this year and 50% by the end of next year. The rest of the expense saves are expected to be achieved by the end of 2019. As a reminder, the first $2 billion of targeted expense saves will support our investment in the business and we expect that the additional $2 billion target in annual expense reduction by the end of 2019 to go to the bottom line and to be fully recognized in 2020.","Turning to our business segments starting on Page 18, Community Banking earned $2.2 billion in the third quarter, the impact from $1 billion litigation accrual which is reported in this segment was the primary driver of the year-over-year and linked quarter decline. ","On Page 19, we highlight customers continue to actively use their accounts; branch and ATM interactions declined 6% from a year ago. This decline was driven in part by customers migrating to a digital channel with the digital secured session up 6% from a year ago. As teller interactions migrate to self service options, teller FTEs have been reduced 4% from a year ago while we continue to invest in more specialty bankers which are up 5% as part of our goal of providing better customer service and advice. ","Primary consumer checking customers declined modestly from the second quarter in a year ago, while our attrition rates have remained stable, the decline in new account openings has impacted primary consumer checking customer growth. However, as we've highlighted in Investor Day, our new customers continue to have higher balances and into use their debit cards more frequently. ","On Page 20, we highlight balance and activity growth. Average consumer and small business banking deposits grew by 2% from a year-ago. Debit card purchase volume increased 5% and consumer and general purpose credit card purchase volume increased 4% from a year-ago. Customer experience survey scores predictably declined after we announced the completion of the expanded third party review of retail banking accounts at the end of August. However, as Tim mentioned earlier, we continue to improve these scores prior to this announcement. While this past year has been challenging, the numbers we've made are creating more consistency -- the changes we've made are creating more consistency and simplicity for our branch team members which will result in a better experience for our customers. We know that improving the experience for customers and team members is critical to growing our business. It's more than being nice it's offering the right products and services to meet the financial needs of our customers; it's also about making changes with real customer impact for example empowering managers in the branches to immediately resolve some customer issues such as fees and service request rather than having to redirect customers to a call center. I am confident that the changes we are implementing will improve customer service and also drive growth. ","Wholesale Banking earned $2 billion in the third quarter, stable from a year-ago and down 14% from the second quarter. Results from the second quarter included the tax benefit resulting from our agreement to sell Wells Fargo Insurance Services which is expected to close in the fourth quarter and resulted to gain in fourth quarter. ","Wealth and Investment Management earned a record $710 million in the third quarter, up 5% from a year-ago and up 4% from the second quarter. Revenue increased 4% from a year-ago driven by 19% increase in net interest income. WIM total client assets were a record $1.9 trillion, up 8% from a year ago, driven by higher market evaluations and continued positive net flows.","Turning to credit quality on Page 23, the quarterly loss rate was 30 basis points, up 3 basis points from the second quarter but still near historically low levels. Commercial losses increased 3 basis points with higher losses in C&I, consumer losses increased 2 basis points as continued net recoveries in consumer real estate and lower credit card and other revolving credit were offset by higher auto losses.","Nonperforming assets continue to decline down $512 million from the second quarter, the sixth consecutive quarter of decreases and NPAs were now less than 1% of total loans. We did not have a reserve build or release this quarter as continued improvement in consumer real estate and commercial loan portfolios including continued improvement in the oil and gas portfolio was offset by a $450 million of reserve coverage for potential hurricane related losses based on an initial review of our portfolio. Our preliminary estimates includes coverage for potential losses in our reliable auto business which is based in Puerto Rico was been specially challenging to determine the full impact from Hurricane Maria. ","Turning to Page 24, our estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio fully phased-in increased to 11.8% in the third quarter, remaining well above our internal target level of 10%. The growth in our CET 1 ratio reflected lower RWA driven by lower loan balances and commitments, as well as improved RWA efficiency. We remained focused on returning more capital to shareholders. Third quarter was the first quarter under our 2017 Capital Plan and we increased our net share repurchases by 34% from the second quarter. We've returned the total of $4 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases which was up 16% from the second quarter. ","Before I conclude, I want to update you on our resolution planning efforts. We made a decision to move from a multiple point of entry resolution strategy to a single point of entry preferred resolution strategy for our next resolution plan submission. We've concluded the developing SPOE strategy will enhance the flexibility of strategic options available to resolve the firm. This decision does not related to any agency feedback we've received in our 2017 submission and is not expected to result in any additional fee lock issuance or liquidity requirements. ","In summary, while our financial results in the third quarter were impacted by the $1 billion discrete litigation accrual, our asset quality, liquidity and capital levels all remain very strong. We highlighted throughout the call the transformational changes we are making and I am optimistic that these changes will help drive our long-term success. And I think we will now take your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Our first question will come from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead. ","John McDonald","Hi, good morning. John, I want to try again to ask about the idea of the timing differences between initial $2 billion of expense saves to be realized by the end of next year. And when the spending that is offsetting that is occurring, if you could kind of comment on that. And then if you have an initial thought on type of efficiency ratio that you guys might strive for next year. I am sure folks will love to hear any thoughts on that. ","John Shrewsberry","Sure. So we provided this slide on the deck this time that shows what portion of that first $2 billion should be out of the run rate by the end of this year and what portion should be out of the run rate by the end of next year which is incremental information. The part that's hard to convey is what is already being spent as reinvestment of that for a variety of programs. We've talked about a lot of these but we've had and will continue to have elevated spending around various regulatory and technology related activities. Now just tick few off for you including resolution planning this year which doesn't completely go away. This BSA and AML activity going on, lot of cyber work going on. I mentioned data modernization earlier in our remarks which is a big undertaking is technology re-platforming and this of course your sales practices issues that are lingering. So some of those are in the run rate today. And many of those will continue to be in the run rate throughout 2018 and maybe some of it even into 2019. There are bits and pieces of getting more efficient on those programs that are part of that $2 billion save that we are working on. So it's not dollar for dollar if as these things roll off and that first $2 billion gets realized those benefit, but with respect to efficiency ratio we think that will be sort in the -- as I mentioned plus or minus 61% from the fourth quarter and it is definitely our goal to be at 59% or below at some point next year. Now there is two parts to that. One is expenses which we are talking about but it is also what happens with revenue. So rate increases, if there are any loan growth which is very important will contribute to that too. So it is both the numerator and denominator that we are working on. But I'll say we are shooting for plus or minus 61% in the fourth quarter and we are -- we like to get to 59% or below at some point during 2018.","John McDonald","Okay. And then separately could you talk about some of the factors affecting net interest income and net interest margin for next quarter? With the loan growth headwinds not having a rate hike in September, is it possible to have net interest income growth going forward or what are your thoughts there? ","John Shrewsberry","That's good question. So it depends on a few things including what you mentioned. It also depends on what happens to deposit pricing and what the market response is in retail deposits in particular. I wouldn't anticipate a lot of incremental growth in interest income in the fourth quarter. I think we are at 5% [here today] [ph] on year-over-year basis and we've been imagining and telegraphing low to mid 4% to 5% for the year as a whole. So I think the fourth quarter will probably reflect that especially because as you said nothing moved on short end, the long ends moved a little bit but that only matters at the margin as we reinvest. ","John McDonald","Okay. And one quick last one for me. The business sales that you mentioned in the fourth quarter and the first are helpful to the efficiency ratio. Are those relatively earnings neutral? Is there any loss of earnings as those businesses go away? ","John Shrewsberry","They are relatively earnings -- the run rate which I think is what you are referring to is relatively earnings neutral going forward. ","John McDonald","Okay. Meaning when you sell them there is no net income that goes away, they are pretty P&L neutral. ","John Shrewsberry","Yes. The only complication that adds is indirect expense because we have a work to do take up the associated indirect expense but in general I'd say that that we will not be giving up a lot of net income.","John McDonald","Okay. Meaning you will just take some time to get the expenses out.","John Shrewsberry","Yes.","John McDonald","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Erika Najarian","Yes. Hi, thank you for taking my questions. My first question is for you Tim. I think that as I speak with your current and prospective shareholders, the biggest sort of question mark in terms of visibility into next year is not really on the expense management side but really on the revenue side. You started out this call with the list of the remedies that you've done on the community bank. I guess the question for me is in terms of the overall culture of the bank how much is the wholesale bank being impacted by the issues and the scandal on the community bank? In other words, is it impacting risk appetite? Is it impacting growth initiatives? Is it impacting your ability to hire? ","Tim Sloan","The short answer as it relates to wholesale banking, Erika, it is a great question, is no, I mean at the margin and our government and institutional banking business. There is a little bit of impact on some municipalities they have put us on probation or just said they are not going to use as much for a period of time. Though we had some municipalities that have taken us off that because we've executed on everything we said we are going to execute over the last year. So it's not impacting our ability to hire people. And I mentioned attrition for the entire company but the same would go for wholesale banking in terms of lower attrition so we are not losing people. And is not affecting our credit appetite at all. And again I think wholesale banking performance in the quarter was good and I'd say the same thing for wealth and investment management. I mean you saw real good performance there. So there is no question that there is impact. We've talked about that. John provided a number of details in his presentation as it relates to some of our consumer businesses but for the rest of the company we are continuing to move forward. ","Erika Najarian","Got it. And just thank you so much for providing the new slide, slide 17, in terms of what we can expect to be achieved when. And I am wondering as we think about 4Q, 2019, John, is it a simple as saying okay let's assume a core run rate for Wells Fargo, let's say it's the $13.3 billion this quarter excluding the $1 billion in litigation accrual, assume a growth rate off of that and then deduct $500 million. Is that what falling to the bottom line means by 4Q, 2019?","John Shrewsberry","That's elegant but I guess the way I think about it -- I think about it is you got to take a snapshot of a business mix that throws off its -- each component which throws of its own efficiency ratio and I expect us frankly to get more efficient in the businesses as we roll forward. But as you look forward a year we should have taken out call it 40% of the first $2 billion and the rest of it to be coming out at the end of next year. So obviously that will be phasing-in through that period of time. You will have these harder to gauge elevated program related expenses for the types of items that I mentioned that sort of happening over the top. They have been for a little while and I anticipate the next 12 or 18 months will be -- there will be a lot of it going on. So I don't know much will be rolling off exactly at the end of the next -- nobody knows exactly how much will be rolling off at the end of next year. But that's a big number. And then we began to have this structural take out like the amortization, deposit intangible, the extra FDIC premium and the cost of the exited businesses although those will be happening earlier in 2018. So those are the moving pieces as I see them. Now with something new could occur to that changes the business but those are the big items and the way that are moving that as we forecast through 2018 and into 2019 are the drivers of where we are going to be. And with that an expectation for revenue that's what makes us think that we will get down to 61% for 2017 in the fourth quarter and hope to get to 59% in 2018.","Erika Najarian","And just one last question, a follow up on the revenue side of the 2018 efficiency equation. Is there idiosyncratic catalyst for the margin decline that you would like to point out that impacted performance for this year? Or maybe a better way to ask if the Fed does raise rate in December could you walk us through what the impact would be for 1Q, 2018 that would be perhaps different from what we saw this quarter? ","John Shrewsberry","Yes. So with respect to year-over-year margin and what's going on I mean it's what you imagine. We've got different categories of earnings assets they are priced differently investment securities loans, short -term investment et cetera. We've got mix and we have repricing. And the sort of weighted average of that matrix is the benefit in a rising rate environment, and then we've got deposits, we've got long-term debt, other funding liabilities, we've got mix and we've got repricing that's the negative in a rising rate environment. And that's what -I think we are five basis points up year-over-year but if there is a move in December and we roll into the beginning of the year and the easy calculation is actually our parallel move, so I'll give you the number for a parallel move. We think that's probable all things being equal that's probably worth $90 million a quarter including in the first quarter. So now things don't happen in parallel. We don't know what's going to happen at the longer end but and the big question mark about that is what is the deposit response in retail that bigger banks either cause or impacted by on the next move because we model a reasonably meaningful response and yet we haven't seen what yet so there could be upside to that. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ken Usdin","Hey, guys, how are doing? Good morning. Hey, can you talk a little bit about just the loan growth expectations? I know John in your prepared remarks you talked through a couple of the buckets where you are continuing to let things roll off. But obviously we are seeing the period end come in lower than the averages in part because of that. Can you just talk about end demand and try to separate end demand and customer growth from perhaps any lagging ramification of retail sales and the slower account growth in terms of how you expect loans to traject going forward?","Tim Sloan","Ken, it's Tim. You are talking about fourth quarter next year in term from the timeframe standpoint? ","Ken Usdin","Yes. Just your general outlook for when do you we see kind of bottoming in loan growth and how much of that kind of let go part is weighing on the overall amount of growth that you are seeing? ","Tim Sloan","So let me start with the portfolios that are likely to decline over that period and then we'll get to the ones that are going to increase. So as we've highlighted for last few quarters, I think it's likely that the auto portfolio will continue to decline over the next few quarters. Our expectation is it probably bottom out sometime second half of next year. I think the home equity portfolio will also continue to decline though our expectation is that next year all other things being equal will originate more home equity loan than what we did this year. But again recall there still that legacy portion of that portfolio that's burning off that we used to be very concerned about from a loss standpoint and it is now performing beyond all of our expectations. I expect the credit card portfolio to continue to grow. We saw that this quarter that was absolutely terrific driven by some really good improvement in digital acquisition. And so all the investments that we are making in the credit card business and our digital platform are working. I expect the on balance sheet mortgage portfolio to grow during that period. There will be some seasonality in the fourth and first quarter we've seen but again like we saw this quarter, we saw good growth in the first mortgage residential portfolio. And then on the wholesale side and commercial side we expect to see growth throughout that period. John highlighted some of the idiosyncratic reasons why we saw some decline this year. But our expectation is going to continue to grow. Having said all that, the reason we became the largest lender in this country is because we look at the market, we look at our customer demand and we want to make sure we are making good, long-term credit decision. So sometimes in a quarter it means you grow, sometimes you shrink but over the long term we are very confident we are going to be able to continue to grow. ","Ken Usdin","Okay. And then if I could just dig in on the commercial business specifically. The biggest of the loan buckets on the wholesale side. Even maybe some granularity there in terms of -- I know the specifics that John mentioned but obviously C&I had slowed overall and what do you just seeing in terms of customer demand and where that growth would come from inside that commercial business ?","Tim Sloan","Oh I think again we called out some specifics for example in this quarter we had a number of larger CRE construction loans that paid off and that's again that's going to be little bit episodic but overall view is that we are going to see growth across the entire portfolio again because we are in so many businesses, each business is going to have a little bit different complexion in the quarter. We highlighted the fact that because of the GE Capital acquisition we are now the number one asset base lender and we are pretty excited about that. That hasn't necessary happened over last few years so there is -- we think there is good upside there but really across the board we are optimistic about being able to grow. ","Ken Usdin","Okay, got it. And on the flip side just if I can ask the question about your credit in general and you are kind of got to this point where your charge-off bounced up a little bit and you didn't really release for the first time in a while. There is a lot of moving parts and you mentioned the hurricane impact. But just can you just talk about outlook or any credit normalization going forward in terms of also the mix and just amount of recovery that you are still being continuing to see on the commercial side?","Tim Sloan","Yes, Ken, it's a really good question. I think that everybody in the industry and certainly been for us too, we've seen such a benign credit environment except for the energy business which we've all work through. Whether you are a 27 basis points or 30 or 33 whatever the number is over the last few quarter it's still really low. If you overlay the current economic environment we continue to believe that losses will probably bounce around at lower rate ex things like the impact from the hurricanes but overall the portfolio has never been in any better shape in my 30 years at the company so we continue to be optimistic. Sorry John -- ","John Shrewsberry","I think for us auto will look better because we've taken out the low end of credit quality. ","Tim Sloan","It's good point.","John Shrewsberry","Vintages a recent quarterly, vintages of origination. I think with card we've been adding more new cards. We -- our card portfolio is now probably 50% what you consider to be very seasoned vintages so we should probably see a tick up because newer card vintages are going to experience front end loaded losses that's to be expected. ","Tim Sloan","But again that's not necessarily because of any fundamental deterioration at card portfolio, that's just a natural aging of new customers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the lines of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Pleas go ahead.","Betsy Graseck","Hi, good morning. I had a couple of quick questions. One was on the hedge accounting treatment that you said you are going to adopt next quarter. Could you give us a sense to why you decided to adopt that? And could you also go through what do you think the impact is on balance sheet or you are going to be realizing any gains as you move over securities et cetera?","John Shrewsberry","Yes. So this is -- this really relates to our own liabilities. When we issue long-term fixed rate either in dollars or in other currencies we hedge -- we often hedge back to floating, and we almost -- we generally hedge back to dollars or at least historically we did. So is that accounting noise that gets reduced as a result of the new accounting. So the only real impact that you are going to see is there will be some catch-up adjustment, year-to-date adjustment in Q4 which I think might amount to call it $100 million - $200 million kind of range. We haven't finished all the map on that yet but we'll figure out and that will come through in Q4. And then going forward what you see is a lot less volatility and the reason of course we are adopting it is because we are creating this noise in non-interest income that was bouncing around to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars a quarter that was just as a result of different evaluation schemes for the liability lag and the hedge lag and things that were permanently hedged. So we are happy with this kind of change. ","Betsy Graseck","Okay. And I heard in that there is one time opportunity to move some securities from held for -- held to maturity to AFS. I just wondering if you are going to take advantage of that at all or not?","John Shrewsberry","Not going to. The impact for us is really on the liability side. ","Betsy Graseck","Okay, got it. And then question on the living will and living will have been extended right to next one is not for another was it 18 months or so. Just want to understand how you are thinking about that? Because I know we had a conversation before round how you are thinking about the size of the investment bank versus the living will and maybe you can give some updated thoughts on that. ","John Shrewsberry","Sure. So the MPOE strategy that we've had in our recently filings works great for us. And I point out that because it's more unique to us among the larger banks because we've got smaller non bank affiliate activity going on and that's sort of a key driver of whether that works or doesn't work. In order to create more flexibility going forward including more either size or complexity of some of our non bank affiliate activity with nothing in particular or urgent in mind but just in general. We get more flexibility with an SPOE strategy. We had to sort of finish the process first of satisfying the deficiencies that were called out a couple of years ago and then filing the most recent plan. And so we stuck to our plan and delivered that and the feedback thus far has been -- it's not complete but it has been fine. So by doing this we think we open up more flexibility for Wells Fargo going forward and as you mentioned the industry got word that there will be instead of an annual cycle, at least this time an extra year and so whether we wait and file at the end of that period or we file at the middle of that period, we haven't really figured out yet but the intention is to move towards SPOE and we thought that the investment community should know that. ","Betsy Graseck","Okay. Just on auto specifically. I know you mentioned your actions you would be taking in the auto portfolio. What would drive you to get back into growth mode there? I know there has been some chatter around demand picking up and obviously the hurricane has had some impact. ","Tim Sloan","Yes. I just add I think there are two things going on, Betsy. One, there is the execution of the fundamental changes that we are making in the auto business to make it much more efficient and much more -- much less complex. And then it's just going to be our view of what's going on in the business. And if we think that there is more opportunity from a risk-reward standpoint as it relates to credit and we will take advantage of that but I think the decisions we've made over the last year had really worked because when you look at the average FICO scores of our customers, we did now increase and that's exactly what we wanted. So it's going to be a function of the changes that we are making in the business and then our view of what's going on in the industry. Even said all that I think you should expect that portfolio -- I am not being negative I just want to make sure you reinforce the comment I made to Ken, you should expect the portfolio even if we turn things up a notch to continue to decline through the fourth quarter this year through most of the next year and probably bottom out again sometime hopefully at the second half of next year. I mean we like that business. Don't get us wrong and our expectation is over time we will continue to gain share in that business but right now we are cautious and we got lot of changes going into the business and we got to execute those. ","John Shrewsberry","And those changes which we talked about are taking 50 or 55 distributed origination underwriting and collecting centers down to three bigger regional centers. And so while that's happening we rather have a higher credit profile the average customer so just that we are dealing with fewer defaults frankly while we make that change. And it will be made in 2018.","Betsy Graseck","Right. And so that you get down to the 3 by the end of 2018 or is that 2019?","John Shrewsberry","It's happening now; it should be by the end of 2018, Betsy. ","Betsy Graseck","And then just lastly on the reserve built for hurricanes $450 million is that right? ","John Shrewsberry","Yes. And it's not net build -- it's -- we would have it released but for the analysis that we've done so far on the hurricane impact areas. ","Betsy Graseck","Right. And is that -- it's a little figure that we've seen in other folks, can you just give us a sense of exposures or what's include in that? Is that across all credit spectrum, consumer and corporate? Is there anything that's really driving the bus on the size? ","Tim Sloan","Yes, it is. Betsy, again we are the largest lender in the country and you had a significant hurricanes have affected to very fast growing estate Texas and Florida in particular. ","John Shrewsberry","And Puerto Rico","Tim Sloan","And Puerto Rico and so it's across all product types. But I would also put in the category of if it's early in our assessment and I think we've been appropriately prudent in wanting to be conservative. We could end up being a little bit too conservative, maybe a little bit less but right now because there is so much going on in all those markets we just thought it was prudent not to have a release until we get to the bottom or whatever the exposure would be. And our folks have been working very hard in terms of trying to get their arms around it and everyday is a little bit different. My guess we'll have updates throughout the quarter.","John Shrewsberry","Yes. One of the first things we did in Texas and Florida was offer people a 90 day forbearance on their mortgage payment then add them on to the back end of the loan with no negative repercussions so they get just get their feet back on the ground. That's great thing although it is just complicate figuring out whose going to make their payments or not. So we have to wait I suppose just seeing all the information and every first of the month payment cycle. We also have more complications here with our borrower insurance whether it's auto insurance or homeowner insurance, how are they covered for flood, how are they covered for winds, those types of things which will -- which increases the uncertainty on what performance are going to be. So we noticed also that there was a bigger number than what some other people have talked about. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Scott Siefers","Hi, guys. I was wondering if you could spend just a moment or two talking about the branch footprint overall? I mean you guys definitely been more aggressive recently than you had been over say the last several years and sort of pairing back where appropriate but I guess increasingly I am finding myself getting questions about why your branch footprint shouldn't be like 1,000 or so branches, if you are just given how many more branches you have been -- the other biggest players in the country so just curious if you could maybe offer a little color on sort of how you are thinking about the appropriateness of the footprint as look you forward and what any additional opportunities might be?","Tim Sloan","Sure. So Scott I think it's a great question but fundamentally I think every institutions going to have a different footprint. We are really, really proud of this footprint that we've developed over decades and decades which is one of the reasons why we have the largest market share from the deposit standpoint. That's incredibly valuable. And I'd also just caution that it's not just about the number of branches, it is the size of the branches, it's how they are organized, it's where they are located, which drive cost and so on. But I think Mary Mack was very clear in our Investor Day in giving a couple of years of guidance in terms of what are plans are and we are in the midst to executing on those plans. So far this year as we've detailed we are on track in terms of the branches we are closing. We haven't seen in any significant revenue impact which is part of the goal too. Most of our team members that were in those branches have now liked other branches which are absolutely terrific. So we've got an experienced crew. My guess is that over time we'll continue to respond to our customers because they are going to ultimately tell us how many branches they want. We transaction billions of dollars, billions of interactions each quarter but over 50 millions time a month somebody still comes into our branches and they want to be able to use them. So I think it's likely over time the number of branches that you see will decline. If our customers tell us that they want fewer of them then we will accelerate that. But candidly, if our customers tell us they want more we are going to listen to them. But I think you had also seen Scott the impact from the investment that we are making from the digital standpoint and it's not just the investment in terms of opening new accounts, it's also how we are integrating that into the branch experience. So it's long-winded answer to your question we are going to execute on what we said for 2018 and 2019. We are going to have an Investor Day next May. We will provide you with an update. I am sorry 2017 and 2018, we will have Investor Day next May, we will provide you with some updates and we will continue to move forward. ","John Shrewsberry","Only thing I'd is that we are thinking very, very aggressively about what the right mix is. We own half of our branches. We have short leases on most of the other half. We are in a position to be as flexible as we need to be if we think opportunity presents itself.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. ","John Pancari","Good morning. Just wanted to -- sorry to everybody here but I just want to kick the dead horse on loan growth one more time. And I'll be quick on this one but the way we should think about with loan growth and the potential impact of the sales practice in card and auto insurance issues that if those issues did not happen at all. If you never had the sale practice issue emerge nor the auto insurance gap, CPI issue and all that. Loan growth headwind that you are seeing rights now, this decline in commercial et cetera that still would have happened? ","John Shrewsberry","For commercial","John Pancari","Yes","Tim Sloan","Yes. John, the sales practices impact for our loan growth has been primarily based on referrals from our branches to some of our other businesses. So there has been impact in terms of credit card referrals and first mortgage home equity and things like that. ","John Shrewsberry","Personal loans","Tim Sloan","And personal and lines, thank you John. That's really where the impact has been. There has not been material impact in wholesale or wealth and investment management for that matter. ","John Pancari","Okay, thank you. And then a couple quick more things on the slide 16 where you give us the targeted savings exclude those items there including the CDI and the FDIC. What is the total of those items? Is it about a $1 billion?","John Shrewsberry","On an annual basis it is about $1 billion, yes. ","John Pancari","Okay, all right, great. And then lastly on the credit side the 90 plus days past dues up 14% on a linked quarter basis. I am sorry if I missed this but how much of that is storm related and what is the amount that maybe related to the storms I guess and could that increase from here. Thanks. ","Tim Sloan","I don't have a good answer for you, John. I don't think much because it just happened and so I don't think that's a big driver. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. ","Matt O'Connor","Good morning. Tim, so you have been CEO now for about a year ","Tim Sloan","A year and a day I think. ","Matt O'Connor","All right that even -- ","Tim Sloan","Maybe two I don't know, yes, seems like forever, Matt.","Matt O'Connor","So now that you've been there for sometime do you feel like you have identified all the issues related to just call it sales practices and tactics have become headline issue for the stock and obviously weighted on results as well, issues like you have identified those issues. ","Tim Sloan","Well, Matt, we've been working very hard to identify all the issues. I am very pleased with the progress obviously, I am not necessarily pleased if you had find something, it sometimes it's not particularly positive but we've made a commitment to look through everything and be very disclosive and I appreciate that can create a headline. And weigh on the company and stock and team members and others stakeholders. But we've made a lot of progress. I can't commit to you Matt that we've finished everything because things are still in progress but we are very far along but I think it's also important to reinforce -- our review of all of our policies, procedures, practices is going to continue for a long time meaning that we got to continue to ask more of ourselves everyday. And I think that was in hindsight one of the mistakes that we made and we've -- I have taken responsibility for that, we've taken responsibility for it. But it's long-winded answer to your question, we are making a lot of progress. We've been transparent about everything that we've talked about, we discovered and so on. I am really pleased with the progress. ","Matt O'Connor","And if you had to guess I mean how much longer until you can say we've look through everything, this is what we found, we are done and I kind of appreciate that so issues can pop-up at any company at any time but when you kind of put the stake on the ground and say, we've been through everything, it's a big company, lots of businesses, lots of employees and we are moving forward and I kind of 100% guarantee nothing will pop up but like we are essentially on par with everybody else and we are feeling good from here. How long that is going to take? ","Tim Sloan","Well, Matt, I don't ever want to be on par with everybody else. I want to be better than everybody else. And that's why we rolled out our six aspirational goals for our team in March. And we said, look, we want to be the best in the industry. We are not in the best in the industry and everyone of those right now but that's what our goal is. So listen I appreciate the question and I understand the reason for the question and so on. But I don't have a specific date and I think it's a mistake notwithstanding in the short term that might feel good but in long term it would be a mistake, it's a mistake to put a stake in the ground, and say everything is got to be done by certain day because then what happen is people might rush to get to an answer and I don't want them to rush to the answer. I want them to get to the right answer. But again we've made a lot of progress. As John described, we are spending a lot of money looking through everything and building a better company. So we are going to continue on that journey. ","Matt O'Connor","Okay. I can appreciate it's hard to put a timeframe on it but I do think it's important to come out when you feel confident and say that these legacy issues have been addressed, we are turning the page and we are moving on. ","Tim Sloan","Understood.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead. ","Marty Mosby","Thanks for taking the question. Hey, what I want to focus on is your deposit beta has been higher than the peer which is a normal compared to your history. And that is really been I think reflective of you wanting to especially with corporate and wealth management customers not giving any other reasons in this period to work anywhere else. So you have been defensive in your deposit pricing which is not been the case in the past you have been much more offensive and aggressive being able to hold back those deposits. When you look at your assets structure because of the duration that would have had you to assume on your deposit side over time, you would have extended your asset. So what you are kind of getting is a fundamental shift into deposit beta which doesn\u2019t reflect on your asset side so you got almost a mismatch and I am just wondering if that's the way to kind of think about this and is this how and why we are not seeing the margin expansion that we are seeing in some other banks. ","John Shrewsberry","The aggregate deposit beta is a function of the component pieces of it. And as I mentioned earlier we are the number one retail deposit franchise and beta there is essentially zero. And in wealth and investment management where we've got a sophisticated clientele with lot of excess liquidity and lot of options, I think our beta -- our realized beta has been on the order of a third -- 30% to 35%. In the wholesale where we as you point out we have lots of sophistication, lots of competition et cetera, I think the realized beta has been something on the order of two thirds and so to the extent that we've been growing wholesale deposits a little bit faster than the weighted average deposit beta moves up reflecting that mix. I don't know whether Perry would say that he is being responsive in this cycle to give not give people a reason to move money away from Wells Fargo. I think they are being judicious; they are going customer by customer or customer category by customer category. We are doing more for example with certain type of institutional borrowers which probably have the most sensitivity to change in rate but we need them for our total liquidity profile and it sort of is what it is on average. And when I think about NIM expansion and the rising rate environment, obviously this is a big part of the outcome but it's also the change in rest of our liability structure as well, we've got more long -term debt than we've ever had before that comes in more of cost which has been NIM depressing during the time that we've been adding an office, this few other structural items as well. ","Tim Sloan","Marty, let me just reinforce how we think about pricing, deposits for our wholesale customers. It's very much based -- very much done on a relationship by relationship basis. So it's not just about hey let's decide whether or not we want to keep these deposits, it's about what's the value of the overall relationship. And so it's as you appreciated it's a little bit more complicated than just the deposit. It's the relationship and it's very much coordinated with what we are doing on the wealth and the individual side. So there is a lot of coordination going on, if there has as John mentioned the beta is a little bit higher but I wouldn't necessary jump to the conclusion that's fundamentally changed the structure at the company. ","Marty Mosby","Now I thinking that might be temporary in the sense that you used to be able to most aggressive lagger which helped you to be able to expand when everybody else was expanding but also maintain a higher margin because you had extended the duration on your assets prudently so that defended your margin in a decline rate environment but takes away a little bit of the punch in the way up that you used to be able to make by just being half of what everybody else did in deposit increases. Then my last question was if you look at fee income, you've seen disruption of activities related to these hurricanes and other things that have go on in the last couple of months. Do you feel like -- we've seen what you have allocated on the loan loss reserve, but hasn't it also probably impacted some of your fee income in the third quarter. ","Tim Sloan","Oh I think at the margin, Marty, there is no question when you have such an important market like Florida without power and still parts of Florida without power, you have an important market like in and around Houston which has been like very dynamic from a growth standpoint, there are some impact. I don't know how much it is but at the margin there is some impact and we'll work through, that has an impact to the company in a very short term, over the long terms those are great markets, they are going to recover. Generally, what you see kind of post hurricane, in a hurricane situation you see kind of V shape recovery in those markets and we are looking forward to that. That's one of the reasons why we've really focused on making sure that we provided all the benefits to our customers possible to help them recover even faster. ","Marty Mosby","No, I think that's right. And this was say it's kind of hidden impact there was no way to put your finger on but it is kind of underneath a numbers as you kind of look at and it will rebound quickly but thanks. ","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.","Gerard Cassidy","Good morning, Tim. Good, thank you. Can you guys give us some color -- obviously, you're leading mortgage originator in the United States, leading mortgage originator. And can you give us some color on where you see the housing industry at this point in the cycle? Are we halfway through the cycle? 2\/3 the way through? We're just turning out? Any color would be helpful.","Tim Sloan","Yes, I mean everybody has got an opinion on this. I wish Franklin on the phone because he'd probably give you the best one but my personal view is that I think this recovery is very different than what we've seen historically because of the impacts of demographics and what we just see the millennials forming households and therefore buying houses at a different pace than what we saw in earlier recovery and\/or prior recoveries in other demographics. So I think there is -- and we believe there is a lot more room to grow. I don't know what inning it's in but I would say its -- again assuming kind of the steady economic growth that we've seen, we see that demographic grew aging more, they are starting to form families more, we are starting to -- and we are starting to see the benefit of that. So my expectation is that we are early in that process and we got lot to look forward to. And that's one of the reasons why we have been so focused on rolling out our new digital mortgage application because I think particularly for that demographic group, they are used to a mortgage and then they want a mortgage experience and maybe you and I didn't experience when we bought our first home. They are used to --when they go online they want all the information as they should have and so that's why we are excited to roll this out in the first quarter and we think that will be very positive to that demographic group.","Gerard Cassidy","In that application you've described, Tim, that's equivalent to the rocket mortgage that Quicken loans has right now?","Tim Sloan","I want to be respectful to the Quicken, I think they've done a great job with rocket mortgage but I would describe what we are doing as the kind of the next generation because it's not just about giving a fast answer. That's part of it. Everybody expects that and we are doing that across the platform from a consumer side. This is about if you are going online, you are Wells Fargo customer, you type in a little bit information like who you are and you want to mortgage and we pre populate your application so that you are not -- we are not asking you and you are not having to give for the 44 time where you live, how much you make and it's using the trusted data that we have here. What's even more exciting about that is that we are going to have the capability of pulling that data from outside Wells Fargo too. So we are going to have that same capability both inside and outside of Wells Fargo. So I would describe that is a next generation. ","John Shrewsberry","So I mentioned in my comments earlier that data modernization is one of our big initiatives because for reasons like this with the breadth of reach that we have to call it 21 million households and 70 million customers in one way or another, we know so much about our customers that we should be able to as in this case pre populate with trusted data, but present really customized, really personalized solution when people are looking for a new product or new service. We can use that same data in a fraud protection way, it's very, very, powerful and a risk management way, it's very, very powerful. The more we know because of the breadth of our relationship with customers, the stronger the value proposition is going forward. So it's a huge initiative and it's going to -- it should change the way retail banking is done. ","Gerard Cassidy","I see. And maybe Tim, sticking with home mortgage for a moment, I think, very recently, the mortgage bankers association came up with the top 20 originators. And what's fascinating is the top 10, the number of non-banks that are in there, like the Quicken loans or Freedom Mortgage Corp., and they're growing very rapidly. How do you see them as a competitive threat to the traditional banks like your own?","Tim Sloan","Well, I think the primary driver for the change in mix in the top 10 has been related to FHA direct mortgages again set correspondent aside for a minute. Because the FHA has not adopted the same liability structure that Fannie and Freddie have. The larger originators we would be one and our other bank competitors or the other have just said you know what we are not going to sign up for the fact that 10 years from now somebody could come back and say I mortgage the originated today defaulted at that point in time. That's really been the driver. Now I am hopeful that with all the changes we are going to incur as we look at how homes are financed in this country that issue will be dealt with and I can assure you that if and when that occurs we will back into FHA direct business and you will see an improvement in our share over time. But that's been the driver. Plain and simple. And I don't mean to be negative about any other competitors. They are all terrific and I am sure they are providing good service and so on to their customers but that's been the driver. ","Gerard Cassidy","Great. And then with home equity loans, I think you mentioned, if I heard you correctly a moment ago, that you could see growth in the product in 2018, but the vintage home equity loans are performing much better than your earlier thought. Is there any possibility that, that type of product whether it was an interest only product for a 10-year term, would those come back when you think about growing the portfolio since they performed so much better than expected.","Tim Sloan","There is no question that we want to try to retain as many of those customers as we can. So the short answer is yes, I think that's part of our overall growth strategy but many of those are just paying off because the customers don't need them any more. ","Gerard Cassidy","I see. And then just lastly, you guys talked about your expense initiative, of course, and it's $4 billion that you're going to reduce, I think you, John, pretty clear, that the expectations for the reduction in expenses do not include the core deposit premiums that you've been running every year, also the FDIC special assessment and then also expenses associated with businesses that you sold of. Can you frame up for us what that total could be from those 3 areas and that it will be on top of the $4 billion?","Tim Sloan","Yes, I think Betsy had asked about the sum of the FDIC premium and the amortization of deposits intangible. That's about $1 billion a year in full run rate. And the expenses from the businesses that we are selling, I don't think that we have called that out one yet, it's less than $1 billion but there is a portion of that's direct and a portion indirect and so we need to make sure that we can drive out all of the indirect that's associated with it in order to take the full amount out. We will get some more clarity as those businesses actually close and are sold. ","John Shrewsberry","Yes. Let's get the deal and then we will provide some more detail. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead.","Saul Martinez","Hi, good morning, everybody. Two questions. First, client customer growth, your primary checking account customers have essentially been flat over the last year, that compares to sort of mid to high single digit historically and it's really decelerated since second quarter of last year. And on top of that small business account deposit and consumer deposits have been come in as well. So I mean how important is it to stem that and start to drive some consumer account growth and what you need to do to kick start that? Is it at some point does it suggest that maybe you do have to start to become a little bit more aggressive in terms of deposit pricing on the retail side as well? ","Tim Sloan","So let me answer the last question, last part of your question and get to the beginning because it's a really good question. The short answer is no. We don't -- that the driver this is not deposits pricing. I think that at the margin if you are competing on price, you are making short term decision and invest in the opportunity to build long term relationships. What -- how I would think about the primary checking account growth in kind of two parts. One is quality and one is quantity. You are talking about quantity which is an absolute fair point year-over-year it's been flat. I think the reason for that is because we've been through and are going through a transformation in our retail business. And when you think about what -- how that sales practices settlement and related reputational impact affected our team and our customers particularly in the third and the fourth quarter, and then Mary and team have been making fundamental changes to the business in terms of a new incentive plan, going through reducing a layer of management in terms of new training and just there has been so much going on. And I think that what we are seeing and actually I was talking to Mary about this over the last couple of days. What we are seeing right now in our branches our team members that are so much more confident and working so much better with their customers to provide them with solutions and I think you are going to see that in not only continued improvement in customer experience and loyalty scores but you are going to see that in terms of growth. The quality I think is an important point. Mary highlighted at Investor Day that average customer deposits per account were up about 8% year-over-year, now we are seeing that be up about 11%. So we've got work to do on quantity, quality is already improving but it's just the execution of all the plans that are in the process right now. And we are seeing improvement everyday. ","Saul Martinez","Okay. No, that's helpful. I guess a follow up with sort of a bigger picture type of question and you guys have lot of stakeholders as any banker any company, employees, the community, you serve your client, your shareholders, you obviously want to be seen as good corporate citizen whose actions are doing good for society at large. But sort of in the grand scheme of things I mean how important is generating an 11% to 13% ROE for shareholders. And the question isn't meant to be confrontational or grandstanding in anyways but it does feel like it sort in the background of discussions you have with investors as well going to pull the cost leverage harder as they can or they going to communicate that or they are going to be more up to change pricing or increase deposit pricing or whatever it is. But I kind of wanted to just ask sort of how do you think about the push and pull of how you run the business and decide how to address different stakeholders' interest? ","Tim Sloan","Yes. I will start and then I am sure John want to jump in but look we appreciate that we have lot of stakeholders. And it is not lost on us, that one of our most important stakeholders are you; our shareholders and we have historically provided exceptional returns on an absolute and relative basis. I think our returns are continued to be very, very good. Others have caught up, we appreciate that but make no mistake, we understand that increasing our capital return to our shareholders like we did this quarter where we were up to $4 billion and continuing to grow ROE is very important. And that's one of the reasons why when we introduced our six aspirational goals to our team that we were very clear that providing the best long-term returns to our shareholders and the industry is one of our goals. And we are going to achieve that goal. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. ","Vivek Juneja","Hi, John. Just a couple of questions, mortgage application issue that came out you said you are refunding customer from September 2016. Just want to understand does something changed in the system that caused this thing to start from September 2016? Any color on that what happened that it starts on that point? ","John Shrewsberry","Sure. So prior to 2013, we were in the midst of refinancing boom and everybody was so busy, everybody in the industry but we certainly were that we didn't charge for any sort of rate lock extension. We put a new policy and practice in place at that point which was in place until we changed it. So it's that roughly three year timeframe that we are focused on where some customers where we charged a rate lock extension maybe should have been -- it should have been handled differently and that's population that we were focused on. We changed our practice, it's done centrally now and so that's there is a focus. ","Vivek Juneja","Okay. And so I guess brings a bigger picture question. So with all these kind of little, little things that have come up which not always easy to find, is that something you are trying to do to I mean it is a big bank in terms of processes so that you can catch more of these, Tim?","Tim Sloan","Oh, absolutely. I think that's really been fundamental to the changes that we've been executing on in the last year. We are very clear about the fact that one of the reasons that we had some issues in our retail banking business is because of how we were organized. So we've centralized all of our control functions whether its compliance or HR, finance, you name it. And so we've got a better check in balance than we did before. That's number one. Two, we've been very focused on reinforcing to the entire team that if there is something they are concerned about, go ahead and raise your hand and escalate it and so that's working too. And then within our centralized risk functions we are also -- we've also created a conduct office and within that we are assembling data to John's point about the investment we are making at data. So that we are using data better to triangulate into any area that we are concerned about. You take call to an FX line or attrition or complaints or whatever, you put that altogether and then you can more quickly look at something and say, hey, we got an issue, we don't. The good news is we are making lots of progress but absolutely right. I mean we have fundamentally changed this organization. We fundamentally changed it for the better and we are seeing that everyday. Now, sometimes in seeing that it means that we find something. We are going to be very transparent about it because that's what we promised you to do. ","Vivek Juneja","So even things like product pricing, Tim? Product pricing - ","Tim Sloan","Yes, oh sure. ","Vivek Juneja","Okay. Different question. John, you mentioned something about spending on BSA AML; I haven't heard that from you before. Something new I mean is there an order or event or something that caused you to mention that or any color on that? ","John Shrewsberry","Nothing new. There has been an order in place for sometime which just raises the standard for the level of borrower due diligence if necessary in order to be satisfying from a regulatory perspective. So there is a lot of beneficial owner or if there is a lot of sort of incremental memo writing, file cracking et cetera across hundreds and hundreds of thousands of wholesale customers. And it cost at the margin hundreds and millions of dollars per year to accomplish. That sort of a backlog issue. ","Vivek Juneja","Okay. And when do you expect you might be able to get out of this consent order? ","John Shrewsberry","Well, I think the expectation is that the work necessary to deliver would be done -- finished in 2018. It has been underway for more than a year. That's a different question as to getting under the consent order. ","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Hi, good morning. So yes two quick questions I think. When you look at the C&I growth, I know it's down, I know you highlighted some of the decline and some of -- what was offset by growth in the presentation but that still only accounts for $1 billion of the $3 billion decline. So can you just highlight where the rest of the decline came from? And in light of some of your peers were reporting strong growth in large corporate banking, how would that large corporate banking perform on a quarter? ","Tim Sloan","Large corporate was down, I don't have the specific number in front of me but it was down a bit. I would say was probably in line with what I have seen from some of our competitors. It was just a little bit decline or low in some of the larger transactional activity. But we called out these specific areas that were the primary drivers. Everything else was relatively small and we also called out the impact in terms of the commercial real estate.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay. And then on the facility ratio for 2018, I know you hear -- you have been saying that your whole to lending growth picks up and that you are optimistic it will but being what kind of lending growth is in the budget for you hit that 59%? I mean can you just still hit the 59% goal with 1% loan growth or 2% loan growth? ","Tim Sloan","We haven't exactly send a budget for next year yet but look our assumption is that we are going -- and belief is that we are going to be able to grow our commercial loans as we have year-over-year-over-year, I mean we had some impact us so far in the last couple of quarters. But I wouldn't describe that as the primary driver for what's going to happen from the efficiency standpoint because we've got a consumer loan portfolio and we've got revenues coming from our fees and like. So it's a little bit more complicated than that in terms of the driver or the efficiency. But again our goal is to get down to a 59% level sometime next year. So I am sure we'll be talking about that again. ","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay, thanks. ","Tim Sloan","Thank you. Listen, I really appreciate everybody's time this morning. I know it's been a busy morning for all of you. Just want to reemphasis that over the past years we've made a number of fundamental changes to our business model, to structure the organization which I was just mentioning and to a number of our performance management programs to ensure that we are focusing on our customers and focusing on their financial needs. Again, I want to thank the hard work and effort of our 268,000 team members for their focus and resiliency in meeting those customers' need. We are seeking every opportunity to identify and fix any issues that we have with the company. And make sure they are done correctly. As I mentioned, we've seen a very strong progress in addressing those issues and also rebuilding trust with all of stakeholders including all of you. And while we understand there is more work to do, I am confident that we are absolutely on the right path as we continue to build a better, stronger Wells Fargo. So again thank you very much for your time. Have a good day. ","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you all for joining.

My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions].","I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference.","John Campbell","Thank you, Regina. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO and President, Charlie Scharf and our CFO, John Shrewsberry will discuss fourth quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our fourth quarter earnings release and quarterly supplements are available on our Web site at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that, we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties.","Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our Web site.","I will now turn the call over to Charlie Scharf.","Charlie Scharf","Thank you, John and good morning everyone. It's good to be with you on my first earnings call. As I go through my remarks, I'd ask that you remember that I just joined Wells Fargo less than three months ago. It's been a busy time as I have been working to get to know the company, our opportunities and challenges and I've learned a lot. But as I discuss my observations, please recognize that it is still early days. I don't have all the answers yet, but I will share more as I learn more and as the year progresses.","John is going to cover the quarter in detail in a few minutes and we'll answer your questions. You can see that a series of legacy issues meaningfully impacted our results in the quarter. Even excluding these significant items, our results are not as strong as we aspire to. But the strength of the franchise is still evident. There are certainly some areas of success but the opportunity to improve our results is significant and attainable.","Let me first share some of my observations and thoughts before turning it over to John. First, I was honored to be chosen to lead Wells Fargo because I believe this is an extraordinary company that plays an important role in this country. We came out of the financial crisis as the most valuable and most respected bank in the U.S.","But as you know, we made some terrible mistakes and have not effectively addressed our shortcomings. These circumstances have led to financial underperformance, but we have one of the most enviable financial services franchises in the world and employees that want to do what's necessary to again be one of the most respected and successful banks in the U.S.","To fully capture this opportunity, we must have a strong foundation and move with an extreme sense of urgency to remediate our historical issues. We still have much more work to do to put these issues behind us, and our future depends on us doing this successfully so we can regain trust with all stakeholders, including our clients, regulators, lawmakers, as well as the broader American population. Ultimately, our actions will dictate when that trust is completely regained, not our words.","Given the importance of these issues, I want to say a few more words about our situation, particularly about the challenges that stand in the way of our success and importantly, the different approach we're taking to address these issues. Providing an honest assessment and clear priorities is critical. And I've given a clear message inside the company that we have not yet met our own expectations or the expectations of others. We must do what's necessary to put these issues behind us.","Our ability to maximize the value of this great franchise is dependent on us running the company with the highest standards of operational excellence and integrity beyond what we've done to-date. We are appropriately a highly regulated institution. And while we need to fulfill regulatory expectations, we recognize that what we want and what regulators want are not different. We are responsible for our actions and they're responsible for ensuring our actions are consistent with clearly defined standards. It's our job to run the company such that we fulfill their expectations, and those of the American public and other countries where we operate. Respect was earned in the past and we will earn it again.","As such, since joining I've been spending almost all of my time on these issues. I will say this several times, but you should know there's still much work to do. Many have focused on the Fed consent order but remember we have 12 public enforcement actions that require significant resource commitment. While I certainly wish more of this work was behind us, what's required of us is clear and we will get it done. It\u2019s work that other banks have done already, so there's a clear roadmap for what we need to achieve.","We're making significant changes to our management structure and processes to accomplish our work, changes that will make us more effective. Like any other problems, recognition of the importance and severity is necessary first step, but this by itself is inadequate. We will take whatever actions are necessary. Our future success depends on resolving these issues. So we will act accordingly. The management team will be judged and held accountable for resolving these issues. To set us up for success, we will ensure we have the right people in place to both resolve these issues and be the stewards of this great company.","Importantly, I want to acknowledge that we have so many wonderful people at Wells Fargo that have done an amazing job serving our clients and customers in the face of the diversity for several years now. They've been through so much and have helped us sustain such a great franchise. So I do want to say thank you to them for all they've done. The warmth and support I've been greeted with, as I've discussed our shortcomings and work in front of us, tells a great deal about the character of many at the company.","They understand our lack of progress makes their jobs far more difficult, and they're looking to management to do more to move the company forward. To get the work done we must ensure that we have the right team. To that end, we've made some important changes to the senior team to complement the talent that's here at Wells.","Scott Powell joined us as Chief Operating Officer. When I arrived at the company, many on the senior management team made clear to me that they believed we needed stronger execution skills. After just several weeks at the company, I came to quickly agree. Scott will lead a transformation across the company where high quality execution, clear accountability and operational excellence, becomes part of our culture.","Bill Daley joined as Head of Public Affairs. He is a strong and experienced voice and brings perspectives from the public sector that we in business do not generally have but are critical for us as we make decisions. Allen Parker, who served both as General Counsel and Interim CEO, announced he will be leaving Wells in March. We are well into a search for the new General Counsel and excited about the quality of the candidates we've met. Avid Modjtabai has announced that she will be retiring after 26 years at Wells Fargo in March. We will be announcing a new organizational structure for these activities shortly.","Ray Fisher has also joined us to run our Card and Merchant Services Business. Our card business is important to our franchise and we have an opportunity to make it even more significant. Ray is an experienced card and Merchant Services executive who brings deep knowledge and a fresh perspective to our business. These changes are in addition to many other senior people who have joined the company over the past few years in important roles, such as Heads of Risk, HR, internal audits, and technology. These new additions complement the strong talent at the company. And I will continue to look at the structure and roles to ensure we are best positioned for success. We need and will have the best talent and strong leadership at the company.","We're also introducing a new set of disciplines in how we run the company which I'm confident will improve our performance. These changes are not only structural and procedural but also cultural. To that point, parts of our culture are wonderful and it would take decades to recreate. People who work here love it. It really is like a second family. We focus on teamwork not on the individual. People want to be successful and do what's right though we recognized we've fallen short of this goal. But our lack of progress and underperformance point to shortcomings.","Going forward, we will operate as one company, not a series of decentralized businesses. We will continue to foster a culture of partnership but we will move past the need for consensus and have open and direct fact-based discussions where we emerge with decisions. We will have a different level of management discipline than we've had in the past and we'll value and expect high quality execution. There will be clear responsibility and accountability. We will judge ourselves based upon our outcomes not our words. And we will ultimately judge ourselves versus the best as we believe that we should be the best.","As we begun to implement this new culture, the response has been overwhelmingly supportive. But I understand it's different and is a significant change for many. We will be respectful of our past and of those who have built this great franchise, which includes so many still with the company today, but we must move forward. I'm confident these changes will be highly impactful.","And though I understand you would like time frames around resolution, I cannot provide that today. Our job is to do the work that's necessary. Regulators and other stakeholders will determine when it's done to their satisfaction. My experience is that our regulators are clear, direct, tough, but fair. The work is on us at this point.","Let me now turn to our medium and longer term opportunities. Our franchises are world class and are in the sweet spot of providing necessary financial services for consumers, small businesses and middle market and large corporate companies. And importantly, we play an important role in helping our customers and clients prosper, as well as being an important enabler for U.S. economic growth.","While I've spoken at length of our mistakes and our commitments to fix them, the underlying franchise itself is as valuable as ever and our opportunities are greater than ever. The success of our business model is proven assuming we run the company with the appropriate controls and work as one company with the goal of delivering for all stakeholders.","All of our business segments, Community Banking, Wealth Investment Management and Wholesale, have the breadth and scale that gives us significant competitive advantage and allow us to deliver truly differentiated products and experiences for our customers and clients. Our opportunity to use technology to drive both automation and new solutions will only grow in importance. Our franchises, both individually and collectively, are the envy of many.","So while our resources and attention today are appropriately preoccupied with historical issues, as we move forward, we will be in a position to leverage our unique franchise and generate stronger financial results. And just to be clear, we are well aware that our expense levels are significantly too high. Part of this is driven by significant project expense related historical issues, part is due to the necessary investments in technology, part is due to significant inefficiencies that exist across the organization. But there is no reason why we shouldn't have best in class efficiency with these businesses at this scale and that ultimately will be our goal. And know we've had pockets of strong performance, we're also well aware that our rate of customer and revenue growth is too low. Given what we've been through, this isn't surprising.","There's certainly an opportunity cost due to the asset gap. Management time and resources have not been as focused on growth as they otherwise would have been. And we have an opportunity to think differently with different level of rigor about how to grow the franchise. All of this points to great opportunity. So again, I know you will want to know timeframes and targets, but please understand that it's too early after less than three months at the company. That said, we have just begun the process to rethink our plans for 2020 and beyond in a different level of detail.","While the opportunities for improvement are clear at the macro level, we need business-by-business plans. Accordingly, we have just begun conducting what are really both budget and broader business reviews where we look in detail at our plans. We will be reviewing over 10 businesses in detail, as well as all of our enterprise functions.","As you can imagine, technology is important theme. This isn't merely a review of the numbers, but one where we use the facts to form a basis to discuss strategy and potential actions. We are asking each business leader to show us what best-in-class efficiency looks like and what our path to achieve it is. We're reviewing revenue and return performance as well and what a path to best class looks like here as well. We're discussing our competitors large and small and we're thinking through our unique options given our special franchise. These are analytical and strategic discussions that I don't think have occurred consistently across the company in some time given what's occurred.","The output of this work will provide us roadmaps to not only improve our performance within each business, but also position us to understand our opportunities across the company and prioritize accordingly. First and foremost, this includes clarity around ensuring we're spending appropriately on historical issues. It's still very early in our process but I will say that every session thus far has reinforced that our opportunities are meaningful.","We intend to be detailed, thoughtful and complete to do this properly and given our priorities, it will take time much of this year, to complete our work. But in the interim, we will devote all necessary resources to risk, control and spend what's necessary. We will be as diligent as ever to drive efficiencies and control expenses, and we will begin to work through the business opportunities we have in front of us. I'm confident in our ability to realize our potential, one that again puts us at the top of the respective financials intuition list with a far more efficient organization and higher revenue growth than you see today.","While there is much to do and I know the path to success will be bumpy, I'm optimistic about our future and excited to be at a place with so many great people and such strong franchises doing incredibly important work. John, over to you.","John Shrewsberry","Thanks Charlie. Good morning, everyone. We had a number of significant items in the fourth quarter that impacted our results, which we highlight on Page 2 of our supplement. We had $1.9 billion of operating losses, including $1.5 billion of litigation accruals for a variety of matters including previously disclosed retail sales practice matters.","The litigation accruals reduced EPS by $0.33 per share and a majority of them were not tax deductible. We had a $362 million gain from the sale of our commercial real estate brokerage business, Eastdil Secured. We had $166 million of expenses related to the strategic reassessment of technology projects in Wealth and Investment Management.","We had a $153 million linked-quarter decrease in low income housing tax credit investment income, reflecting a timing change of expected tax benefit recognition. We had a $134 million gain on loan sales, predominantly Junior Lien mortgages. And we had a $125 million loan loss reserve release. While our financial results in the fourth quarter were impacted by these items, as we show on Page 3, we continue to have positive business momentum with strong customer activity, which I'll highlight throughout the call.","On Page 4, we summarize the full year results. Compared with 2018, revenue declined as 4% growth in non-interest income was more than offset by a 6% decline in net interest income, driven by lower interest rates. Our expenses remained too high and increased 4% from a year ago, driven by higher personnel expense, which included $981 million of higher deferred comp expense, which is P&L neutral and higher operating losses.","Loans grew 1% and deposits increased 3% from a year ago. Our net charge-off rate remained near historic lows. And we returned a total of $30 billion to shareholders in 2019 through common stock dividends and net share repurchases, reducing common shares outstanding by 10%. I'll be highlighting most of the balance sheet drivers on Page 5 throughout the call. But I will note here that we were $20 billion below the asset cap at the end of the fourth quarter.","Turning to Page 6. I will be covering the income statement drivers throughout the call. But I want to highlight that our effective income tax rate was 19.1% in the fourth quarter, which included a net discrete income tax expense of $303 million, predominantly related to the non-tax-deductible treatment of certain litigation accruals.","Turning to Page 7. Average loans increased linked-quarter and year-over-year with growth in both consumer and commercial loans. Period end loans increased $9.2 billion from a year ago, even as we sold or moved to held for sale a total of $5.8 billion of consumer loans over the past year.","I'll highlight the drivers of the linked-quarter growth in loans starting on Page 9. Commercial loans increased $3.4 billion from the third quarter, driven by broad-based C&I growth in corporate and investment banking.","As we show on Page 10, Consumer Loans grew $4 billion from the third quarter. The first mortgage loan portfolio increased $3.2 billion from the prior quarter, driven by $17.8 billion of held for investment mortgage loan originations and the purchase of $2.3 billion of loans as a result of exercising service or cleanup calls. We're now substantially done with our cleanup call program for pre-2008 securitizations. Junior Lien mortgage loans were down $1.3 billion from the third quarter as pay downs continue to outpace new originations.","Credit card loans increased $1.4 billion, primarily due to seasonality. Our auto portfolio continued to grow with balances up $1.1 billion from the third quarter. Originations were down 1% linked quarter on seasonality but increased 45% from a year ago, reflecting a renewed emphasis on growing auto loans following the restructuring of the business.","Turning to deposits on Page 11. Average deposit cost increased 2% from the third quarter and 4% from a year ago. Our average deposit cost of 62 basis points increase 7 basis points from year ago, reflecting promotional pricing in retail banking for new deposits earlier in the year and the mix shift to higher costs deposit -- higher cost products across our consumer and commercial businesses.","Our average deposit cost declined 9 basis points from the third quarter, reflecting lower rates in wholesale banking and WIM. We did not run any broad based retail banking marketing promotions for deposits during the fourth quarter. However, retail banking deposits increased 2 basis points due to the continued impact from previous promotional campaigns and deposit gathering strategies over the past year when interest rates were higher.","While we continue to offer our customers competitive promotional savings and CD rates within our branches, retail Banking deposit costs are expected to start to decline in the first quarter as higher promotional rates expire.","On Page 12, we provide details on period end deposits, which grew 3% from a year ago and 1% from the third quarter. Wholesale banking deposits were up $15.9 billion from the third quarter, driven by seasonality and growth in existing and new customer balances. Consumer and small business banking deposits increased $16 billion from the third quarter, driven by higher retail banking deposits, including growth and high yield savings and interest bearing checking. Wealth and investment Management deposits grew as brokerage clients' reallocation of cash into higher yielding liquid alternatives moderated during the quarter. These increases were partially offset by lower corporate treasury and mortgage escrow deposits.","Net income declined $425 million from the third quarter, primarily due to balance sheet re-pricing, driven by the impact of the lower interest rate environment. $104 million of lower hedge and effectiveness accounting results, as well as $74 million of higher MBS premium amortization costs due to higher prepayment rates. We had $445 million of MBS premium amortization in the fourth quarter. And based on the current interest rate environment, we expect MBS premium amortization to be relatively stable in the first quarter and then start to decline. Although, we expect it to be higher in full year 2020 compared with full year 2019.","As expected, net income was down 6% in 2019 compared with 2018. And we continue to expect net income to decline in the low to mid single digits in 2020. However, as always, net interest income will be influenced by a number of factors, including loan and deposit growth rates, pricing spreads, the level of interest rates and the shape of the yield curve.","Turning to Page 14. Non-interest income declined $1.7 billion from the third quarter, which included $1.1 billion gain from the sale of our institutional retirement and trust business. Let me highlight a few of the other linked quarter trends. We completed the sale of Eastdil Secured on October 1st, resulting in $362 million gain that was reflected in other non-interest income. This sale reduced commercial real estate brokerage commissions by $168 million from the third quarter.","We provide a breakout of the revenue and direct expense related to this business on Page 27 in the appendix. We're assessing all of our businesses as part of the reviews we're having since Charlie joined WellsFargo and there maybe additional pruning going forward as we assess our strategic priorities.","Mortgage Banking revenues increased $317 million from the third quarter. Servicing income was up $165 million due to a negative MSR valuation adjustment in the third quarter, reflecting higher prepayment rates. Net gains on mortgage origination increased $152 million due to $4 billion increase in Residential Held for sale mortgage loan originations, while the production margin was flat at 121 basis points.","Net gains on mortgage loan originations also increased from higher gains associated with exercising service or clean up calls in the fourth quarter. We expect mortgage originations to be lower in the first quarter due to normal seasonality. Net gains from equity securities were down $505 million from the third quarter as lower gains from our affiliated venture capital and private equity partnerships were partially offset by $240 million increase in deferred comp plan investment results, which again are largely P&L neutral.","Turning to expenses on Page 15. Our expenses were too high and becoming more efficient remains a top priority. I will explain the drivers of the linked quarter and year-over-year increases in more detail starting on Page 16. Expenses increased $415 million from the third quarter, driven by higher personnel and equipment expense. The $320 million increase in compensation and benefits was driven by $258 million of higher deferred comp plan expense. We also had higher salaries expenses, primarily due to changes in staffing mix, which was partially offset by lower FTE.","As a reminder, we will have seasonally higher personnel expenses in the first quarter, reflecting incentive compensation and employee benefits expense. Infrastructure expense increased due to higher equipment expense, driven by the strategic reassessment of technology projects in WIM. Our operating losses remained elevated but were stable linked quarter.","As we show on Page 17, expenses increased $2.3 billion from a year ago, driven by higher personnel expense and operating losses. Comp and benefits expense increased $1.1 billion, which included $691 million of higher deferred comp expense, as well as higher salaries expense, primarily due to staffing mix changes and annual salary increase. Running the business non-discretionary expense increased by $1.5 billion of higher operating losses, partially offset by lower core deposit and other intangibles amortization expense.","On the earnings call last quarter, we said we expected our 2019 expenses to be approximately $53 billion, which was at the high end of our $52 billion to $53 billion target range. As we showed on Page 18, we came in above that as fourth quarter expenses were higher than expected, primarily in three areas. First, we had higher than forecasted outside professional services expense. These expenses were primarily related to legal, technology and risk management. Second, we had higher impairments and other right downs, including the strategic reassessment of technology projects in WIM that I previously mentioned, as well as impairments on rail cars. Finally, we had higher personnel related accruals, including severance.","Turning to our business segment, starting on Page 19. Community Banking earnings declined $570 million from the third quarter, primarily driven by lower net interest income and lower net gains from equity securities. On Page 20, we provide our Community Banking metrics. We have 30.3 million digital active customers in the fourth quarter, up 4% from a year ago, including 7% growth in mobile active customers from a year ago.","Primary consumer checking customers grew 2% from a year ago, the ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Branch customer experience survey scores in December increased from a year ago, reflecting the fundamental changes we've made to improve the customer experience. The decline in branch customer experience survey scores from the third quarter was most likely due to changes in branch staffing levels.","We're pleased that the progress we've been making to improve customer satisfaction was reflected in the J.D. Power in 2019 national banking satisfaction study released in December. Our customer satisfaction scores improved by 9 points from last year study, the largest increase among our large bank peers. Improving the customer experience across Wells Fargo remains a priority. And as part of this focus, we're implementing the net promoter system to allow even more dynamic customer feedback in benchmarking. As a result of this implementation, we'll no longer be reporting branch customer experience survey scores. However, we will continue to share key business drivers that reflect the progress we're making to improve the customer experience and to drive loyalty.","Turning to Page 21. Teller and ATM transactions declined 6% from a year ago. As a result of our customers continuing to migrate to digital channels, we consolidated 174 branches in 2019. We had 5,352 branches at the end of 2019, down 12% over the past three years. We also continue to have strong card uses with linked quarter and year-over-year growth in both credit and debit card purchase volume.","Turning to Page 22. Wholesale banking earnings declined $151 million from the third quarter, driven by lower revenue. We are an industry leader in businesses that support low income housing and renewable energy investments, which both generate income tax credits. These income tax benefits do not get included in revenue. So as you can see in the table on this page, we're reporting both our consistent wholesale efficiency ratio and we're also providing our efficiency ratio adjusted for income tax credits in order to make this ratio more reflective of how we evaluate the business.","Wealth and Investment Management earnings declined $1 billion from the third quarter, which included $1.1 billion pretax gain from the sale of our institutional retirement and trust business. For the first time since the first quarter of 2017, WIM had linked quarter growth in average deposits, up 2% from the third quarter. And total client assets increased 10% from a year ago on higher market valuations, including 18% growth in retail brokerage advisory assets. Closed referred investment assets resulting from the partnership between WIM and Community Banking were up 18% in the fourth quarter compared with the year ago with December having over $1 billion in closed referrals our strongest month since June of 2017.","Turning to Page 24. We continue to have strong credit results with 32 basis points of net charge-offs in the fourth quarter. Commercial losses were 16 basis points, up 5 basis points from the third quarter, driven by lower recoveries and higher losses in lease financing, primarily related to railcars. Overall credit quality indicators in our commercial portfolio remained strong with our fourth quarter internal credit grades at their strongest levels in two years.","Consumer losses were 51 basis points, also up 5 basis points from the third quarter. Both of our consumer real estate portfolios were in a net recovery position in the fourth quarter. Our other consumer portfolios had slight increases in losses from the third quarter, primarily driven by seasonality. Both our credit card and auto portfolios had lower loss rates than a year ago.","Non-accrual loans declined $199 million from the third quarter with lower non-accruals in both the commercial and consumer portfolios. Non-accrual loans were 56 basis points of total loans in the fourth quarter, their lowest level in over 10 years. We adopted CECL on January 1st of this year and expect to recognize $1.3 billion reduction in our allowance and a corresponding increase in retained earnings.","This reduction predominantly reflects an expected $2.9 billion reduction in the allowance for commercial credit losses under CECL, reflecting shorter contractual maturities and the benign credit environment. While the allowance for consumer credit losses is expected to be $1.5 billion higher under CECL, reflecting longer or indeterminate maturities that have recoveries and collateral value predominantly related to residential mortgage loans, which have been written down significantly below current recovery value during the last credit cycle. As we've noted in prior quarters, we anticipate more volatility under CECL due to economically sensitive forecast and the impact of changes in the credit cycle.","Turning to capital on Page 25. Our CET1 ratio decreased to 11.1%, driven by returning $9 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases in the fourth quarter. Our ratio was still well above both the regulatory minimum of 9% and our current internal target of 10%. As a reminder, we used approximately 65% of the gross repurchase capacity under our most recent capital plan in the second half of 2019, so repurchases will be lower during the first two quarters of 2020.","In summary, while we had a number of significant items that impacted our fourth quarter financial results and our expenses remain too high, we continue to have positive underlying business fundamentals, including growth in loans and deposits, increased customer activity and strong credit performance. We also had high capital returns. I'm excited about the opportunities ahead as we continue to do the work necessary to transform Wells Fargo. And Charlie and I will now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of John McDonnell with Autonomous Research.","John McDonnell","Charlie, I wanted to ask you maybe for some high level takeaways on Wells Fargo's technology. Where do you see it being up to par and best-in-class and what areas do you see the technology is behind and needing more investment?","Charlie Scharf","Thanks John. It's a great question. Again, I'm certainly not in a position to be definitive across the board, given how I have been spending my time. I will say that in the time that I spent with Saul Van Beurden, who is our Head of Technology at the company, we have a really clear list of the work that we have to do, to both improve the underlying infrastructure of the institution, which will benefit our ability to grow at some point, because it really contributes to our ability to servicing all of our clients across all of our different segments, as well as we possibly can.","And so it's a robust list. There's a lot to do on it. And Saul clearly is working through with this team all the right prioritization and putting timeframes around it. At the same time, it's clear when I spent time with all of our folks that we are thinking about where we go next and how we use technology to create different experiences and we see it in terms of some of the things that we've done in the digital space on the consumer side.","And so, again, I'm not in a position to be extremely specific business-by-business of exactly where we're positioned and how we think about it. Other than it's really clear that it has been a top priority inside the company. And certainly all the business leaders understand the importance that technology will play going forward.","John McDonnell","And then I wanted to ask John Shrewsberry in terms of expenses, totally getting Charlie's point about being too early to talk about expense improvement, but when we think about the jumping off point as we put our models for 2020 expenses, John, should we think about this 53.7 adjusted expenses that you did for '19? Is that a good starting point to think about 2020 expenses? The last you kind of said you'd trying to be flat in 2020. Is that the right ballpark we should be thinking about for the adjusted number?","John Shrewsberry","So early on here while we're still going through this planning process, I wouldn't expect that much to change other than the -- some of the adjustments that we all make for deferred comp, for excess operating losses et cetera. And then we'll, as this processes ensues, we will come back with some more details.","John McDonnell","But for now we're kind of thinking flattish to that number, or that's the right ballpark to start off with?","John Shrewsberry","I would just take it period-by-period, not that much is going to change between Q4 and Q1, the same because of the shortness of the time frame. And as we get more clarity as a result of our process, we'll provide more clarity.","John McDonnell","And then just one as a quick follow up on that. In terms of the $600 million of operating losses that you talk about, it really hasn't been that in many years, it's really average. It seems like more like $2 billion a year and I know it's hard to predict. But to worry about, I was anchoring too low on that $600 million. Should we kind of budget something higher than that just as a go forward?","John Shrewsberry","It's a good point. So that we originally talked about the $600 million, it reflected the $150 million per quarter of fraud related losses and other run rate operating losses without regard for what's been elevated over the last couple of years. I do think that the $600 million has probably grown to be something a little bit more like, could be $700 million or $800 million. We'll try and give better guidance to that. But the higher run rate or the higher realized rate that we've had over the last two years reflects more of a combination of episodic things that are anticipated to be to recur at the same level.","And let me give you, just on your first question a little bit more clarity, because I'm reminded that the first quarter is the first quarter. I said this in my remarks. But there are seasonally elevated expenses in the first quarter that caused, that standout year-after-year as FICA resets, as retirement eligibility resets and a few other things that will cause that to stand out in any year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. ","Ken Usdin","Charlie, to your points about just going after all the things to put the company on the right foot forward. How do you start to assess just if the right things are happening underneath? And coming back to the point just on related expenses, you've obviously had this build over time of compliance and risk and those functions. Are we even at the point yet where the hiring is done in that regard right where you're actually -- just you've got the people in place and it's more just about execution? How do you give us a sense of just kind of where you think you are on that story arc? Thanks.","Charlie Scharf","Sure. So on the first question, I think when you're on the inside of the company and we're managing the work that has to get done the way that we are, we have clear reporting, we have clear goals, item by item by item. And so it's very, very easy for us to understand whether we're tracking to milestones and having reviewed the entire plan believe that those milestones will get us to eventual closure on issues. Quite honestly from the outside, you obviously don't have the ability to do that. That's not something that we can provide to you. So ultimately what you're going to have to look for are closure of these issues. And as time goes on that is what we hope to accomplish and that ultimately will be success as well.","On your second question about where are we I guess in terms of the build of expenses necessary to accomplish the work. Again, I would say on that one, we can\u2019t sit here today and say I can't sit here today and say that the amount that we're spending and the people that we have is totally appropriate. And by the way, don't take that to mean it's too high. It's area-by-area. We've added a lot of resources. We need to understand whether we've added the right resources, whether we have people working together as well as we possibly can, understanding things that we've built manually to understand where we can go to automate those items, which will make us not only just far more efficient but far more effective.","And so again, when I say it's really too early to be definitive about where we think about the level of expenses and what's appropriate, I put this into the same bucket. But again, I just want to be really clear about this. We don't sit here and believe that we have carte blanche to spend whatever we possibly want on any issue. We are going to spend what's necessary on these historical issues. And you should assume that we will be extremely vigilant about ensuring that we're not only thinking about our future but thinking about our shareholders in terms of where it all nets out ultimately.","Ken Usdin","And just one follow up on your point that couple months in, you said you're going to look at like 10 business lines and just see where we should think about things from a bottom up. From what you at least see now, is the company what it needs to look like going forward, the company has been trimming out of some areas over the course of time? Do you think that all the businesses the company has today deserve to be inside the company from a go forward basis? Thanks.","Charlie Scharf","I would say, as far as the big pieces of the company, absolutely. When we look at the benefits that our clients get from having the combination of consumer businesses, wealth businesses and wholesale businesses under one roof are significant today. And as we look to the future, we believe they should be even more significant. And so at that level, I would say, absolutely.","As John did mentioned in his remarks we have been pruning. And as we go through these reviews and talk about some of the smaller things that we do, it is a good opportunity to ask do we need to continue to do all of these things, will they make a difference first to our clients and ultimately to us. And so I would expect to have some things come out of that. But I put them in the category of pruning at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","I wanted to follow up on the line of questioning, Ken just had Charlie. So it sounds like as we think about what you mentioned during your prepared remarks as you focus on remediation and investment, it sounds like you are also -- there is also room to focus on inefficiencies at the same time. In particular, a lot of your investors are pointing out that your headcount hasn't moved much over the past 10 years and your head count is similar to another peer that is producing about $40 billion more in revenue than you. So just want to -- I know that sounded more like a statement. But the question really is, is there room to also address some of the efficiencies as you think about remediation and investment?","Charlie Scharf","I think, again, want I want to make sure that I was been clear about is that I think that we have -- we want to be able to think with this clean sheet as possible about how we should be spending our money. And so that goes to asking the question, are we spending appropriately on the historical issues and that number will be whatever we think it should be. Absolutely, we will focus on efficiency. And I want to give -- I haven't said this in my remarks, but it is important. It's not as if it's not something the company is focused on.","And so when we look at all the additional resources that have been added to support these activities, it's very difficult for you all to see what we have gained in terms of efficiency, because you should just assume that our expenses would be substantially higher if we hadn't been generating efficiencies in the rest of the company over last several years.","But having said that with fresh eyes, I get to show up and take a look and ask a whole series of questions as do some of the other new folks that have come in. And there are still big parts of the company where we are extraordinarily inefficient. And to be fair, it's not just my eyes and the new folks' eyes, but it's what the existing management team talks about as well. So we do believe there is significant opportunity.","And while the first priority is fixing the issues of the past, we should be able to continue to work towards both. And I do want to throw on the last category which is important, which is we are thinking about the future. And while time and conscious are weighted more times the past -- are weighted towards the past, we're not ignoring the future. And so we do see there are opportunities, which are meaningful we want to have the latitude to think about how we can spend wisely on that.","And so that's why were just being very, very careful about leading you to a specific number, because we're not sure where that all nets itself out and we want the time to be thoughtful about how to put it all together in a way that we certainly believe is the right long-term thing for the company. Again, very conscious of the fact that we're stewards of the company and their owners out there and other stakeholders that we have to answer to.","Erika Najarian","And my second question is as you mentioned that you will be announcing a new org structure shortly. Does that include the hires that you highlighted during your prepared remarks or could we anticipate more changes to the operating committee from here?","Charlie Scharf","I think what I said is what I said, which is Avid is retiring. She is responsible for a whole series of things from deposits to treasury services, to card, to innovation, digital marketing, a very, very wide range of things and we're actively working through what the right way to structure the company is with her retirement. And when we've completed that, we will certainly make sure that you all know about what it looks like.","Erika Najarian","And just if I could squeeze in the third question, I hear you loud and clear that the closure of the issues is one way your investors and other stakeholders can measure progress at the company. As we think about the end of the year, what other measures of progress would you suggest your current and prospective shareholders could use to measure progress? Or is one year simply too short of the time given the transformation that you believe the company will go through?","Charlie Scharf","I guess, let me say a couple of words and John could add anything that he'd like. Again, I think it's important, we have a lot going on and I have been here for a short time. And so we feel extremely optimistic about that medium and long-term, but we have a lot to figure out. And as I pointed out, some of it takes months and some of it will take a little bit longer than that. So I think answering the question of what that all looks like by the end of the year at this point is even premature. But just know that we're focus on outcomes here.","John Shrewsberry","I think we will be talking about realized results and what drove them over the course of the year, including closure of issues to the extent that those are public items and then how we set ourselves up in our stakeholders up for what comes next. So as this process goes on and concludes and we have a better line of sight on what happens end of year next year, et cetera then we will begin to share that that will be progress.","Charlie Scharf","And I just don't want to dwell on it, but I just want to be clear. I'm not suggesting year that any of these public issues will be closed this year. What I'm suggesting is that we are going to do all the work that's required. The timeframes will be driven by when we accomplish that work and when the regulators are satisfied by it. As I said, there is a great deal of it. Some have a certain level of complexity to them and we're focused on the work at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.","Brian Kleinhanzl","So another question on the regulatory side, I think one of the things regulators always had said is they wanted to see a change in the culture at the bank as the sign that things are improving. I mean, is that still an outstanding item that needs to be addressed, or has it been addressed already?","Charlie Scharf","Well, I think you know addressed some of this in my remarks that were prepared. And I think as an outsider coming in, I do have the opportunity to make some observations of some of the things that we do versus some of the things that I've seen that could help to make the company successful, going through issues that are somewhat like this. And so, I do think that these changes that I spoke about are important to helping us be more successful at closing these issues in a way that has eluded us at this point.","Brian Kleinhanzl","And then second question just on the numbers themselves. I mean, if you look at, John, maybe on the commercial loans, you've seen decent growth now or I guess there's some growth year-over-year. And that portfolio looks, but pieces of that are coming from the non-U.S. also coming from this credit investment portfolio. Can you guys give us an update on the C&I lending side of it, what's this growth in the non-U.S., where is that coming from? And then how do you see these loan CLOs? Is that -- and what's the total of CLO exposure at this time?","Charlie Scharf","So on the second part first, the total CLO exposure is about $38 billion, I think at this point, which hasn't changed much. This approach of investing in them in loan form is really just more accounting friendly approach it's the same risk reward otherwise. And so we've made the shift for part of our incremental investments. Still an asset class that we feel comfortable with the risk reward in, in spite of where we are in the cycle and for other reasons.","The bulk of the C&I loan growth overall did come from commercial or corporate investment banking related activity. So some of it's in the asset backed finance area things like CLOs and then also with major corporate customers, but on probably not permanent funding, its things -- we'll fund at activity or strategic activity that ultimately would likely get taken out in the capital market subsequently. So it's not so much coming from the funded term loan segment of Commercial Banking, for example. And I wouldn't agree too much with the growth in non-U.S. loans that will ebb and flow a little bit, but it's not likely to be a big driver of loan growth one way or the other in the foreseeable future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.","Marty Mosby","John, I want to ask you first, this $1.5 billion is a big number for this particular quarter. You've been addressing these issues. You can't talk specifically. But generally, was there some event what was the catalyst for all of sudden recognizing another significant or meaningful slug of onetime extraordinary costs?","John Shrewsberry","Sure, I mean I can't talk too much about specific active litigation. But in general, these amounts get recorded when the items become both probable and estimable. So we've had elevated cost in this area for the last two quarters as a result of greater estimability of what outcomes might be.","Marty Mosby","And then, Charlie, when you're coming over now and your statement that you went through initially kind of forwardly said we haven't addressed, or Wells Fargo hasn't addressed these issues at the pace or in the way that they should have in order to make the progress. How do you look at assessing where some of these things went wrong? I mean, again just generally and maybe not specifically. But you would have thought over these years there would have been a lot of attention and a lot of progress, and it just doesn't seem like that's been the case. So your assessment of it seems pretty critical. So I was just trying to figure out how to put some context around that?","Charlie Scharf","I guess the way I would -- the way to think about it is that I have the opportunity to come in and look at where we are, my judgments are based upon where we actually are. I haven't -- I don't think there's a whole lot of value in terms of when I have to figure out how to spend my time in going back and figuring out if I was here what I might have done differently. I'm not sure I would have done anything necessarily differently. I wasn't in the seat. I don't know what the priorities were. I don't know what else was going on. That is a very, very difficult thing to do and generally something that's very, very unfair to do.","So again, I think what's relevant is that I've been able to come in with this fresh set of eyes, believe that we have an opportunity to manage these blocks of work differently with both a different set of processes, some different people and a great deal of my time and attention, as well as the rest of the senior management team. And based upon the experience that I've had in executing operational things, as well as the other members of the team that we have in place now and understanding the work that we have to do, I do feel confident that we can get it done and that's been my focus.","Marty Mosby","And I guess maybe a different way to think about it is when you've seen these things happened in the past. Would you counted as that maybe there is a new standard in which Wells Fargo is going to be held accountable to kind of develop toward in order to set the new standard for the industry? So in other words when the regulators get in on a bank, they've been really begin to kind of figure out where they want everybody else to kind of head to. So it's not like you just catching up with everybody else, maybe there's surpassing and creating a more forward kind of model that they're wanting to get to. So I didn't know is that or that part of it as well, or is this just still catching up with everybody else?","Charlie Scharf","I think I've got a lot to do to speak on behalf of Wells Fargo. And so it certainly wouldn't be right of me to speak for regulators. But I do think that we have the opportunity to raise the standard by which we view the importance of the work, the manner in which we go about doing it and the way we hold each other accountable for getting it done. And so again that is my focus.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS.","Saul Martinez","Speaking of things you need to do to get closure on some of these issues. I think in the past, you've talked about close to 10,000 processes. I think John mentioned high single digit thousands of processes where you're identifying individual risk controls and where needed remediating those risk and control functions. Can you just give us a sense of where you are in that process? What kind of progress you've made more recently? And I guess importantly, how is your relationship with your regulators evolving as you kind of go through this and work through a lot of these individual processes?","Charlie Scharf","On the first part, so not all 9,000 plus processes are created equally. They're risk scored and\/or importance scored for their impact. And we're ahead of where we anticipated being by the end of the year. I don't have the exact number in front of me. But of those that are most impactful, they will have been, as we've described, mapped risk ID'd, control ID'd, controls developed where controls didn't previously exist, testing over those controls put in place in the first half, by the end of the first half of this year, that's how that looks right now. And I think it's to the satisfaction of people who are watching us do it.","Saul Martinez","And so it feels like you're making good progress on the major -- on the more significant processes. So just changing gears a little bit, you took I think $166 million charge for reassessing technology projects in Wealth and Investment Management. Can you just give a sense of what drove that decision and whether we should be thinking that there could be other IT projects with that you're looking at reassessing and cutting going forward?","Charlie Scharf","So Jon Weiss has substantially reconstituted the leadership team in WIM. And they've set their strategic priorities and direction, and they are different than what had been under development in terms of the technology to support different parts of the business over the past few years, which is what resulted in the impairment to capitalize software development costs.","I wouldn't anticipate seeing a lot more of that. And to be honest, we don't have an extraordinary amount of capitalized software development costs, so the risk isn't that great from an accounting perspective.","Saul Martinez","If I could just squeeze one more quick one in, John, just on fees, the core fee lines, time deposit, trust card, mortgages. In general, it seems like the momentum has improved a bit in recent quarters. But can you just give us a sense -- and I'm not asking for specific guidance. But can you just talk directionally about whether there is any reason to think you can't grow from fourth quarter levels. Obviously, recognizing there's seasonality in a lot of these businesses. But is this -- are these like good core run rates to use and do you feel good about your ability to grow some of these line items?","John Shrewsberry","The trust and investment fees should step off at a high level, because they price off of the opening deck, which for the S&P looks good for the coming quarter, that leverage it creates cyclicality that works for us and against us. Mortgage, as we said, is probably going to be a lighter quarter in the first quarter just because of seasonality. It was stronger in the fourth quarter than it would have seasonally been expect it to be. But the pipeline suggests that it will be somewhat smaller on the origination side in the first quarter.","Card fees tick up because there's more consumer spending going on in the fourth quarter. So I'd expect that to be more seasonally appropriate in the first quarter. And then, it's hard to forecast trading activity, it certainly was stronger year-over-year in the fourth quarter because of the blood bath in the fourth quarter of 2018, but it was weaker third quarter to fourth quarter in 2019.","And historically, the first quarter is a stronger quarter as a result of asset managers reallocating and people getting invested in the first quarter. So we'll see what happens there and that is tougher to predict, but those are the types of things that are likely to implement, things that are a little bit more ratable like deposit service charges or loan fees, etc., I don't think it would be much change from quarter-to-quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","John, can you share with us, I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you expected the net interest income to be down low to mid-single digits for 2020 over 2019. Can you compare for us, what's the driver of that vis-a-vis what drove the decline in 2019. Is it more having less higher yielding assets like to Pick-a-Pay loans on the books in 2020 or is it a margin compression issue, can you give us some color there?","Charlie Scharf","So it's a handful of things. There was a bigger drop in 2019 because of I would say that, the original uptick in the premium amortization on the MBS portfolio that in, I'm not giving this to you in order of priority, but just in terms of inputs. The big leg down in LIBOR obviously had a big impact in 2019 that's expected to be a little flatter at this point as we're looking into 2020. We talked about retail deposits, pardon me, retail deposit pricing and how as rates were increasing we had put in place some promotions that have a little bit of a tail to them, that tail was fully in place during 2019 and will abate during 2020, all of those things. And it's -- but its rates right, they dropped in 2019, at least at the front end expect it to be relatively flattish in 2020.","Just one quick, the number of variables and the range of potential outcomes around those variables that goes into giving the low to mid-single digits is a lot can move, as we've talked about. We were, I think we were quite close on our estimation for 2019, but we'll keep you updated as we roll along in 2020, what is looking like based on what changes. You mentioned Pick-a-Pay. I guess I should also point out that, that was on a full year basis, it's probably $400 million worth of interest income coming off of the sold Pick-a-Pay loans that's worthy of mentioned that we don't have this year.","Gerard Cassidy","Could you also share with us, you pointed out that you grew the primary consumer checking account deposits 2% year-over-year, what are you using as the hook to get customers to come in. Is there some incentives, whether it's a higher upfront cash deposit or that you give them or is there gifts or how are you guys driving that growth?","John Shrewsberry","So that metric is the number of accounts, not the deposits associated with the accounts which we've talked about separately. It's the branch network. It's the digital acquisition, the combination of those two things. I wouldn't say that it's specifically, there's nothing that's compelling people the offers that we use are more around dollars for additional -- capturing additional deposits from customers. But these account openings reflect the sort of everyday business model of Community Banking both in the branches and through digital activity.","Gerard Cassidy","And then just real quickly, you mentioned lower gains in the quarter from your venture capital private equity area. What's left in unrealized gains in those two categories for you folks?","John Shrewsberry","So unrealized gains are harder to come by these days, because we tend to realize them on a faster basis since the accounting change. I guess, now a year and a half ago, but it used to be the case that we'd have to actually realize something to recognize the benefit something have to be sold or go public in order for us to take a gain and these days even with private companies doing subsequent private capital raises.","If I set a higher level of valuation, we recognize the gain from that as it goes along and so when the ultimate realization occurs that there is less of a pop because we've ratcheted up we've taken gains along the way. So that's led to more of a, call it, front-end loading over the last several quarters of benefit from that portfolio and it will increase the volatility if people have down capital raise rounds or things don't go as well when companies are actually sold or taken public. So it's been a great business, the returns are solid. But the accounting change has caused being revenue recognition to be a little bit more choppy. Although in the early quarters, it's actually been very strong.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler.","Scott Siefers","I was hoping to try to drill down into the cost side once again. I guess if you're looking at an uptick in core expenses in the first quarter, it implies a pretty substantial downdraft through the remainder of the year just to keep us in the ballpark of this year's adjusted $53.7 billion. I mean did the plan, indeed, call for such an absolute improvement in costs and what sort of the path to get there, especially at a time when there is so much discussion on investments, just curious to your thoughts there.","John Shrewsberry","So we're not going to be that specific about the year as a whole. My comment earlier about the first quarter is like every first quarter, it tends to be the high tech for expenses because of the way personnel costs have first quarter uptick. And so, like any other year on an adjusted basis, you'd expect them to be higher in the first quarter and gravitate down over the course of the year, as Charlie mentioned, we're going through a second look at our planning process for the year. And so there is no fixed number at this point to.","Since we are in the first quarter -- since this happens every first quarter, I'm calling out the fact that those personnel costs will be higher, there won't be much more specificity around that until we've completed this process and made some conclusions, made some choices and come back and update people later in the year.","Scott Siefers","So even though I guess, the $53.7 billion is a sort of place to start -- it's not -- we shouldn't anticipate any sort of a flat trend or anything. It's basically TBD completely on what the expectations for the full year, is that correct?","John Shrewsberry","I think that's appropriate, so that we don't mislead you. Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Just wanted to understand on the planning process that Charlie announced at the beginning, I know Charlie, you're not talking about time frames. But you've seen a lot of different types of institutions and a lot of different types of scenarios, and I'm wondering is this something that we should consider is, I get to best in class on a three to five-year time frame, or is this more of a one to three, just trying to understand broad strokes your thought process there?","Charlie Scharf","I wish I could answer the question at this point, but for all the reasons that I've spoken about, I'm not in a position to do that. I don't want to be repetitive, so I apologize, but we've got to do the work to understand whether we're appropriately resourced against the historical activities. And then honestly, as we go through these discussions in terms of how you get to best-in-class.","I'm sure business-by-business will be very, very different in terms of what the time frame is. Some of them will be structural. Some of them will require some significant technology investment. Others could be burdened by just inefficiencies that we can get to quicker. So I'm not trying to be evasive. I can see there being several different answers when we look at different parts of the Company. It's what it will actually look like when we're done with the work.","Betsy Graseck","And does the work potentially have a result of exiting some of the businesses or do you think that that's really not on the table at this stage?","Charlie Scharf","Well, I think I'll repeat what I said before, Betsy, I think that when you look at our big business segments, there is tremendous sense because of the benefits our customers and clients get from them being under one roof. But like any other company, we should sit and ask the question, do we need to be doing absolutely everything and we have been pruning along the way. And there's probably still some more pruning that we should probably do.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.","Steven Chubak","So John, I was hoping to drill into some of the fee trends that you had spoken to in response to an earlier question, certainly appreciate the detail you guys gave in Slide 27, helping us isolate some of the impacts from gains and other related sale impacts. As we think about trying to evaluate the core fee income generation power just of the franchise today, after adjusting for some of these sales. If I look at that $8.7 billion you guys produced this quarter, I adjust for about $600 million that you guys cited in the slide. And then on top of that adjust for deferred comp other investment income adjustments, we get to a run rate of roughly $8 billion a quarter in core fee income generation. I know you're going to have equity market tailwinds just from what happened in the fourth quarter as we enter the year in 2020, but I'm just hoping if you could frame whether that $32 billion annualized run rate is a reasonable jumping-off point after adjusting for some of those factors or anything else that you would cite for that matter?","John Shrewsberry","Well, so it's not unreasonable in the sense that it captures the seasonal volatility of some of these things that tend to ebb and flow throughout the course of the year and if we've adjusted out things that we've sold in both from a gain perspective as well as the run rate perspective and it captures that where we do have elements as you'll note that ebb and flow relatively meaningfully from not just from quarter-to-quarter but from year-to-year. And so we have had equity market tailwinds as you mentioned that we might continue to but that will come and go.","I think sort of tend to look at a slightly longer time horizon on some of those line items and think about what the average has been over five quarters or so since we reported in five quarters, it's easy enough to. There's nothing unreasonable about that approach. There are some of these that we believe that even while we're doing our work we should be driving and growing and then some that will reflect the cycle of the market that we're in mortgage comes to mind in terms of where we are in the rate cycle and things like that.","Steven Chubak","And just one more follow-up for me, I just wanted to clarify some of your capital guidance. So I know that the last update that I can recall and I'm sorry if this is wrong or misguided you alluded to attending 10.25% to 10.5% CET1 target that you guys were managing to that always felt quite conservative. And in the earnings release, you actually referred to an internal target of 10%. I'm just wondering as we think about future buybacks in capital return plans. Has there been any change in the firm's internal capital targets that you guys are ultimately managing to or how are you guys trying to think about that as you start to implement some of these changes that Charlie was speaking to earlier?","John Shrewsberry","What we've been waiting for specifically our internal guideline is 10% and that includes the buffer on top of the 9% regulatory requirement. We've been talking about something that could be 10.25% to 10.5% waiting for what CECL looks like in stress and what the stress capital buffer guidelines actually look like once they are implemented and it's a belief certainly because we are getting more CCAR clarity over the coming weeks that will start to know whether we're going to know the hit through to that this year. And then it's likely that the combination of those two things leads us to a slightly higher level could be conservative, but we'll know for sure once we are operating in the stress capital buffer world.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matt O'Connor","I'm sure you're a little tired of all expense questions kind of near term. I do want to ask though longer term on costs. Charlie, you said about being best-in-class efficiency and I guess, just how do you define that and I think a lot of investors and analysts think of your direct peers is being like Bank of America, JPMorgan, maybe U.S. Bank as well, but are you kind of being literal like your efficiency ratio, it should be in the ballpark or better than theirs. And if it is, it's just a -- it's a bold comment given where you are coming from and obviously reflects, I assume optimism on both cost and revenue, but maybe you could just elaborate on some of those themes. Thank you.","John Shrewsberry","We're going business by business and selecting the peer group that best represents either the products or the segments that had established what best-in-class looks like. So it could be the component pieces of our larger peers. It could be the component pieces of regional banks and it could be the component on what the business is.","And then for the Company as a whole, the weighted average -- the mix adjusted average of what those inputs are results in the outcome. That's part of this review process that Charlie had alluded to earlier, and it's definitely aspirational as we sit here today, but that is the direction that we are setting for ourselves as Charlie mentioned for every business that we're likely to be in over the long term. We've got all of the benefits of scale working for us. It's very mature in most of them and we should -- there may be specific reasons and we will address them if we find them why we can't compete effectively with the most efficient, but that's what we're setting our sights for.","Matt O'Connor","And then without putting any specific numbers around it like as you think about improving efficiency, there are comments as it could be both kind of revenue and expenses, should we think about it being somewhat balanced or the vast majority coming from expenses or too early to know right now?","John Shrewsberry","Too early to know. We know there's work to do on expenses, but it's too early to start attributing percentage driver for example.","Charlie Scharf","Matt, it's Charlie. Let me just add one thing because I do think it's important. This isn't something that I would say that John and I sit here in a room and believe and then we get in a room with others and they argue with us. There is a clear understanding from our business leaders that this opportunity exists. And I would say quite frankly, there is very little conversation internally about the need to use revenue to improve the efficiency rate because we do understand that there are series of things that we do that are highly inefficient. That's not to say to get the best-in-class that we won't need some revenue growth to get there, but I just find it very encouraging the way people internally are thinking about it and what they're talking about as the types of things that'll be in the line of sight.","Operator","Your final question will come from the line of John Pancari with Evercore.","John Pancari","On the spread income guidance of down low to mid-single digits, I know you reiterated that, but you also indicated that you are still pruning. Does that guidance factor-in the pruning and accordingly any additional adjustments to your business base would not be all that meaningful to impact that guidance or would that guidance change if you did continue to prune?","John Shrewsberry","If we continue to prune in ways that caused us to shed either loans or deposits then we would adjust the guidance. It contemplates the company as it exists today.","John Pancari","And then in terms of CECL day two impact. I just want to get your thoughts on the appetite to lend in certain longer duration consumer areas. Has that been impacted at all by the implications of the new methodology?","John Shrewsberry","We've done the work product-by-product to consider what the return characteristics are. And at this point, it's not likely that we change our appetite for longer duration consumer loans, it's depending on where you are in the cycle, it can cause you to think differently about what your returns are, but it hasn't closed anything to drop below a hurdle level that says to us, we need to either meaningfully reprice it or where we think whether we're there in the business.","John Pancari","And then lastly, just back to the expense expectations. Again, I know it's too early to give a more accurate expense expectation, but I know you're going through your planning process, so what's the timing, when should we think we will get a more precise expectation when it comes to full year expenses, Charlie?","Charlie Scharf","I guess there is nothing more that I can say that I haven't already said. I think what I've said is that we've got this process to go through. There is a lot to do and when we know something we'll tell you. I wish I could be more specific, I really do, but we have a lot to do to get to but we think the right answer should be.","John Pancari","Got it. Okay. Thanks.","Charlie Scharf","All right. Listen, thank you very much for your patience and joining us this morning. I do hope that you just walk away with just a couple of important thoughts. We have work to do. It's clear what we have to do. We're committed to getting it done, and we will get it done. The quality of the franchise is still extraordinary. We have thousands and thousands of dedicated people across the Company that can come in every day to serve their clients. They are doing an extraordinary job, and we're going to do our part to help them do their job even better as time goes on, and we think our future is very bright. And so, we appreciate, again, the patients that you have and look forward to have more conversations in the future.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)","I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Rowe, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Rowe, you may begin your conference.","Jim Rowe","Thank you, Regina, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today during which our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf; and our CFO, Tim Sloan, will review third quarter results and answer your questions.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our third quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I\u2019d also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today\u2019s call that are subject to risks and uncertainties.","Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings; including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release, and in the quarterly supplement available on our website.","I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf.","John G. Stumpf","Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Our results in the third quarter demonstrated the underlying strength of our diversified business model and our ability to earn more of our customers\u2019 business, driving outstanding performance throughout our franchise.","Let me quickly review some of the highlights of the quarter. We achieved record net income up 22% from a year ago and EPS was also up 22%. Revenue grew 8% and pre-tax pre-provision profit increased 14% from a year ago. Our core loan portfolio grew 6% and core deposits were also up 6% from a year ago.","We had positive operating leverage and our efficiency ratio improved by 240 basis points from year ago. We had continued strong underlying credit performance. Our profitability ratios reflected these strong results with a return on assets growing to 1.45%, up 19 basis points from year-ago, the highest it\u2019s been in five years. Our return on equity increased to 13.38%, up 152 basis points from a year-ago.","Our estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio under Basel III reached 8.02% as we continue to have strong capital growth while remaining focus on returning more capital to our shareholders. This strong performance during a period of slow and uneven economic growth was driven by momentum across Wells Fargo\u2019s diversified businesses.","We have a broad set of products that enables us to meet all of our customers\u2019 financial needs, which is reflected by our record retail banking cross-sell this quarter of 6.04 products per household. In the current low rate environment, our mortgage business continued to benefit from the strong refi and purchase volume. And credit quality reflected an improving housing market.","Our credit card business is successfully generating new account growth, up 46% from a year-ago, and we are focused on increasing customer card usage, which is generating strong balance and fee growth. We\u2019ve grown managed account assets in our retail brokerage business over 25% in the past 12 months driven by strong net flows and market performance.","Our wholesale banking business continues to meet the financial needs of our commercial customers generating nine consecutive quarters of loan growth from our middle market customers. We are also meeting the lending needs of our small business customers with $11.4 billion of new loan commitments so far this year, up approximately 30% from a year ago. These are just a few examples of the momentum we have throughout our businesses as we remain focused on better serving our customers, while we continue to be diligent in managing our costs and risks.","Our ability to meet a broadly diversified set of customer needs throughout a variety of economic cycles is a clear Wells Fargo advantage, and contributed to another strong quarter for our company.","Tim Sloan, our Chief Financial Officer, will now provide more details on our financial results. Tim?","Timothy J. Sloan","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. My remarks will follow the presentation included in the first half of our quarterly supplement starting on Page 2, and then John and I will take your questions.","As John highlighted, we had a very strong quarter, with record earnings of $4.9 billion, up 7% from the second quarter. Earnings per share were a record $0.88, up 7% from last quarter, our 11th consecutive quarter of EPS growth and the 6th consecutive quarter of record EPS.","Our ability to consistently generate earnings growth reflects the benefit of our diversified business model. We are balanced between fee and spread income, and our sources of fee generation are also very diversified.","As John highlighted, we had many businesses serving our commercial and consumer customers that had strong growth this quarter, and I\u2019ll provide more examples throughout my comments today.","I\u2019m going to highlight some of the key drivers of our results this quarter starting on Page 4, and then I\u2019ll discuss them in more detail later in my remarks.","We had strong balance sheet growth in the quarter. We grew both our total and core loan portfolios with growth in commercial and consumer portfolios. We once again had strong deposit growth with balances up $23 billion.","Turning to credit, we continue to have strong underlying credit performance this quarter. However, our reported results were affected by regulatory guidance issued to the industry by the OCC. The guidance covers consumer loans that are current or less than 60 days delinquent, where the borrower has declared bankruptcy.","The implementation of this guidance resulted in a $1.4 billion reclassification of performing consumer loans to non-accrual and a $567 million in net charge-offs, which was fully covered by our loan loss reserves. Absent this change, credit performance continued to improve, which I\u2019ll also highlight later on the call.","Turning to the income statement, net interest income was down as our net interest margin declined as expected from the second quarter. We had strong non-interest income growth across a number of our businesses this quarter, and we remain focused on reducing expenses, and we generated positive operating leverage.","Let me now cover our business drivers in more detail. As shown on page six, period-end loans were up $7.4 billion in the second quarter, with growth across a number of commercial and consumer portfolios. The liquidating portfolio declined by $4.5 billion, and our core loan portfolio grew by $11.9 billion. We\u2019ve now grown our core portfolio for eight consecutive quarters.","Commercial loans declined $1.5 billion as growth in C&I and real estate construction loans was offset by declines in our real estate mortgage loans, leases, and foreign portfolios. Consumer loans increased by $8.9 billion, with growth in first mortgage, auto, credit card, and private student lending.","The growth in our first mortgage portfolio was due to our decision to retain $9.8 billion of new conforming fixed rate production, with most of this coming later in the quarter. While retaining these mortgage loans on our balance sheet reduced mortgage revenue this quarter, we expect to generate spread income in future quarters for mortgage loans with higher yields than mortgage-backed securities we could have purchased in the market. We are in a unique position to have a large enough mortgage business and strong capital to be able to make these choices that should benefit long-term results.","We currently expect to retain additional conforming mortgages in the fourth quarter. Average loan balances increased $8.5 billion from the second quarter, benefiting from the strong consumer loan growth in the late second quarter close of the WestLB portfolio.","Deposit growth remained strong this quarter with average deposits up $22.5 billion from the second quarter and up $63.9 billion, or 7% from a year ago. Average core checking and savings deposits were up 9% from a year ago and were 94% of average core deposits.","We continue to benefit from lower deposit costs with average deposit costs of 18 basis points in the third quarter, down one basis point from the second quarter and down seven basis points from a year ago. We\u2019ve successfully grown deposits, while reducing our deposit costs for eight consecutive quarters.","Tax equivalent net interest income declined $393 million from the second quarter. average earning assets grew $26.3 billion linked-quarter with growth in short-term investments and mortgages held for sale. as we expected, the NIM was under pressure this quarter.","The 25 basis point decline in the net interest margin was driven by three primary factors. First, variable income declined from strong second quarter levels, which accounted for 10 basis points of the linked-quarter decline in the net interest margin. second, approximately eight basis points of the margin pressure was driven by continued balance sheet repricing, as higher yielding earning assets ran off, and we were cautious in our reinvestment activity focusing on shorter duration securities.","Specifically, six basis points of the decline was from our available-for-sale portfolio and two basis points of the decline was from the loan portfolio. Third, the remaining seven basis points was driven by strong deposit growth we had in the quarter and invested in short-term investments in Fed funds sold.","As we\u2019ve highlighted for the past year or so, we expect continued pressure on the net interest margin, given the slow rate environment. however, we don\u2019t believe, the net interest margin decline we had this quarter is representative of what we\u2019ll see in the future.","Noninterest income increased $299 million from the second quarter, up 3%. growth was broad-based and included a 6% increase in deposit service charges, which was driven by product and pricing changes that we have now rolled out throughout our geographies. Trust and investment fees grew $56 million, or 2% from the second quarter, reflecting strong asset-based fees in retail, brokerage, and asset management, as well as higher retail brokerage transaction volume.","Credit card fees increased 6% from the second quarter, driven by new account growth and higher volumes, including a 5% increase in credit card transactions. Trading gains were up $266 million with $153 million of higher deferred compensation plan investment income, which was offset in employee benefit expense and stronger customer accommodation trading results.","Mortgage banking revenue declined $86 million from the second quarter, driven by lower servicing income. The decline in servicing income was primarily due to a $350 million reduction in our MSR valuation for updating servicing and foreclosure costs. the ratio of MSRs to related loan service for others was ahead a historical low 63 basis points.","Mortgage gain on sale revenue was up $396 million from the second quarter, despite approximately $200 million in forgone revenue from retaining conforming mortgage loans, which I mentioned earlier.","Third quarter results included a $462 million provision for mortgage repurchase losses, which was $207 million lower than the second quarter. Mortgage originations were $139 billion in the third quarter, up $8 billion from the second quarter and up $50 billion from a year-ago. 14% of our origination volume this quarter was from HARP. The unclosed mortgage pipeline at quarter end was $97 billion, down from last quarter, but still very strong and volume during the first few weeks of October has accelerated as rates reached new lows.","Turning to expenses, we continue to make progress in reducing costs. Non-interest expenses were down $285 million from the second quarter. This decline includes lower personnel expenses from lower severance costs. Operating losses were down $243 million on lower litigation accruals. Our litigation reserves consider all litigation matters we are aware off including the recently announced FHA lawsuit.","Insurance expenses declined $132 million due to seasonally lower insurance commissions. Our efficiency ratio continued to improve down to 57.1%, the lowest level in 10 quarters, and within our target range of 55% to 59%. We expect to be within this range in the fourth quarter. While we are pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made, we remain focused on managing the expenses even as we continue to benefit from strong revenue opportunities throughout our businesses.","Turning to our segment results starting on page 11; community banking earned $2.7 billion in the third quarter, up 8% from the second quarter. Retail banking achieved a record cross-sell of 6.0 products per household, up from 5.9 a year-ago. Cross-sell in the West grew to 6.4 and reached 5.56 in the East. We continue to have strong partner referrals including such products as insurance, mortgage, and student lending, which were up more than 30% from a year ago. To support future growth, we consistently have invested throughout our franchise. For example, we increased platform banker FTEs in East by more than 500, or 5% from the second quarter.","Wholesale Banking earned record net income of $2 billion in the third quarter, up 6% from the second quarter. The results this quarter reflects strong fee income, solid loan growth or expenses and improved credit quality. Credit losses in Wholesale Banking were just eight basis points this quarter, reflecting higher recoveries and improved performance.","We had strong results across a number of our wholesale businesses. Let me give you a few examples. Within our CMBS capital markets business, we increased our market share from 8% in the second quarter to 15% in the third quarter as we securitize more of our home loans and also better met the securitization needs of our customers. Our asset management business grew assets under management by 3% from the second quarter and Wholesale Banking\u2019s cross-sell increased to 6.7, up from 6.5 at year-end 2011.","Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement earned $338 million, down 1% from the second quarter, reflecting lower net interest income partially offset by higher brokerage transaction and asset-based revenue, and lower net charge-offs. WBR client assets were up 4% from the second quarter, including strong growth in average core deposits up 2% and retail brokerage managed asset accounts up 7% driven by strong net flows and market performance. Our continued focus on meeting our customers\u2019 financial needs is reflected in achieving a record cross-sell ratio of 10.27 products for WBR household, driven by growth in retail banking products.","Turning to credit quality, as I highlighted at the beginning of my remarks, our reported credit metrics were impacted by the implementation of the OCC industry guidance related to bankruptcies. Page 14 highlights that our underlying credit trends adjusted for this impact continued to improve.","Let me review our trends adjusted for this impact. Net charge-offs declined $409 million from the second quarter, and were 92 basis points of average loans. Provision expense was $1.6 billion in the third quarter, down $209 million from the second quarter reflecting better credit performance. Absent significant deterioration in the economy, we continue to expect future reserve releases.","Another sign of improving underlying credit trends was a $4.3 billion addition to the accretable yield balance primarily from our Pick-a-Pay portfolio. $3.6 billion was due to an increase in expected cash flows that did not affect the non-accretable difference and $687 million of the increase was a re-classification from non-accretable difference to accretable yield.","These increases reflect an improved housing market forecast and credit outlook, and will be recognized through net interest income over the expected life of these loans, which increased to approximately 13 years for our Pick-a-Pay portfolio.","Non-performing assets were down $1.1 billion from the second quarter, and were 3.04% of total loans. Loans 90 days or more past due increased $132 million from the second quarter reflecting normal seasonality in consumer loans, but were down $437 million from a year ago. Early stage consumer loan delinquency balances and rates also increased from the second quarter due to seasonality, but were significantly better than a year ago.","Page 17 is just a reminder of the quality of our mortgage servicing portfolio with over 70% of the portfolios being with the agencies. The quality of our portfolio is demonstrated by the low delinquency and foreclosure rate on our servicing portfolio, which was over 400 basis points lower than the industry average, excluding Wells Fargo, based on the most recently publicly available data. Our total delinquency and foreclosure rate was 7.32% in the third quarter, down from 7.63% a year ago and a peak of 8.96% in the fourth quarter of 2009.","We added $462 million to our repurchase reserve this quarter, down $207 million from the second quarter. Our repurchase reserve considers both outstanding reserves and also our future expectations for demands. Our repurchase reserve balance increased $269 million from the last quarter, reflecting $156 million of lower losses.","New demands from GSCs were actually down in the third quarter; however, our outstanding repurchase demands were up from the second quarter. This increase reflects higher non-agency demands primarily due to new demands that have been previously reserved for. Agency outstanding demands were also up linked- quarter, which reflected the demands from increased file requests we highlighted last quarter, as well as the time it\u2019s taking to work through those demands with the agencies.","As shown on page 19, our Tier 1 common equity ratio was 10.06%, down 2 basis points from the second quarter. Our third quarter ratio reflects refinement to the risk weighting of certain unused leading commitments that provide for the ability to issue standby letters of credit, which reduced the ratio by 32 basis points.","Importantly, this update did not affect our estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio under Basel III capital proposals, which grew to 8.02% in the third quarter. We continue to have a very strong capital position.","We purchased 16.5 million shares in the third quarter, and entered into a forward repurchase transaction for an estimated 9 million shares, that is expected to settle in the fourth quarter. As we\u2019ve highlighted throughout the call today, we had demonstrated momentum across our franchise as reflected in growth across a diverse group of consumer and commercial businesses. We have many examples listed on page 20. The main point is that across cycle different businesses drive our growth, which has been the reason for our consistent performance.","In summary, our balanced business model produced strong results again this quarter. We once again achieved record earnings and EPS. We grew pre-tax pre-provision profit, achieved positive operating leverage with reduced expenses, and had strong underlying credit performance.","Our ROA increased to 1.45%, the highest in five years, and within our target range of 1.3% to 1.6%. Our ROE grew to 13.38% also within our target range of 12% to 15%. Our ability to achieve this growth in the low rate environment that is putting pressure on our net interest margin, and in a quarter when mortgage revenue actually declined slightly, clearly demonstrates the underlying momentum we have across our franchise.","I\u2019ll now open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question will come from the line of Erika Penala with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","John G. Stumpf","Good morning, Erika.","Leanne Erika Penala \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Good morning. My first question was on the margin. Is there a seasonality in terms of deposit flows, because you have $92 billion average cash this quarter, and it was $98 billion last year same quarter. I\u2019m just wondering, we had sort of a similar step down, and more stability in other quarters. I'm just wondering, if there is a seasonality in deposit flows that we hadn\u2019t been taken to account?","Timothy J. Sloan","Erika, that\u2019s a good question. I think throughout the year you can see some seasonality in our deposit flows. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily conclude that every third quarter we\u2019re going to have deposit growth like we had in the third quarter of last year and this year. But there is no question that part of the \u2013 and a big reason for the net interest margin decline was because of the strong deposit flows particularly what we saw in September.","Leanne Erika Penala \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","And it\u2019s clear that the momentum in core loan growth should absorb some of that excess cash on a go-forward basis. But could you give us a sense of how you plan to deploy and how much of it of the excess cash that you plan to deploy on a go-forward basis, your reinvestment strategy that\u2019s not soaked up by core loan growth?","Timothy J. Sloan","Well, the first call on any of our liquidity is for our customers, and it\u2019s really going to be focused on core loan growth. As you saw this quarter, we decided to hold $9.8 billion of our confirming first mortgage portfolio primarily, because we viewed it as a very good investment opportunity for us, given the risk award of holding those mortgages, which were very high-quality versus buying a similar duration MBS at a big premium.","We were very cautious this quarter in terms of how we thought about our investment alternatives, and we are doing that, because we are thinking about the investment portfolio for the long-term.","John G. Stumpf","And Erika, I think that Tim is absolutely right on that. We are going to be very careful at this point in time, not to just go out there and stretch for yield and take on a lot of interest rate risk.","Leanne Erika Penala \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay.","John G. Stumpf","But the first call is always for our customers.","Leanne Erika Penala \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay. And just one last question on the margin, and I\u2019ll step off. On slide 15, you mentioned that there was a $4.3 billion increase in the accretable yield, I guess the way I\u2019m thinking about this is, as the housing market in the U.S. recovers, you can continue to reclassify more of the non-accretable into accretable. And so that\u2019s clearly going to be margin support on a go-forward basis. And the negative impact that you\u2019ve mentioned on the margin this quarter, is that have to do with lower cash resolutions from the Wachovia legacy book than last quarter? And my thinking about the components put that way?","Timothy J. Sloan","No. That\u2019s correct. The 10 basis points that we called out in the supplement was primarily because of lower resolutions, and as we mentioned, in second quarter, at higher resolutions, those are going to be volatile on a quarter-to-quarter basis. But you\u2019re absolutely correct when you think about the impact on the non-accretable yield to accretable yield and then the expectation of cash flows from that portfolio that as the housing market continues to improve that we\u2019ll get benefit there.","Leanne Erika Penala \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Got it. thank you for taking my questions.","John G. Stumpf","Thanks, Erika.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse","Tim, could you perhaps maybe just drill down a little more into what you\u2019re seeing from the agencies in terms of the put backs, and you talked about a little bit, could you kind of just \u2013 I mean some of your competitors have already kind of had their reserves to the point where they\u2019re beginning to drive them down, could you talk about that a little bit?","Timothy J. Sloan","Sure. As we mentioned, we added $462 million to their purchase reserve this quarter, which was down from the second quarter, which was $669 million. There is a little bit of noise in the puts and takes here, because the new agency demand levels were actually down. so this sort of new agency demands were down this quarter, which is a good sign. I don\u2019t necessarily think that it means we should declare victory and there are always going to be down, but that\u2019s a good sign that we haven\u2019t seen for a while.","The outstanding demands from the GSEs were actually up a little bit, and this reflects a couple of things; one, remember our expectations from last quarter as well as the fact that it\u2019s taken a little bit longer to work through our file request. But the non-agency demands were actually up this quarter. So, there\u2019s a lot going on there. and we continue to have a lot of discussion with the agencies, but there\u2019s nothing that we\u2019ve seen yet that would indicate that the decline that we saw this quarter is certainly a trend I hope it is, but I can\u2019t guarantee you that that\u2019s going to be the case.","John G. Stumpf","There are a couple of big, you step back a little bit, a couple of issues that are encouraging, first of all, real estate is getting better. we start in housing a year ago and every quarter we have more confidence that this, we\u2019re not back to where we need to be and it\u2019s not as robust as we\u2019d all want it to be. But that\u2019s good on the repurchase side as values go up. And secondly, we continue to get further and further away or it\u2019s further and really a mirror, the 2006 and 2008 portfolio. So every quarter we go, we\u2019re getting through that. So those are things that are encouraging.","Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse","Great, just on the mortgage banking front, a couple of just interesting trends, it looks like you took the pedal off on the correspondent business of touch, and at the same time, took the valuation of your MSR down whereas the JPMorgan had taken it up a little bit. Just talk a little bit about how we should think about the interplay of, both origination volumes into the fourth quarter in 2013, and maybe perhaps the valuation to MSR?","Timothy J. Sloan","Sure, I\u2019ll start with origination volume. We ended the quarter with a pipeline that was a little bit less than the second quarter, but it almost $100 billion, it\u2019s still very strong.","Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse","Right.","Timothy J. Sloan","And as we mentioned, volume has been strong so far this quarter being the fourth quarter. So we expect to have a pretty strong mortgage quarter in the fourth quarter. How long that last, don\u2019t know for sure, but it feels like, it\u2019s going to last at least a few quarters, and obviously, we hope it does.","In terms of the MSR valuation, the change that we made this quarter was just to continue to take into consideration, the higher servicing and the foreclosure costs that we\u2019re seeing and to include that in the valuation of our MSR and that yielded $350 million write-down.","Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse","Great. Thank you.","Timothy J. Sloan","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets.","Joseph Morford \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Thanks, good morning.","John G. Stumpf","Good morning.","Timothy J. Sloan","Hi, Joe.","Joseph Morford \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Just first following up on the mortgage, can you just also comment about gain on sale margin trends in the quarter and were they materially hired at all that you\u2019ve been, that means quarter end?","Timothy J. Sloan","No, they were 2.21%, which was about what it was in the second quarter at 2.2%.","Joseph Morford \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And then beyond that, any thoughts on the potential impact of that, the Fed\u2019s NPRs, now you\u2019ve had more insight looking at that. And also just going into CCAR 2013, any thoughts about, you maybe, your approach in it would be any difference than last year?","Timothy J. Sloan","Yeah, in terms of the NPRs, the Basel III estimate that we have for Tier 1 common equity takes into consideration a relatively conservative implementation of those. So the 8.02% number, we feel it\u2019s a pretty solid number based upon what we know today. We haven\u2019t gotten any further updates or indication just because it\u2019s a working process right now.","As it relates to CCAR, we\u2019re really looking forward to going through a CCAR and we\u2019re looking forward to presenting our submission in the first quarter, because it\u2019s the way that we can continue to increase our capital return to our shareholders. And as you know, we had a very successful CCAR process this last year and our expectations are else we will have another successful one.","John G. Stumpf","Let me reiterate what Tim just said, which is really important. We are really focused on getting more capital back to our stockholders. That is, best way to do that is perform well as we\u2019re doing and have, the capital we have and Tim said, it\u2019s a lot of work to CCAR and we\u2019re looking forward to it.","Joseph Morford \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Timothy J. Sloan","Thanks, Joe.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O\u2019Neill.","Scott Siefers \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners L.P.","I just want to ask another question on the margin. Is there anything that like surprised you in September, I guess just relative to where you\u2019ve been suggesting the month or so or ago that would be came in a little worse than that guidance? And then I guess along those lines, I think in the past you\u2019ve been pretty clear that you expected the margin to come under pressure, but by the same token I\u2019d hope that NII would be able to continue to grow. Do you think you can offer this quarter\u2019s base still generate positive NII growth?","Timothy J. Sloan","Yeah, so, a few questions in there all good ones. The first one, our deposit growth was a little bit stronger in September than we had expected, which again is terrific, that\u2019s the way that we get most of our customers into the Wells Fargo. So we are happy with that.","And secondly, we had a fewer resolutions than we had estimated. But I think it\u2019s really important to step back and just reflect on what\u2019s happened with our net interest margin over the past year. Certainly, the 25 basis point decline this quarter is high, but when you think about it year-over-year, our net interest margin is down 18 basis points.","So when you think about what happened during that year, on a net interest margin decline of 18 basis points, our net interest income is up 1%, we\u2019ve grown deposits by $51 billion. We\u2019ve originated $519 billion of residential mortgages. Our efficiency ratio has improved from 59.5% to 57.1%. And so when you total all this up, and I\u2019m sorry, and credits improved and even adjusted for the OCC guidance, our loan losses were down 50 basis points. I say all that, because while net interest margin is an important factor to look at. What we really focus on is, earnings per share, and earnings per share were up 22% over that same period.","And I think that really reflects the strength of our diversified model. There is no question that in this slow rate environment, the NIM will continue to be under pressure. Again, we don\u2019t believe that the 25 basis point decline that we saw this quarter is representative of what we\u2019ll see in the future. But what we do believe is that, our performance is going to be representative of what we are going to see in the future, because we\u2019ve got a very strong diversified model.","And in answer to your last question, I do believe that, we can grow net interest income over time even in the phase of a declining net interest margin.","Scott Siefers \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners L.P.","Okay. Perfect. That\u2019s a helpful color, I appreciate it. And then I just wanted to switch back to the decision to portfolios, some of the conforming mortgage as well. I definitely understand the rationale relative to some of the other investment alternatives that you would have, but I guess by the same token, putting on mortgages at historically low rates, potentially introduces some high risk of its own into the future. I guess, how did you kind of square that dynamic when you guys thought about it?","Timothy J. Sloan","Yeah, I think it\u2019s a very fair point, a good question, because any time we put any asset on the books, we\u2019ve got to think about the risk. It\u2019s not only about what kind of return we can get in the short-term, but it\u2019s about the risk of owning that asset whether it\u2019s a loan or a security, or whatever.","And so in making this decision, we took into consideration interest rate risk, credit risk, as well as concentration risk, and we are very comfortable given the size of our loan portfolio and the level of our liquidity and the level of interest rate risk that we have at the company that this incremental increase of $9.8 billion and the incremental mortgages that we mentioned that we will likely put on this quarter on the balance sheet is not going to significantly or materially affect our interest rate risk or credit risk.","Jim Rowe","If you think about this, we\u2019ve done this in the past. And again, it\u2019s one of the tools that we have, one of the leverage we can pull, and we see a very nice, a difference between the yield there versus if we bought RMBS as a security. And again, then you are paying 105 or 106, you are paying a premium and those things pay half yearly you know that premium amortization. So there is a lot of bouncing here. But we\u2019ve done this before, we\u2019re aware of that, it\u2019s something that we think about it.","Scott Siefers \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners L.P.","Okay, perfect. Thank you very much.","Timothy J. Sloan","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Ed Najarian with ISI Group.","Edward R. Najarian \u2013 ISI Group Inc.","Hi, good morning, guys.","John G. Stumpf","Hi, Ed.","Timothy J. Sloan","Hello, Ed.","Edward R. Najarian \u2013 ISI Group Inc.","So a couple of quick questions here. Just first in terms of retaining the conforming fixed-rate mortgages the $9.8 billion. Why is that a better decision then maybe retaining jumbo is that, might have a higher yield and have equal or better credit quality?","John G. Stumpf","Oh, Ed, yeah, we do that too.","Timothy J. Sloan","Absolutely.","Edward R. Najarian \u2013 ISI Group Inc.","Given your giant origination volume, can\u2019t you just do more of that versus 30-year fixed conforming?","John G. Stumpf","Well, we would like to do more of that and we\u2019ve got a very strong nonconforming or jumbo origination capability and we want to and we\u2019ll continue to grow that. But in addition to that, we thought it was a good idea given the risk written alternatives to hold these conforming mortgages too.","And this is just an example of how we think about managing the company for the long-term. I mean, we could have taken that $9.8 billion and had a gain on sale, which would have been fine and increase the short-term earnings, but we thought it was better to hold these high credit quality mortgages to generate income over a longer period of time. And again we\u2019ve retained all of our nonconforming jumbo mortgages, we do not sell those.","Edward R. Najarian \u2013 ISI Group Inc.","Okay. And then given what you\u2019ve done to sort of the overall accretable yield balance, taking that number up to almost $19 billion, which you talked about previously. Should we expect $495 million of quarterly accretable yield to NII to be a higher number in future quarters?","John G. Stumpf","Yeah, it\u2019s going to be higher. I would describe it as being slightly higher, because it\u2019s over a longer period of time, 13 years plus. There is the disproportion of return that comes towards the end of the term of those mortgages, but there is no question, it will have a slightly positive impact on the net interest margin.","Edward R. Najarian \u2013 ISI Group Inc.","Okay, thanks. And then this question is again kind of specific to the margin. Looking at your C&I and your real estate mortgage yield, you\u2019re sort of prepared for the big drop in the commercial real estate mortgage yield from $462 million to $405 million, because I think that was obviously insulated into 2Q from the cash recoveries. But we also saw a pretty big drop in the yield on the C&I portfolio itself. Is there something going on in there other than the rate environment and competition, was there is some cash recovery in there as well in 2Q?","Timothy J. Sloan","There was a little bit of cash recovery in the second quarter. And again, you also have the impact of the liquidating portfolio kind of running off. But I wouldn\u2019t \u2013 and again if you look back even on a five quarter basis, you\u2019ve seen some volatility in that number. But there is also an impact from some lower loan recoveries that we got in the second quarter. But I would necessarily look at that decline, the level of that decline a trend.","Edward R. Najarian \u2013 ISI Group Inc.","Okay. Would you feel like that $384 million number on the C&I yield is something that should remain more stable going forward?","Timothy J. Sloan","Gosh, I hope so. There is no question that there is a fair amount of competition out there for assets. I don\u2019t \u2013 but again, I don\u2019t think you should look at the $421 million to $384 as a trend that you are going to see on a quarterly basis. There certainly could be some impact and some future decline, but the 384 number feels pretty good.","Edward R. Najarian \u2013 ISI Group Inc.","And then lastly and I\u2019ll stop.","Timothy J. Sloan","","Yeah.","Edward R. Najarian \u2013 ISI Group Inc.","On operating costs, probably absorbing clearly to next year costs related to the strong mortgage origination pipeline and volume. can you maybe frame operating expenses for us over the next few quarters sort of in two pieces: number one, what we might see in terms of core expense reductions and \u2013 apart from mortgage? And number two, what we might see in terms of savings on the mortgage side as the refi volume ultimately comes down?","Timothy J. Sloan","Well, our guess as it relates to the best estimate in terms of the refi volume is that that\u2019s going to continue on for a few quarters. so I don\u2019t expect any sort of decline in expenses until that occurs. And it\u2019s again, I doubt it\u2019s going to be next quarter, the quarter after that.","In terms of other expenses, clearly, and when you look at the mortgage business, we have other environmental expenses that are elevated for things like the consent order, the servicing settlement, and just the fact that, well, the portfolio has continued to improve, we still have higher than normal cost. And my guess is that those are going to start begin to tail down some time probably in the second half of next year.","and in terms of, then just the base operating expenses, as John mentioned, as I mentioned, we\u2019re continuing to look at expense reduction in the company, but we want to do it in a way that\u2019s very focused on the efficiency ratio, because in this environment while we want to be more efficient, we don\u2019t want to give up good revenue opportunities. John, I don\u2019t know.","John G. Stumpf","Yeah. Let me maybe expand that a bit. Ed, you\u2019re asking the right question. We still think expenses are too high here. But we\u2019ve also said we\u2019re not going to be slavish to a number and turn away revenue. So if we look year-over-year compared to the third quarter of \u201911 we\u2019re up now in the expenses of $500 million, but our revenue was up $1.6 billion. So, we think that was a good trade.","That being said, we can be more efficient. there are some expenses that we\u2019re getting through compliance and consent and other things that we\u2019ll get better at, that will go away. but even in spite of all of that, we still think we have \u2013 our operating expenses are too high and we\u2019re focused on that, but we want to do it smartly. And a 57% efficiency ratio, we\u2019ve come a long way from the low 60s. And we\u2019ve picked up 240 basis points in a year and we still think we have more room to go. And that\u2019s well within our guidelines of 55% to 59%.","Edward R. Najarian \u2013 ISI Group Inc.","Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks guys.","John G. Stumpf","Thanks, Ed.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Andrew Marquardt with Evercore Partners.","Andrew Marquardt \u2013 Evercore Partners","Good morning, guys.","Timothy J. Sloan","Hi.","John G. Stumpf","Good morning.","Andrew Marquardt \u2013 Evercore Partners","Just on \u2013 just back to the margin commentary, can you help us frame just kind of the magnitude of how much pressure we should still expect going forward, after the re-stepping down to 366 ranges, is it going to be in the 5 to 10 range or how do we think of the output given, the number of moving parts still?","Timothy J. Sloan","Yeah, I know it can be a little bit frustrating to try to predict any sort of decline in the net interest margin. And part of that is because on a quarterly basis, it can be pretty volatile. I mean if you look back a year ago in the third quarter, our net interest margin was down 17 basis points and then it was up in the fourth quarter, and then it was flat for a couple of quarters. So if you step back and look at it year-over-year, it\u2019s being down 18 basis points. Could we see another 18 to 20 basis points decline in the year, sure we could. Could it be up to 25, you bet. Could it be 15, right, and so that you could see that much change, but we could also see another quarter in the next quarter where it\u2019s up.","Again what we focus on, right, is not managing to the net interest margin and again reason for that is the following. We could have easily increased our net interest margin by making some bad short-term decisions. For example, we could increase the duration of our investment portfolio. We could go out and buy a lot of securities that have good short-term yield, but have higher credit risk, right.","That maybe a good short-term decision in terms of managing to the net interest margin, it could be a bad long-term decision in terms of how we\u2019re managing this company for the long-term, which again is why we don\u2019t spend the whole lot of time being focused on managing to that margin, but again back to the original question, \u201cCould we see the same kind of decline year-over-year that we\u2019ve seen this year?\u201d We certainly could.","John G. Stumpf","And the other side, think of it, the other half of our revenue comes from non-interest income. And we\u2019ve shown very good growth in that area. So even though as we gain new households, new customers, if they are not borrowing or if spreads are lower there, we do a lot of other things with these folks. And we\u2019ve seen good growth in that area. So overall revenue, year-over-year up 8% those are pretty good numbers.","Andrew Marquardt \u2013 Evercore Partners","Got it. And then I hear correctly from the earlier question, I think it was Scott, who asked that the NII should and can\u2019t improve from here despite the pressure on a linked quarter basis.","Timothy J. Sloan","Yes, yes, absolutely.","John G. Stumpf","Sure.","Andrew Marquardt \u2013 Evercore Partners","Okay. And then is the margin pressure, is this going to last for year and I guess feels like the industry through next year as well, if this current environment remains?","Timothy J. Sloan","","Yeah.","Andrew Marquardt \u2013 Evercore Partners","","Okay. And then on expenses, the target of 55% to 59%, should we think about that being a target that for next year as well?","John G. Stumpf","Yeah, we should. Yeah, that\u2019s a good question. We announced the 55% to 59% at Investor Day in May. And we did at Investor Day because we didn\u2019t want that to be viewed as a range that was for one quarter, two quarter. That\u2019s the range that we believe that we can operate in. Again there\u2019s going to be some seasonality in our expenses. Our expenses are generally up a little bit in the first quarter because of compensational related items. But we think that we can operate within that range, and will be using that range for the time being.","Andrew Marquardt \u2013 Evercore Partners","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matthew O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities","","Good morning.","John G. Stumpf","Hey, Matt.","Timothy J. Sloan","Hey, Matt.","Matthew O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities.","","I want to follow-up on something Tim, I think you just said about the mortgage related costs, relates like legacy assets or the environmental costs as referred to them. You said something about hopefully those start to tail off back half of next year. I realize this is probably somewhat of a guesstimate like, why is it taking so long for those cost to come down with loan price just raising and some more guidelines on the servicing side? I think what do you think it could be another year, before we see a meaningful decline in those areas?","Timothy J. Sloan","","Let me separate them into two groups, Matt. The costs that related to just managing the portion of the problem loan portfolio, whether it\u2019s in mortgage or anywhere else within the company, and those are continuing to come down. And so I didn\u2019t mean to imply and apologize if I did that that, that we are \u2013 we don\u2019t think those are going to come down until next year. The cost that I was referring to are, what I would describe as the environmental cost related to complying with the consent order and also the servicing settlement and those are works in process right now and it\u2019s going to take us through next year to be able to \u2013 to work through the servicing settlement and comply with the consent order. So there is really kind of two different categories Matt.","John G. Stumpf","And for example, the new supervisory standards just became effective I think October 1, I mean now we have a front run in that, but it takes a while to get those really worked into your system and become efficient on those.","Matthew O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities.","And how much are the cost, how much are those the consent and serving delay cost in the third quarter?","John G. Stumpf","Yeah, what we disclosed in the supplement that is the third-party costs related to the consent order about $100 million a quarter and as it relates to the cost for the servicing settlement, we didn\u2019t disclose those, but assume there is some addition to that.","Matthew O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities.","Okay. So I guess the bigger portion though is just the cost of servicing some of the troubled borrowers, that part is coming down, because I\u2019d think that\u2019s the biggest piece of your\u2026","Timothy J. Sloan","That will continue to come down as the portfolio continues to improve, which is what we\u2019ve been seeing.","Matthew O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities.","Okay. And then just separately on the mortgage side, how elevated are the production related expenses just like in an absolute dollar, what are those costs this quarter?","Timothy J. Sloan","Now, I\u2019m not going to disclose that, because then everybody know exactly what our margins are and that\u2019s a important from a competitive standpoint.","Matthew O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities.","Is there anything you can size around like year-over-year expenses are up X and X% of that is due to higher mortgage or anyway to frame that a little bit for us?","John G. Stumpf","No.","Matthew O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities","Okay.","Timothy J. Sloan","That it \u2013 it takes more time now to underwrite a loan, I mean there is more expense on that but we are working through those things.","Matthew O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities","I\u2019m going to guess it\u2019s at a very high level like, it seems like there\u2019s some puts and takes on the production related expenses, a lot more legwork needs to be done to get loans approved whether it\u2019s refi or purchase, yet, I think the headcount adds been a lot less for the industry and technology is better. So it\u2019s just hard to put it all together. I mean it seems like there is some elevation on expenses, but maybe no there is much to say, few years ago when hiring\u2019s were more meaningful.","Timothy J. Sloan","Well, Matt I think it\u2019s a really fair question and in fairness state, the entire industry or anybody that\u2019s in the mortgage business today there is a lot of change that\u2019s going on. And so I think it\u2019s hard to kind of put a hard dollar cost to, this has really been what the impact to the change because it\u2019s still a work in process, I\u2019d have to step back and just again focus on the overall efficiency ratio for the company, which has continued to improve over this last year as John said by about 2.5% and even in the last quarter by over 100 basis points.","Matthew O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities","Okay.","John G. Stumpf","But we are adding people to deal with volumes and to get the throughput.","Matthew O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities","You don\u2019t disclose the headcount in the mortgage company, do you?","Timothy J. Sloan","Not separately, no.","Matthew O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities","Excellent. All right. Thank you.","John G. Stumpf","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.","Thanks, guys. Good morning. Just one more, you kind of all encompassing question on expenses. So understanding the efficiency ratio points that you make at the top of the company, and the progression that's been made with total expenses continuing to come down through the last couple of quarters, can you give us a framework of how to just think about the overall expense base, just going ahead, because I would think you still have some annualization of the cost savings programs, you\u2019ve got the environmental costs that we just, that Matt just asked about.","And then there is this unanswerable question right now about how much is in the mortgage business, but so can you just help us frame how are you going to be thinking about just the overall cost base from a dollar's perspective as we think about 2013 over 2012 just from an operating leverage perspective?","Timothy J. Sloan","Yeah, well, I think you made an important point there at the end. And that is, we're looking at operating leverage and we're looking at efficiency ratio. And so, we are not focused on saying, look, here is the hard dollar reduction that we want to see year-over-year. What we want to see is, we want to see sequential improvement in our efficiency ratio. Now again, the first quarter in every year is going to be a little bit different, but the way that we are measuring, our people who are measuring the businesses is to see that sequential improvement in the efficiency ratio. So we don't have a specific dollar target for next year, but we want to improve the efficiency ratio, so we can get down to stay in the middle to get down to the lower end of the range that we set.","John G. Stumpf","And I would also say that we want to make sure that for businesses like mortgage that have volume differences, one year could be much higher, when volumes do have, or the business contracts, we are able to adjust expenses in a similar way that's extremely important in that business.","Kenneth M. Usdin \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.","","So I guess the broad takeaway is that, next year you would still see the ability to improve the efficiency ratio from where it currently stands?","Timothy J. Sloan","","Yeah, again let me, what we are looking for, the way that we measure our businesses internally is look for sequential improvement in operating leverage, in every business regardless of what the business is.","John G. Stumpf","Absolutely.","Timothy J. Sloan","Right. So that it takes into consideration not only the revenue opportunities that the businesses are seeing and you\u2019ve seen that in our results this quarter across the broad in many businesses, but also asking them to become more efficient at the same time.","Kenneth M. Usdin \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.","","Okay, got. And my second question is just about the trust and investment fees business obviously had good sequential improvement. I was just wondering if you could provide a little color about the momentum you\u2019re seeing there and also obviously, December was a tough environment on the volumes base side of things, but there were still growth in the business. So we\u2019re seeing an incremental bit of momentum there in the core business and just any changes you\u2019re seeing in terms of customer activity and the outlook for growth in that part of the company?","Timothy J. Sloan","I think a couple of things, one, we did see and we are continuing to see some momentum there. I think David Carroll, at our Investor Day did a terrific job in kind of walking through the opportunities that we see in that business, in his business and then in our investment banking business, John Stumpf did a nice job kind of walking you through that at Investor Day, so we\u2019re seeing some good momentum. And I think the other thing that\u2019s really important when you think about the trusts and investment fees is that, the mix is also improving, so that we\u2019re seeing more of that the mix coming from advisory fees, and asset management fees as opposed to just transactional activity. So we\u2019re optimistic that we can continue to grow not only within those businesses, but also that line item.","John G. Stumpf","And part of the secret sauce there is, David and his team\u2019s ability to work across businesses within the company. So he worked very closely with the community banking side, led by Carrie Tolstedt, very closely with Dave Hoyt in the wholesale side. So there\u2019s lots of work together, because many of our customers who call us their bank, keep their wealth some place else. So there is \u2013 we have huge opportunity in this business.","Kenneth M. Usdin \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks guys.","John G. Stumpf","Thank you.","Timothy J. Sloan","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Paul Miller with FBR.","Paul J. Miller \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Very much and I hate to go back to the NIM, but I want to talk a little bit about the securities portfolio. It did increase a little bit. But what type of \u2013 and you talked about this in the opening remarks about that some of the NIM pressure is coming from the securities portfolio, but what type of the CPR rates were you\u2019re seeing, I know you had some really high yielding stuff that is probably prepaying very fast?","John G. Stumpf","Yeah. You know what Paul, it\u2019s a fair question. I don\u2019t have the CPR rates on an individual security basis handy. we can get back to you with that.","Paul J.

Miller \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Yeah, yeah.","Timothy J. Sloan","Open up, it\u2019s whatever the yield is today in the market. I think that the more important point is that when we saw rates declined significantly, and then we saw the demand for the underlying securities really increased, so that you\u2019re looking at buying these at a significant premium. That\u2019s the point at which we said, you know what, this just doesn\u2019t feel very good to us in terms of making a long-term decision and where we focused on keeping more of the conforming mortgages.","Paul J. Miller \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay. and one real quick question, what is \u2013 you might release, you might have it somewhere, but I can\u2019t see it. What is your annualized servicing fee?","Timothy J. Sloan","Our annualized servicing fee?","John G. Stumpf","On mortgage?","Timothy J. Sloan","Yeah.","Paul J. Miller \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.","No, on the MS, for your servicing portfolio, I\u2019m sorry guys.","John G. Stumpf","You mean the valuation...","Timothy J. Sloan","63 basis points.","John G. Stumpf","You mean the valuation?","Paul J. Miller \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.","That\u2019s your capitalized cost of servicing. Your annualized servicing fee?","John G. Stumpf","25 bps.","Timothy J. Sloan","25 basis points.","Paul J. Miller \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay. Thanks a lot guys.","John G. Stumpf","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.","John G. Stumpf","Hey, Mike.","Michael Mayo \u2013 Credit Agricole Securities","Hi, my question is on mortgages past, present, and future. so let\u2019s start with the mortgages past, I mean the decision to retain the mortgages on the balance sheet, do you still have the option to sell those retained mortgages, because you\u2019re passing up some revenues today, it\u2019s tying up more capital and there is a tradeoff there, isn\u2019t there?","John G. Stumpf","Sure. There is.","Timothy J. Sloan","Sure.","John G. Stumpf","And we think it\u2019s a good tradeoff to make today, but holding these mortgages today doesn\u2019t preclude our ability to sell them in the future.","Michael Mayo \u2013 Credit Agricole Securities","So you could sell them today or in a month or in three months, you think?","John G. Stumpf","Well, I don\u2019t think we could sell them tomorrow, but we could sell them in the future certainly.","Timothy J. Sloan","You have to securitize them and\u2026","Michael Mayo \u2013 Credit Agricole Securities","Okay.","Timothy J. Sloan","You got to get him wrapped and \u2013 but yeah, we could do that.","Michael Mayo \u2013 Credit Agricole Securities","And then as far as the mortgages today, you said the applications were down from the second quarter to the third quarter and you might have thought with QE3, the application volume would have increased. So what has the application volume down from the end of the third quarter until today?","John G. Stumpf","Let me pause your mortgage present for a minute. The pipeline at the end of the third quarter was down slightly from the end of the second quarter by, I think, $5 billion or $6 billion is still very high. Our mortgage volume in the third quarter was higher than in the second quarter and may be just gets into a little bit of the mortgage future. What we\u2019re seeing so far this quarter is that volume is up.","Timothy J. Sloan","","And remember we get out of the wholesale business from the third quarter.","Michael Mayo \u2013 Credit Agricole Securities","","All right. So volume is up so far this quarter versus the second quarter, especially it would be good to the fourth quarter?","John G. Stumpf","I hope, if it continues.","Michael Mayo \u2013 Credit Agricole Securities","Okay. But the more general question for the future, you said this should last maybe a few more quarters as far as the mortgage boom in terms of the revenues, but then it falls off. So my question is, could you offset that falloff entirely through actions at the mortgage company or would that be where the diversified model comes into play and you would expect other business lines to pick the slack?","Timothy J. Sloan","","Well, there is a lot of variables in the question you just asked. What\u2019s the economy going to look like, where our interest rate is going to be? But I think what you\u2019ve seen this quarter and not only what you\u2019ve seen this quarter, but what you\u2019ve seen for the last few quarters and the last year is that because we\u2019ve got a diversified model, you\u2019re seeing growth in a number of businesses. I can\u2019t promise you that in the quarter that we see a decline in the mortgage business that everyone of those business is going to be able to pickup the complete slack. I hope it does, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen historically, when we\u2019ve gone through these peaks and valleys in the mortgage business. But again, that\u2019s the benefit of the model that we\u2019ve got and that we\u2019ve got other levers to pull, there is other horses that are pulling the stagecoach.","John G. Stumpf","And Mike, another thing you need to think about is 75% of our mortgage volume this past quarter was refinanced and 25% was purchase money. That\u2019s still a very low overall purchase money market. As we see real estate continue to improve as refis ebb, we might see the purchase volume pick up. So that\u2019s a natural offset. Furthermore as the purchasing volume or if rate rise and those things slowdown, then the servicing asset peoples were valuable. So we have all those things going on, besides the diversified model.","Michael Mayo \u2013 Credit Agricole Securities","","But at the end of the day, even with the improving in the servicing asset, even with more purchase volume, even with the expense cut in the mortgage unit, chances are you\u2019d still have to rely on some, as you would say, horses outside the mortgage area.","John G. Stumpf","Yeah, absolutely. That\u2019s the exciting part. We free them all.","Timothy J. Sloan","Yeah.","John G. Stumpf","They are all pulling.","Michael Mayo \u2013 Credit Agricole Securities","Just last follow-up because this is the main question I think. How you manage to hand off from the mortgage boom to the time you cut the expenses? How do you know when to start cutting those expenses? What signs are you looking at?","John G. Stumpf","Well, the mortgage business, as you can imagine, this is not the first \u2013 we\u2019ve in this a long time, we have terrific leaders there. And they see volumes on a \u2013 not hourly, but at daily basis and they have been very good at dialing up and dialing down to adjust to volumes. Now there is truly a fixed component there, but we\u2019ve done this. This is not the first up or down we\u2019ve seen in this business. We\u2019ve seen many of those.","Michael Mayo \u2013 Credit Agricole Securities","But isn\u2019t this time different, I mean if we had QE4 that could change your whole analysis right? Isn\u2019t it\u2026","John G. Stumpf","Well, you might get exactly right. We had \u2013 we didn\u2019t know QE3 was coming and now we\u2019re adding people. And if QE3 lasts, if the volumes last for 12 months versus six months, we will make adjustments up or down based on that.","Michael Mayo \u2013 Credit Agricole Securities","","Are you able to say how many people you\u2019ve added?","John G. Stumpf","I don\u2019t think \u2013 no, we\u2019d not say that, but we\u2019re adding people.","Michael Mayo \u2013 Credit Agricole Securities","Okay. All right, thanks a lot.","Timothy J. Sloan","Thanks Mike.","Operator","","Your next question will come from the line of Greg Ketron with UBS.","Gregory W. Ketron \u2013 UBS Investment Bank","","Good morning.","Timothy J. Sloan","Good morning.","Gregory W. Ketron \u2013 UBS Investment Bank","Just a variation of all the mortgage questions that you\u2019ve answered this morning. Kind of looking at the 2013 the MBA forecast calls for volumes to be off, you know maybe 20% to a size of 30%, I know that MBA forecast is about as accurate as a weather forecast. But if you look at that type of scenario are there things that you can do maybe on the pricing side or products side, and increase market share in light of the scenario that would have mortgage production coming down that much?","Timothy J. Sloan","Well, I mean, yeah, we can \u2013 you could always lower your prices and take up share, but I don\u2019t know, necessarily think that\u2019s a good \u2013 a good decision always going to be a good decision from a profit standpoint. And it\u2019s a very competitive market out there, we don\u2019t run the business based upon on share, we run the business based upon profitability. Our first call continues to be focused on our retail origination network and then also secondly our corresponding network.","As you said, the MBA forecast it could be right, it could be wrong. I think everybody has been surprised that how long this refinance boom has lasted, as I said, we think it\u2019s going to last for a few more quarters. And again, at some point, it\u2019s going to slowdown. As John said, there might be a mix change, we hope there will be and there will be more purchase money mortgages. But again, the important thing is we\u2019ve been through this before. This isn\u2019t something that the folks in our mortgage business or the management team at this company hasn\u2019t seen before in terms of cyclicality in the mortgage business and we will adjust to it.","Gregory W. Ketron \u2013 UBS Investment Bank","Okay. Right. And then in terms of the \u2013 I\u2019m sorry.","John G. Stumpf","I would just add remember on our mortgage business, half of our business is through correspondence. So the adjustment we are going to make is really on a 16% share or something.","Gregory W. Ketron \u2013 UBS Investment Bank","Okay. Great. And in terms of what you are seeing maybe so far this quarter, we know, if you look at the primary to secondary mortgage spread that widened out quite a bit so especially after QE3 was announced. Is there \u2013 your sense that you are going to continue to see mortgage rates work their way down and maybe some pressure on that spread in the fourth quarter?","Timothy J. Sloan","I don\u2019t know that answer to that. I mean clearly the spreads are attractive today, the costs are up too and the GC was up also. We are hopeful that the margins will continue to be at their present level, but it\u2019s competitive out there. And I think the one thing we know from history in the mortgage business is that when you are at a high level of margin there generally tends to be more pressure down than up. And again, it\u2019s competitive, but it\u2019s a very attractive business for us to be in and we\u2019re really pleased that we are originating one of every three mortgages that\u2019s done in the country.","John G. Stumpf","And it\u2019s also a very good deal for consumers, I mean consumers are getting bargained these days, if you look at the rates on the street. This is very \u2013 and this is probably the best time ever to buy a house. Most affordable.","Gregory W. Ketron \u2013 UBS Investment Bank","Great. Well, thank you very much.","John G. Stumpf","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy L. Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley","A question on the nonperformers, it\u2019s just another way of getting at the expense question, because obviously you\u2019ve got carrying cost associated with the nonaccrual and foreclosed assets and I\u2019m just wondering about how much more rapidly we could expect you would, try to bring this balance down. We\u2019ve had a change in the short sale program from the FHFA, which I would expect would be one opportunity to accelerate this shrinkage, but maybe I\u2019m wrong there? Maybe, if you could give us some color on what your thoughts are?","John G. Stumpf","Sure, Betsy, I think if you look at kind of that five quarter chart that we had in the supplement. You go back to the third quarter of last year, our total non-performing assets were about, I\u2019m going to round you about $27 billion. The improvement over the last year has been pretty significant with the exception that we\u2019ve had the OCC guidance in the first quarter, and then in this quarter that raised it. So what we\u2019re seeing is $1 billion plus decline in NPAs more or less on a quarterly basis, absent that guidance and our expectation is that it\u2019s reasonable to assume that that can continue.","Betsy L. Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley","But could you do anything to accelerate that?","Timothy J. Sloan","We could and we look at that all the time in terms of what\u2019s the best economic return for the company, not necessarily driven by ratios. but, yeah, I mean and so not only do we look at working out loans on a loan-by-loan basis, but also in the past quarters, we\u2019ve sold our packages of non-performing assets. and we\u2019ll continue to look at that and if the economics are there, and if the economics get better than we could certainly accelerate that.","John G. Stumpf","Yeah, Tim is right about that. It\u2019s based on economics; I mean we don\u2019t feel there is any reason to do something that\u2019s uneconomic. if that\u2019s economic, that\u2019d be terrific.","Betsy L. Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley","The short sale rule change anything in terms of helping you accelerate this or not really?","Timothy J. Sloan","","Not really.","John G. Stumpf","","Not really, because most short sales never get to the balance sheet, right. I mean if it\u2019s many of those are done on behalf of our investors, and it\u2019s so that will spend much time if at anything in your NPA area.","Betsy L. Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Great, okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Chris Mutascio with [Credit Suisse].","Christopher M. Mutascio \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning John, and Tim. how are you?","John G. Stumpf","Hey Chris, how are you doing?","Timothy J. Sloan","I\u2019m fine.","Christopher M. Mutascio \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I am doing well. I promise I won\u2019t ask you the margin or mortgage question.","Timothy J. Sloan","I guess we\u2019re pretty good at that.","John G. Stumpf","Thanks again.","Christopher M. Mutascio \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","You can do a debate I think given all the (inaudible). Looking at your cash and your Fed funds sold at the end of period, you\u2019re almost up to $120 billion pretty darn close to 9% of your total assets. I understand you\u2019d mentioned you\u2019re more prudent in terms of reinvestment right now given where rates are? My question is, though it looks like you\u2019re holding cash a bit though, are there any opportunities out there for a typical, the type of loan pool purchases you\u2019ve made in the past. I think they kind of slow of late, are you seeing any type of ramp up in those opportunities out there?","Timothy J. Sloan","Yeah. you\u2019re correct, I mean we didn\u2019t have a medium-size or large acquisition we did this quarter like, we\u2019ve had over the last few quarters. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily conclude that that\u2019s a trend that we won\u2019t continue to see those. We still have a pretty robust pipeline of opportunities out there. And so we\u2019re not necessarily holding cash to make sure that we\u2019ve got the ability to do it, because even if we had $20 billion or $30 billion less the cash, we would be more than liquid enough to be able to accomplish an acquisition. We\u2019re continued to be very focused on looking at good acquisition opportunities. we\u2019re very pleased with what we\u2019ve been able to accomplish in the last year. And we\u2019re hopeful to see that we\u2019ll continue to see those types of opportunities, but the pipeline is still there.","John G. Stumpf","Yeah. and I would say that the level is more because we can\u2019t \u2013 the opportunities are not, the risk reward is not the right kind of thing. and we haven\u2019t found anything that that make sense for us. But if it\u2019d be half that, if we could find great asset, that\u2019d be great.","Christopher M. Mutascio \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","All right.","John G. Stumpf","We didn\u2019t pick that number per se.","Christopher M. Mutascio \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","All right. Thank you very much. Have a great weekend guys.","John G. Stumpf","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Marty Mosby with Guggenheim.","Marty Mosby \u2013 Guggenheim Securities, LLC","Good morning.","John G. Stumpf","Good morning, Marty.","Marty Mosby \u2013 Guggenheim Securities, LLC","I want to take us back into the margin and mortgage just for a second, but a little different twist. If you\u2019re looking at the variable income more employment figure out is that, you met the five quarters over this period of time, you end up with a negative five basis points. So in general, you got to start at some point, and I\u2019m just curious, do you say that, would you think that the resolutions are lower than normal, at normal, kind of where we\u2019re yet going forward on that particular item?","John G. Stumpf","Marty, for this quarter, the resolutions were a little bit, were clearly lower than what we\u2019ve seen in the last four or five, six quarters.","Marty Mosby \u2013 Guggenheim Securities, LLC","","So, because I was looking at last quarter there, obviously elevated, but if you look back over time that would more than compensated with a little drop-off that you had in this quarter?","John G. Stumpf","That\u2019s correct.","Marty Mosby \u2013 Guggenheim Securities, LLC","Okay. and then when you look at mortgage, one of the things that\u2019s interesting to me is, as you look at the roll-off of the income that you\u2019re getting there, one of the things that helps cushion that blow is in periods when you have higher revenue potential, you find ways to kind of offset that. So in other words, if you look at holding the mortgages, that would have lowered your revenues by like you said, a little bit more than $200 million.","In this quarter you adjusted your servicing cost and you incorporated a higher cost going forward that lowered the number by $482 million. So if you look at those two adjustments that we\u2019re kind of incorporated in the $2.8 billion, there was a potential to earn $3.5 billion, which is about 20% higher, 20% to 25% higher than what you actually earn. So part of being able to cushion the future run-off and that you just kind of shave some of the peak off, which helps to cushion the ball later on","John G. Stumpf","Well, you\u2019re correct, Marty, particularly as it relates to the decision to hold the conforming production, and keeping on balance sheet, and to have that income flow over a longer period of time during the term of the mortgages as opposed to recognize its gain on sale. So, yeah, I mean there\u2019s no question that when you look at the mortgage business today is very strong.","Timothy J. Sloan","All of it\u2019s not flowing to the bottom line because of the couple of things that happened in the sense of the servicing costs and holding the mortgages. So you could have recognized if, every quarter you\u2019re not going to have servicing cost fee we have adjusted higher, that\u2019s not something you normally do.","John G. Stumpf","I certainly hope, I hope that that\u2019s correct Marty. But we did this quarter, we thought it was prudent to do it. But I hope we don\u2019t have a repeat of that in the next few quarters.","Timothy J. Sloan","And then just kind of lastly putting all that together down to, if you think of the decision you made to hold more mortgages of the decision to hold more liquidity, you are going through a process of, kind of storing up revenues that you can deploy at a better time down the future. So the linked and the life of that mortgage that you held will give you income through the cycle and over the next probably seven to 10 years.","If you look at the liquidity, when interest rates eventually begin to rise, which is when refi come down, you can deploy that at a much more advantageous time and create some positive there. So just on those two decisions that you tangibly made, there was about $0.04 of earnings in this quarter that helps future earnings down the road.","John G. Stumpf","Marty, that\u2019s a great summation of how we think about the company over the long-term. We\u2019ve got to make good long-term decisions everyday as opposed to, let\u2019s make a good short-term decision that doesn\u2019t have a good long-term benefit. And so that\u2019s exactly how we think about managing this company.","Marty Mosby \u2013 Guggenheim Securities, LLC","And, my past history is the way that this works the best is managing the quarters in which you have extra earnings for future investing into the future versus really taking the weaker quarters and trying to clock them off. You make the most traction in creating future earning streams taking those peaks and putting them out into future quarters. So I appreciate it. Thanks.","John G. Stumpf","Thank you, Marty.","Operator","Your final question will come from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.","Chris Kotowski \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.","My question was actually asked about 12 different ways, so we can call it a day.

I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Rowe, Director of Investor Relations.  Mr. Rowe, you may begin your conference.","Jim Rowe","Thank you, operator, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining our call today during which our chairman and CEO, John Stumpf; and our CFO, Tim Sloan, will discuss first quarter results and answer your questions.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our first quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I\u2019d also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today\u2019s call that are subject to risks and uncertainties.","Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement. ","Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release, and in the quarterly supplement available on our website.","I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf.","John Stumpf","Thank you, Jim, and thanks to everyone for joining us today.  In the first quarter, Wells Fargo generated another record quarter of earnings, and we achieved our 13th consecutive quarter of earnings per share growth.  ","We\u2019ve achieved these results by doing what we have always done: remaining focused and meeting the financial needs of our customers and helping them succeed financially.  We accomplished this in an environment that I think we would all agree wasn\u2019t ideal for generating earnings growth, demonstrating the benefit of our diversified business model.  ","Our business is diverse in many ways.  We are geographically diverse, we have over 80 different businesses that performed differently in various economic environments, and our revenue is split fairly evenly between interest and noninterest income.","That kind of diversity lowers risk and enhances earnings stability and growth.  Let me start by highlighting examples of our strong performance in the first quarter compared to a year ago.  We earned a record $5.2 billion, up 22%, and also grew our earnings per share by 23%.  We reduced our expenses and improved our efficiency ratio by 180 basis points to 58.3%.","Our core loan portfolio grew by $50.9 billion, up 8%.  Our credit losses reflected the benefit of a slowly improving economy and the high quality loans we\u2019ve been originating over the past few years.  Our credit losses in the first quarter declined to 72 basis points, the lowest level since second quarter 2006, and our net chargeoffs were down 41% from a year ago.","We also continued to benefit from our wonderful deposit franchise, growing deposits by $80 billion, up 9% from a year ago, while reducing total deposit costs by 5 basis points.","Our growth reflects the benefit of our relationship model as demonstrated by achieving record retail banking cross-sell of 6.1 products per household.  We also grew wholesale banking cross-sell to 6.8 products and wealth brokerage retirement cross-sell increased to 10.3 products.","We grew our return on assets, or ROA, by 18 basis points to 1.49%, and our return on equity increased by 145 basis points to 13.59%.  We continued to increase our capital levels, growing our estimated tier one common equity under Basel III to 8.39%.","Returning more capital to our shareholders remains a priority, and we\u2019re extremely pleased that we were able to reward them in the first quarter by increasing our common dividend to $0.25 a share.  Our 2013 capital plan enables us to further increase our dividend rate to $0.30 a share in the second quarter, subject of course to board approval, and also increase our common stock repurchases in 2013 compared to our 2012 repurchase levels.  ","We\u2019re obviously off to a great start in 2013, and I couldn\u2019t be happier with the ability of our team members to continue to make more loans and grow deposits, increase cross-sell, and reduce expenses, all while we continue to invest in our franchise and adhere to our risk management discipline.","Let me conclude by taking a moment to share my thoughts on some industry issues and our current view on housing.  A topic that has been in the headlines a lot lately that\u2019s important to Wells Fargo, our industry, and the economic recovery of our country, that is, Too Big to Fail.  ","I believe our first priority as a country, given the economy\u2019s tepid growth, is restoring economic health to America, including consumers and businesses large and small.  Banks feel and support economic growth and we need banks of all shapes and sizes to serve the diverse needs of a diverse economy.  All banks add value, and big banks have unique resources and capabilities to help the economy, including coast-to-coast convenience, a broad range of products and services, and technology innovations serving large and small customers alike.","There are ongoing discussions about the need for more regulation and other changes.  We do not need additional legislation aimed at big banks.  Important and significant regulatory changes have been made since the financial crisis, and we need to give existing regulations a chance to work, especially now, when all of our energy should be focused on creating growth and new jobs.","No bank should be considered too big to fail and no taxpayer money should ever be used to support a failing institution.  Some claim that we receive a subsidy or have an unfair advantage from being perceived as Too Big to Fail.  We disagree.","Wells Fargo supports economic growth in our country in a variety of ways, including employing 1 in 500 working Americans and paying more than $10 billion in corporate income taxes last year.  We are the nation\u2019s largest small business lender, and increased new loan commitments to small businesses by 24% in the first quarter compared with a year ago, and have grown loans to our middle-market customers for 11 consecutive quarters.  ","We also funded 1 in 4 U.S. home mortgages in 2012, a total of over 2 million mortgage loans that helped our customers buy a home or refinance their existing home at much lower rates.  This is great for the overall economy, because housing has led almost every economic recovery in recent history.","The momentum from the housing rebound during 2012 has remained strong in the early months of 2013.  Our near term outlook is for steady gains in home sales, building activity, and price appreciation.  Housing affordability remains excellent.  The overhang from unsold properties is gone, and demographics are favorable.","Thank you again for joining us.  Tim Sloan, our chief financial officer, will now provide more details on our results this quarter.  Tim?","","Tim Sloan","Thanks, John.  Good morning everyone.  My comments will follow the presentation included in the first half of our quarterly supplement, starting on page two, and then John and I will take your questions.","Wells Fargo had another outstanding quarter, with record earnings of $5.2 billion, up 22% from a year ago and up 2% from the fourth quarter.  Earnings per share reached a record $0.92, up 23% from the first quarter last year.","We have now achieved 13 consecutive quarters of earnings per share growth, and eight consecutive quarters of record EPS.  Quite an achievement given the environment during that period.","Revenue was down this quarter, reflecting two fewer days in the quarter, a decline in equity gains from elevated we had in the fourth quarter, and the expected decline in mortgage volumes.  We were not surprised by these declines.  We had anticipated them, and we are very pleased with the strong fee growth we generated in a number of our other businesses.","Our quarterly results also reflect lower expenses, strong credit performance, and increased capital levels.  As John highlighted, and as you can see on page three, we had year over year growth in pre-tax pre-provision profit, net income, EPS, both total and core loans, deposits, and a higher ROA and ROE.","Slide four highlights that we\u2019ve been able to generate consistently strong results, through the diversity of our revenue.  We remain balanced between fee and spread income, and our sources of fee income are highly diversified.  Mortgage banking accounted for 26% of our fee income this quarter, and was 13% of our total revenue.","We could not be more pleased with the performance of our mortgage business.  What may surprise some of you is that trust and investment fees accounted for 30% of our fee income in the first quarter, and has generated more fee income than any other category, including mortgage, for the past four quarters.","We had strong year over year fee growth with a number of our businesses, with deposit service charges up 12%, brokerage up 12%, trusts and investment up 6%, investment banking up 37%, card fees up 13%, merchant processing fees up 23%, and mortgage servicing income of 25%.","With over 80 businesses, they\u2019re not all going to grow every quarter.  We are excited about the market share and cross-sell growth we achieved this quarter across a number of our businesses.  The diversity of our revenue enables us to make the right long term decisions and be disciplined in managing risk.","Overall, this was a pretty straightforward quarter from a balance sheet and income statement perspective, but let me highlight some key drivers to our results in the next two slides.  On page five, you can see we continued to have balance sheet growth this quarter, growing both loans and deposits.","Even though we purchased a total of $17.8 billion in agency MBS in the quarter, our short term investments in Fed funds [sold] balance has increased by $6.5 billion as average deposits continue to grow.  ","We grew our securities available for sale portfolio by $13 billion, up 5.5% from the fourth quarter.  This is our largest linked quarter increase since the fourth quarter of 2011.  We took advantage of the rate backup at various times within the quarter as rates rose and yields became more attractive.","Turning to the income statement, on page six, I\u2019ve already highlighted some of the factors affecting the decline in revenue we had this quarter, and I\u2019ll talk about net interest income and noninterest income drivers in a minute.","Noninterest expenses declined as expected, reflecting the elimination of elevated items we had last quarter and the addition of some seasonally higher benefit cost in the first quarter.  Our effective tax rate this quarter was 31.9%, which included the benefit associated with the realization for tax purposes of a previously written down investment.  We expect the full year effective tax rate to be higher, absent additional discrete benefits.  ","Let me now cover our business drivers in more detail.  As shown on page seven, period end loans were up $33.5 billion, or 4%, from a year ago, and grew by $392 million from the fourth quarter.  Loan growth included the runoff of our liquidating portfolio, which declined $17.4 billion from a year ago and $3.7 billion from the fourth quarter.","Excluding these liquidating loans, our core portfolio grew by $50.9 billion, or 8%, from a year ago, and was up $4.1 billion from the fourth quarter.  Our linked quarter loan growth was impacted by the very strong quarter end growth we had last quarter and the fact that we were able to retain and add to those loan balances is a real positive.","Commercial loans grew $516 million in the quarter, on growth in foreign loans.  We saw declines in foreign loans throughout most of last year, and the growth we achieved this quarter was in trade finance, reflecting increased economic activity in Asia.","Consumer loans declined $124 million, with growth in first mortgage and auto offset by declines in junior lien mortgages and expected seasonal declines in credit card and student lending.  The growth in first mortgage loans benefited from the retention of $3.4 billion of new conforming fixed rate production.  We currently do not plan to retain additional first mortgage production, although we have the flexibility to do so if conditions change.","We continue to grow deposits in the first quarter, with period end deposits up $7.9 billion from the fourth quarter.  Average deposits were up $71.2 billion, or 8%, from a year ago and up $10.1 billion from the fourth quarter.  We also grew our primary consumer checking account customers by a net 2.1% from a year ago.  These are basically active customers who transact with us regularly.","We continue to lower our deposit costs, with average deposit costs of 15 basis points in the first quarter, down 1 basis point from the fourth quarter and down 5 basis points from a year ago.  We\u2019ve successfully grown deposits while reducing our deposit cost for nine consecutive quarters.  Our ability to lower deposit costs while consistently growing deposits reflects our longstanding relationship focus and pricing discipline.  ","As shown on page nine, tax equivalent net interest income was down 2% from the fourth quarter, primarily due to two fewer days in the first quarter.  Without this day count impact, net interest income would have been essentially flat.","Average earning assets grew $21.6 billion from the fourth quarter, reflecting increases in short term investments, loans, and available for sale securities.  Our net interest margin declined by 8 basis points from the fourth quarter to 3.48%.  ","This decline was driven by three primary factors.  First, our continued deposit growth caused cash and short-term investments to increase, reducing the margin by 3 basis points.  As I\u2019ve highlighted in the past, our deposit growth is obviously beneficial to deepening customer relationships and does not negatively impact net investment income, but it is dilutive to the NIM.  ","Second, 3 basis points of the decline was due to the lower variable income, including PCI loan resolutions and periodic dividends.  Finally, 2 basis points of the margin pressure was driven by the ongoing repricing of the balance sheet in this low-rate environment, net of the growth in loans and AFS securities.  Growing net investment income remains our focus, which we believe we can grow even in this low-rate environment.  ","Noninterest income was down from the fourth quarter on lower gains on equity investments, which were highlighted last quarter as being above average, and the expected decline in mortgage, which I\u2019ll highlight on the next slide.  ","Because of the seasonality of many of our businesses and the lower day count in the first quarter, it\u2019s best to look at the year over year growth rates to demonstrate the momentum we\u2019ve had in many of our businesses.  Deposit service charges increased 12%, reflecting customer growth and product and pricing changes.  Brokerage fees and trust and investment management fees grew reflecting strong net asset flows and higher equity valuations.  Investment banking fees were up 37% from a year ago as we continue to do more business with our wholesale customers. Card fees were up 13%, with growth driven by strong new account growth and higher credit and debit card spend.  ","On page 11, we highlight some mortgage trends.  While mortgage revenue was down this quarter as expected, we still had strong originations of $109 billion, our sixth consecutive quarter of more than $100 billion in originations.  Mortgage revenue was reduced by $112 million this quarter from the retention of $3.4 billion of conforming first mortgages.","Gain on sale margins remained historically high, and as we\u2019ve been saying for the past few quarters, we would expect these margins to decline.  Origination volume for the rest of the year will obviously depend on continued strength in the housing market and interest rates, but we expect volumes to remain relatively strong given the improved purchase market and the benefit of the spring buying season.","In fact, we\u2019ve already seen the improved purchase market benefitting our results with originations for home purchases up 31% this quarter compared with a year ago, and also many of our existing customers can still benefit from a refinance.","We added $309 million to our repurchase reserve this quarter, down $70 million from the fourth quarter.  Our repurchase reserve balance increased to $2.3 billion.  Our repurchase reserve incorporates current demand levels, considers all vintages, and anticipates probable future expected demands.","Our servicing portfolio continued to perform better than the industry.  Our total delinquency and foreclosure rate was 6.54% in the first quarter, down 50 basis points linked quarter and down from 6.89% a year ago.","Turning to expenses, on page 12, first quarter expenses declined $496 million from the fourth quarter, which had included higher operating losses and a contribution to our foundation.  As expected, our first quarter expenses included $460 million of seasonally higher employee benefit expenses from higher payroll taxes and 401k matching, as well as $199 million in annual equity awards from retirement-eligible team members.","In addition to lower operating losses and charitable contributions, we reduced expenses in a number of other areas including occupancy, outside professional services, contract services, and advertising and promotion.  We expect expenses to be lower in the second quarter, reflecting lower employee benefit expenses that were seasonally higher this quarter, but there will be normal growth in other areas, including ongoing investments in our business and normal merit increases.","Our expense efficiency ratio of 58.3% was within our target range of 55% to 59%, and was down 180 basis points from a year ago.  We\u2019ve been focused on reducing expenses for years, as you can see in the impact on our results, but we still believe our expenses are too high, and we can continue to improve our efficiency ratio.  ","Last quarter, we highlighted environmentally elevated cost, and we\u2019ve made progress in reducing these costs this quarter, as shown on slide 13, and we expect them to continue to decline.  We had approximately $50 million of continued costs from the independent foreclosure review this quarter, and these costs will be fully eliminated next quarter.","Foreclosed asset expense was down $26 million from the fourth quarter, and down $109 million from a year ago, reflecting the improvement in the housing market, which we expect will continue.","Mortgage revenue this quarter was reduced by $250 million for additions to our repurchasers reserve, not related to current originations, and was reduced by $58 million to reflect higher servicing and foreclosure costs as some foreclosure timelines continue to extend.  ","Turning to our segment results, starting on page 14, community banking earned $2.9 billion in the first quarter, up 25% from a year ago and up 2% from the fourth quarter.  Retail banking achieved a record cross-sell of 6.1 products per household, up from 5.98 a year ago.  ","To better meet our customers financial needs and improve cross-sell, we continually invest in our business, including new store designs, improved technology, and adding bankers.  We grew platform banker FTE by 1,528 from a year ago, and by 478 in just the first quarter alone.  ","Our credit card business continued to have strong account growth, with a record of 577,000 new accounts in the first quarter, up 18% from a year ago and up 31% from the fourth quarter.  Our household penetration increased to 34.1%, up from 29.9% a year ago.  Credit card balances are down from the fourth quarter, reflecting normal seasonality, but are up 10% from a year ago, reflecting strong account growth.","We also had continual momentum in our auto business and are now the industry\u2019s leading auto lender.  We generated record auto originations in the first quarter of $6.8 billion, up 10% from a year ago, and up 27% from the fourth quarter.","We also successfully met the needs of our small business customers, with business checking accounts up 2.9% from a year ago.  We also extended $4.2 billion of net new loan commitments to small business customers this quarter, up 24% from a year ago.","Wholesale banking earned record net income of $2 billion in the first quarter, up 9% from a year ago and up 1% from the fourth quarter.  Wholesale banking results continued to benefit from steady loan growth, with loans having grown for 10 consecutive quarters.","Industry loan growth remains tepid, but our relationship focus has enabled us to grow market share, and we\u2019ve been able to generate middle-market loan growth for 11 consecutive quarters.  This growth has occurred as we maintained our pricing and risk discipline.","Our risk and underwriting discipline is also reflected in the $8 million in loan loss recoveries in wholesale banking this quarter.  The last time wholesale was in a net recovery position was nearly seven years ago, in the second quarter of 2006.   ","Asset management fees were up 8% from a year ago, and were up 2% from the fourth quarter.  Total assets under management increased $11.4 billion from the fourth quarter, with growth in all asset types.  The growth reflects the benefit from favorable markets and $4.1 billion of net inflows in the first quarter.","Wholesale banking\u2019s continued focus on building relationships resulted in cross-sell of 6.8 products per relationship, up from 6.6 a year ago.  Wealth brokerage and retirement earned $337 million, up 14% from a year ago, driven by strong growth in asset-based fees and higher brokerage transaction revenue.","Earnings were down 4% from the fourth quarter, reflecting seasonally higher personnel expenses and lower net interest income.  Wealth brokerage and retirement has continued to successfully grow client assets, benefitting from improved markets and growing market share.  ","WBR client assets reached a record $1.5 trillion, up 7% from a year ago, including strong growth in retail brokerage managed account assets up $46 billion, or 16%, driven by strong net flows and market performance, as well as growth in average core deposits, up 10% to $149 billion.","The growth in managed account assets in the first quarter will benefit our revenue from advisory fees next quarter, since they are priced on a quarterly lag.  In addition, WBR continued to effectively partner with retail banking to meet all the financial needs of our customers, increasing cross-sell to 10.33 products per household, up from 10.16 a year ago.","Turning to credit quality on page 17, we have significant improvement across our commercial and consumer portfolios.  First quarter net chargeoffs declined to 72 basis points of average loans, the lowest level since the second quarter of 2006.  ","Losses in our commercial portfolio were only $90 million, or 10 basis points of average loans.  Obviously, this is very strong performance, and we would expect commercial losses to remain low, but probably fluctuate around these levels.","Consumer losses declined to 123 basis points, with strong improvement in our real estate secured portfolios.  These portfolios should continue to benefit from our underwriting discipline and the continued improvement in the housing market.  Reflecting this improved credit performance, we released $200 million in loan loss reserves in the first quarter.  Absent a significant deterioration in the economy, we continue to expect future reserve releases in 2013.","Nonperforming assets decreased $1.6 billion from the fourth quarter, and were down $3.8 billion, or 14% from a year ago, with declines in both nonaccrual loans and foreclosed assets.  Loans 90 days or more past due decreased $75 million from the fourth quarter, and were down 17% from a year ago, with improvement in both commercial and consumer loans.  ","Early-stage consumer loan delinquency balances and rates also declined significantly from the fourth quarter and a year ago, with balances down 19%, and with improvements in every portfolio on a linked quarter basis.","As shown on page 19, our capital levels continued to grow.  Our tier one common equity ratio moved to 10.38%, up 26 basis points from the last quarter.  The ratio this quarter was negatively impacted by 25 basis points from the implementation of Basel 2.5, which became effective on January 1.  ","This implementation was reflected in our 2013 CCAR plan and did not impact our ratio under Basel III, as its impact has historically been included in this calculation.  Our estimated tier one common equity ratio under Basel III capital proposals increased to 8.39% in the first quarter.   ","We purchased 16.6 million shares, but issued 39 million shares in the first quarter, which was seasonally high because of employee benefit plan issuances.  Our 2013 capital plan included an increase in common stock repurchases compared with our 2012 repurchases.  ","Our capital plan also included a $0.30 per share second quarter dividend, which we will recommend to our board at our meeting this month.  This would be an increase of 36% over the second quarter dividend last year, and a 20% increase over our first quarter dividend this year, which we had increased to $0.25 a share.","Our diversified model provides us with many opportunities to grow earnings, as highlighted by our 13 consecutive quarters of EPS growth.  On slide 20, we summarize some of the momentum we\u2019ve realized throughout our businesses that I\u2019ve highlighted on the call.  The market share gains, customer growth, increases in loans, deposits, assets under management positions us very well for 2013.","We also have the opportunity to further reduce expenses, benefitting from improvement in credit, and deploy liquidity prudently to meet loan demand or to invest.  In addition, we believe that the housing market will continue to improve, which will not only increase economic growth for our country, but should benefit our revenues, reduce environmentally elevated expenses, and lower losses in our real estate secured portfolios.","In summary, we had exceptional results this quarter, earning more than we\u2019ve ever earned in the history of Wells Fargo.  Our EPS grew by 23% from a year ago, and we reduced expenses by 5%.  Pretax preprovision profit increased 2%, and credit continued to show significant improvement, with losses down 41% and total chargeoffs declining to 72 basis points.","ROA grew to 1.49%, within our targeted range of 1.3% to 1.6%, and ROE increased 13.59%, also within our targeted range of 12% to 15%.  We continue to grow our capital levels while returning more capital to our shareholders by increasing our dividend and continuing to buy back our shares.","We\u2019ll now open up the call for questions.   ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.]  Our first question will come from the line of Erika Penala with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  ","Erika Penala - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","My first question, John, is on your capital priority.  It\u2019s clear that the dividend is on top of the list, and your yield is clearly best in class.  However, I wonder how you think about weighing your buyback opportunities versus strategic opportunities for acquisition.  Because on one hand, most of your shareholders are clamoring for more buyback and to actually see shares outstanding, the count reduced, but on the other, there are not a lot of banks that have your currency.  So I guess if you could give us an insight into how you\u2019re thinking and weighing these issues.  And additionally, does the trajectory of mortgage have anything to do with favoring one strategy over the other?  ","John Stumpf","We have stated publicly, and I know you know this, that our payout ratio, we have targeted 50-65%.  I believe the first call in capital is to grow the business, and we have ample capital to do that and meet those payout targets.","With respect to M&A, remember that the biggest users of capital on an M&A side would be in the deposit side of the franchise, of which of course we are at our federal statutory number, or close to it.  And the acquisitions that we have talked about being interested in would be mostly bolt-on businesses to our existing portfolio suite of the kind of 80 different businesses we do here, and predominantly in the United States.  ","So we\u2019ve done some portfolios in the past.  We\u2019re still interested in things around wealth, help with retirement, but I don\u2019t see that as a huge draw on our capital.  This company is uniquely positioned that we\u2019re producing terrific returns in absolute terms, and in relative terms.  There\u2019s plenty of liquidity and performance there to meet a number of goals.  Again, investing in our business, doing strategic bolt-ons where they make sense, and returning capital to our shareholders at the kind of levels we\u2019ve talked about.","Erika Penala - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","And my follow up question was for Tim.  Speaking of liquidity, I\u2019ve already gotten a few questions in my in box regarding how high your liquidity levels remain.  And obviously deposit growth continues to be strong.  But can you give us a sense in terms of why you\u2019re keeping it at this high of a ratio relative to your earning assets?  Is it you\u2019re afraid of the duration risk?  Does it speak to a question mark on the duration of deposit flows?  Or is it, as John alluded to, warehousing some cash in order to take advantage of some of the bolt-on opportunities that could be out there?   ","Tim Sloan ","That\u2019s a really good question, because our liquidity levels are low.  We view that as a real positive for the company.  Clearly the first call on our liquidity is always going to be for our customers, and we\u2019ve seen good loan growth year over year.  Our core loans are up $50 billion.  But even with that, as you point out, we\u2019ve seen very strong deposit growth.","We did deploy some of that liquidity that wasn\u2019t need for loan growth in the first quarter at a slightly higher rate than what we\u2019ve seen in the last year, when we saw rates back up.  As you\u2019ll recall, we saw rates back up toward the end of the fourth quarter, and we purchased some securities.  They dipped back down and then they backed up again throughout the quarter, and we purchased $17.8 billion of MBS.","Our plan continues to be to make the right long term decisions and the risk risk-adjusted decisions in terms of how we deploy our excess liquidity.  We don\u2019t want to significantly increase duration.  So our liquidity is up.  We view that as a positive, and we\u2019re looking forward to deploying it in the future.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets.","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets","Now that you\u2019re starting to see a more sustained slowdown in mortgage applications, pipeline, and originations, how are you thinking about the headcount in this division?  And have you begun to address some of the variable costs there?","John Stumpf ","","We actually added to the number of team members in the mortgage business in the fourth quarter, because we wanted to improve the customer service in the business.  And we\u2019ve seen a reduction in the time from app to close go from about 90 days to 60 days, which we view as a real positive and a competitive advantage.","The mortgage business is still very strong.  At $109 billion, as we mentioned, it\u2019s our sixth consecutive quarter of originations above $100 billion.  And we started this quarter with a fairly strong pipeline at $74 billion on an absolute basis, and relative to almost most quarters we\u2019ve ever been in business.  ","So the business continues to be strong, and as I mentioned, we also saw an increase in purchase activity in the first quarter, up 31% year over year.  I think the other positives in the business are we\u2019ve now seen an extension of the HARP program and with rates rallying again, we\u2019ve got more customers that could take advantage of a refinance, as well as the fact that as housing values go up, there would be more customers that could potentially take advantage of a refinance.  ","So I think we\u2019re very bullish on the business.  That said, our expectation is that it\u2019s probably likely that revenues and margins will come down a little bit.  All that said, to the extent that it comes down further than we think, we\u2019ll adjust cost as or team has done through various cycles on a number of occasions.","So that may happen this quarter, it may not.  I kind of hope it doesn\u2019t happen, because it means revenues will continue to be growing, so that will be nice.","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets ","I guess along those lines too, what about other opportunities to sustain origination volumes, just given some of the capacity issues you\u2019ve had in recent quarters?  Maybe perhaps more proactively marketing to tap into some of this pent up demand?","Tim Sloan ","I think that\u2019s a really good point, and the way that our team thinks about it, and one of the reasons we want to make sure that we\u2019re adequately staffed is that we do view the purchase market as a big opportunity, and so that as refinancing volume comes down, which it\u2019s come down over the last few quarters, we have our sales folks out there and our bankers out there being more proactive with our customers.","John Stumpf ","","That\u2019s a great point, Tim.  This really plays to our strength, our One Wells Fargo, working as a team.  You know, we have 30,000-plus bankers in our stores.  Not every one of our customers who call us their bank has their mortgage with us, and we\u2019ve kept our relationships with our realtor friends and our builder friends during the big refi time, and this is really where it pays off.  And in Tim\u2019s comments, he mentioned that purchase volume is up 31% year over year, so that\u2019s really important for us.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.  ","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit, Tim, on the factors that helped keep the mortgage gain on sale flat at very healthy levels this quarter?  And what will be the puts and takes on that going forward, if you have any outlook there?","Tim Sloan  ","Good question, because at 2.56%, it\u2019s historically high, and really right on top of what we saw in the fourth quarter.  Recall that our accounting convention is to recognize most of the gain on sale when we book the loan, and so the primary secondary spread changes in the quarter, and rate movements was really beneficial.","I think in terms of outlook, let me throw some numbers at you, and then you can conclude what you think the right gain on sale margin might be.  If you look over the last four years, and I\u2019m going to use some yearly averages, the highest average we had was not surprisingly in 2012, which was 2.33%.  The lowest average that we had, which was in 2011, was 1.61%.","And so when you step back and look at 2.56%, I think it\u2019s reasonable, as we said in the fourth quarter, to assume that the gain on sale is going to come down.  My guess is it will probably end up somewhere in the range of between 1.61% and 2.33%.  But I don\u2019t know exactly where it\u2019s going to be within that range.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ","In terms of the mortgage put backs, at what point will you know it\u2019s okay to start using some of that reserve.  With the credit we could see when the inflows flow and you start to see chargeoffs come down and [unintelligible].  On the put back front, when do you start maybe consuming or stop needing to add to that reserve?","Tim Sloan ","Well, I hope it\u2019s sooner rather than later, and I don\u2019t know for sure, but when we think about our mortgage repurchase reserve, we not only look at what the current demands are, but also what expected demands are.  And so it has come down now for the last three or four quarters, which we\u2019re pleased with.  But we just haven\u2019t seen that yet.  We need to be very comfortable that not only current demands but also future expected demands are going to come down.  Hopefully it will be in the next few quarters.","John Stumpf ","You know, John, an improving housing market sure is a good sign regarding that issue.  It\u2019s not the only thing that influences it, but that\u2019s good news.  ","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ","And Tim, one quick follow up on the share count issue.  You know that shareholders are hoping to see the share count come down, and it hasn\u2019t yet, and we know in 2013 your plan involves more buybacks.  So I guess the question is does it also involve more issuance?  Or do you hope to kind of have the same issuance as you did last year such that your net share count would come down this year given that you\u2019ve done more buybacks?","Tim Sloan ","I certainly appreciate that share count is a big focus.  Candidly, earnings per share is a bigger focus for us, and we\u2019ve been pleased to be able to grow that for the last 13 quarters.  I think that when you think about the fact that last year we repurchased 120 million shares, the likelihood - again, this is a function of our share price that we repurchase shares at - the likelihood is that we will probably repurchase more shares than we did last year, and probably repurchase more shares than we issue.  And we\u2019ll know in a year.  ","But again, our primary focus is going to be growing earnings per share.  But make no mistake, our capital plan calls for an increase in total share repurchase dollars versus what we did last year.  And we are going to be repurchasing our shares at a greater rate this year than last.  ","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ","And one quick follow up on, somebody said January, I think you said that in January you hope to grow net interest income dollars even though it\u2019s a tough environment and you\u2019ve got some pressure on spreads and things like that.  You\u2019re focused on the net interest income dollars, and you\u2019re having some earning asset growth.  I know in the first quarter you had day count pressuring the NII dollars, but do you still hope to grow that in 2013?","Tim Sloan ","Yes, we did.  I think that when you look at net interest income we could have had the same conversation a year ago and had the same concerns, and they would have been absolutely valid.  But last year we were able to grow our net interest income by over $500 million.  And our expectation is that we should be able to grow it this year.  Again, it\u2019s harder to see this quarter, because of the two fewer days, but if you step back and look at the last three quarters, you can see that notwithstanding the decline in net interest margin, that the net interest income has more or less bottomed at about $10.6 billion.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank.  ","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank","Just following up on the net interest income dollar question, as you think about the relationship of balance sheet growth and the NIM percent, do we get an acceleration in the balance sheet growth?  Or do we get less NIM pressure to drive those dollars higher?  How would you envision that playing out?","Tim Sloan ","Well, recall that the primary driver for the decline in the net interest margin, just look over the last three years, 12 quarters.  The decline has been 79 basis points.  Almost three-quarters of that decline has been driven by the fact that deposits are growing.  Again, we view that as a very positive sign for the long term growth of the company.  When you pull that out, that net differential is really the decline in overall margin.  ","So my bet is that if we see further net interest margin decline, it\u2019s probably more likely going to be driven by deposit growth than by margins.  But there\u2019s no question that the net interest margin in this interest rate environment, as the balance sheet reprices, continues to be under pressure.  But again, let me emphasize, we believe that we can grow net interest income just like we did last year, year over year, even in this environment.  ","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank ","And then separately, the chargeoffs came down sharply, and you commented both on the commercial piece and kind of broadly speaking on the consumer.  But the level that we\u2019re at on the real estate related areas in the consumer, is this kind of a clean level, or did some of the up-fronting of charge offs in the second half of last year related to regulatory changes, did that impact these numbers at all?","Tim Sloan ","No, and I wouldn\u2019t describe it as up fronting.  Clearly there was some OCC guidance that we had for a portion of the portfolio that we needed to address, and others in the industry addressed this.  I would view this as the charge off level and the credit performance as just being terrific.  And I don\u2019t believe that this is the bottom in terms of consumer loan losses.  ","Again, the commercial losses are a little bit different story.  At 10 basis points, it doesn\u2019t take a lot of change to increase those or even decrease them a little bit.  But in terms of consumer loan losses at 123 basis points, our guess is that assuming the economy continues to improve, and assuming that we\u2019re going to continue to see an improvement in the residential housing market, which we think\u2019s going to happen, we should continue to see a decline.  ","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank ","And then just last clarification.  You talked about the tax rate bouncing up a little bit.  What number should we be using for the rest of the year?","Tim Sloan ","Well, I don\u2019t know what the number\u2019s going to be.  We just wanted to make sure that you all didn\u2019t use the tax rate in the first quarter and then just annualize it.  I think it will be closer to more historical levels that we\u2019ve seen in other quarters or other years where we haven\u2019t had some tax benefit like we had in the fourth quarter.","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank ","Okay, so maybe 32-33%, if I look at the last three years?","Tim Sloan ","Yeah, that\u2019s a reasonable range.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. ","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse ","You alluded the purchase mortgage market kind of stepping up, but isn\u2019t the scale kind of tough, just given how much of your originations are refis right now?  I guess if we look at, let\u2019s say, projections to the industry, how should we think about your market share and what that would mean for originations for the balance of the year?","Tim Sloan  ","I think you make a very fair point, and we didn\u2019t mean by pointing out that purchase money activity was up 31% year over year that that in and of itself is going to take the place of the decline in refinance volume.  Because as we\u2019ve said, and you\u2019ve seen in our numbers, that our total mortgage volumes are coming down.  I think what we\u2019re seeing is that they\u2019re not coming down maybe as fast as some folks might have thought, because of the improvement in the purchase money market.  ","I think it\u2019s also factual that when you look at the market share that we have in the refinance market, it\u2019s higher because of the size of our servicing portfolio than it would be in the purchased money market, but again, that\u2019s why we want to make sure that we have more folks in the business being proactive with our customers so that we can grow our purchase money activity.  John, I don\u2019t know if you want to comment?","John Stumpf ","The way we think about this, we think this is a really important consumer product, and we have made investments in this business and have performed through a variety of cycles.  We happen to think now, yes, no question, that there will be less refinancing.  A lot of people have done their refinancing.  But even in that area, the average rate in our servicing portfolio is just shy of 4.7%.  The Street rate is, depending on the day, 100 basis points less than that.  So there is still refinance volume.  ","But on the purchased money side, we\u2019re going into the stronger selling season now.  We have over 6,000 banking stores with bankers who are dealing with customers every day.  We have 10,000 plus home mortgage consultants out with their relationships.  And we will get our share, hopefully plus some.  And if it\u2019s not there, we can adjust quickly, because we have the experience, to bring our costs down and reflect that.  ","But remember, housing is improving every day.  More people have more equity in their homes.  Americans have not lost their emotional attachment to home ownership.  It can\u2019t be for everyone, but we want to be there, help as many customers as we possibly can.  We like this business a lot. ","Tim Sloan  ","And Moshe, let me just give you a couple of other numbers to put it in perspective.  A year ago our pipeline, starting in the second quarter, was $79 billion, and now we\u2019re at $74 billion.  And 35% of that $74 billion pipeline is purchased money activity.  And that\u2019s an increase from about 24% a year ago.  So it is having some impact, which we\u2019re very excited about.","John Stumpf ","And the overall market, the overall purchase, still it\u2019s low by historical standards.  A normal market is a pretty good market for us.","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse  ","Two quick follow ups.  One is your correspondent share fell this quarter and JPMorgan reported today that the number two player there is moving up.  Can you talk about what your thought process is and maybe kind of related to the issue of whether you\u2019re thinking about selling either actual MSRs or a servicing strip, if that asset were to increase from here?","Tim Sloan ","The decline in share in the correspondent business, there wasn\u2019t anything in particular going on.  I think it\u2019s just a very competitive market.  But as it relates to the MSR, you probably saw this week that we did sell some reverse mortgage MSR.  ","I wouldn\u2019t describe that as a strategic change in terms of our thought about the overall MSR.  That just reflects the fact that we got out of that business, originating those loans, a couple of years ago, and we thought it was prudent to continue to reduce our servicing activity in that business.  There\u2019s really been no change in our view of the MSR.  It\u2019s still an important asset for the company, and from time to time we may decide to sell, but again, I wouldn\u2019t read too much into the sale of the reverse mortgage MSR. ","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets.","Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets "," ","You know, I don\u2019t want to keep harping on the mortgage, but we saw yesterday that HARP got extended for two years, and I think you guys said publicly that you think the bulk of your HARP, you\u2019ve already originated or refinanced the bulk of your HARP.  Do you think that, if there is a good, solid PR program from the White House to get people off the sidelines, and the two year extension, do you think you could see another wave of HARP mortgages done?","Tim Sloan ","I don\u2019t know if it will be another wave.  Our HARP originations in the first quarter were 10%, which was down from the midteens that we saw last year.  I think this is a positive.  The HARP program has been a very successful program.  I think the numbers nationwide are over 2.2 million homeowners have been able to refinance via HARP.  So it\u2019s been a successful program.  I don\u2019t think it will be a new wave, but continuation is very good.","Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets ","And then the follow up on the securities portfolio, was that actually being optimistic on the rates going up, because you feel rates are going to remain relatively flat?  Or is it something where when we see rates going up we could see the portfolio grow in that category?","Tim Sloan","I think if we see rates go up from here, you could see us being as active as we were in the first quarter.  We\u2019ve got a fairly, on a percentage basis, and also absolute levels, a pretty sizable backup in the first quarter.  If you\u2019ll recall, there were some days when the 10-year was above 220, and MBS was very attractive.  And from our perspective, given the amount of liquidity that we have, and given that we want to maintain a pretty steady duration and we don\u2019t want to take excessive credit risk, it just makes sense to take advantage of those opportunities.  We\u2019re not going to deploy all of it on one day, but again, given our liquidity, to be able to deploy $17.8 billion in the quarter on an opportunistic basis was very good from our perspective.","John Stumpf ","You know, as Tim mentioned, I think, in his comments, this is really, we think, a strength for the company, to have the kind of liquidity available.  And we make risk-return decisions every day.  And when we think it\u2019s favorable and in our shareholders\u2019 interest, we will deploy that.  And if we don\u2019t think the right risk-return ratio is there, we\u2019re willing to pass.  And we don\u2019t have to do something.  But this is a source of strength.","Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets ","Does it surprise you guys a little bit, because I know it does me.  We\u2019re seeing the housing market start to pick up, we\u2019re seeing home builders building homes.  But there\u2019s still really not a lot of loan growth being created.  Do you see that changing over the next couple of quarters?","Tim Sloan ","Do you mean loan growth for home builders or for consumers?","Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets ","No, just for the overall economy.  I mean, that\u2019s one of the areas of activity we\u2019re seeing, but it doesn\u2019t seem like they\u2019re materializing in the overall economy.","Tim Sloan ","Well, I wouldn\u2019t jump to any conclusions about loan growth in the industry in the first quarter.  If you look at the HA data, for the last few years the first quarter tends to be a seasonally low quarter, and what I would do, and again, this is just me, I\u2019d take the first quarter decline for the industry and also then add to that the fourth quarter that we saw last quarter increase and probably average those together.  And remember, the fourth quarter of last year was extremely high, because of some of the changes and decisions that folks were making because of the potential changes in taxes and the code and so on.  So again, I think what we\u2019re seeing in the industry is a steady loan growth if you average over the last few years at about one-ish percent on a quarterly basis.  We\u2019ve been fortunate because we\u2019ve been able to grow at a multiple of that.","John Stumpf ","","If you look at some of the drivers, if you look at household formation, if you look at cost of financing, cost of housing, there\u2019s a lot of tailwinds, a lot of favorable attributes.  Now, nobody can predict what\u2019s going to happen, but if anything today there\u2019s probably a shortage of housing on the market.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.  ","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Just on your last comment, shortage of housing in the market, that\u2019s a pretty powerful statement.  Is there any specific geographies that you\u2019re seeing that in?","John Stumpf ","It\u2019s not true in every market and at every price range, but when I\u2019m out talking with realtors and customers, the amount of supply, especially in the lower end or starter houses, there\u2019s not a lot of supply out there.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ","","Obviously that has some powerful implications for your business model over the next year or so, as long as we keep rates low.  And I guess that\u2019s kind of my question.  Do you feel like part of this housing improvement that we\u2019re seeing is a function of where rates are?  Clearly, at 3.7%, 3.3%, in that range, that\u2019s got to be fueling part of the boom here.  And to what degree are you building your business based on the current interest rate environment?  How do you protect yourself for the Fed deciding to stop QE3?  ","John Stumpf ","I would say the housing market is as much driven by confidence and by improvements in values as it is with rates.  I don\u2019t know of many people are on the sidelines and say, \u201cI\u2019ll only buy a house if the rate\u2019s 3.25%, and I won\u2019t buy at 4.25%.\u201d  I think it\u2019s about jobs, about confidence, about feeling good about where things are going.  Think about when you buy a house, it\u2019s what you make, what the house costs, and what your financing costs are that are the big three.  But housing is improving at different levels, but virtually everywhere we see in the country.","Tim Sloan ","And then the second part of your question, which is related to the interest rate risk and how do we protect ourselves, we\u2019re actually positioned very well over the medium and longer term to benefit from an increase in interest rates.  Again, as long as it\u2019s not such a large increase that it negatively affects economic growth.  But we\u2019re positioned very well, and it\u2019s one of the reasons why we continue to maintain the level of liquidity that we have.  ","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ","Great, and can I just follow up on one other thing?  I think you mentioned earlier on that you\u2019re not planning on retaining any more of the conventional production as you have over the last couple of quarters.  And I guess I\u2019m just wondering how you get to that decision.  Gain on sale coming down over the next couple of quarters, I would think it would tip in favor of retaining versus securitizing, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019re thinking of a broader range of inputs than that.  Maybe you can help us understand your logic.","Tim Sloan ","That\u2019s a good question.  Recall that the primary driver for the reason why we wanted to hold some of our first mortgage production in the third and fourth quarters of last year was because interest rates and investment alternatives, given the level of liquidity, were just very unattractive from our perspective, if you think about where rates were in almost all categories in the third quarter and the fourth quarter last year.  That\u2019s the primary driver, not necessarily the gain on sale margin.  ","So as we looked at the first quarter, and we mentioned this last quarter, we saw the opportunity to invest because rates seemed like they were backing up and we took advantage of that rather than hold our first mortgage production.  So that\u2019s going to be the driver.  It\u2019s investment alternatives, not gain on sale margins.  ","But certainly, if, for whatever reason, rates would really rally from here, and we could see a repeat of the third and the fourth quarter, we would reconsider holding some of those mortgages again.  That remains an option, and that\u2019s another strength of the business.","John Stumpf ]","Correct.  We don\u2019t preclude that.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ","Yeah, because you did get it back up, obviously, in rates and [unintelligible].  So you\u2019ll be nimble is basically what you\u2019re saying.  ","John Stumpf ","Correct.  As nimble as we can be.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.  ","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Back to net interest income, and you said that\u2019s a focus, but at least linked quarter it stunk, and I know the day count, and you seem pretty confident that $10.6 billion is the bottom.  And I\u2019m just trying to figure out what would make you so confident.  Would it be anything to do with the accretable yield going forward, given better credit quality?  The balance sheet repricing?  Maybe [unintelligible] 2 basis points.  You feel better there?  Or is it just really just you added all these securities opportunistically and that will play out for a full quarter, and we should see that in the second quarter?","Tim Sloan ","Well, I\u2019m always careful not to disagree with you, but I wouldn\u2019t say that $10.4 billion of net interest income stunk.  I mean, it was down, but if you just added two extra days, and that\u2019s an issue with the calendar, it would have been $10.6 billion.  And we actually think, in the environment, when you look at the entire industry, that that was very good performance.  ","But having said that, I think that the answer to your second question is it\u2019s all of the above.  We have consistently been able to grow our loans at a multiple of what the market\u2019s growing.  That\u2019s number one.  And number two, we\u2019re going to continue to take advantage and deploy our liquidity when we see rates back up like we did in the first quarter and we bought $17.8 billion worth of securities.  ","And so again, we could have had the same conversation - I think we actually did - about a year ago, when we looked at where rates were, and where loan growth was.  The industry was coming off a seasonal low, just like it is this quarter.  And so our perspective is that we can grow net interest income and the next quarter we\u2019ll see if we were able to do it.  But that\u2019s our goal.","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","And of the securities that you put on, was that mostly the latter part of the quarter, the early part?  In other words, do we actually see it in the numbers?","Tim Sloan ","Yeah, that\u2019s a good question.  Recall that when we talked about our first quarter earnings, we gave some specific guidance that we had purchased some MBS at the end of December when rates backed up a fair amount.  And then you saw a rally again.  They backed up again in early January, and we were purchasers.  And then it kind of went back and forth a bit, and then we saw a nice backup about a month or so ago, and so we were pretty active, which is why the average was less than what the total purchases were.  And so you\u2019re going to see more of the benefit of those purchases as we go through this quarter.","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","Got it.  And then the second question relates to the efficiency target.  You are on the upper end of your target range, and there\u2019s the article today talking about your new mini branches.  And I know you\u2019ve talked about that in the past.  Now it seems like the execution phase.  Can you just give some sense of how many of your 6,000 branches might go to this mini form, if it\u2019s correct that they cost half as much, and any other color that you can give?","John Stumpf ","Sure, in fact, I was in Washington this last week, and went by and actually toured our first neighborhood store.  You think of it as a branch.  And it\u2019s a terrific combination of using technology and convenience, both for hours and after hours, so it really is a dual purpose that way.  ","You know, our view around distribution is that it\u2019s more of a distribution community where you have stores and ATMs and online and mobile, and phones all working together.  And that\u2019s part of the magic of how we deepen, cross-sell, and how we build customer loyalty.  We don\u2019t have a plan per se that says so many of the neighborhood versus so many of traditional.  But they all work, because even our millennial customers who are much more skewed towards self-service and mobile devices still want and need stores.  ","And in some places, you can\u2019t get a 3,000 or 4,000 square foot space, where 1,000 square feet works just as well, in fact better.  And so look for us to do more.  It\u2019s a test and learn kind of mode.  And it\u2019s going to help us grow and deepen the relationships.   ","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Marty Mosby with Guggenheim.  ","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim","My question kind of focuses on the operating expenses, and you talked about the seasonal impact.  If I kind of add those up, it\u2019s about $750 million in that number related to the seasonal uptick in first quarter.  That kind of starts to roll out as you move to the next quarter, but you mentioned the merit increase.  I didn\u2019t know how much.  If you could just give us some proportion of the $750 million that might get used up in the merit increase as you go to the second quarter.","Tim Sloan ","Oh, it could be a few hundred million dollars more.  I wouldn\u2019t take that $750 million and just deduct it and say that\u2019s going to be the second quarter.  We\u2019re going to have an impact for merit.  I think we\u2019re also going to continue to invest in both people as well as technology and products.  So we want to continue to grow the franchise.  So I wouldn\u2019t just deduct that and call that our expenses for the second quarter.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim ","And then when you look at the net chargeoff rate dropping as significantly as it did, our provision number that you kind of came through with was pretty consistent with what we were expecting, but the composition was so different in the sense of net chargeoffs being lower, and release of a recapture of loan loss allowance being a lot less.  Did the lower net chargeoffs and improvement in nonperformers eventually start bleeding through in the recapture?  Or how do you kind of see that playing out in the sense of the magnitude going forward?","Tim Sloan  ","We\u2019ll, I think you make a fair point, and that\u2019s one of the reasons why we reiterated that we do expect in the future to continue to see reserve releases absent some big deterioration in the economy.  So our expectation is that we will see more releases and again, it\u2019s going to be a function of the improving credit.  And we\u2019ve seen that now consistently.  I think one of the important things to remember is that our reserve release is a relatively small part of our total earnings.  I think it\u2019s less than 5% this quarter.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim ","Exactly.  And lastly, I just wanted to ask you about, you know, a $74 billion pipeline.  Typically seasonally there\u2019s kind of a swoon in applications and activity, and that starts to pick back up as we get into spring and summer.  That would be kind of a pull through, that you could see originations still kind of hovering in the hundred billion dollar range given kind of your starting point is already three-fourths of the way there for the quarter.  Just thought I\u2019d ask your thoughts there.","Tim Sloan ","Well, Marty, I think you\u2019re correct in that the pipeline was very strong.  It was about what we saw a year ago at this time.  And again, I think that the complexion of the pipeline is a little bit different because a bigger percentage relates to purchased money activity.  I don\u2019t know what the originations are going to be for the quarter.  ","I think the other thing to remember, and I referred to it, probably could have been a little bit clearer, and that is that we have an appropriate level of staffing to take advantage of opportunities out there in the mortgage business.  That\u2019s allowed us to reduce the application to close period from about 90 days to 60 days.  And so you can\u2019t really see that in the numbers, but that would portend some pretty good origination activity.  But in terms of what the number is going to be, we don\u2019t know for sure.   ","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Greg Ketron with UBS.   ","Greg Ketron - UBS","A question on servicing.  I know you\u2019ve touched on this a number of different ways, but when you think about servicing going forward and where it\u2019s valued today, at around 70 basis points, if you just look at the residential side of it, and anticipate the rates do drift higher, if you have a slowdown of prepayment speeds, potentially you could see a pretty sizable writeup in MSR valuations, $5-6 billion if we got back to 100-110 basis points ultimately.  Would it be your anticipation that you would recognize most of that or hedge that away as that develops?  Could that be a future source of income in terms of running the balanced mortgage model?","Tim Sloan  ","It certainly could.  I don\u2019t know if I would necessarily agree with the $5-6 billion, but certainly we could see an increase in value of the servicing asset as rates go up.  I\u2019d also just want to make clear that as housing values go up, when you think about modeling that out, that also potentially has a negative impact on the servicing value because it\u2019s more likely that our customers could refinance as valuations go up.  So there\u2019s a little bit of a put and take there.","But there\u2019s no question that one of the benefits of the balanced model is that when you\u2019ve got a servicing asset and rates go up, it becomes more valuable.  So that could be a source of earnings in the future.","Greg Ketron - UBS ","Okay, that stuff you wouldn\u2019t necessarily hedge away given the fact that you\u2019re in the balanced model?","Tim Sloan ","We want to make sure that we\u2019ve got the mortgage servicing asset appropriately hedged, and we\u2019re not going to speculate in interest rates in terms of how we hedge that asset, because we could just as well be right as wrong.  So my guess is that we will get some benefit, but it\u2019s not as if we\u2019re going to make a decision one morning to completely unhedged the portfolio because we think that rates are going to go up.  That would be a very, very bad decision.","John Stumpf ","Let me just reiterate what Tim said here.  Part of our balanced model is we don\u2019t speculate.  We don\u2019t try to speculate in this business around where we think interest rates are going to go.  We could have been sitting here a year ago and said they have to be going up.  And actually they went down.  So the balanced model is more around when rates are higher, we have more value in the servicing asset, and when rates are lower, we tend to do more gain on sale with production.  So surely those two are related to one another, but we\u2019re not in the business of taking a view on rates and then adjusting the hedge accordingly.","Greg Ketron - UBS ","And then John, a question for you.  At investor day last year you had spent time talking about the Wachovia franchise in the eastern U.S., and how you had the opportunity there, and as you achieved the record earnings and the positive growth and the revenues in areas such as wealth management.  Can you give us some color on how that\u2019s progressing, what kind of leverage you are receiving out of the Wachovia franchise at this point, and maybe percentage of the way through that optimization?","John Stumpf ","First of all, I want to tip my hat to all the team members who helped make that merger the best one I\u2019ve been around, and it was the largest, of course, in U.S. bank history.  And it\u2019s so rewarding to see the activity happening in the east with adding stores, adding team members in stores.  ","In fact, if you look at productivity numbers, sales per day, referrals, cross-sell, the gap is closing rapidly.  In fact, some of the best innovations and ideas we\u2019re getting now for future growth come from our newest team members.  In fact, it\u2019s hard to distinguish east and west anymore.  It\u2019s quite pluralistic in its performance.  So it\u2019s hard for me to give a percentage.  I think we can get better across the franchise.  ","But I just couldn\u2019t be happier with it.  And if I had to pick a percentage I\u2019d say, you know, well into the final quartile of performance closing.  It\u2019s just been that good.  And we continue to add people there, incidentally.   ","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Chris Mustascio with KBW.  ","Chris Mustascio - KBW","I had a follow up on the MSR.  When you look at the MSR, and the black box accounting that goes around it, it certainly looks like, from a historical perspective, it\u2019s undervalued.  I\u2019m not sure we\u2019d get back to the 150 level of loan service relative to back in 2006.  But it certainly looks undervalued relative to historical perspectives.  And I know you had looked at it as a natural hedge or a partial hedge to production activity in a balanced approach.  ","But what if that black box accounting creates a timing difference between when that asset is written up and when the production and gain on sale starts to fall?  If that occurs, would you consider more strategic sales of MSRs rather than the kind of nonstrategic sale of the reverse mortgage portfolio you just did, in order to harvest the gains that you can\u2019t harvest from an accounting perspective?","Tim Sloan ","Let me just push back a little bit in that we don\u2019t consider the accounting in and around the MSRs black box accounting.  We follow generally accepted accounting principles that are reviewed both internally and externally, and we think they\u2019re very sound.  I know there are some commentators that are out there that get confused by generally accepted accounting principles and think that they\u2019re hard to follow, but they\u2019re not.","Having said that, I think the fundamental part of your question is that when we look at the servicing business, it\u2019s a really good business.  The servicing business has been so valuable for us over the last few years, but in particular it\u2019s been very valuable over the last couple of years because of the fact that it\u2019s put us in the position to be able to originate as many refinance opportunities as we have been, which has just been terrific.  ","The capital implications of the MSR, given the new Basel III capital rules, creates an overlay over the asset itself in that it could be, in certain circumstances, a potential deduct to capital levels.  And that\u2019s just something that we need to take into consideration, and it\u2019s something we think a lot about.  And as we\u2019ve said, from time to time, it may make sense to consider selling some of the MSR.  We\u2019ve sold servicing in the past, we\u2019ve sold the reverse mortgage part of the reverse mortgage MSR this last week, which we were pleased with.  ","So that could happen from time to time, but it doesn\u2019t change our view that the servicing business is a very important business for the company and is very valuable at all times, but in particular the period we\u2019ve been through.","Chris Mustascio - KBW ","","Thanks.  I wasn\u2019t suggesting that you\u2019re performing black box accounting.  The point being that the yield on that portfolio being as low as it is, probably has never been lower, that the inherent value of that asset over time is certainly going to be higher than what\u2019s on the balance sheet today.","Tim Sloan ","Oh, completely agree.  Just wanted to clarify, that\u2019s all.  ","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous Research.  ","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research","Just on the gain on sale outlook, I recognize correspondent is a lower gain on sale than retail.  But would you expect them to come down by about the same magnitude over the course of the cycle?  Or is one channel likely to outperform the other?","Tim Sloan ","I think if you looked at the gain on sale historically, it\u2019s been all over the place, on a comparative basis, between the two channels.  My best guess is they\u2019ll probably come down at the same level, but I don\u2019t know for sure.","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research ","And then just one follow up on kind of the general comments about housing improvement.  When we look at the pick-a-pay portfolio and where it\u2019s marked in the accretion, is there any kind of background you can give us on the home price assumptions embedded in that, or just more generally, if your positive view of housing comes to fruition, would the pick-a-pay portfolio perform based on the current schedule accretion?  Or does that represent upside to the current schedule of accretion?","Tim Sloan ","","I think it represents some upside.  And we were very clear when we brought nonaccretable to accretable and updated the estimate of cash flows last year in the third quarter, that if we continued to see an improvement in not only the housing market but also in terms of the performance of the underlying asset, because that\u2019s a very important part of the valuation, that we could see some upside.  That didn\u2019t happen this quarter, but given the continued improvement, it certainly could over the next few quarters.","John Stumpf ","","As I mentioned in my comments, we have a positive view, sure in the near term outlook, about steady gains in home sales, billing activity, and price appreciation.  We\u2019re seeing that in most of the markets, or frankly the lion\u2019s share of the markets.  And when that happens, good things happen here on all things related to real estate.  It\u2019s better for our home equity portfolio, for our reverse mortgage portfolio.  It\u2019s better for production activity at the mortgage company.  So surely things are improving.","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research  ","And lastly, just if I read it right, I think there was a sale of some of the PCI loans that kind of pulled forward the accretion.  With a rising market, would you continue to sell some of the PCI loans, or is that just a one-off?","John Stumpf ","","We\u2019ll look at that opportunistically.  We had a $150 million gain from that.  We find opportunities.  We surely will do what we think makes most sense for our portfolio and for our stockholders.","Tim Sloan ","I think just to reinforce that, we marked this portfolio four years ago, and we just could not be more pleased with the performance.  And the expectations will change over time, but if there\u2019s an opportunity to pull through some of our forecasted accretion, we\u2019re going to go ahead and do that.  ","Operator","Your final question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company","I just want to ask a bigger picture expense question.  A couple of the pieces have been asked, but Tim, you mentioned that expenses are still too high.  We know about the seasonality that can happen from first to second, and we know you\u2019ll make adjustments against the mortgage business.  So what I wanted to try to understand is when you say that expenses are still too high, what can you do to work on that underneath?  How much from [Project Compass] is still there to just recognize?  And then what areas are you actually investing in, and what\u2019s the magnitude of that investment versus what you can do to control things otherwise?","Tim Sloan ","","Again, I think that the focus of the company is to improve our expense efficiency, and so when we say that expenses are too high, given the current level of revenue, we think that we can improve our efficiency, which is why we have that range of 55-59%.  ","There\u2019s no one kind of magic change that we can make, that if we can just get through a certain project that it will get us down to 55%.  It\u2019s really a function of lots of projects all around the company.  It\u2019s improving the efficiency of our corporate properties and all of our square footage.  It\u2019s using technology to reduce cost in our businesses.  ","And so sometimes there\u2019s some investment related to that.  It\u2019s continuing to make sure that our folks are all in the appropriate locations.  And it\u2019s little things.  There\u2019s literally hundreds of projects going on right now in the company such that we\u2019re focused on reducing cost.  So I\u2019d love to be able to give you two big items, but it\u2019s just not really the way it works, now that we\u2019re done with the integration.  ","But I would also reinforce that apart and separate from the proactive projects that we have, the environmental costs are continuing to come down, so that we see, with an improving economy, particularly an improving residential mortgage business, that we could see continued improvement in our environmental costs apart and separate from anything else we\u2019re doing internally.  John, I don\u2019t know if you want to\u2026","John Stumpf ","I\u2019d add that we are making investments, and we want to continue to make those investments.  And we won\u2019t be, as I said before, slavish to anything here, because for example we\u2019re doing wonderful, innovative things to help customers on things mobile and tablet-wise.  We just talked a few minutes ago about our neighborhood store.  We\u2019re making investments, frankly, in compliance and governance, all kinds of different things.  ","On the other hand, some things, just because you did it that way for 20 years doesn\u2019t mean you need to do it for the next 20 years.  And we\u2019re finding different ways to improve customer service, customer loyalty, deepening relationships, at the same time getting rid of expenses that don\u2019t add value.  ","Tim mentioned a few seconds ago just space.  Four years ago, we had about 115-116 million square feet.  Now we\u2019re down to 95-98 million square feet.  It\u2019s down 10-12%.  And yet we have more people, more customers, more products, more services.  And I think that\u2019s the magic here.  We continue to invest, but we do all agree we can still do more.  And this is a bottoms-up exercise, and it\u2019s just part of doing business.  There\u2019s no destination here.  This is a journey.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company ","An adjunct to that is then just a lot of the things you just mentioned, John, are very much about deepening relationships with customers and improving the experience.  Are there any parts of the investment cycle that are now also paying off on a clear incremental revenue side?  Because I think that\u2019s part of the investment process that people also want to appreciate too.  What are the investments that you\u2019re making that you\u2019re actively getting operating leverage off of?","John Stumpf  ","For example, adding more bankers in stores and getting referrals to the mortgage company.  Having ATMs that give paperless receipts.  Taking paper out of stores and not having to have as many Brink\u2019s pickups.  The way people can now buy products and services on their mobile devices and other self-service activities.  It\u2019s a number of things that help reinforce just when, where, and how people want to be serviced.  ","There\u2019s actually a lot of innovation going on in the industry.  More of it happens to be within creating this distribution community, whether it be on the small business, large business, consumer side, as opposed to a different whiz bang kind of product.  It\u2019s much more about the overall service. and availability.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company ","","And then last tiny thing, just to follow up with Brian\u2019s last question.  When you mentioned the potential for nonaccretable differences to be moved back into accretable yield, is any of that potential in your outlook for improving NII this year?","Tim Sloan ","No, not really, because recall that in the third quarter of last year when we made the adjustment, and removed some of the nonaccretable to accretable, and also increased our expectation of cash flows, even though when you totaled it up it was over $4 billion in total, because the average life of the underlying loans is 12-plus years, the incremental increase in terms of net interest income or net interest margin in a given quarter is actually relatively small.  It will have some impact, but it\u2019s not a primary driver for why we think net interest income can go up in this environment.  ","John Stumpf  ","","Thanks again.  We ran over a little here, but thank you for your interest in Wells Fargo, and for your questions.  We\u2019re always available to you, and we\u2019ll see you next quarter at the same time.  Thank you.

My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo fourth quarter earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question and answer session [Operator Instructions].","I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Rowe, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Rowe, you may begin your conference.","Jim Rowe","Thank you, Regina. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our President and CEO, Tim Sloan and our CFO, John Shrewsberry, will discuss fourth quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our fourth quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our Web site at wellsfargo.com.","I\u2019d also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement.","Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our Web site.","I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Tim Sloan.","Tim Sloan","Thank you Jim. Good morning and Happy New Year. Thank you all for joining us today, I know it\u2019s been a very busy morning for most of you. Our results in 2016 demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model with loan and deposit balances at an all-time high while we maintained a strong risk discipline. Last few months of the year certainly were challenging, I couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the hard work and progress of our team -- that our team made to rebuild trust which I'll highlight shortly. But first I want to summarize our financial performance for the past year. We generated earning of $21.9 billion and EPS of $3.99 a share. We grew revenue by 3% including 5% growth in net interest income. Average loans grew $64.5 billion, up 7% and average deposits increased $56.5 billion, up 5%.","Wealth and investment management total client assets reached a record high of $1.7 trillion, up 7%. Our credit results continued to be strong with net charge off rate of 37 basis points. We returned $12.5 billion to our shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases and we reduced our common shares outstanding by 76 million shares.","On Page 3 we describe the progress we\u2019ve made on our retail banking sales practices remediation plan, including contacting our retail and small business customers and encouraging anyone who has concerns to contact us. We established a sales practice consent order program office reporting directly to our Chief Risk Officer which is undertaking actions to meet the requirements of the consent orders that were issued as part of the settlements in September.","As part of this effort we submitted a Reimbursement and Redress Plan to the OCC and the CFPB in December. We refunded a total of $3.2 million to customers including the 2.6 million that was part of our original analysis. As part of the consent orders work is now under way to expand the time periods of our review to cover the beginning of 2011 and the period through September 2016 and we've hired an independent consultant to evaluate sales practices. We've also gone beyond the requirements of the sales prices consent orders as part of our effort to make things right for our customers including a nationwide mediation program at no cost to our customers.","In addition we've begun the data analysis to review 2009 and 2010 for potentially unauthorized accounts and we've engaged a separate third party consultant to evaluate sales practices more broadly across Wells Fargo. We are leaving no stone unturned so that we can emerge from this a better stronger company.","We've also made progress on evaluating potentially unauthorized credit card accounts including any impact to customers' credit scores and analysis of credit signatures to verify authorization. We want to identify anyone who was negatively impacted so we can make things right. We've accomplished a lot over the past few months but we still have a lot of work to do and we understand that it'll take continued effort and time to rebuild trust with our customers, team members and other key stakeholders.","Another important action we've taken is the recent launch of our new retail banking compensation program, this has been a top priority over the past few months and it is a significant step in reinforcing to our retail banking team members what is expected of them, how their actions connect to our business priority of serving our customers and how they'll be rewarded for performance against these expectations.","There are five key principles to the new plan which we highlighted on Page 4. First, there are no product sales goals which we previously ended in October. Second, we will gauge success based on customer service, increases in primary customers, household relationship growth and risk management, and not on opening new accounts. Third, this new plan includes a strong focus on team performance with metrics heavily weighted toward team and branch goals, not just individual goals. Fourth, we have stronger controls in place to monitor behavior and ensure we're doing things the right way, including more proactive monitoring at the regional and corporate levels. And finally, we will be closely monitoring results for any unintended outcomes or behaviors prompted by the new plan and we will make changes as needed.","It will take time to communicate the plan and train 1,000s of team members so they understand the changes they need to make to successfully achieve new objectives. We're also leveraging a number of new business success metrics including primary customer growth, which measures the growth of customers that use Wells Fargo as their primary financial institution, and household relationship balanced growth to measure how Wells Fargo satisfy the broad financial needs of our customers. We will share more details on these and other metrics during our Investor Day in May.","The incentive plan rollout is an important step in restoring trust, this new program coupled with our work in redefining our service experience and training our leaders and frontline team members will be important elements as we continue this work. Also effective this week is part of our annual compensation review process, we increased our minimum hourly pay rate to a range of $13.50 to $17 an hour, a 12% increase from the previously minimum rate and 86% higher than national minimum wage. We believe this increase is a right thing to do for our team members.","On Slide 5, we provide the December customer activity in retail banking which we\u2019ve been updating on a monthly basis since our last earnings call. In general, while account openings are still down from a year ago, customers continue to actively use their accounts and many of the trends have shown improvements from the lows earlier in the fourth quarter. Let me highlight a few of those trends in more detail.","Customers are increasingly coming into our branches including a modest increase in banker interactions which started in the last two weeks of November and continued through year-end. Customers continue to open more checking accounts than they closed and primary consumer checking customers increased 3%. Our credit card business benefitted from strong holiday spending and December had record monthly purchase volume growing 8% from December of 2015 and active accounts were up 7%.","While new application stabilized in October, we have not seen an increase in application volume. The decline in December compared with November reflected normal seasonality. We have recently started to reintroduce some outbound calling and direct mail and we will be monitoring these results very closely. Customer experience scores continue to improve from the lows experienced early in October, with branch customer experience scores nearing pre-settlement levels by the end of December.","While customer loyalty scores have steadily improved since the lows in October, we still have work to do in order to return to previous highs. The improvement in these scores reflects the outstanding jobs that our retail banking team has done by focusing on providing exceptional customer experience.","Our existing customers have continued to use their accounts and we\u2019ve seen higher deposit and credit card balances and increased credit and debit card transaction volume which drives near-term revenue. The decline in the rate of new account openings may impact the pace of future revenue growth, so we\u2019ll continue to be transparent regarding those trends.","In addition, we\u2019re also tracking the impact to our other businesses, while businesses that are not reliant on retail banker referrals have not been significantly impacted, lower banker referrals continue to affect businesses such as mortgage. Referrals accounted for approximately 9% of mortgage originations in 2016 and we expect lower referrals in the fourth quarter will reduce funding volumes in the first quarter by approximately 2.5%.","In summary, we are pleased that the trends have stabilized and many metrics have started to show improvements. Before turning the call over to John Shrewsberry to discuss the details of our financial results, I want to update you on our resolution plan. We\u2019re working closely with this Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC to better understand their concerns, so that we can bring our resolution planning process in line with their expectations.","Additionally, to demonstrate our commitment to the remediation of the deficiencies and the overall resolution planning process, we have implemented actions to limit the size of our total non-bank subsidiaries assets to the levels in place as of September 30th, 2016. We\u2019ve already reduced assets to below this level as of year-end and expect to operate at this level for the foreseeable future. We are committed to remediating the two deficiencies identified by the agencies in our revised submission that is due in March and have added significant resources to this effort.","John Shrewsberry will now discuss the details of our financial results. John?","John Shrewsberry","Thanks Tim and good morning everyone. We earned $5.3 billion in the fourth quarter, the 17th consecutive quarter of generating earnings greater than $5 billion. Our consistent performance demonstrates the benefit of our diversified business model that has continued to perform well through the challenges we\u2019ve faced in recent months. We had solid underlying performance in the quarter including a record level of loans and deposits and strong growth in net interest income. It's important to note that our results in the quarter included the loss of $592 million or $0.07 a share from the impact of net hedge ineffectiveness accounting. Slide 8 provides more details on our long-term debt hedging program.","As we\u2019ve previously discussed as part of our overall asset\/liability management program, we typically swap our fixed rate long term debt to floating rate in order to balance our deposit oriented liability structure and better align with the interest rate sensitivity characteristics of our assets. We also issue non-U.S. dollar long term debt to diversify our funding sources and a portion of that debt is swapped to U.S. dollars. While we believe this hedging strategy is prudent from an asset\/liability management perspective it\u2019s generally not possible to achieve a perfect accounting hedge due to the differences in the required valuation measurement of the hedging instrument and the hedged item. As a result this can produce hedge ineffectiveness gains and losses from quarter-to-quarter as interest and exchange rates change. However, the hedge ineffectiveness recognized over the life of the hedging relationships is expected to be zero as long as the hedge accounting is maintained and the hedges are held to maturity.","In 2016, we experienced significant quarterly volatility and hedge ineffectiveness due to key interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations, including a hedge ineffectiveness gain, net of related economic hedges of $379 million in the first quarter and a net loss of $592 million in the fourth quarter. However the 2016 full year net hedge ineffectiveness accounting impact on our results was a loss of only $15 million. FASB has issued an exposure draft on hedge accounting guidelines and new guidance is expected to be issued in 2017. If issued in its current form, the interest rate related ineffectiveness associated with our long term debt hedges would be significantly reduced.","Turning to Page 9, let me highlight a few balance sheet trends. We had strong loan growth up $6.3 billion from third quarter on commercial loan growth. Consumer loans were reduced by the $3.8 billion deconsolidation of certain previously sold reverse mortgage loans following the sale of the related servicing in the fourth quarter. Investment securities increased $17.1 billion with $44 billion of purchases, predominantly agency MBS. The growth in this portfolio as well as a smaller balance sheet drove the $32.3 billion decline in short term investments and Fed funds sold.","Deposit growth was also strong up $30.2 billion from third quarter with increases in commercial, consumer and small business banking balances and our short term borrowings declined $27.9 billion reflecting lower repurchase balances. Credit quality remains solid and we had a reserve release for the first time in 2016 which was $100 million in the fourth quarter.","Turning to the income statement overview on Page 10, while revenue declined from the third quarter we had strong growth in net interest income up $450 million and our NIM increased 5 basis points. Non-interest income declined $1.2 billion driven by net hedging ineffectiveness, accounting losses, as well as lower trading and mortgage banking results which I will discuss later. Other sources of non-interest income were diversified and relatively stable. There are a lot of linked quarter changes and specific expense categories this quarter which I will highlight later in the call, but in total expenses were down $53 million from the third quarter.","As shown on Page 11 loans increased $6.3 billion from third quarter with broad based growth across many of our commercial and consumer portfolios. Our auto portfolio was an exception as balances declined $587 million from third quarter. To respond to conditions in the competitive landscape and to maintain our risk tolerances we've tightened our underwriting standards. Auto originations in the fourth quarter were $6.4 billion down 21% from the third quarter and down 15% from a year ago. We currently expect balances in our auto portfolio to continue to decline in the near term.","On Page 12 we show year-over-year loan growth. I'm not going to highlight each portfolio but our commercial growth was strong across many businesses and asset classes and the $3.8 billion deconsolidation of reverse mortgage loans reduced the growth rate of our 1-4 family first mortgage loan portfolio.","As highlighted on Page 13, we had a record $1.3 trillion of average deposits in the fourth quarter, up $67.4 billion or 6% from a year ago with growth in both commercial and consumer deposits. Consumer and small business banking deposits increased 8% from a year ago. Our average deposit cost increased four basis points from a year ago driven by commercial deposit pricing. There was little to no market response to the rate hike in December 2015 and we currently believe that deposits betas from the rate hike in December 2016 will also be low, at least initially. Indications so far support this view, but we continue to monitor the market to ensure we remain competitive for our customers while maintaining our disciplined relationship based pricing strategy.","Net interest income was up $450 million or 4% from the third quarter reflecting growth in loans and investment securities, higher interest incomes on trading assets and higher income from variable sources, including periodic dividends and fees. There was also a modest benefit from higher interest rates in the quarter. Net interest margin increased five basis points from the third quarter driven by growth in earning assets including deployment of cash into investments and the net benefit from higher interest rates. Income from variable sources benefited the NIM by approximately two basis points. Our growth in earning assets in the higher rate environment continue to benefit net interest income as we remain asset sensitive. However first quarter will reflect the impact from two fewer days and the typical linked quarter reduction in income from variable sources.","Non-interest income declined $1.2 billion from the third quarter including the $592 million of net hedge ineffectiveness accounting losses as well as lower trading and mortgage banking fees. I've already explained the impact from net hedge ineffectiveness, so let me highlight the drivers of our mortgage banking and trading results. Mortgage banking results decreased $250 million from third quarter and included a $163 million decline in mortgage servicing income primarily due to higher unreimbursed servicing costs. These costs increased $109 million in the fourth quarter as a result of actions we took to work through an aged population of FHA foreclosed properties, where we\u2019ve had challenges in repairing and conveying them back to HUD. As a result we increased our estimated cost to resolve these properties in the fourth quarter, however we expect these actions will reduce unreimbursed servicing costs significantly in 2017.","Residential mortgage origination volume was $72 billion, up $25 billion or 53% from a year ago and up $2 billion from the third quarter. Applications were down 25% from the third quarter and we ended the fourth quarter with a $30 billion unclosed pipeline similar to our pipeline a year ago. Our production margin on residential held-for-sale mortgage originations was 168 basis points in the fourth quarter, down 13 basis points from the third quarter primarily due to a higher mix of correspondent originations in the fourth quarter.","We currently expect origination volume in the first quarter to be roughly in line with the volume we had in the first quarter of 2016 but down from fourth quarter due to seasonality in the purchases market and lower refi volume driven by higher interest rates.","On Page 16 we provide some details on trading related revenue and the impact in net interest income and non-interest income. Total trading related revenue was down $378 million from the third quarter, trading related net interest income was up a $146 million in the fourth quarter reflecting higher average trading asset balances as well as $98 million from periodic dividends and carry income on certain hedged trading positions in our equity and RMBS books. The corresponding decline in the value of these hedges was reflected as a loss in net trading activity, so they\u2019re revenue neutral.","Net trading activities declined due to a $223 million decrease in secondary trading, reflecting lower client volumes compared with the strong third quarter as well as seasonality, fewer trading days in the fourth quarter and lower client demand as clients adapted to the rising rate environment. While our client focused business model typically underperforms the market in periods of high volatility, we believe we successfully managed through the post-election market volatility in the fourth quarter.","A $106 million of the decline in net trading activities was from deferred compensation trading results which was largely offset in employee benefits expense. Finally, there was a $61 million decline from a change in credit valuation adjustments in the fourth quarter due to market driven changes in credit spreads and higher swap rates. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2015 total trading related revenue was down $27 million.","On Page 17 we highlight the five quarter trend across major fee categories, compared with a year ago many of our fee businesses grew including deposit accounts, brokerage, investment banking, card and mortgage originations. This page illustrates that while many businesses had above average results in the fourth quarter, total non-interest income reflected below average mortgage servicing income and lower market sensitive revenue which was down $526 million from a year ago.","As shown on Page 18 expenses declined $53 million from the third quarter, but our efficiency ratio increased to 61.2% primarily driven by the impact of net hedge ineffectiveness losses on our revenue. Our efficiency ratio for the full year was 59.3%. We expect our efficiency ratio to remain at an elevated level. While total expenses were relatively flat from the third quarter there were some meaningful changes in some specific expense items in the fourth quarter. Personal expenses were down a $195 million from the third quarter primarily due to lower revenue related incentive compensation, lower deferred compensation expense and one fewer payroll day. As a reminder we will have seasonally higher personal expenses in the first quarter reflecting incentive compensation and employee benefits expense.","We have typically higher outside professional services, equipment and advertising expenses in the fourth quarter, and combined these categories increased $394 million from the third quarter. This increase was also driven by higher project spending and legal expense. Operating losses declined $334 million from third quarter on lower litigation accruals. And all other expenses declined $116 million from third quarter which included a $107 million donation to the Wells Fargo foundation.","As we highlight on Page 19, we remain focused on expense management and efficiency. We\u2019ve been working on a number of initiatives that we expect will reduce expenses by approximately $2 billion annually by year-end 2018 with the full year benefits starting in 2019. This is not a new focus, we\u2019re just providing you with more detail in our initiative this quarter to reduce expenses.","We\u2019ve summarized these opportunities into three categories and included the stage of completion on the right of this page. The largest opportunity relates to centralization and optimization. We\u2019ve started to make changes in how we\u2019re organized to reduce complexity and redundancy by continuing to realign staff areas including marketing, finance and technology. These changes should not only reduce cost, but should also enable us to more seamlessly serve customers and team members.","We remain focused on reducing discretionary spending in areas like facilities, non-customer related travel and third party spending. And as we\u2019ve discussed in the past, we\u2019re also focused on selective divestitures of non-core sub-scale businesses which includes the sale of our crop insurance and health benefit services businesses last year. We also formed the payments, virtual solutions and innovation group which will accelerate our focus on delivering the next generation of payments capabilities, advancing digital and online offerings and investing in new customer experiences and products.","While these efforts should have a meaningful impact to certain expense categories, there will not be a bottom line impact as these savings will be reinvested in the business. Our expense focus enables us to operate more efficiently, generate meaningful expense savings and continue to invest to drive future growth, all while continuing to have a strong efficiency ratio.","Let me take some time to discuss our branch strategy in more detail, it\u2019s along with each and every business within the company as part of our focus on discretionary spending. We continuously evaluate our branch network and while our physical distribution strategy is driven by customer behavior. While branches continue to be a critical component in serving our customers\u2019 needs, our investment in digital capabilities has enabled us to seamlessly serve our customers across channels providing them with more choice and convenience in how they bank with us. And as a result, more transactions are occurring outside the branch.","Our strategy is also influenced by geographical differences in our individual markets, economic trends and competitor actions to close or open branches. Once external trends indicate that there is an opportunity for branch closures, we focused on the customer impact. Additionally, we evaluate the CRA impact and the branch profitability and other key criteria to maximize expense savings and minimize revenue loss. Based on observed trends in customer behavior, we began to accelerate branch closures in 2016 and closed 84 branches mostly in the second half of the year. We expect the pace of branch closures to increase to 200 branches in 2017 and we expect closures at that level or slightly higher in 2018.","There also continues to be opportunities for de novos in some attractive markets. Many of the closures this year will be in closed proximity to another branch and therefore we don\u2019t expect a significant revenue or team member impact. The full year expense benefit usually occurs one to two years after the branch is closed. We will be providing more details on our branch distribution strategy at our May Investor Day.","Turning to our business segments starting on Page 21, community banking earned $2.7 billion in the fourth quarter down 14% from a year ago and down 15% from third quarter. The declines were primarily due to net hedge ineffectiveness losses and lower mortgage banking results. We\u2019ve already discussed many of the business trends within community banking, so I won't go into any more details here.","Wholesale banking earned $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter, up 4% from a year ago and up 7% from the third quarter. Revenue was $7.2 billion, up 9% from a year ago driven by 16% growth in net interest income. Balance sheet growth was strong with both deposits and loans at record levels. Loan growth was broad based with average loans up $44.5 billion or 11% from a year ago, the ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year loan growth. And we have completed the final phase of the GE Capital's portfolio acquisitions in October.","Wealth and investment management earned $653 million in the fourth quarter, up 10% from a year ago and down 4% from the third quarter which was a record quarter. Fourth quarter results reflected strong balance sheet growth with net interest income up 14% from a year ago. Average deposits were up 10% and average loans increased 11% from a year ago, the 14th consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year loan growth. WIM total client assets reached a record high in the fourth quarter of $1.7 trillion, up 7% from a year ago driven by higher market valuations and continued positive net flows.","Turning to Page 24, net charge-offs increased $100 million from the third quarter with 37 basis points of annualized net charge-offs. Commercial losses were up $36 million driven by $32 million in lower recoveries. Consumer loses increased $64 million driven by higher losses in credit card, auto and other revolving credit and installment loans due to seasonality, higher severity in auto losses and a movement toward more normalized losses in unsecured lending. Residential real estate portfolios continue to improve with net charge-offs down $28 million or 41% from the third quarter. Our first mortgage loan portfolio had net recoveries in the fourth quarter and we had only 38 basis points of loss in our Junior lien portfolio.","Non-performing assets continued to decline down $644 million from the third quarter with improvements across our consumer and commercial portfolios and lower foreclosed assets. We had a reserve released of $100 million reflecting continued improvement in our residential real estate portfolio and stabilization in our oil and gas portfolio performance.","Slide 25 provides details on our oil and gas portfolio. Outstanding continued to decline down 8% from the third quarter and down 15% from a year ago. We had $177 million of net charge-offs in the fourth quarter with all losses from the E&P and services sectors. Given the current environment we continue to believe that losses peaked in the second quarter of 2016. Non-accrual loans were $2.4 billion, down $84 million from the third quarter and criticized loans declined $776 million or 11%.","Turning to Page 26, our estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio fully phased-in was stable at 10.7%, well above our internal target of 10% which includes the regulatory minimum and buffers and our internal buffer. We repurchased 24.9 million common shares in the fourth quarter and entered into a $750 million forward repurchase transaction which settled this week for 14.7 million shares. We returned $3 billion to shareholders in the fourth quarter through common stock dividends and net share repurchases.","The final TLAC accrual was issued in December and becomes effective on January 1, 2019. We estimate that as of December 31, 2016 we will need to increase our portfolio of qualifying TLAC by approximately $18 billion in order to be compliant. This shortfall is lower than our previous estimates which were based on the proposed rule due primarily to the grandfathering of existing debt governed under foreign law in the final rule. It also was impacted by lower RWA levels at year end. However the removal of the phase-in period in the final rule will result in a modest acceleration of our issuance plan. We issued a total of $32 billion of qualifying TLAC in 2016 and we currently expect issuance in 2017 will be at a similar level to fund both maturities and our targeted build of qualifying debt.","In summary our results in the fourth quarter demonstrated solid underlying performance as we continued to meet our customers' financial needs. We had record levels of loans, deposits and client assets. Our credit quality, liquidity and capital all remained strong. We once again earned more than $5 billion in the quarter demonstrating the benefit of our diversified business model which continued to perform well during a period where we faced unique challenges.","It's been only four months since we signed the sales practices consent orders but we've already made progress in restoring customers and team members trust and we remain committed to being transparent with investors while there is still more work to do we're confident that we will build a better Wells Fargo that will continue to meet our customers' financial needs. Benefit the communities we serve and provide opportunities for our team members and investors.","And we can now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein, please go ahead.","John McDonald","I wanted to ask about the rate sensitivity profile, John. I was wondering if there's been any change in the core rate sensitivity and could you remind us what kind of benefit do you get from the Fed hike that we got in December?","John Shrewsberry","Sure. So we're still in the -- I think we're in the 5% to 15% range, which is what we talked about the last time our Treasurer, Neal Blinde presented more broadly, that hasn't really changed very much. I think we've estimated that the quarterly impact -- a full quarterly impact of a 25 basis point parallel shift, which is different than what we got in December, although arguably we got more than that in the long end, is worth in the order of a $150 million per quarter and that estimation still holds as well.","John McDonald","I know you put some swaps on in maybe 2015 it was, which muted what would have been your maybe natural asset sensitivity. Just wondering as to maybe you're thinking about the rate environment evolves, are you able to get out of that and adapt that or is that locked in for a few years? ","John Shrewsberry","Those hedges will be in place for a few years. They\u2019re captured in this calculation of our rate sensitivity and so if you think about LIBOR based commercial loans as the hedged item there those won\u2019t float up and that incremental benefit won't be passed along in the near term as a result of the choice to fix those out and to earn higher interest income in previous periods and to change their profile.","So that's not where the benefit would come from, it\u2019s other floating rate loans, it's incremental floating rate loans in those categories that haven't been hedged. But those -- that program was a result of a specific decision to reduce interest rate sensitivity in a period that felt lower for longer and there will be other assets that float up that create a benefit on the [Multiple Speakers].","John McDonald","I guess your sensitivity also will come from your liquidity deployment. It looks like you put some to work this quarter with the Fed fund sold down $30 billion. I know you get asked this all the time but is there a way for us to think about how much of that $270 billion or so of liquidity is deployable and flexible dry powder versus needed to meet the various liquidity and other requirements?","John Shrewsberry","I think we're sticking with 10s of billions at any point in time as incrementally deployable. This relationship between the liquidity value of whatever we might be incrementally investing in and there are limitations as you know on certain -- the definitions of certain assets is either high quality liquid assets or not. And then there is the capital impact of moving too far out the curve and increasing our exposure to diminution and OCI in a rising rate environment. So there are a lot of tradeoffs to be made. We're making them all the time with that -- with the same outcome in mind that you're curious about. We will be deploying more in a higher rate entry point, but subject to those constraints and what it means for capital and what it means for liquidity versus holding cash.","Operator","You're next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ken Usdin","Tim and John, I think people are really appreciative of the incremental, just putting a number around the work you're already doing on the cost side. You did however mention that you expect to reinvest it. So, I was wondering if you could help us understand your comments just about the efficiency ratio remaining high. Does that mean high relative to your historical 55%, 59% range or does it mean high end? And just how would you help us understand just how you get from point A to point B and how we start to see efficiency improvement over time?","Tim Sloan","So, John I\u2019ll start and then you jump in. I think Ken the efficiency ratio metrics that we set out at our Investor Day last year are really guidelines for us to operate in in the environment that we expected to turn the clock back to last May. We think that 55% to 59% range is best-in-class in the industry and the range that we're expecting to operate in for the next couple of years. Things have changed clearly, and expectations have changed, but the efficiency ratio is a function of not only your expense rate, but also revenue growth and we're hopeful that we'll continue to grow revenue overtime as we did over the last year in 2016.","And our guidance is that, in the short term as revenue continues to grow and we continue to have some headwinds from an expense standpoint and the first quarter is going to be a good example of that because we'll have some impact from annual incentive compensation impact and so on, that we\u2019ll going to be at the high end, and again we think about this expense ratio -- our efficiency ratio, excuse me, not on our quarterly basis, but as much year-over-year. So, our expectations for 2017 is that we\u2019ll probably be at the high end of that range.","John Shrewsberry","And the only thing I'd add is that, and this is implied, but to the extent that we're getting revenue increases from interest income then that's substantially more efficient in terms of dollars of expense per dollar of revenue then most sources of non-interest income. So, there should be a lift if we\u2019re getting it in interest income.","Ken Usdin","That's great, John. And that's actually my follow-up, as well, is that you do seem to have a decent path towards NII growth from the factors that you've talked about, and to John's questions before. Can you talk about just some of the moving parts inside fees in terms of how those businesses feel? The brokerage business has flattened out, but maybe hopefully it's turned the corner. And then obviously there is the mortgage side of things, which obviously with rates, the unclosed pipeline is down a little bit. So, what drives fee growth as you look ahead? Where do you see the most opportunities? And what are the things that we have to just be mindful of?","John Shrewsberry","Sure. The big sources, setting mortgage aside because we talked about it a little bit in the prepared comments and I think you just nailed it, we\u2019re in that lower point in the refi cycle. So it\u2019s really about getting after the purchase needs of our customers and then those refi that do come up, but applications are down across the industry and I think people expect that in general. So what that yields will depend on the path of where rates go, how jobs are formed and what the demand is for home buying.","In our other big sources, deposit, deposit service charges, our customers are using our products more than ever, so we\u2019ve had good growth in debit card and we\u2019ll continue to work there and now we need to continue to attract new customers to the bank in order for that to grow like it has in the past, that is an area of focus for Mary as she launches her new program in community banking and of course a lot of that also comes from the commercial side of things where we\u2019re a leader in providing treasury management services to our corporate customers as well. So -- and that\u2019s been a growing business for us over the last several years.","On the card side, new credit card applications are down, but for the cards that we have out there and the cards that we are originating now, people are using them more, they\u2019re transacting more, they\u2019re spending more, their balances are higher, et cetera. So those have driven good sources. And then with respect to brokerage, obviously we\u2019re at high market levels right now so we expect good fees from that as well as institutional asset management, but with David Carroll\u2019s teams focus on meeting the saving for retirement and investing needs of all of our banking customers, my sense is that there continues to be an opportunity there also. We have to execute along all of those dimensions, but there is a real path forward.","Tim Sloan","Yeah, I would just reinforce the opportunity we have in wealth and investment management, as John said David and team did a terrific job last year and when you think about growing that business 10% year-over-year and just couldn\u2019t be more pleased with those performance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead. ","Erika Najarian ","I just wanted to get some clarification on the response to Ken's question. As we think about the reduction of expenses and investing it back by year-end 2018, does that mean that the expense base on an absolute basis could potentially be flattish in 2018? Or is that too simplistic to think about because we really have to think about the revenue side, as well? I'm just trying to think about whether or not we should think about the $2 billion as something that can self-fund investments in 2018 or we really should be going back to the 55% to 59% efficiency ratio guidance.","John Shrewsberry","I would say with the latter.","Tim Sloan","I would too.","John Shrewsberry","Because you never know where a dollar of revenue is going to come from and especially on the non-interest income side, the mix matters in terms of what it\u2019s related expenses are and so I wouldn\u2019t be predicting a couple of years forward what that mix is going to look like or what the associated expense impact is going to look like at the margins from a dollar of one sort of non-interest income versus another, I would think about it as these are undertakings that we have going on to accomplish all of our incremental spending and still stay in 55% to 59% on an annual basis.","Erika Najarian","And just to clarify, it sounds like if we do get a structurally higher curve, like you said in previous calls, that could really drive the path to the middle or lower end of that 55% to 59% efficiency ratio target.","Tim Sloan","Overtime, over time, but again Erika I mean it\u2019s a function of so many other different variables. I mean not just interest rates, but just fundamental economic growth. If the economy grows at 3% is better than 2% and that means its loan was going to be higher and maybe other activity will be higher. I would just reinforce John\u2019s comment, just to think about that 55% to 59% that we\u2019re going to save a lot of money here at Wells Fargo, and we\u2019re going to reinvest that business for the long-term that will pay benefits well beyond the next couple of years.","John Shrewsberry","I do think it\u2019s reasonable though to say to get to the lower end of the range it\u2019s going to be because of the impact of higher rates on interest income.","Erika Najarian","Okay. And just if I could squeeze one last question in here, in the back of the retail sales issue there has been a lot of focus on new account openings. And I'm wondering if you could give us a sense of whether or not the profitability of your primary customer has really been impacted by the scandal. Because as I've been talking to investors about this, does new account opening really matter if that credit card was not being used anyway or was sitting in a drawer? I guess I\u2019m wondering if we could -- I know you've given a lot of detail already, but I'm wondering if the new account openings statistics sort of overstates what the revenue impact to your primary customer is from the retail sales scandal.","Tim Sloan","Yeah. It\u2019s a good question. And I think the short answer is it\u2019s too new to tell. The value of a relationship tends to increase overtime, and generally relationships are a little bit less profitable at the beginning than they might be two years from now and four years from now and five years from now. So, I don\u2019t mean not to ask [indiscernible] question Erika, so we\u2019ll have to reduce your question next quarter. But the fact of the matter is that I think it\u2019s just too early to tell. We\u2019re just excited that we saw what seems to be an inflection point in the midst of the fourth quarter. And so we\u2019re starting to see some real positive attributes in some of those metrics, not only in terms of accounts activity, but also in terms of customer service and experience.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matt O\u2019Connor","I wanted to follow up on a comment earlier. I think you said -- I just want to make sure I didn't hear it incorrectly, but have you promised to keep the absolute size of your balance sheet at the 9-30 [ph] level? Is that the entire balance sheet or was that just segments? Did I miss something there?","Tim Sloan","No. What we said is that, we\u2019ll keep our non-bank subsidiary balance sheet at the 9-30 level. And that accounts for probably 10% of our overall balance sheet. ","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay. All right. So from my point of view not that big of a deal. Just separately, you guys have talked about that there's a third-party review of all layers of management into the sales practicing and what was known and what wasn't known. There's an article, I think, this past weekend just talking about emails being reviewed. I can appreciate that takes a very long time for a firm your size, but any thoughts on when that would be concluded and when and how it would be communicated to investors and analysts?","Tim Sloan","Well, think of the review in terms of sales practices in two parts. One is a requirement under the consent orders with the OCC and the CFPB to have a third party consultant come in and take a look at sales practices, primarily in our retail related business and so that's just begun. My guess is that will take the good part of this year to accomplish and then separately because you know as I said in my earlier remarks we want to leave no stone unturned here, we've said that -- and we have brought in a separate consultant to look at sales practice across other businesses within the company. And my guess it will take much of this year to complete that work and if we find something that's important, we'll communicate that, but if nothing happens we may not communicate it. But we\u2019ll take it as it comes, but I think given our desire to be very transparent we'll probably err on the side of over communicating as opposed to under communicating that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI, please go ahead.","John Pancari","Back to the sales practice issue, given that you're seeing some turn, some inflection here that you cited in some of these metrics and everything, are you in any better position to help quantify what you would say would be the all-in recurring financial impact of the issue, both with the foregone revenue as well as the related expense impact from this?","Tim Sloan","No, I would say not. But John jump in if you feel differently. Just because we're -- this has been going on for at least the last quarter or so and while we're pleased with what we think is hopefully an inflection point. We may have months over the next few months where things turn the other way again for a month. But what we're really focused on is the long term trend. In the short term the revenue impact has not been significant, but we want to be careful about that, is that to the extent that we're growing primary checking accounts at 3% instead of 5%, over time that would have a bigger impact. So I would still put it in the category of too new to rate.","John Shrewsberry","One specific I can add is that I'd estimated for the next several quarters we\u2019re probably a $40 million to $50 million this quarter of outside professional service fees which includes the third party [Multiple Speakers] incremental, which includes the reviewing third parties and law firms as well and that probably grows a little bit and then tails off. So that's incremental.","John Pancari","All right, thank you. And then, separately, I know you were alluding to this a little bit earlier with the asset sensitivity questions, but I just wanted to see if I can get some thoughts on your NIM trajectory here in coming quarters, just given the TLAC pace now is going to be a little bit quicker and that's a negative drag. But also you've got the impact of the rate hike. So, how would you be thinking about the trajectory of the margin here through \u201917?","John Shrewsberry","So I'd rather talk about it in dollars if those are useful to you, because NIM is really an outcome and we can't predict what exactly is going to happen with deposit flows, et cetera. But just to put a dollar sign on it, if we don't get any more moves by the Fed in 2017, and I anticipate that we might, but if we didn't given that their pace of TLAC issuance that you mentioned, given the balance sheet positioning today, given what we might expect from loan growth, what we could imagine from redeployment et cetera, we're -- it's pretty easy to sketch out a 4%, 5%, 6% net interest income growth trajectory, full year '17 over full year '16. What that means for a NIM because of what the balances are, that are applied to that, is a little harder to pin down.","Operator","You're next question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR. Please go ahead.","Paul Miller","You talked about in the beginning of the call that you've gone all the way back to 2011. But I know there's been some discussion in the media and some politicians of going back farther than that. Are the regulators good with you going as back to 2011? Or do you need to go back farther later on?","Tim Sloan","Paul good question and let me clarify, under the consent orders we're required to go back a little bit earlier in 2011 than we have previously done and then bring forward the analysis to September of 2016 to the date more or less that we've signed the consent orders, that's the regulatory requirement. We've decided, right -- this is the management of the company not any third parties located anywhere else around the country, have decided that we think it's appropriate to go back and look at 2009 and 2010, that's something that we announced in late September, October and so we're in the midst of doing that but think about that as a separate effort outside of the consent order requirements to make things right for our customers.","Paul Miller","Okay. So, the 2011 is a consent order, you're willing to go back as far as 2009. And have you had discussions with people in Congress who were asking you guys to go back even further than that? Does that satisfy their needs?","Tim Sloan","Well I'll leave satisfaction rates in Congress to them. We think that it's important to go back and look at 2009 and '10, we've picked that timeframe because that's when we Wells Fargo and Wachovia together, and we think that's right from our perspective. It's well beyond the requirements that our regulators set for us. So, we're in the midst to doing that.","Paul Miller","And then my follow-up question, I did ask this of Jamie Dimon, but I was wondering what your thoughts of it, on the mortgage world the credit box is really, really continuing to be tight. And you heard a lot of the new administration guys talking about opening up the credit box. Can they open up the credit box effectively? And what do you guys want to hear for you guys to start drawing down and opening up the credit box in the mortgage world?","Tim Sloan","Well it\u2019s a good question. We think it's very important to continue and to provide a broad suite of mortgage options to our customers and we think we do that better than anybody in the industry, we've got the number one share and we're satisfying customers every day. There is no question that there have been certain rules and regulations that have been promulgated over the last eight years which have impacted and provided some concern in the industry not just with big banks in terms of how we provide credit, some of it is related to the fact that we all, we\u2019re part of servicing settlements that went back decades almost and which were a surprise to everybody.","So I think the more that there can be clarification, and FHA is a great example, the more that there can be clarification on any uncertainty in the future, the better. Having said that, we\u2019re really pleased with the progress that we\u2019ve made in terms and performance of our first mortgage product which is focused on first time homebuyers. That the volumes has exceeded our expectations and so we\u2019re just really pleased with the fact that we\u2019ve had a very strong origination year and you know the credit quality within the mortgage businesses has just continued to exceed our expectations. As John noted in his remarks we had net recoveries in the fourth quarter from our first mortgage business.","So we\u2019re really pleased with the position that we have in the mortgage business we\u2019re hopeful that the new administration can continue to provide clarification in terms of that business and we look forward to working with them.","John Shrewsberry","Two things I would add, we\u2019re not looking for a way to put lower credit quality first mortgages on our balance sheet. So if there are others who are looking for loosening the box for that outcome, I don\u2019t think that that would apply here. And as it relates broadly to tightening the credit box as a result of financial crisis, it\u2019s really about underwriting the ability to repay and that\u2019s what constraining how much money people can borrow or whether they can borrow and it\u2019s a reasonable requirement, and that\u2019s how we\u2019re operating. So, customers have to be able to provide evidence of their ability to repay, so more jobs, et cetera. It advances that cause versus making it -- lowering the requirement for the ability to repay.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. ","Vivek Juneja ","Couple of questions, one your guidance for the efficiency ratio remaining to the high end of the range, near term. What assumptions do you have baked in for rate hikes and when you\u2019re defining rate, I am presuming near-term, I\u2019m presuming you\u2019re thinking 2017?","John Shrewsberry","In our own internal analysis there is one in the middle of the year and one at the end of the year. So, not much in terms of the short end of the curve providing incremental interest income is in that calculation.","Vivek Juneja ","Okay. Right, and so then this full notion of the 2 billion savings that you\u2019re talking about, that\u2019s going to come over the course of the \u201917 and \u201918, and then the investments also coming during the same time frame, is there any timing differences in those and that\u2019s all supposed to be at the same time? [Multiple Speakers].","John Shrewsberry","It's self-funded at the same time.","Vivek Juneja ","Okay. So completely different question. Living well, what went wrong with that and the changes that you have to make, what kind of implications will that have for you in terms of your numbers. ","Tim Sloan","So, fair question. The focus of the regulators on our -- the submission -- the resubmission that we made last fall related to legal entities and shared services and so what we\u2019re in the midst of doing is having as I mentioned some very good quality meetings with the regulators to make sure that we appreciate with their expectations are. And focused on providing more detail to them in terms of how we manage risk related to all of our legal entities. And then how we -- our shared services would operate in the midst of a catastrophe at Wells Fargo, actually we don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to occur.","And so we\u2019ve redoubled our efforts there, we\u2019ve added some additional folks and additional resources, and we\u2019re going to work very hard and improve the quality of our submission which is due at the end of March. I don't fundamentally believe that it's going to affect our ability to serve our customers and rebuild trust in any way, shape or form. But we were disappointed and we\u2019ve got to make some improvements and we\u2019ll do it.","Vivek Juneja ","And will that legal entity change, would that make any changes to your fund, your liquidity, any of that, any comment, any color on that at this point?","Tim Sloan","Well at the margin it might impact some things, but not materially to that. ","John Shrewsberry","There might be some prepositioning of capital liquidity into various entities, but from your perspective it wouldn\u2019t have a meaningful difference.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead. ","Marty Mosby ","I had a couple of well more micro and small issues and then I had a big question for you Tim at the end. We're looking at the servicing. Usually the servicing fees would kick in when rates started to go up. However, you had that unreimbursable cost. Your servicing fees dropped down to 18 basis points was about the lower I\u2019ve seen. That is temporary and should rebound back to a more normal 20-ish type of base points going forward, I think I heard you say that.","John Shrewsberry","So, servicing fees that are coming off of the unpaid principle balance of our servicing portfolio will track how big the servicing portfolio is. And it has shrunk overtime as prepayments have been faster, frankly faster than our share of the origination market, as we\u2019ve existed different types of businesses to de-risk both our mortgage origination as well as mortgage servicing business like the reverse mortgage portfolio we sold this quarter for $4 billion of unpaid principle balance like several of these origination program that we deem higher risk overtime. ","So the notional that is driving the contractual servicing fee stream has been coming down and as you\u2019d expect we think it will stabilize now, because we\u2019re -- prepayment should sort of halt or a creep in a higher rate environment. But as you say in a higher environment, we\u2019d also expect that the flow towards more as we as escrows and taxes and insurance and other things, those are worth more to us in a higher rate environment than in a lower rate environment, and that should start to work its way in overtime. ","And then specifically on unreimbursed foreclosure costs, on the one hand we\u2019re working down the long-term cyclical amount of foreclosed properties, et cetera, that need to be worked out of the system. We\u2019re originating those types of loans, FHA loans in particular at a much slower pace than we were previously. And now we\u2019ve taken this step, where we\u2019ve taken charges in Q4 that we think are really going to reduce the rate of that expense in 2017. So, I would expect servicing revenue in general to be meaningfully positively impacted by that last piece in particular.","Marty Mosby ","And then when you look at the hedge ineffectiveness where you had the -- related to your long-term debt, I would assume that the credit spread comparison, in other words, the real basis risk changed, was your credit spread gapped out with the reputational issues that you're working through right now in the marketplace, and that drove a large part of this negative. So that would be an unusual in this particular quarter. Would that be correct?","John Shrewsberry","I don't think that's as big a driver as you think. It's really, it's a portion of it because you're discounting that leg of the hedged relationship with A, credit spread in it, and B, the swap leg you're not. But it has more to do with the direction of rates and the amount of the uptick in the swap rate over a short period of time than our spreads. You can see the impact of our spreads in Q3 versus Q4 in our net CVA outcomes on the trading side of things because we generated positive P&L in the third quarter from our own spreads gapping out and then we didn\u2019t have that in the fourth quarter, but that\u2019s a -- those are relatively small numbers for Wells Fargo.","Marty Mosby ","Okay. And then Tim, the big question is, Mary Mack's gone around now and you said talked to 3,000 team members. Is the environment such that had she would have done that a year ago or two years ago, nobody would really want to step up and say anything bad about the Company because everybody was thinking of it as such a hot performing institution. Is the flow of information freeing up so you're getting some really good information and ways to improve along a lot of different lines with these town hall meetings?","Tim Sloan","Oh absolutely Marty, and that's part of the -- you know when we think about rebuilding trust at the company, rebuilding trust is not only with external stakeholders, but candidly it's primarily -- the primary focus was 268,000 team members. If we don\u2019t rebuild trust with all of them then we\u2019ve got bigger issues and I think Mary's outreach in terms of her town halls and she's been tireless in terms of these town halls is very important and many of the other senior leaders within the company have had similar town halls and have been out there more than we've ever been, talking to our team members and the way that we're getting feedback from our team is not just through those town halls, but also through requests that we make to them through surveys and we're getting all kinds of great ideas in terms of how to improve Wells Fargo and many of them that we're implementing.","So I'm really pleased with the progress that we've made in terms of our internal communication and we're seeing that in terms of some of the feedback that we're getting from our team members and that translates into better service for our customers and personally I think that's one of the drivers. I mentioned that in my earlier remarks in terms of the improvement in the customer experience scores in retail. I couldn't be more pleased with that performance given the circumstances.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC, please go ahead.","Gerard Cassidy","Tim, I think you touched on that you raised the wages of your lower wage workers well above the Federal Minimum Wage. Can you share with us what that will do for operating -- compensation expenses in 2017? I know seasonally first quarter everybody has the uptick in employment expenses, but what will that do for expenses this year?","Tim Sloan","So, a fair question and I'll give you an answer that's probably a little bit frustrating, so I apologize in advance, and that is that, we don't really look at it that way. Because one of the reasons why we wanted to increase the minimum levels of compensation is that we want some other positive outcomes. So outcomes like lower turnover and that could be a -- have a net impact and would have a net impact and we think it will have a net impact on whatever the expense number might be.","Lower turnover means lower training cost, it means a higher productivity because you've got more experienced bankers, tellers, service folks, that are working with our customers, so net-net overtime making this decision we think is a net positive for the company so we really don't look at it as gosh it's going to have this kind of an impact in a certain period of time, because the other outcomes that I mentioned aren't really known until we look back a year from now.","Gerard Cassidy","Fair enough. And then the follow-up question is, can you guys give us some color on how the GECC acquisition is performing, how the integration has gone? Have you been very pleased with it? Just some color there.","Tim Sloan","Any acquisition and integration is complicated. And so my answer will not do justice to the incredible amount of hard work and effort to all of the 100s of people if not 1,000s of people within the company that have been working hard on that integration. But overall I would tell you it has exceeded our expectations. The quality of team members that we were able to bring on from GE has just been very impressive, their engagement in the business and how happy they are to be part of Wells Fargo is very encouraging.","The quality of the customer base that we were able to bring on has exceeded our expectation and those customers are doing more business with us and one of the opportunities that we have overtime is to broaden those relationships because GECC which was a terrific lender, was just that, a lender, and we have other products and services that we can provide to their customer base, so if this is the nine-inning game, the first inning we put some points on the board and score some runs and hopefully we'll continue to do that, but again long answer to your question, so far so good.","Operator","You're next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead.","Saul Martinez","I wanted to discuss the branch rationalization strategy a little bit, what the thought process is there, especially the thought process around the 200 branches. You have a slide where you have some bullets around some of the factors that you consider when you close a branch. But when I look at that number, it's about 3% of your branch network, the 200 figure. You've closed fewer branches than perhaps some of your peers have in recent years.","But I guess the bigger question is, whether you can do a little bit more there and whether you can pull the cost lever harder through a bit more aggressive branch rationalization. Just wanted to go through the branch strategy and how you think about that and what some of the factors are in determining that 200 figure per year.","Tim Sloan","I'll start and John jump in, it's a great question. What you saw last year is us increasing the pace of branch rationalization, so that 80 plus that we closed last year, most of that was in the second half and what that\u2019s reflecting is us listening to our customers in terms of how they want to do business with us they still want to come in to branches, but they also are accessing us via online and mobile, and through ATMs, and on the phone. So our strategy is really based upon listening to customers and looking at their habits and how they want to interact with us and based upon that we think it makes sense and Mary\u2019s has had an opportunity to oversee the business for the last six months and what we\u2019ve concluded is that we should increase the pace of rationalization to about 200 this year.","I wouldn\u2019t describe that as our long-term branch strategy, because again it\u2019s really a function of reactions and habits from our customers. We may increase, we may decrease, who knows, it\u2019s going to be based upon how they want to do business with us. But what we\u2019re seeing right now is, it leads us to the conclusion to be focused on that 200 branch number for the year.","John Shrewsberry","I think that\u2019s right and we\u2019ll continue to -- they\u2019ll be a feedback loop from this process to see how customers react to it, whether we\u2019re right or wrong about the customer attrition, deposit attrition or other things that we\u2019re trying to minimize by taking the strategy that we\u2019re taking and if six months into this, we think there is an opportunity to do more, then we\u2019ll come back and we\u2019ll do that.","And we\u2019ll talk in some more detail at our May Investor Day about the process that we used to analyze this, why we think this is the right approach to take, some of the idiosyncrasies of our branch footprint versus the others that you\u2019re familiar with just in terms of owned, leased, that cost to operate, et cetera. We\u2019ve got branches, there is a lot of them as you might know in very low cost locations and so the expense pick up that you might be imagining may not be exactly the same as if they were all in coastal communities or major metropolitan areas, et cetera. There is a lot of differences from one to the other. But this is the beginning of a process where we\u2019re picking up and the whole time customers will be reflecting in their use of physical versus virtual, how much they value coming into our branches and we can keep feeding that back.","Saul Martinez","Great, that's helpful. Just a quick follow-up on an earlier question, what proportion of your employees are affected by the minimum wage hike? Do you have that figure?","John Shrewsberry","It\u2019s about 26,000 people. ","Saul Martinez","Okay, got it. Thanks a lot. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. ","Eric Wasserstrom","Just two questions, please. One is, you mentioned the tightening of some of your underwriting standards and portions of the auto portfolio. Could you just maybe give us a little insight into what you were doing and where, whether it's in the credit spectrum or new versus used or how that's playing out?","John Shrewsberry","So, we\u2019ve been holding fast on term. I think we\u2019ve talked about this with this group before, but there is between leasing as a competitive product or just other lenders willingness to go to seven years and beyond more frequently than we are. That has cost us to lose some volumes, sticking by that. And the other two areas I think are proof of income, on the one hand, which is part of how we try to underwrite credit and then back to ability to repay.","You mentioned new versus used, because we\u2019re not attached to a manufacturer and we don\u2019t have a leasing program, we do are disproportionately a huge car lender and so these are criteria that are meaning full to us and at this part of the cycle its causing us to lose volume.","Eric Wasserstrom","Got it. Okay. Thank you for that. And I know there's been many questions on OpEx, but I'm afraid I'm still a little confused. I understand certainly where you're coming out in terms of the efficiency ratio. But just in absolute dollar terms, relative to the roughly $52.4 billion that you had in 2016, how should we think about that figure in absolute terms for this year?","John Shrewsberry","So the way that I would think about it is, thinking about it from the expense ratio, and I know it\u2019s a little bit frustrating, because again one of the reasons why we think about expenses here is part of that efficiency ratio as its very much a function of revenue opportunities and depending upon which business is generating those revenue opportunities or which product some of them have higher or lower expenses associated with them. But the way that I would think about that $2 billion is we\u2019re going to save that $2 billion over the next couple of years and then we\u2019re going to reinvest it in the business.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research. Please go ahead. ","Nancy Bush","This tags onto Gerard's question. In looking at your new compensation scheme and the fact that it's fairly new, how confident are you in projecting, accruing, et cetera, for comp expenses this year? Were you able to beta test this at all? Or is there wide variability in where the numbers can come out?","John Shrewsberry","So, we were able to test it somewhat Nancy, but as you can appreciate the timeframe that we have was a little bit shorter than we would normally have liked.","Nancy Bush","Right. ","John Shrewsberry","I don\u2019t want to give you the impression that we\u2019re always changing incentive compensation plans for tens of thousands of people in 90 days. So, there is some risk in that we didn\u2019t get it completely right and that\u2019s one of the reasons why I wanted to reinforce the point, and we\u2019re going to watching this very closely and to the extent that we need to make some changes, we\u2019re not going to wait for a year from now, we\u2019ll make some changes.","But, when I think about the fundamentals of the plan, they were reviewed by Mary and team, we had a lot of discussions with the retail folks, we had it reviewed by our risk folks and HR folks and the likes, and just the fundamentals of basing it on customer service, increasing in primary accounts and household growth, I mean those are all measurable items. ","Nancy Bush","Right. ","John Shrewsberry","So, we\u2019re not really concerned about having the accruals correct or incorrect. And they\u2019re all very important drivers for growth in relationships and in return satisfied customers and then that will translate into revenue growth overtime.","Nancy Bush","Yes. And, secondly, there was another piece of news in the last couple of days where you've gotten a letter, I think, from some members of Congress about the growth in overdraft charges, could you just -- and whether this is somehow linked to the rest of the issues. So, if you could just address that whole overdraft issue, I'd appreciate it.","Tim Sloan","Sure. So, I\u2019ll start and John jump in. I\u2019m actually waiting to get the letter. So, you\u2019ve read about it before I've actually received it, but my understanding is that it was based upon some earlier reporting regarding year-to-year increases. Recall that in 2014 we made a number of changes in terms of how we provide information to our customers, how we process payments and deposits and debits and credits and the like, which meant that our deposit or our overdraft income actually declined in 2015 to 2014 and so the year-over-year, again three quarters to three quarters comparison you're seeing '16 to '15 is a reflection of the changes we made in '14, revenue decline in '15 and then growing off that number and the reason it\u2019s growing is not because there's anything nefarious that we're doing or it's part of any sort of retail sales practices issue. It's just a reflection of the fact that we're seeing growth in our customer base and we're seeing more customer activity.","We think maybe our competitors are making some of the changes that we made a year later and so maybe that's impacting some of their overdraft revenue, but we'll -- I'll be responsive to the letter when I get it and we'll continue to provide the right services to our customer base.","John Shrewsberry","Just a little bit more color on that. So we don\u2019t have the largest overdraft revenue base among larger banks. As Tim said we made this change and specifically the change that we made was to post to customers online and mobile account picture items that were being received throughout the course of the day that we're going to post overnight in a batch, so that they have that information before making a determination about whether to overdraft or not.","We implemented that at the end of '14 and from '14 to '15 and that's good for customers. It was on purpose, it was intended to give people more information to make better decisions about what to do with their money and we dropped an overdraft revenue from '14 to '15 and then as Tim said because the business has grown, because people have gotten used to that information and made different decisions about how they want to run their lives. We picked back from '15 to '16. We're flat from '14 to '16.","As we understand it, our peers adopted that similar customer friendly technology a year later and so the point of comparison that is available now is their year of adoption versus the period right afterward when customers can react to that information. So it's a little bit of apples and oranges. But our fee levels, our frequency of charging et cetera are right in the middle of the fairway compared to the competitive set, there's nothing different about Wells Fargo's approach to that activity.","Tim Sloan","And Nancy the more that we can provide information to our customers so that they can make good decisions about how to manage their money, the better. And we're going to continue to look at ways in which we can use technology particularly through mobile to provide that information, so it\u2019s much more customer friendly to them.","Nancy Bush","Okay, alright thank you.","Operator","And I'll now turn the conference back over to management for any concluding remarks.","Tim Sloan","Great, well again thank you all for spending time with us today, know it's been, it's been a very busy morning for all of you and we appreciate your interest in Wells Fargo and I also just want to reinforce to all of our team members who are listening out there, thank you very much for just a tremendous effort this quarter in the midst of a very challenging period for Wells Fargo, I couldn't be more proud of everything that you've accomplished.","So, thank you and have a good rest of your day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

Good morning and Happy New Year to everyone. Thank you for joining us today.","We just completed another outstanding year at Wells Fargo. We generated record earnings, produced strong deposit and loan growth, grew the number of customers we serve, improved credit quality, enhanced our strong risk management practices, strengthened our capital and liquidity levels and rewarded our shareholders by increasing our dividend and buying back more shares.","Our achievements during 2014 demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model and our continued focus on the real economy. Let me share just some of our accomplishments during the past year.","We generated earnings of $23 billion and earnings per share of $4.10, both up 5% from the prior year. We grew both revenue and pretax, pre-provision profit. We had strong broad-based loan growth. Our core loan portfolio increased by $60 billion or 8%.","Our deposit franchise continue to generate strong consumer and balanced growth with total deposit up $89 billion or 8% and we grew the number of primary consumer checking customers by 5.2%.","Our credit performance continue to be very strong with net charge-off down $1.6 billion and our net charge-off ratio declining to just 35 basis points for the year.","Our capital levels increased even as we returned more capital to shareholders. We returned $12.5 billion to our stockholders through dividends and net share repurchases, up 74% from a year ago.","While we serve our customers throughout the world, 97% of our revenue comes from the United States and there had been many signs of strength in the U.S. economy. GDP growth accelerated during 2014 and may be even stronger in 2015.","Last year was the strongest year of job growth in 15 years and December was the 50th consecutive month of job creation, unprecedented in U.S. history.","Consumer confidence is at its highest level since the peak of the last economic expansion. Home ownership remains an aspiration for most Americans and recent development such as the announced reduction in FHA premiums, GSE clarification on repurchase rules and changes in GSE lending guidelines should provide some benefit to the housing market where affordability remains attractive.","While lower oil prices have created volatility in the financial markets, America as a whole is a net consumer of energy and American households will benefit from the decline in energy prices, which is positive for the U.S. economy.","I believe the improvement in the economy, the strength of our balance sheet, the diversity of our businesses and the continued commitment of our team members to meet our customer's financial needs will provide Wells Fargo with many opportunities in the year ahead.","John Shrewsberry, our Chief Financial Officer will now provide more details on our fourth quarter results. John?","John Shrewsberry","Thanks John and good morning everyone. My comments will follow the presentation included in the quarterly supplements starting on Page two. John and I will then answer your questions.","Wells Fargo had another strong quarter, earning $5.7 billion and $1.02 in EPS in the fourth quarter. Our results included continued strong loan and deposit growth that was diversified across our businesses and credit quality continued to reflect the benefit of our ongoing risk discipline.","Our capital levels remained strong even as we returned $3.9 billion to shareholders in the fourth quarter through common stock dividends and net share repurchases.","Slide three highlights our strong full year results that John discussed at the beginning of the call, including increased revenue and pretax, pre-provision profit, strong loan and deposit growth, higher earnings and increasing our net payout ratio to 57%.","Page four highlights our revenue diversification and the balance between spread and fee income in the fourth quarter. The benefit of our diversified business model is that we have over 90 businesses that performed differently based on interest rates in the economic environment.","While the balance between spread and fee income has remained consistent over time, the drivers of fee income have varied. For example over the past five years, mortgage banking as a share of total fee income has been its highest 28%, but because of the decline in mortgage refinancing activity, mortgage banking fees have declined as expected and represented 15% of fee income in the fourth quarter.","However other businesses have benefitted from current market conditions, our trust in investment fees have steadily increased over the past five years and we're 36% of fee income in the fourth quarter.","These examples demonstrate the benefit of our diversification and how our business mix enables us to focus on meeting our customer's financial needs, while retaining our risk discipline.","Let me highlight some key drivers of our fourth quarter results from a balance sheet and income statement perspective starting on Page five. I'll discuss the drivers of our strong loan and deposit growth later in the call.","Short-term investments in fed funds sold declined $3.5 billion from the third quarter due to the deployment of liquidity into loans and investment securities. This was the first time since the fourth quarter of 2011 that we've had a linked quarter decline.","Investment securities increased $24 billion from the third quarter, due to $35 billion of purchases partially offset by run-off and maturities. The majority of our purchases were U.S. treasury and federal agency securities.","Turning to the income statement on Page six, revenue grew $230 million during the quarter with growth in net interest income and stable non-interest income.","Expenses increased in the quarter reflecting higher personnel cost, continued investments in our businesses and risk related initiatives and some typically higher fourth quarter expenses. Our results in the quarter also reflected lower income tax expense, which was down $123 million.","As shown on Page seven, we continue to have strong broad-based loan growth in the fourth quarter, our 14th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. The core loan portfolio grew by $60.4 billion, or 8% from a year ago, and was up $26 billion or 13% annualized from the third quarter.","Loan growth in the fourth quarter included $6.5 billion from financing related to the sale of our government guaranteed student loans as well as the Dillard\u2019s credit card portfolio acquisition.","Our liquidating portfolio decreased $20.1 billion from a year ago. It is now only 7% of our total loans, down from 22% at the end of 2008. Total average loan yields remain fairly stable declining just two basis points from the third quarter.","On Page eight we highlight our loan portfolio to have strong year-over-year growth. C&I loans were up $36.4 billion or 15% from a year ago with broad based growth that I\u2019ll highlight on the next page.","Core one-to-four family first mortgage loans grew $14.4 billion or 7% from a year ago reflecting continued growth in high quality conforming mortgages, pardon me, non-conforming mortgages primarily jumbo loans.","The credit quality of our core mortgage portfolio was outstanding with only six basis points of annualized credit loss in the fourth quarter. Auto loans were up $4.9 billion or 10% from last year. While we continued to benefit from the strong auto market, new originations were down from a year ago, reflecting our continued risk and pricing discipline in a competitive market.","Credit card balances were up $4.2 million or 16% from a year ago, benefiting from a combination of organic account and loan growth as well as the benefit of the Dillard's portfolio acquisition.","Slide Nine demonstrates the diversity of businesses that contributed to the growth in C&I loans. Let me highlight just a few. Asset-backed finance increased $16.7 billion, which included $6.5 billion from financing related to a government guaranteed student loan sale.","Corporate banking grew $5.8 billion, driven by new customer growth and higher utilization rates from existing customers. And capital finance grew $3.8 billion reflecting new customer growth.","As you can see on Page 10, we had over $1.1 trillion of average deposits in the fourth quarter, up $22.7 billion or 8% annualized from the third quarter. Our average deposit cost declined one basis point to nine basis points in the fourth quarter.","Our strong growth in checking customers continued in the fourth quarter with primary consumer checking customers growing 5.2% from a year ago and primary small business and business banking checking customers increasing 5.4%.","Our success reflected the advantages Wells Fargo offers including broad based and industry-leading distribution channels, enhanced product offerings that make it easier for customers to do more business with us and improved customer retention.","We continue to grow net interest income on a tax equivalent basis, up $255 million from the third quarter, reflecting strong growth in average earning assets up $43.5 billion or 3%.","The net interest margin, declined two basis point from the third quarter due to strong deposit growth, which resulted in higher average balances of cash and short term investments and from actions we took in the third quarter, which resulted in higher average balances and liquidity-related funding.","The impact of all other balance sheet growth and reprising benefit in the margin by three basis point due to a larger investment portfolio and stronger loan originations, increased interest income from variable sources benefited the margin by one basis point.","Our balance sheet remains asset sensitive, so we\u2019re well positioned to benefit from higher rates, but as we\u2019ve demonstrated by growing net interest income throughout the year, we're not relying on rates to increase to generate growth. Of course the first quarter will be impacted by two fewer days in the quarter. ","Total non-interest income was stable from third quarter as higher trust and investment fees, card fees, commercial real estate brokerage commissions and a $217 million gain on the sale of government guaranteed student loans was offset by a $396 million decline in market sensitive revenue, driven by lower equity gains and lower mortgage banking revenue and deposit service charges.","The decline in deposit service charges in the fourth quarter was primarily due to lower overdraft related fess resulting from changes we implemented in early October designed to provide customers with more real-time information to manage their deposit accounts and avoid overdrafts.","Mortgage banking revenue declined $118 million from the third quarter. As expected, mortgage origination income was down from the last quarter reflecting reduced volume from the seasonally lower purchase market.","The decline in mortgage rates during the quarter resulted in refinancing volume increasing to 40% of originations up from 30% last quarter.","While it's still early, the continued declining rates could benefit origination volumes from the first quarter and we currently expect volumes to be relatively consistent with fourth quarter levels, despite the fact that the first quarter usually reflects its lower purchase market.","Our gain on sale margin was consistent with last quarter and is expected to remain within the range we\u2019ve seen over the past four quarters.","Servicing income increased modestly from third quarter reflecting lower unreimbursed direct servicing cost, partially offset by lower net head results.","Our total trust and investment fees were up $3.7 billion in the fourth quarter which was a record high and increased to $151 million from third quarter driven by higher investment banking activity.","Our expenses continue to reflect our investments in our businesses including risk related initiatives. ","As shown on Page 13, expenses were up $399 million from third quarter. There were a number of factors driving this increase.","Personal expenses increase $272 million reflecting higher deferred comp expense, which is offsetting revenue, higher revenue based incentive compensation and higher healthcare costs.","A number of our expenses are typically higher in the fourth quarter. Equipment expense was up $124 million, primarily due to annual software license renewals.","Outside professional services increased $116 million, which included higher project related spending on business investments as well as risk related initiatives. Advertising expenses were also elevated up $42 million from third quarter.","While these typically higher expenses should be lower next quarter we will have seasonally higher personnel expenses in the first quarter, reflecting incentive compensation and employee benefits expense.","Our expenses will also reflect our continued investments in our infrastructure -- our risk infrastructure, including hiring new team members and ongoing project spending.","Our efficiency ratio is 58.1% for full year 2014 and we expect the efficiency ratio for full year 2015 to remain within our target range of 55% to 59%even if the upper end of our target range we're operating more efficiently than many of our peers.","Turning to our business segments starting on Page 14, community banking earned $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter, up 7% from a year ago and down 1% from the third quarter.","I've already highlighted the strong growth in primary checking customers. We've also been successfully adding retail bank households.","Through November our year-to-date household growth rate was the highest since 2010. Meeting the financial needs of these new households will help drive growth across our diversified product line.","Our debit and credit card businesses are examples of where we've had success and yet still have opportunities for continued growth.","Debit card purchase volume was up 8% from a year ago driven by primary checking customer growth and increased usage from our existing customers. Our credit card penetration rate increased to 42%, up from 37% a year ago.","Credit card purchase volume grew 17% from a year ago reflecting account growth and increased usage among our existing customers.","Wholesale banking earned $2 billion in the fourth quarter, down 7% from a year ago and up 3% from the third quarter. Loan growth continued to be strong with average loans up $32.2 billion or 11% from a year ago with growth across many businesses as I highlighted earlier.","Credit quality remained outstanding with eight consecutive quarters of net recoveries. Deposit growth was also strong with average core deposits up $33.9 billion or 13% from a year ago.","Results also benefited from strong investments banking fees, up 10% from a year ago, driven by higher loan syndication fees, high yield debt origination fees and equity underwriting.","Treasury management revenue increased 11% from a year ago, benefiting from record product sales in 2014 and re-pricing. Wealth, brokerage and retirement earned $514 million in the fourth quarter, up 5% from a year ago and down at 7% from the third quarter.","Revenue grew 6% from a year ago with growth in both net interest income and non-interest income. The growth in fee income was driven by a 12% increase in asset-based fees as we continue to execute on our strategic initiative of focusing on plan-based relationships resulting in higher recurring revenue.","Our brokerage advisory assets grew to $423 billion, up $48 million dollars or 13% from a year ago, primarily due to positive net flows. Loan growth for WBR remained strong, up 13% from a year ago, the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth.","This growth was primarily driven by an increase in high quality, non-confirming mortgage loans.","Turning to Page 17, credit quality in the fourth quarter remained strong with a net charge-off ratio of 34 basis points of average loans. The $67 million increase in net charge-offs from the third quarter was primarily driven by lower recoveries down $54 million, which we would expect at this stage with the credit cycle.","Nonperforming assets have declined for nine consecutive quarters and were down $739 million from the third quarter. Nonaccrual loans declined $517 million and foreclosed assets declined to $222 million.","The reserve release was $250 million in the fourth quarter, down $50 million from third quarter and down $350 million from a year ago.","Our capital levels remained strong with our estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III using the advanced approach full phased on at 10.44% in the fourth quarter. Our ratio declined slightly from the third quarter, reflecting an increase in the risk weighted assets, primarily from strong loan growth in the quarter.","We stated that our long term target is 10%, which includes a buffer over required minimums. Since we've achieved our targeted level, our capital ratios may fluctuate from quarter to quarter reflecting changes in asset levels or composition or changes in OCI impacted by market volatility. These potential changes are why we maintain a buffer.","As shown on Slide 19, we returned $3.9 billion to shareholders in the fourth quarter. Our common shares outstanding declined by 45 million shares in the fourth quarter, reflecting 62 million shares purchased during the quarter.","In addition we entered into a $750 million forward repurchase contracts that's expected to settle in the first quarter for approximately 14 million shares. As a reminder, our share issuance is usually higher in the first half of the year, given the timing of certain employee benefit plan issuances.","So in summary, our results in 2014 and for the fourth quarter reflected the benefit of our diversified business model, with strong growth in loans and deposits. Our loan portfolio is well diversified and charge-offs were near historic lows. We increased the amount of our capital and liquidity and returned $12.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase.","Our net payout ratio was 57% for the year within our targeted range of 55% to 75%. We believe we're well positioned to benefit from an improving economy and increased customer base. Our diverse product line and our continued risk discipline.","Our diversified business model has performed well across a variety of economic and interest rate environments and I am optimistic that it will continue to produce opportunities for our customers, our team members and our shareholders in the year ahead.","We'll now be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Joe Morford of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Joe Morford","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","John Stumpf","Hey morning.","Joe Morford","I just wondered if you could speak to how we should think about weighing the positive and negative effects of the sharp drop in energy prices on the bank, while it should help out the consumer businesses, is it enough to offset any potential credit issues or probably slow down in loan growth and investment banking activity?","John Stumpf","Well as I mentioned in my comments Joe, since the United States is a net consumer, net importer of oil, we think it's a positive for the U.S. economy. Clearly that's on average because there is going to be some states that are impacted. Some customers who are going to be impacted and some businesses that's going to be impacted, but we serve 70 million customers.","Virtually all of them know how to fill the gas tank and go to a gas pump and that's a real benefit. So we think net, net it's an opportunity. Surely there are offsets like we said, but even within the oil and gas business and John mentioned we are participant there. It's about 2% of our loans.","There is still a lot of opportunity for consolidation there and we'll participate in that with our customers. We're looking at our portfolio. We analyze that. We've been through that over the past, but net, net, we think it's a positive.","Joe Morford","Okay. Great, I guess somewhat related to that with the teams recently, the expectation is now that higher rates are getting pushed out. We could be lower for longer, which theoretically could weigh on margins.","Do you expect to be able to offset that with better growth in the business amidst the stronger economies you talk about or do you see any need to take a harder look at expenses and what other levers might you have to pull there?","John Shrewsberry","We're always taking a hard look at expenses. So there is nothing incremental that we would plan on doing there, but continuing to be as vigilant as we have.","We've been operating at a pretty strong level in a zero interest rate environment for a very long time and while because of the way our balance sheet is positioned, it would probably be -- there is upside when short term rates move and if that happen later, then that upside might be realized later.","We're continuing to position ourselves to compete and to perform in this interest rate environment and so loan growth, deposit growth, redeploying excess liquidity into earning assets, as I said being vigilant on expense, all of those things contribute to the performance that we've had and that we're anticipating continuing to have until that time that rates begin to move.","Joe Morford","Okay. Thanks so much for the thoughts.","John Stumpf","Thanks Joe.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","John McDonald","Hi. Good morning.","John Stumpf","Hi John.","John McDonald","I was wondering John on just a question on credit and provision asset quality clearly remains excellent and I wasn\u2019t sure if you mentioned future reserve releases John, but with such strong loan growth and credit metrics now looking stable, should we expect the reserve releases to taper off and might you need to start adding to reserves at some point if loan growth continues at this kind of pace?","John Shrewsberry","I think the short answer is yes. if we have robust loan growth going forward all things being equal even, that would contribute to the need for some amount of incremental provisioning. So it's going to be a function of the amount of loan growth, the mix of loan growth, the quality of the portfolio overall and general economic conditions.","One thing I would add to Joe's first question also is there is no specific provisioning action in the fourth quarter for what's going on in the energy world. There is nothing anticipated, nothing necessary at the moment, but there is nothing in that quarter either.","John McDonald","Okay. Did you make a comment about reserve releases John and if you achieved kind of -- in the past couple of quarters, you said reserve releases could continue. I was wondering if that changed a little bit now with credit bottoming in if I missed out.","John Shrewsberry","With the size of the portfolio, the size of the allowance and the amount of the fourth quarter's release, the $250 million, it's close to call. We've said in the recent past to expect them to taper.","Now for the reasons that you mentioned and I described, there could be future releases -- there could be future net provisioning. So we're at that point in the cycle I think.","John McDonald","Okay. Got it and then in terms of just the net interest income, the puts and takes, did you say how big the Dillard\u2019s portfolio was or could you tell us?","John Shrewsberry","We can't because of the nature of the contract we have with our customers. You can see the amount of loan growth in the credit card portfolio from quarter to quarter and that's a combination of the organic growth in the Dillard\u2019s portfolio.","John McDonald","Okay. And then any clarity you can offer on what opened up in terms of opportunity to deploy the liquidity this quarter, anything driving that in particular?","John Shrewsberry","Well, some clarity around our liquidity framework, clarity around -- further clarity around LCR, further clarity on what kind of cash versus other HQLA we would need to have. I think that emboldened us a little bit in terms of finding an entry point, but as we've said, these are difficult times for finding attractive entry points into fixed income markets when we're thinking about making that switch.","John Stumpf","And John also we had as you know continued very strong deposit growth.","John McDonald","Got it. Okay. Great. And just one last quick thing on TLAC John, rules on finalized, we do have a proposal, how do you feel on that and would you have to do some gradual preparing for that as we go forward?","John Shrewsberry","Sure, well just depending on where the ultimate rule comes out versus the range that's been published, at the low end of the range we've got less to do and at the high end of the range we would have more to do.","There is still a lot to know and there is some wood to chop in the regulatory realm to get to the final rule where on the record is pointing out that we really don't -- the industry doesn\u2019t understand the need for the magnitude of the total buffer that's been to our loss absorbing capacity that's been talked about here.","We certainly find that it lands a little bit harder on people who seem to have less risky business models. Those of us who are deposit funded with a little bit more straightforward deposit taking and lending type of activity.","We would like some clarity on why that makes sense, but however it lands, within the range that's been published, the approach for Wells Fargo is going to be to add more termed at the holding company level and that will have a -- that will have a P&L consequence that we have to navigate through and it will be substantially more manageable at the lower end of the range and somewhat more expensive at the higher end of the range.","John McDonald","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Erika Najarian","Yes. Good morning. Thank you.","John Stumpf","Good morning.","Erika Najarian","I appreciate the color that you have given us so far on what you expect from mortgage originations in the first quarter, but as we think about the full year and think about your comments earlier, high consumer confidence, accelerating GDP in the context of potentially lower long rate for longer.","Is it possible that from an industry level, the origination growth for this year could surpass the current MBA forecast of 6%.","John Shrewsberry","Yes. The numbers last time that I've seen from them is $1.1 trillion to $1.2 trillion. Yes, it could be higher based on those things. As I mentioned in my comments with what was done recently in FHA and some of the things that the GSEs are doing and if rates stay low or are favorable, surely we could see more activity and you could see actually more activity on both the refinance side and the purchased-money side.","We'll just have to see how that goes, but -- and I don't think there has been any reduction or any update on those numbers from the MBA, but it could the higher end of that range.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And on the flip side to that, you mentioned that you did get more clarity on also your HQLA with regards to being more aggressive on liquidity deployment, but John, you've mentioned several times that absolute level of rates have dictated your cash deployment or liquidity deployment strategy.","As we look at into 2015, was the clarity around the rules enough to make you a little bit more aggressive about deploying your liquidity into earning assets or is it going to continue to be largely rate dependent?","John Shrewsberry","Oh, it's a good question. It's substantially rate dependent at this point and loan growth dependent as well because that's the first call in all of our available liquidity is making loans to customers.","But if we believe that we're in a lower for longer, long term rate scenario separate that from policy rates for a moment, but just thinking about the tenure and mortgage rates etcetera, at the margin that probably emboldens us a little bit additionally to convert what's cash today into duration over the course of the year.","And actually we still have tens of billions available. So there's just a lot of liquidity on the sheet.","Erika Najarian","Understood and just a quick follow-up, we appreciate the color that you gave in terms of the impact of energy, as there have been a lot of questions from investors in terms of what it would take for banks to adjust its qualitative reserve to reflect lower energy prices?","I was just wondering if that's how Wells Fargo does it or do you really look at the reserve at least in terms of your energy and commercial exposure on a name by name, loan by loan basis?","John Shrewsberry","So in the case of commercial and corporate loans, it's absolutely that some of the parts have a name by name basis and the risk rating on each loan. We have hundreds of customers in the energy business. They are in the E&P or upstream part of the market.","There are midstream companies. There are services companies. We have the largest team in this area, very long tenure. Have been through several cycles and we're working with -- we're building customer by customer and working through each situation to figure out what this job means to them based on their leverage, based on their hedging profile, based on their assets, based on their management capability and that will lead to risk rating changes on a loan by loan basis or a name by name basis as time unfold and it's that activity that would lead to changes in our reserving posture for the portfolio.","John Stumpf","And we don't want to minimize this, but this is nature of that business. If you go back just six years, we've had $30 a barrel oil and we've had $140 a barrel oil. We've seen gas for example, natural gas go from $6, $7 Mcf to $2 and some change today and that's just part of that business.","John Shrewsberry","On the E&P side of that portfolio, those tend to be reserve based loans, asset based loans with a very interactive approach between the bank and the borrower in terms of determining the value of the collateral and then re-margining the loan down to reflect changes in the value of the collateral and of course that's at our discretion. We have our own engineers and we're very engaged in that process.","So all of that -- all of that ties into what the future reserving needs requirements are for that portfolio and as I said, nothing obviously has revealed itself yet and there is nothing in the fourth quarter specifically for that.","Erika Najarian","Got it. Thank you for taking my questions.","John Shrewsberry","Sure.","Your next question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ken Usdin","Hi, good morning, guys.","John Stumpf","Hi Ken.","Ken Usdin","A couple of questions on the fee side, John you had mentioned some of the tweaks you made in October on the service charges side, so I am wondering if you can help us understand what types of changes those were?","And then how you're looking at your product set with regards to either payday advance and whatever pending rules we could still get at some point next year on overdrafts and if that would continue to have an impact on your deposit fees?","John Shrewsberry","So what happened in October wasn\u2019t a change in the product or what we charged for and rather we un-ruled some incremental technology that allows our customers to have more real time information to manage their own baking affairs and they've been using that information and successfully reducing the amount of over-drafting method and which had an impact on our revenue.","We think it's very customer friendly and it's good for all of us. That's distinct from any pricing approach or a product approach that we'll have. With respect to -- go ahead.","Ken Usdin","Okay. No go ahead.","John Shrewsberry","You asked about short term or payday type lending, I think it's clear that during 2014 we discontinued a product that we used to offer that was a direct deposit advance product that allowed people to borrow on a short term unsecured basis with their next direct deposit pay check as security for a source of repayment for the loan and there was some regulatory urging around that.","I think most of the discussion around those types of products is now frankly outside the banking system because it's private financed companies who are providing that and that's how it seems to be doing that with from a regulatory perspective.","I would also tell you that the discontinued product is out of the run rate at this point. So the impact has been fully realized.","Ken Usdin","And then overdrafts?","John Shrewsberry","Hard to say much more about it other its -- we're not in the process of re-pricing or rethinking the product capability. The results that you'll see in our numbers are a reflection of the activity and behavior of our customers as they manage their own baking affairs.","Ken Usdin","Okay. Another question I had was just on the kind of market related revenues. They've been trending a little bit lower if I combine trading activities, securities gains, equity investment gains and that's even with the student loan gain in that 354 number.","Should we generically expect that you'll still be able to generate this type of market related revenue or is it more likely that we can trend down over time?","John Shrewsberry","So there is lot of moving parts there and I would look at a multi quarter average to think about how to model it. On the trading side, their customer accommodation, customer facing trading revenue that we make, which is a pretty modest part of Wells Fargo revenue profile, but will probably ebb and flow along the lines of what you're seeing in the industry just at a more modest level.","That also -- the trading line also includes the impact of our deferred comp hedging programs. So it's a little noisy given the magnitude of that versus the magnitude of our trading businesses, but those will be with based on industry factors and the deferred comp programs will be more revenue and more expense in an up market and less revenue and less expense in a down market generally speaking.","On the other elements, we've got gains from equity securities, gains from debt securities and in the equity space, you've seen some of the businesses that we've been involved in that frankly are -- that continue to be -- are sources of revenue that we would anticipate seeing if market conditions stay the same as they are today.","So I wouldn\u2019t model that down too heavily. And on the debt side, given the levels of rates that we're at and in some markets the levels of spreads that we're at, there are some debt securities, which it makes sense for us to sell and monetize from time to time just because their market value substantially exceeds what we can imagine as their intrinsic or certainly their carrying value.","So there will be pops in there from time to time as well. And it's some of those things that gets to that collection that you described.","Ken Usdin","Okay. And last one, maybe you can just talk a little about the momentum in the trust business and what type of outlook you see just through asset gathering and after a really strong year and in that part of the business. Do you see -- how is the pipeline for asset growth looking?","John Shrewsberry","We're very happy and pleased with the progress we've made in that area. One of the biggest opportunities we have is relationship between David Carroll's Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement Group and Carrie Tolstedt's Community Banking Group.","We have as many assets away from customers who call us their bank as we do under management right now. So the relationship and the working date of their to bring those assets home if you will, has been a big opportunity for us and -- but I still view this.","Of all the opportunities we have in the company, with all of our businesses probably that is our biggest opportunity to jump a curve or to even do -- to show some incremental growth above what you would see in other more mature businesses.","So a lot of opportunity there; pleased with where we are, lot more to do.","Ken Usdin","Thanks guys. Appreciate it.","John Shrewsberry","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Paul Miller with FBR. Please go ahead.","Paul Miller","Yes, thank you very much and there has been a lot of news thrown out today, but on your -- if you mentioned this in the prepared marks I apologize, but your C&I loans jumped up. Is that where the Ginnie Mae financing came through on your balance sheet?","John Shrewsberry","No, that's not that Paul.","Paul Miller","So that's just pure\u2026","John Shrewsberry","The biggest thing to call out is the student loan financing that we did. If you saw the portfolio of student loans and we provided some financing to the company who bought those loans and so if one items stands out in the quarter as outsized, it would be that, but those are all commercial loans.","Paul Miller","Yes and is there any particular industry that are doing well? Is it just across the Board and across geographic that this line item picked up? Because this is one of the line items we've been waiting to see pick up in general amongst the bigger ranks.","John Shrewsberry","Very broad based.","John Stumpf","Very broad.","Paul Miller","And you're not saying because the questions that I get is that everybody is concerned about the energy credits, but you're just not seeing and I know you made some opening comments about that, but you're just not seeing anything on the negative side on energy credits at this point.","John Shrewsberry","Well this drop in crude is very recent and the companies are taking the appropriate evasive actions to preserve cash, to de-lever, to reduce their expense base etcetera, but it hasn\u2019t worked its way into loan quality.","Now loan demand certainly will be down in that area I assume, but in the fourth quarter you can see what the change in growth is out there and net outstandings was which more than makes up for whatever reduced demand there is in the energy space.","Paul Miller","Okay guys. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.","Bill Carcache","Thank you. Good morning. I had a question on your credit card growth strategy. I think most would agree that credit card assets yields have held up quite well in this slow rate environment relative to other asset classes.","Would you consider competing more aggressively on rates in an effort to growth your share of outstanding balances particularly since the high return business where you arguably have room to give up a bit on pricing, while still generating returns that are attractive relative to other lower return over yielding asset classes?","John Stumpf","Well let me say it this way. First of all we love the card business, especially for our community bank customers and we've grown from the low to mid 20s penetration to now to 42% of our customers carry our credit card.","And we like that business a whole lot not only from the balances we get, but to be relevant to our customers as far as handling their payments, providing them services that are even around payments and so forth for them.","We want to provide great value. Pricing sure is part of that. You've seen recently where we've partnered with American Express. We do a ton of business with Visa on the higher end, higher value cards.","So this is really a strategy about getting more cards top of wallet with our customers and pricing, rewards, the whole value of proposition is part of that. I wouldn\u2019t say it's just any one thing around price per se, but it around value.","Bill Carcache","Great. Thank you. A separate question if I may on municipal deposits, can you talk about how significant municipal deposits are to Wells? Are you deemphasizing them given their relative unfriendly LCR treatment and to what extent do you see future revenue opportunity for holding them?","John Stumpf","We have a -- we have a very big municipal business and deposits are certainly part of that. It's a service that we provide to the tax exempt issuing community and by municipal, it's all forms of state and local and country government and other non-profit types of customers.","The unfriendly LCR treatment came from the fact that municipal deposits tend to be collateralized by us so that their municipal depositor is safer in the event of a problem with their bank and that wasn\u2019t being taken into account in the original approach to LCR.","We think we've gotten that favorable outcome there, so that they're now LCR friendly. Still very competitive. We still like those deposits. We still very much enjoy those relationships because there is a lot of banking service that we provide to those types of clients, but they don't have the LCR problem that they might have seemed to have in pre-clarification that came out in the third or fourth quarter.","Bill Carcache","Okay. So it was my understanding that for the purposes of the LCR calculation in the numerator, the high quality liquid assets would not be able to include the collateral associated with the deposits and then had to outflow in the denominator on day one. Is that not the case anymore?","John Stumpf","I don't think that you have it right. I think that it works fine. Incidentally there were two issues that people were trying to address in tweaks to LCR relating to munis.","The other one was whether high quality muni bonds would be considered HQLA on the asset side and I don't think that there has been a resolution there and there are a number of our customer -- our clients who issue high quality muni bonds to take exception of that and we will see where that goes.","But on the deposit side, I think we've cracked the code.","Bill Carcache","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Mike Mayo","Good morning. I had a question about the efficiency ratio. First what were the drivers in higher revenue driven compensation and deferred comp, especially with lower originations and software trading results?","And then the following question to that is are you still at the upper end of your efficiency target, what can you do to get at least back towards the middle end?","John Shrewsberry","Well so the drivers of the revenue oriented portion of increased compensation included a handful of businesses. I would say investment banking was one of them where we were $150 million up in the quarter and so some portion of the elevated expense is attributable to that, but it comes from a few others as well.","And again to those businesses that performed better in the fourth quarter, so it could be with 90 different businesses, it can be a little here, a little there. That was part of it.","So we find ourselves in the high 58% or now 59% and with a lot of emphasis on trying to be as efficient as we can and how we spend our money every day. There are no guarantees that we're moving toward the middle of the lower end of the range in this interest rate environment and as we go through a full year.","While we're tackling the things that we need to tackle, we spend a lot of money on risk management, compliance related initiatives other things that have a regulatory origin and some of that is semi permanent, might be around for several quarters and some of it is going to around the run rate for a while.","If rates begin to move up that probably moves us down in the range, but it's frankly a 59%, which is the high end of our range where we can tolerate that. We've been performing very well.","John Stumpf","Mike, you're hitting one of the important issues for us as. As John mentioned, we take this seriously. We're looking for all those opportunities to eliminate expenses where customers don't find value and it's an ongoing continuous process for us, reducing square footage.","It's one of those looking hard at the kind of money we spend that is not revenue producing if you will, but also making sure that we take a look at the long term. So we continue to invest in things like late last year Apple Pay and other things that we do to provide convenience for our customers.","So it's always a don't waste, but also we take a long term view, but this continues to be a big focus for us.","Mike Mayo","Well correct me if I am wrong. You have a 55% to 59% efficiency target range and what I am hearing now is, well if the rate environment we might be at 59% whereas I wasn\u2019t sure if I heard that same message before or saying well unless rates go up, we won't get to the middle part of the range and you were a little bit lower before.","So am I hearing the message wrong or is it simply that you've done what you could for so long with the low rate environment and you can't do a whole lot more or what is it that leads you to say, well, 59% okay.","John Shrewsberry","Well I think when we had the range, we knew that we would surely we would love to be at 55%, but we also recognized that that's how we gave a range. These were -- think of as guardrails and we're spending more in cyber today. We're spending more on all things risk.","On the other hand, we've not yet pulled out all of our expenses around loss mitigation. We continue to make investments in distribution. So I guess a range is a range and I can't guarantee with the lower end, but if we were at the high end that's also acceptable.","In our mind, if we're making the right investments, in the right things and eliminating expenses where we think they can be eliminated. So that's how we feel about it.","Mike Mayo","And then last follow-up the cyber expenses or the all things risk expenses, have these ticked up some, or is this kind of what you had expected?","John Shrewsberry","They've ticked up in the terms of we continue to make more investments there and we're starting to get the annualization of expenses we made last year. And we'll get more efficient in that over time, but we're spending -- we're spending the money we think we need to spend.","And sometimes that's hiring consultants and then over time you can convert whatever they're doing to team members, which tends to be more efficient, you're not as efficient in every process, the minute you adopted it or employ it, but more money has been spent there.","Mike Mayo","All there. Thank you.","John Shrewsberry","Thank you, Mike.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Good morning.","John Stumpf","Good morning.","Matt O\u2019Connor","If I could follow-up on the net interest margin was down just two basis points, which I think was very good in this kind of environment. As I look at some of the underlying detail on the yields of the securities and some of the loan yields.","I guess I don't totally understand how they've been so stable and wondering if there is anything you can add on maybe first the securities, you've been growing it and the yields have been remarkably resilient.","John Shrewsberry","It's just math. What we've been growing hasn\u2019t been that extraordinary in terms of its incremental contribution to the way that it average because the denominators is big as it is.","If we continue to deploy as I know you know, if we continue deploying in this environment, ultimately it will start to skew down the way it averaged return and also we've been tending to invest in treasury and agency securities and just from a credit quality point of view, that's going to bring down returns, setting aside the historical book yields versus current book yields and the shape of the current when the investments were made.","If we've got corporates and munis and some other things in the starting portfolio, if we're just adding U.S. treasuries, it's going to bring things down, but it just hasn\u2019t revealed itself yet because the numbers haven\u2019t been big enough yet.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay. And then on the loan yields, I guess they've been surprisingly resilient as well. Do you feel like -- I know it's a blend of eight or ten categories the way you disclose it, but do you feel like generally speaking loan yields have stabilized and I am looking at the C&I that was actually up a couple bips, but really up and down the portfolio.","It feels like there has been pretty good stability the last three or four quarters.","John Shrewsberry","I think that's right. We're in fiercely competitive markets. Not every bit of composition is in the last phase. It's point of spread on a loan. Sometimes it's in the structure of a loan and of course there are places we'll back away from when that happens, but it is competitive, but it hasn\u2019t all shown up in price.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay. And then I mean I just -- I guess putting it all together as you think about the next margin percent going forward, probably largely dependent on loan growth, but how do you think it shapes out?","Obviously the rates where they are doesn\u2019t help but is it just as modest pressure of is there more material pressure to come?","John Shrewsberry","It depends on the pace of continued deposit inflows and how that gets redeployed. If deposits remain steady where they are, then the loan growth and the redeployment from cash into investment securities is going to be very supportive of the Inco.","If we get keep getting high single-digit or even low double-digit deposit growth and it doesn\u2019t make and loan growth isn\u2019t happening at the same pace where redeploying into investment securities doesn\u2019t make sense at the same pace, then the math is going to put pressure on that calculation.","And as you know, that's not a calculation we're managing to. It's an outcome of the other things that we're doing, but the driver there is the growth in deposit and how you responsibly deploy that into either loans or securities in the same timeframe that the deposits are coming in.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay. All right makes sense. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Betsy Graseck","Hi. Good morning.","John Stumpf","Hi Betsy.","John Shrewsberry","Hi Betsy.","Betsy Graseck","Hey, I had a question on investment spend and thoughts around mobile wallet with Apple Pay obviously you did a lot of work there, is there an opportunity to take those investments and potentially expand them into mobile wallet, real time banking other tokenization strategies?","John Shrewsberry","Well we're doing a lot of work in all those things, but the so called paperless store and doing real time cash letters and helping customers with real-time information not understanding which channel they're involved.","And so I would say all the above is important. What we've found, which is interesting is that our most loyal customers today are ones who use the channels most often and the most types of channels.","So even for those customers who are very advanced technology and use of technology, ease of technology who might be dominant in that channel, still visit stores on a infrequent but regular basis. They go to ATMs. So there is lots of things.","And we're making -- some of the investments we're making is to set up an appointment with the banker using your technology. We're testing things about being able to authenticate customers knowing they are in the stores, working on things that would authenticate an ATM machine, maybe using your mobile on.","So there is mobile devices, so there is just lots of things going on there. And we're actually leaning a lot of those things from retailers and other service providers outside of our industry. So pretty exciting stuff.","Betsy Graseck","And do you feel this is like table stakes and will just maintain share or do you think that you're doing things that could potentially drive share up, drive down that expense ratio?","John Shrewsberry","Well I think about less or an expense ratio, but these are more than table -- while they're table stakes in some cases, if you don't have a mobile offering, you're probably not going to serve most millennials today.","But we think of it more than table stakes. We think it's a big reason why we're growing net new primary tech new account where we're 5% a year.","The positive growth we've had clearly is a result of -- partially a result of our distribution model and the Omni channel view we have of these various channels, not separate businesses, but combined into really centric around the customer needs and convenience. And our growth is I think reflective of our commitment to that.","Betsy Graseck","And I guess I am just wondering too on a Dillard\u2019s because I would expect that retailers also want best-in-class mobile apps etcetera, is this part of what we should expect you'll be delivering to Dillard\u2019s and other private liable portfolios that you're in?","John Shrewsberry","Well I don't want to speak about a particular situation, but I'll just give you this. 16 years ago, we didn't have an online offering. Today over 80% of the customers are actively online, some 28 million or 24 million customers actively online on the consumer side.","Five years ago we didn't have a mobile offering. Today we have over 14 million customers on that. I mean mobile is the fastest growing, fastest adopted channel we've had in our history of our company.","And the things that customers can now do mobally and the things that they\u2019ll be able to do in the next year or two as we continue to introduce new capabilities is really exciting. So watch for this. It's really important.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. Thanks.","John Shrewsberry","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","John Pancari","Good morning.","John Stumpf","Good morning.","John Pancari","On the -- kick the energy horse here again, so my apologies, but first of all can you just help quantify your total leverage loan book what the size is? And then of that leverage loan book, how much of it is energy?","John Stumpf","Sure, so we don't have a leverage loan book. We have loan portfolios in various lines of business. We have an energy loan portfolio, which would include both oil and gas and as I mentioned, it's about 2% of our loans overall and it includes E&P companies. It includes mid stream, pipeline companies and it includes services companies. It also includes some investment grade integrated oil names.","But some of that is about 2% of our total loan portfolio. Some of those companies will have higher leverage. Some of those companies will have lower leverage, but we don't draw the portfolio line along the level of leverage.","John Pancari","Okay. And then separately related to that, do you have the amount of bond exposure that you may have held in your trading portfolios for any deals that you've done in the energy sector? Do you have that quantified?","John Stumpf","Yes, it's a good question. So I'll quantify for you our total securities exposure including what's in trading and also what's in AFS because we have some -- we have some corporate investments in energy names as well.","And the sum total of both of those is less than a $1.5 billion at Wells Fargo and it's much smaller portion in trading which of course gives mark-to-market through the P&L every day and somewhat larger percentage of that is sitting in AFS, which we mark every day, but the value change goes through OCI.","John Pancari","Okay. All right. And then separately on the loan growth I agree good pick up that we saw in C&I for the quarter, and as we look out into 2015, is it fair to assume that you should see some acceleration in the loan growth that you're looking at for 2015 versus what you achieved in 2014.","I think you're in the 4% to 5% range for 2014. Is it fair to assume that, that accelerates from there next year or for the full year 2015?","John Shrewsberry","I think knowing what we know about the economy today, we feel better about the next four quarters than couple of the last four quarters. So if the most recent quarter is the continuation of a two quarter trend, then yes, we'll probably have higher loan growth or higher amounts originated.","Now if the denominator keeps growing as we grow the size of the portfolio and at some point the rate gets impacted by that. But yes, it feels like a good year for loan growth.","John Stumpf","You know John, we think if you're going to grow revenues over the long run, you have to be growing households, cross-sell deposits and loans and we share a plan for all of those.","John Pancari","Okay. All right. And my last question. I know there are some questions around the excess liquidity reinvestment and what you've been buying, I know you indicate you're buying treasuries and agencies.","Do you have what durations and what yields that you purchased in the quarter? Just to get an idea of what the ultimate impact could be on the margin?","John Shrewsberry","Yes, we don't lay out quite that way. You'll see in our tables what we're talking about, but its treasuries and agencies you know the timeframe and I can tell you we're in the intermediate part of the curve. So that will probably get you there.","John Pancari","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","Eric Wasserstrom","Good morning.","John Stumpf","Good morning, Eric. Oh Regina, he dropped.","Operator","Eric, your line is open.","Eric Wasserstrom","Hi, can you hear me?","John Stumpf","Yes, hi Eric.","Eric Wasserstrom","Oh! Hi. That was an odd, because I was not on mute and I have the telephone at least once before. Just to follow-up on the OpEx for a moment, I understand the discussion of the ratio, but just in terms of absolute level, based on what I am hearing in terms of your loan growth expectation, it sounds like we should be anticipating an absolute level of expense that is higher than what we saw in 2014. Is that correct?","John Stumpf","It's really tough to say, which is why we're talking percentages and think about things in terms of a range and you can see the items that we're calling out as feeling seasonal in Q4 and there is a handful of them and there an amount to a few $100 million.","And then of course in Q1, we typically have escalated personnel in benefits expense as well.","In terms of the OpEx of the investments that we're making in risk management etcetera, they will be elevated for some period of time, but because of all of the other drivers to the total expense number.","It's possible that we operate and there is a reasonable expectation that we operate at a lower level than we have in the last couple of quarters because we're always pushing down on things where we can.","So that's why we give you the range. We think we're going to be in the range in 2015 like we have been in 2014. One other item I had mentioned for those other new two that we do have this deferred comp element that shows up in expense even though it's a P&L neutral item and that creates in some cases a couple $100 million worth of noise in any given quarter, which is material given the differences that we're talking about here.","John Shrewsberry","But Eric even though we're at the high end of the range now, one should not assume that it's not top of mind around here, it is. It is. It range top of mind and it's always looking for opportunities to be more efficient, but also continue to invest in the future because we do have a long term view.","Eric Wasserstrom","Right. Of course. And the financing that you provided on the student loan sale, what is the expected duration of that?","John Shrewsberry","So that financing probably comes down over the course of next couple of years on a relatively steep curve as the portfolio gets permanently financed into student loan ABS and so my expectation I think the reasonable expectation is that it's average life would be maybe a little bit more than a year as it comes down.","Eric Wasserstrom","Got it. And just quickly one last thing, the tax benefit that you mentioned in the period from the change in federal tax law, is that a permanent benefit and what should we expect for your kind of go forward GAAP tax rate?","John Shrewsberry","So what happened in the fourth quarter is both the impact of the extender legislation that came in at the end of the year as well as the resolution of some discrete matters that we've been working on with the various taxing authorities for some period of time.","I would look at recent prior years for what the reason of what a good expectation is for a tax rate going forward.","Eric Wasserstrom","Okay. So largely unchanged, it sounds like.","John Shrewsberry","Yes, I think that's right.","Eric Wasserstrom","All right. Thanks very much.","John Shrewsberry","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mutascio with KBW. Please go ahead.","Chris Mutascio","Good morning, guys; Happy New Year to you.","John Stumpf","Happy New Year to you, Chris.","Chris Mutascio","I have a quick question for John Shrewsberry, you noted that your investment securities portfolio was increasing quite materially over last year; I think it's up about $50 billion. Can you tell me what portion of that is Ginnie Mae, MBS? How much is that Ginnie Mae portfolio.","If you have exposure has it grown in '14?","John Shrewsberry","It's negligible.","Chris Mutascio","Okay. Because I am assuming the refinance activity there with a 50 basis point cut, plus rates being down, I didn't know what the impact would be perhaps on the margin, but your Ginnie Mae exposure is negligible.","John Shrewsberry","Negligible.","Chris Mutascio","All right. Thank you very much.","John Stumpf","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research. Please go ahead.","Nancy Bush","Good morning, guys.","John Stumpf","Happy New Year, Nancy.","Nancy Bush","Happy New Year. Two questions for you. John you mentioned the changes at in the GSEs and at the FHA with regard to allowable mortgages etcetera. There seems to have been a remarkable turnaround in Washington since the days the financial crises when everybody was cracking down on mortgages and we're in a reverse posture now.","As a result of this, do you see any changes that you might make at the mortgage company in terms of businesses that you exited, the wholesale business etcetera that you might want to go back and revisit?","John Stumpf","No, well first of all, I think those are positive changes that have been made and I think they've been largely made because it got too restrictive and customers who deserved a loan, who wanted to buy a home could afford it, could not get credit.","And I am not -- I don't want to overstate the amount of those folks, but there was that element and I think we've come to a much better place with regulators, with the industry and with customers.","But no, we don't have an intention of going back into joint ventures or the wholesale business. We like the business mix we have now.","Nancy Bush","Okay. Second question is this. There was -- I believe a heard on the Street column a few days ago in the Wall Street Journal about the impact of the energy price drop on various banks and John I think they mentioned that the figure of 17% of revenues comes to mind with regard to your capital markets businesses related to energy.","Could you just clarify that where you stand in capital markets with relation to the energy business and is there going to be a big impact in revenues there?","John Stumpf","So in that article they referred to I think geologic information for 2014 that suggested that we had about $280 million worth of underwriting revenue from energy related activity. So that would be debt and equity underwriting and probably loan syndication fees as well.","So that's the order of magnitude. The 17% would refer to that as a percentage of the investment banking revenue -- U.S. investment banking revenue for full year of 2014.","So if in terms of at risk or where it goes from here, that's a starting point for last year. And it bounced around between I don't know, $150 million and maybe $300 million over the course of the last several years.","Nancy Bush","Okay. And just one more question John Stumpf for you, you've been very positive on the direction of the American economy for the last couple of quarters and I think you remain that way. Well I don't know if you saw your predecessor Mr. Kovacevich on CNBC a couple of mornings ago and he was not so positive on the strength of the American economy.","I am sure you still talk to Dick from time to time and sort of what is behind the differing views?","John Stumpf","What was his name again?","Nancy Bush","That K guy.","John Stumpf","Oh! The K guy. Well I obviously respect Dick's view and there are different views in the economy, but that being said when I -- and there is volatility clearly. Today, look at retail sales and if I feel differently, so you can feel differently on a day to day basis.","But when I look at the businesses that we're in and as I am talking with customers which I am every day and talking with our business leaders and frankly looking at the numbers, 50 consecutive months of employment growth. Unemployment in the five, six range. GDP 5% and will probably have a few quarters this year that start with 3%.","So I am optimistic. I don't think -- again I don't think this is a breakout, but I think we're on the front foot and consumer's confidence is at a all time high since the downturn. So the way I read the tea leaves, I'm optimistic.","John Shrewsberry","I think Dick also suggest that we could have gotten here sooner. We could be at higher levels\u2026","John Stumpf","And actually I agree with that.","Nancy Bush","Okay. Thanks very much.","John Stumpf","Thank you.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.","Marty Mosby","Hello and well, glad to have wrap it up for you. If you look at the capital deployment ratios, if you look at your total payout this quarter of 72%, which is I think close to your stated target you talked about around 75%.","So the increased capital deployment from here, are you going to need to see some earnings momentum or do you think you could push pass at 75% payout ratio?","John Shrewsberry","So our target is 55% to 75% and you saw that it bounced around during the course of the four quarters of 2014 for a few reasons. One of them is that we do more share issuance in connection with our benefit plans in the first half of the year and so it drives down the net payout ratio.","The first call on our capital is to be available to support more loan growth on behalf of our customers. So the capital deployment horse is out in front of the net payout cart and that's important to remember because we're not hoping that we have enough to support the business growth after we think about distribution.","We're making sure we have enough to support the business growth and then we're factoring in distribution behind that. So we anticipate continuing to operate in the range quarter by quarter, 55% to 75% and the fourth quarter was a high take on that in the 70s.","Marty Mosby","And that was really kind of looking back towards the E part of that, which is as earnings grow, that gives you more chance, what kind of catalyst do you see until -- while we're waiting on interest rates to create some incremental earnings momentum kind of reigniting that, that we've seen kind of slow down over the last couple of quarters?","John Stumpf","Sure, well its loan growth for sure. It's redeployment of excess liquidity into higher yielding earning assets. It will be what the impact is on expenses that we've been talking a lot a little bit, if we do as expected there.","And then it's the various sources of fee revenue, which have which reflect quarter to quarter, up year-over-year, but there is a lot of momentum in places like card, places like investment banking, trust and investment fees overall.","We just talked about the slightly more bullish case for mortgage this year. All of those are catalysts for growth.","Marty Mosby","Thanks.","John Stumpf","Yes. Thank you.","John Stumpf","Thank you. And thanks everybody who joined us today and again Happy New Year to everybody and thanks for your interest in Wells Fargo. See you next quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for joining.

My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions].","I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference.","John Campbell","Thank you, Regina. Good morning. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO and President, Tim Sloan; and our CFO, John Shrewsberry, will discuss second quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our second quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our website.","I will now turn the call over to our CEO and President, Tim Sloan.","Timothy Sloan","Thanks John. Good morning and I want to thank you all for joining us today. I know it's a busy morning for many of you. We earned $5.2 billion in the second quarter or $0.98 per diluted common share. Our results included net discrete income tax expense of $0.10 per share. John is going to provide more details on this income tax expense as well as other noteworthy items that impacted our results later in the call. I want to focus my comments on providing an update on the transformational changes that we're making to build a better, stronger company for our customers, team members, communities and shareholders. These efforts include progress on our six goals. ","We've committed to transform how we manage risk at Wells Fargo, and our goal is not only to meet, but exceed regulatory expectations so that we have the best risk management in the industry. We have a strong track record of managing many of our risks, and our 2018 CCAR results and credit quality are just two examples. However, we have to improve how we manage other risks, such as compliance and operational risk, to address challenges, such as those we'll discuss later in the call on our foreign exchange and trust businesses. As I mentioned at Investor Day, we're pleased that Mandy Norton has started as our new Chief Risk Officer, and she's already having a positive impact. While we have more work to accomplish, I'm confident we'll achieve our goal in risk management.","We're also focused on new ways to create a better customer experience. This includes a number of changes that help our customers manage their accounts by leveraging data and technology. In June, we launched a customer pilot of Control Tower, a digital experience aimed at providing our customers visibility and control of their connections to their payment accounts. Last year, we introduced automatic zero balance alerts to online banking customers, and we now send an average of more than 30 million zero balance and customer-specified balance alerts a month. ","We're continuing to make changes to better serve our customers who come in our branches. In the second quarter, we completed the rollout of our customer relationship view tool, which helps our tellers and bankers have more value-added conversations and refer customers to specialists to meet more complex needs. These conversations are improving the customer experience, and we believe they'll further improve customer retention and deepen relationships over time, which leads to growth.","We've also continued to create value for our customers through our focus on innovation. In the first quarter, we launched our online mortgage application, which grew to 23% of all retail applications in June. In the second quarter, we introduced iPrint biometric log-on capabilities for our commercial customers, making it easier for them to do business. Our small business banking deposit customers can now apply and, if approved, immediately accept card payments and purchase processing equipment through one convenient online application at Wells Fargo Merchant Services. And we rolled out simplified, standard Merchant Services pricing for eligible small business customers, too. We've also announced the newly enhanced Propel Card, one of the richest, no-annual-fee rewards cards in the industry. We believe our credit card business has significant opportunities for growth, and we are excited to start taking applications for the card next week.","As part of our goal of making a positive contribution to the communities we serve, which includes promoting environmental sustainability, we recently announced a commitment to provide $200 billion in financing to sustainable businesses and projects by 2030. And the millions of hours our team members volunteer each year contributed to Wells Fargo recently being named as one of the 50 most community-minded companies in the U.S. from the Points of Light organization.","We also want to be a leader in team member engagement, and we've made many changes to make Wells Fargo a better place to work. These efforts are reflected in continued declines in voluntary team member attrition, which -- with second quarter voluntary attrition at its lowest level in over five years. We've also had success in hiring strong talent from outside of Wells Fargo. In addition to our new Chief Risk Officer, we also hired Lisa Frazier to lead our Innovation Group. Lisa has extensive experience in digital disruption, customer experience and product innovation. And earlier this week, David Galloreese, who was most recently at Walmart, joined us as the new Head of Human Resources.","As part of our goal of delivering long-term shareholder value, we're committed to returning more capital to our shareholders. This commitment was demonstrated in our recent CCAR results, which included an increase in our quarterly common stock dividend rate in the third quarter 2018 to $0.43 per share, subject to board approval, and up to $24.5 billion of gross common stock repurchases during the next four quarters. The shareholder returns included in our 2018 Capital Plan are approximately 70% higher than our previous four-quarter capital actions. ","Our ability to significantly increase our returns demonstrates the strength of our diversified business model, our sound financial risk management practices and our strong capital position, which is a result of the capital we built in recent years through continued stable earnings and a lower level of risk-weighted assets. We're also committed to operating more efficiently, and we are on track to achieve our targeted $4 billion of expense reductions by the end of 2019. ","In the second quarter, we also launched our reestablished marketing effort, which is the largest advertising campaign in our history. The campaign acknowledges our past issues, shows how we're moving forward, and highlights the changes happening and continues to happen at Wells Fargo. The reaction to the campaign has been positive, and advertising awareness has continued to increase. As our ads highlight, our team members are focusing on transforming Wells Fargo into a better company for all of our stakeholders, and I am confident that we're on the right path. ","John will now discuss our financial results in more detail.","John Shrewsberry","Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. As Tim mentioned, we had a number of noteworthy items this quarter, which we've highlighted on Slide 2 of our supplement. Our earnings of $5.2 billion included $481 million net discrete income tax expense. This expense mostly related to state income taxes and was driven by the recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling in South Dakota versus Wayfair. While the ruling addressed whether a state can require an out-of-state seller to collect sales taxes or use taxes even when the seller lacks an in-state physical presence, it has an income tax implication as well. Following the ruling, some of our affiliated entities may be considered to be taxable based on an economic presence in the state, even if they have no physical presence in the state. And while our effective income tax rate increased to 25.9% in the second quarter from this expense, we currently expect our effective income tax rate for the remainder of '18 to be approximately 19%, excluding the impact of any other future discrete items.","Our results also included $619 million of operating losses primarily related to non-litigation expense for previously disclosed matters, which I'll highlight in more detail in the next page. We had a $479 million gain on the sale of $1.3 billion of Pick-a-Pay PCI mortgage loans; $214 million of other-than-temporary impairment on the announced sale of Wells Fargo's Asset Management 65% ownership stake in The Rock Creek Group; and $150 million reserve release reflecting strong overall portfolio credit performance and lower balances.","As we're highlighting on Page 3, operating losses in the second quarter were driven by a customer remediation for previously disclosed matters, all of which have been referenced in our recent 10-Q and 10-Q filings. I'll spend a moment updating you on these matters. The foreign exchange business has been under new leadership since October of '17. And after substantially completing an assessment with the assistance of a third party, the business is currently in the process of revising and implementing new policies, practices and procedures, including those related to pricing. In the second quarter, we accrued $171 million in customer remediation and rebate costs.","We've been conducting an ongoing review related to certain of Wells Fargo's historical FX pricing practices. $31 million was accrued in the second quarter to remediate customers that may have received pricing inconsistent with commitments made to those customers. In addition, as part of our efforts to make things right and rebuild trust, we've examined rates historically charged to FX customers over a seven-year period and set aside $140 million in the second quarter to rebate customers where historic pricing, while consistent with contracts entered into with those customers, doesn't conform to our recently implemented standards and pricing.","With respect to fee calculations in certain fiduciary and custody accounts in Wealth and Investment Management, we've determined that there have been instances of incorrect fees being applied to certain assets and accounts, resulting in both overcharges and undercharges to customers. In the second quarter, we accrued $114 million to refund customers that may have been overcharged at any time during the past seven years. The third-party review of customer accounts is ongoing to determine the extent of any additional necessary remediation, including with respect to additional accounts not yet reviewed.","During the second quarter, we also accrued additional amounts for remediation related to past practices in our automobile lending business, including insurance-related products, and related to mortgage interest rate lock extensions. We believe remediation for mortgage interest rate lock is now substantially complete. In June, we received final approval on the class-action lawsuit settlement concerning improper sales practices, and the claims filing period for the settlement closed on July 7. We had previously accrued for the amount of this settlement. These actions are important steps in our efforts to rebuild trust.","Turning to Page 4. As Tim highlighted, improving risk management across Wells Fargo is a top priority, including our compliance and operational risk management program. And we're focused on satisfying the requirements of the Federal Reserve, OCC and CFPB consent orders. However, the asset cap related to the Federal Reserve's consent order has not impacted our ability to grow our core lending and deposit taking businesses. The decline in the balance sheet in the second quarter primary reflected lower deposits, driven by seasonality as well as commercial and Wealth and Investment Management customers allocating more cash to alternative, higher-rate liquid investments. I'll describe deposit trends in more detail later on the call. I'll be highlighting the income statement drivers on Page 5 throughout the call. ","So turning to loans on Page 6. Average loans declined $6.9 billion from the first quarter. The decline in loan balances was not related to any actions we took in connection with the consent order, but was driven by opportunistic loan sales and continued reductions in auto, consumer real estate and commercial real estate. ","I'll highlight the specific drivers starting on Page 7. Commercial loans declined $291 million from the first quarter, despite C&I loans increasing $1.9 billion on growth in our Asset Backed Finance, Middle Market Banking and commercial capital business. The growth was more than offset by continued declines in Commercial Real Estate, primarily due to lower originations reflecting continued credit discipline and competitive highly liquid financing markets as well as ongoing paydowns on existing and acquired loans. Of note, Wholesale Banking revolving line utilization has been substantially unchanged compared with a year ago at approximately 40%.","Consumer loans declined $2.8 billion from the first quarter. First mortgage loans increased $343 million as high-quality, nonconforming loan origination growth was partially offset by $2.3 billion of lower Pick-a-Pay mortgage loans, including the sales of $1.3 billion of PCI loans. In addition, $507 million of nonconforming mortgage loan originations that otherwise would have been included in this portfolio were designated as held for sale in anticipation of future issuance of RMBS securities. Junior lien mortgage loans continued to decline as paydowns more than offset new originations. However, junior lien mortgage originations grow in the second quarter, up 15% from a year ago.","Credit card loans increased $581 million from the first quarter. Balances increased $1.4 billion or 4% from a year ago. New account -- new accounts grew 7% from a year ago, driven by higher digital channel acquisitions. 43% of new card accounts were originated through digital channels in the second quarter. We expect credit card balances to continue to grow, bolstered by the launch of our new Propel Card next week and our continued focus on digital channel acquisition. Auto loans were down $1.9 billion from the first quarter due to expected continued runoff. Auto originations have stabilized over the past three quarters. And we're positioned for originations to start to grow, and we currently expect portfolio balances to begin to grow by mid-2019.","Other revolving credit and installment loans declined $376 million from the first quarter and included $68 million of loans transferred to held for sale as a result of previously announced branch divestitures. Balances in student lending and personal loans and lines continued to decline, but originations of personal loans and lines were up 8% from a year ago and reached their highest level since the third quarter of 2016.","Average deposits declined $25.9 billion for the first quarter, driven by lower commercial deposits, including $13.5 billion from actions taken in response to the asset cap. Average consumer and small business banking deposits declined $1.4 billion as higher average Community Banking deposits were more than offset by lower deposits in Wealth and Investment Management as customers allocated more cash to alternative, higher-rate liquid investments. ","Our average deposit cost increased six basis points from the first quarter and was up 19 basis points from a year ago compared with a 75 basis point change in the Fed funds rate. The increase in our average deposit cost was driven by increases in commercial and Wealth and Investment Management deposit rates, while rates paid on consumer and small business banking deposits have not yet meaningfully responded to rate movements. Deposit betas continue to outperform our expectations. But as we highlighted at Investor Day, the cumulative beta over the last year was above our experience for the first 100 basis point move. And the initial lags in repricing are expected to ultimately catch up to our historical experience.","On Page 10, we provide details on period-end deposits, which declined $34.8 billion from the first quarter. There's typically a seasonal decline in deposits in the second quarter, which includes the impact of customer tax payments. And deposits were down $19.6 billion on a linked quarter basis a year ago. Wholesale Banking deposits declined $23.6 billion in the second quarter. Approximately 40% or $9.7 billion of this reduction was in financial institution deposits. As Neal Blinde, our Treasurer, discussed at Investor Day, financial institution deposits are by far our highest-cost deposits and our highest beta category. The decline in these deposits reflected temporary high levels of liquidity from the commercial payments business at the end of March as well as $3.9 million in actions taken in response to the asset cap. Wholesale Banking deposits also declined due to seasonality and commercial customers allocating more cash to alternative, higher-rate liquid investments.","Consumer and small business banking deposits declined $20.2 billion from the first quarter, driven by seasonality as well as customers allocating more cash to alternative, higher-rate liquid investments. These declines were partially offset by $6.2 billion of higher Corporate Treasury deposits, including brokerage CDs as well as $2.8 billion of higher mortgage escrow balances.","Net interest income in the second quarter increased $303 million from the first quarter. The drivers of the increase included $120 million less negative impact from hedge ineffectiveness accounting; approximately $105 million from balance sheet mix, repricing and variable income, largely driven by the net impact of rates and spreads; and approximately $80 million from one additional day in the quarter. Our NIM increased nine basis points to 2.93%, driven by a reduction in the proportion of lower-yielding assets, a less negative impact from hedge ineffectiveness accounting, and the net benefit of rate -- interest rate and spread movements. Noninterest income declined $752 million from a year ago, driven by lower mortgage revenue and a reduction of $210 million from businesses we sold during the past year, which also reduced expenses. Noninterest income declined $684 million from the first quarter. ","While deposit service charges had minimal impact to linked-quarter trends, they were down 9% from a year ago, so I want to provide more insight into these fees. I've highlighted in prior quarters the customer-friendly initiatives we've launched over the past year to help our consumer customers reduce fees, including Overdraft Rewind, which is an industry-leading feature that's helped over 1.3 million customers avoid overdraft charges. These initiatives were largely reflected in the amount of deposit service charges in the first quarter, so they didn't have a significant impact linked quarter. We've also enhanced our efforts to help customers minimize standard monthly service fees through activities, such as direct deposit or debit card usage. Approximately 90% of our consumer checking customers do not pay a monthly fee, which is consistent with our goal of having more primary consumer checking customers.","It's also important to note that 46% of deposit service charges in the second quarter are from wholesale customers and are related to the Treasury Management fees they pay for services we provide to them. As market interest rates have risen over the past year, the earnings credit rate on noninterest-bearing deposits has modestly reduced these fees for wholesale customers, which were down $25 million from a year ago. We would expect this trend to continue if interest rates continue to rise. As a reminder, Treasury Management fees apply to noninterest-bearing deposit accounts, so the reduction in fees is an alternative to our paying interest.","Mortgage banking revenue declined $164 million from the first quarter. Servicing income declined $62 million driven by higher prepayments. Residential mortgage originations increased $7 billion from the first quarter, but revenue declined $102 million due to a lower production margin. The production margin declined to 77 basis points as a result of increased pricing competition in both retail and correspondent channels. And given current market pricing trends, we would expect our production margin to remain near the current level in the third quarter.","Gains from equity sales declined $488 million from the first quarter on lower unrealized gains and the impairment related to the announced sale of our ownership stake in RockCreek that I highlighted earlier. Other income was down $117 million from the first quarter. Our results in the second quarter included a $479 million gain on the sales of Pick-a-Pay PCI loans compared with a gain of $643 million from sales in the first quarter. Partially offsetting these declines was growth in card and other fees. Card fees increased $93 million from the first quarter on higher credit and debit card purchase volume. Other fees increased $46 million and included higher Commercial Real Estate brokerage commissions.","Turning to expenses on Page 13. Expenses declined $1.1 billion from the first quarter, largely driven by lower operating losses and a decline from seasonally higher first quarter personnel expenses. ","Starting on Page 14, I'll explain our expense drivers in more detail. Compensation and benefits expense declined $447 million from the first quarter, which had seasonally higher personnel expense. Second quarter expenses included a full quarter impact from salary increases, higher deferred compensation and severance expense. Revenue-related expenses increased $59 million primarily from incentive compensation in Wells Fargo Securities and in home lending. Third-party services increased $151 million from higher contract services and legal expense.","The $819 million decline in nondiscretionary, running-the-business expense was driven by lower operating losses on lower litigation accruals. The increase in discretionary running-the-business expense was driven by higher advertising expenses related to the launch of our Re-Established campaign. Finally, infrastructure expenses declined $62 million from the first quarter, which is typically elevated equipment expense due to contract renewals.","On Page 15, we show the drivers of the $441 million year-over-year increase in expenses. Compensation and benefits expense increased $265 million, primarily due to salary increases and higher severance, partially offset by the impact of the sale of Wells Fargo Insurance Services, which drove FTE reductions in Wholesale Banking. Our total FTEs were down 2% from a year ago and also reflected lower FTE in Community Banking and Consumer Lending. ","The increase in expenses was also driven by $269 million in higher operating losses, primarily related to the customer remediation from previously disclosed matters that I highlighted earlier. These increases were partially offset by lower revenue-related and third-party services expense. We remain on track to achieve both our targeted $4 billion of expense reductions by the end of '19 and our expected range of $53.5 billion to $55.4 billion of expenses for 2018. As a reminder, our expected range of expenses for '18 includes approximately $600 million of typical operating losses, but excludes any outside litigation and remediation accruals and penalties.","Turning to our segments on Page 16. Community Banking earnings increased $583 million from the first quarter, driven by lower operating losses, partially offset by higher income taxes from the net discrete income tax expense in the second quarter.","On Page 17, we provide the Community Banking metrics. Teller and ATM transactions declined 5% from a year ago, reflecting continued customer migration to virtual channels, while digital secure sessions increased 17% from a year ago. In the second quarter, we consolidated 56 branches, and we're on track to consolidate approximately 300 branches this year. Additionally, we announced plans to divest 52 branches in Indiana, Ohio, Michigan and part of Wisconsin. ","Primary consumer checking customers have grown year-over-year for three consecutive quarters. In the second quarter, we continue to have improvements in primary customer retention. And growth in new checking customers overall was driven by digital, with 12% of new checking customers acquired from the digital channel. Growth in new checking customers also reflected the benefit of ongoing marketing initiatives.","On Page 18, we highlight strong growth in credit and debit card purchase volume. General-purpose credit card purchase volume was up 7% from a year ago, and debit card purchase volume was up 9%. For the second consecutive year, we were ranked the number one debit card issuer by Nilson by both purchase volume and number of transactions. Both customer loyalty and overall satisfaction with most recent visit survey scores declined in the second quarter, which was driven by several factors, including recent events and a risk-based policy change affecting individuals making cash deposits into an account on which they're not a signer.","Turning to Page 19. Wholesale Banking earnings declined $240 million from the first quarter, which included a $202 million gain on the sale of Wells Fargo Shareowner Services. Results in the second quarter included $171 million in operating losses related to the foreign exchange business, as I mentioned earlier.","Wealth and Investment Management earnings declined $269 million from the first quarter, driven by the impairment from the announced sale of our ownership stake in RockCreek and $114 million of operating losses related to fee calculations in certain fiduciary and custody accounts, as I also mentioned earlier.","Turning to Page 21. Our credit card -- our strong credit results continued with our loss rate in the second quarter declining to 26 basis points of average loans, a historically low level. For the third consecutive quarter, all of our commercial and consumer real estate loan portfolios were in a net recovery position. Nonperforming assets declined $305 million from the first quarter, the ninth consecutive quarter of declines. We had a $150 million reserve release, reflecting strong credit performance and lower loan balances.","Turning to Page 22. Our estimated Common Equity Tier 1 ratio fully phased-in was 12%. We returned $4 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases in the second quarter, including entering into a $1 billion forward repurchase transaction, which settled this week in the third quarter. Our 2018 Capital Plan, which includes up to $24.5 billion of gross common stock repurchases, reflects our goal of reducing our CET1 ratio to our internal target of 10% over the next 2 to 3 years. In the past, our quarterly common stock repurchases have been relatively evenly distributed over the 4-quarter period of a capital plan. However, given our high level of excess capital, our current plan, subject to market conditions and management discretion, is to use approximately 60% of the gross repurchase capacity under our capital plan during the second half of 2018.","In summary, our second quarter results continued to reflect strong credit quality, liquidity and capital. We grew net interest income, both linked quarter and year-over-year. We remain on track to meet our expense reduction expectations. And as Tim highlighted, we continue to transform Wells Fargo and make progress on our six goals. ","And we'll now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein.","John McDonald","John, I was wondering, in terms of the net interest income, is the $12.5 billion that you did this quarter, is that a fair jumping-off point for us to think about going forward? And what would be the puts and takes for the ability to grow NII from that level that we should keep in mind?","John Shrewsberry","So I think it's a good jumping-off point. And I think the biggest puts and takes are going to be what happens with both deposit and loan growth coming from separate drivers; what happens with, in particular, retail deposit betas, which as I pointed out have been outperforming our -- or the industry-modeled expectations and past performance; and then maybe, although not immediately, what happens at the long end of the curve as we continue to redeploy excess liquidity in our bond portfolio. And I guess importantly also, hedge ineffectiveness accounting now runs through interest income, or a portion of it does. So at the -- that was the biggest driver in this quarter-to-quarter. So that will be up or down from quarter-to-quarter, a little harder to model. But the first items that I mentioned are the ones that are going to drive the outcome.","John McDonald","And in terms of excess liquidity, do you feel like you have a fair amount now relative to what you need for regulatory purposes, and it's just a question of the pricing and rates available that dictates how much you put to work?","John Shrewsberry","I think that's right. Our liquidity coverage ratios and other key regulatory measures of liquidity are very strong, and we have calculated excess that could be put to work. So for example, if loan demand were to pick up, that would be no problem to satisfy. And similarly from -- one question that's -- I think we've talked about it before, but this notion of, in the old days, the difference between cash and duration of the bond portfolio, there's a bigger pickup for the risk that you're taking. These days, there's less of a pickup because the curve is so much flatter. So the -- being patient as we sit here and wait for better entry points doesn't cost us as much as it used to, because we're earning so much more in cash. And then lastly, of course, the sensitivity of OCI is something that we certainly model and stress and think about in terms of what happens at any point, if there's a big, big move up in the long end in the short term. But that shouldn't prevent us from continuing to redeploy if long rates were higher, as we have excess liquidity building, or if we've got the existing bond portfolio amortizing or paying down.","John McDonald","Okay. And then on the loan growth side, the two areas that you're really experiencing runoff. Auto, it sounds like you might have pushed out the time frame for that to start growing until mid-next year. But do you expect the pace of its decline to slow so you're not losing $2 billion a quarter or seeing to decline? And then also on home equity, should that pace start slowing?","John Shrewsberry","I don't think home equity is going to slow. Because even if we're up 15% year-over-year, which we're excited about, those are relatively small numbers. The modern-era home equity business just isn't as robust as the runoff from the, call it, the pre-crisis, now amortizing home equity portfolio. And in auto, I think we're flat, we'll be flat to up in originations. It's just a question of how fast we're amortizing in the more seasoned portfolio. So those -- where those lines cross, whether it was late this year, early next year or a little bit later into next year is hard to judge, unless we'll see quarter by quarter what the originations are. But I would say that we're happy that we sort of stabilized and are now viewing the origination path as growing.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","I have a question on the capital return. Obviously, very strong result for you in CCAR. You're still the bank with the most excess capital after the test and the results. Could you just give us a sense as to how you came up with the ask that you did? And how you think about deploying the rest of the excess capital? Would you go for a top-up this year? Or does that have to wait until the consent order gets lifted? Your thoughts on all there.","John Shrewsberry","Yes. So we're very happy with the results. And as we've described, we're on a path to get down toward our 10% target over the next 2 to 3 years. And this is a big first step in doing that. I mentioned that our approach to repurchases will be a little bit more front-end loaded than it has historically, because as you described, we have so much excess. I think it's unlikely that we would be going for a top-up. We are -- the way we approach our ask is by conducting a rigorous assessment of our risks, developing a scenario that we think is appropriately severely adverse, and then measuring our earnings stream through that scenario and judging how much room we have to take capital out. And in our own calculations, we think the approach that we took got us to the right level of capital to -- or gets us to the right level of capital to run our business. We'll see what the next few quarters or even several quarters deliver in terms of RWA growth and earnings growth or earnings volatility or anything like that. But I wouldn't count on a midstream bite at the apple, because we're going to be so busy executing on the capital plan that we have. Conditions could change, but that's my assessment today.","Timothy Sloan","Yes, Betsy, just to add on to John's comment. I mean, I think a 70% increase from last year was -- we were really pleased with that. But I think it's really important to emphasize that when you think about capital policy, you really can't think about them as short term. You got to think about it over the long term. We -- the CCAR plans that we provide to the Fed are over a multiyear period. We're managing this business over a multiyear period. That's one of the reasons why John and I and Neal have been talking about getting down to our 10%-ish level over the next 2 to 3 years. And so we're going to continue to manage capital in an appropriate way, thinking on a multiyear period. So I want to reemphasize what John said, and that is I think the likelihood that we're going to take any sort of additional action this year is remote.","John Shrewsberry","One more thing just, Betsy, to mention is that we're also in the middle of the NPR period, or the comment period on the NPR for the stress capital buffer. And we don't know -- the industry doesn't know yet exactly how that's going to land, whether it's going to produce a lot more expected year-to-year volatility. There's not a lot of transparency currently in how those outcomes are calculated by the regulatory community. So there's work to do there, and that's a little bit of an overhang, I think, for everybody until it's better understood.","Betsy Graseck","Got it. No, that's helpful color. The follow-up I had is just on the allocation to the divi versus the buyback. And on the divi, do you feel like the current payout ratio is pretty much as high as it gets? Is that maxed out? Or is -- do you feel like there's room for that to rise a little bit from here?","Timothy Sloan","No, not at all. I mean, we're hopeful that it's going to rise over the next few years, a function of hopefully higher payout rates and then also more earnings.","Betsy Graseck","So dividend up on an absolute basis, yes. But even on a payout ratio, you think that could move higher.","Timothy Sloan","Yes.","John Shrewsberry","I think it's [indiscernible] to move higher.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill","Robert Siefers","I appreciate the commentary on sort of the movements within the loan portfolio. I guess, just as you guys see it, I know there's at least some concern that balances are just sort of leaving, to a certain extent, involuntarily. But I guess, as you guys see it, you've been pretty clear on whether CRE or auto, those intentional runoff. On an aggregate basis, how do you see the runoff being sort of conscious versus involuntary as you guys look at things from the inside?","Timothy Sloan","It really depends on the portfolio, Scott, so it's hard to describe it on an aggregate basis. But clearly, the pace of the involuntary runoff as it relates to some of the Pick-a-Pay as well as home equity will continue. I mean, the underlying consumer real estate portfolio is performing very well. We were pleased to see, as John mentioned, originations in home equity pick up on a sequential-quarter basis and year-over-year, which was good. And we hadn't seen that in a while. So we're pleased with that. I think that -- and to emphasize, as John said, in the auto business, I think we've seen the inflection, plus or minus. And we should be able to grow originations from here. Where the lines cross, as John mentioned earlier in terms of growing the overall portfolio, it's likely to happen in the -- sometime in the first half of next year, not 100% certain when.","We'll continue to look at the Pick-a-Pay portfolio. And to the extent that there are opportunities to sell it at very attractive prices, which is what we've done over the last couple of quarters, we'll continue to do that. On the origination side, I think we're going to continue to kind of be the Wells Fargo that's been around for decades, and that is that we're going to underwrite in an appropriate way. And that means that in some portfolios, we get a little bit of a headwind, like we've seen in Commercial Real Estate. But gosh, we've only seen that hundreds of times in our history, and so we'll get through that. So overall, I think we're feeling good about the areas that we can control in terms of growing the portfolio. And credit card is pretty interesting. When you look at the growth that we've seen year-over-year, it's been about 4% with this new card. We expect that to be higher, which is good. So I know it's a long-winded answer to your question and more granular. But I think overall, we've really exed the home equity and some of the continued runoff in the residential mortgage portfolio. We're feeling good about growth over time.","Robert Siefers","Okay. That's perfect. And if I could switch to mortgage business for just a second. I mean, that seems to be proving to be maybe a more challenging quarter than we would have thought, even with the anticipation of some softness. I wonder if you can speak to sort of competitive dynamics. I think we all might have hoped that maybe some excess capacity would rationalize itself a little more quickly. Doesn't seem to be happening, at least this quarter. So any top-level thoughts you have there would be helpful.","Timothy Sloan","Yes, I'll start. John, jump in. I think historically when you look at periods of overcapacity in the mortgage business, the rationalization doesn't naturally clearly occur in the second and the third quarter because those are the quarters where you see the most originations. So my guess, and it's just a guess, is that we will probably see more rationalization in the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of next year if the same level of demand for first mortgages continues. But again, this is, as you know, it's a cyclical business. We've seen this before. We'll see it again. I think the real benefit from our model, unlike maybe a monoline mortgage-only originator, is we've got the balance sheet product. We've got the for-sale product. We've got a servicing business, and then we provide financing in our wholesale business to mortgage originators. So having that diversified business model is really helpful when you're going through a period of overcapacity.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","Going back to what you said to Betsy, Tim, about hopefully more earnings, I just wanted to ask about how we should think about the fee outlook ex mortgage. So I think we appreciate the cyclicality of that business. But there has also been significant volatility in that -- in fee income, even if you exclude mortgage. And as we think about stabilizing earnings for Wells Fargo over the next two years, this has ranged anywhere between $32 billion to $35 billion. How should we think about fees ex mortgage?","Timothy Sloan","Yes. So there's always going to be volatility in some of the gains from equity securities, trading assets and the like, so I'm going to set that aside for a minute. Some of the volatility that you've seen in our fee line has also been from the sale of certain businesses like the commercial insurance business. And that's onetime, so I'd factor that out. I think that the proactive decision that we made, the consumer friendly decision that we made really hit our -- and impacted our service charges on deposit accounts, which were down 9% year-over-year. What you're seeing now from the first to the second quarter is a moderation of that impact. And so that's one line item I would point to and say, my gosh, it's probably going to be growing over time from here. May not exactly happen in the third quarter, but probably growing over time from here. That's a big impact that in terms of the math that you just described, I think our expectation is that trust and investment fees will continue to grow. We had a nice quarter this quarter in Investment Banking. That was terrific. And then on the card side, you've seen really strong growth in cards. And again, we're excited about the new Propel Card, which should drive that. So hopefully that's a little bit more granularity for you, but there's no question that as it relates to mortgage, the net gains from originations have been under some pressure.","Erika Najarian","And as we think about -- I appreciate that. And for your peers of a similar size because you have larger investment banking and trading businesses, often investors expect a more sensitive flex to the expense base in terms of the relationship to fees. And I'm wondering, as we think about either hitting the lower band or upper band of your fee outlook, how should we think about the flex of expenses? In other words, if fees just continue to disappoint, is there a commensurate compensation benefit or a lower compensation? Or it just doesn't work that way in your model?","Timothy Sloan","No, it works that way in our model, and it needs to work that way in our model. If we're not generating revenues, we need to reduce expenses. And Investment Banking in the first quarter -- or in the second quarter, that was not the experience we had. But I think Michael DeVito and Mary Mack are doing a good job in terms of managing the expense levels in the mortgage business. And if -- you've got to plan for the environment you're in, hope it gets better, but certainly you need to make those decisions. I don't know, John, if you have any other comments on that.","John Shrewsberry","I will say that the -- where we are in the aggregate for fee income is part of what's driving us to get overall fixed expenses as low as they can possibly be, so a little bit different than Erika's question about revenue-related expense on the fee side. But if fee income continues to be under pressure and not growing at an acceptable rate, we're going to go even deeper in core expenses.","Erika Najarian","Great. And just one last question. The Propel Card, is that available only to current depositors of Wells Fargo? Or is that going to be more open?","John Shrewsberry","No, everybody. Would you like one? It's available for Bank of America's -- we would be happy to deliver one to you.","Erika Najarian","I can't even comment on that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS.","Saul Martinez","Question on the expenses. I just want to make sure I have the numbers down straight. The $53.5 billion to $54.5 billion, John, that obviously bakes in $600 million of operating loss. You've had much higher than that. You've had some other one-offs. I think that was the $800 million in the first quarter. I just -- you're on track for the -- to be at that level you set. But what is the right number in terms of what the actual expenses on a like-for-like basis have been in the first half? Just to get a sense of what you have to deliver in the second half to be at the high end or low end of that range?","John Shrewsberry","I haven't added up and backed out, but I can tell you that the forecast with 2 quarters in the books is to end up in the range of $53.5 billion to $54.5 billion with the $600 million that you described. We can separately reconcile that, but it does require us to deliver in the second half things that are currently in the -- hard in the forecast to take out.","Saul Martinez","Okay. We can get that offline then. And I guess, a broader question, look, you -- there's obviously, a lot of noise in these results and in the first quarter as well. And I get to something like $1.08 on a core basis, adjusting for the number of one-offs you highlighted. And we can nitpick what the right number is. But having said that, the ROTCE kind of on that basis is sort of at the low end, if not a little bit lower than your 14% to 17% guide. Just can you talk to what your level of confidence is that we're, if not at a trough, near a trough in terms of when we start to see earnings power really move up and your confidence that you start to see that in the second half.","John Shrewsberry","Sure. Well, we laid out a simulation at Investor Day that describes beyond the second half the expense path for this year, next year and into the following year. There are different revenue assumptions, whether it's the mix of fee and rate or rate sensitivity based on what happens to the curve that you would apply to that and then the Capital Plan that was recently approved in terms of what it means from an ROE perspective. And I think we've got conviction, high confidence that the, call it, 15% ROE, 17% ROTCE in that simulation is exactly where -- we're very confident we'll deliver. It can certainly be better depending on what happens with revenue. We weren't baking in a lot of revenue upside in that just because of the quality of -- the conviction of delivery is easier on the lower revenue number. So what happens in the second half, what happens through 2019 will reflect the expenses that we're talking about. Now there could still be one timers that come through from -- or I have to say operating losses in excess of the $600 million that we want to -- that we'll talk about as we -- as they occur, if they occur. But that's the path that we're on. And while doing that, we're trying to grow revenue in every category that makes sense. And we think that, that, call it, pro forma is very reasonable.","Saul Martinez","Okay. Just I guess, a final question. I think somebody asked you about Pick-a-Pay additional sales going forward. The sale of the Puerto Rico assets, what is the -- is that expected approved for 3Q?","John Shrewsberry","It's expected to close on August 1. Yes, the buyer had a regulatory approval that they had to achieve, and they've announced that they've reached that, obtained that.","Saul Martinez","Okay. And have you determined or disclosed what the financial impact of the sale is? I forget.","John Shrewsberry","No. There's, call it, $1.8 billion worth of loans coming off the books. $1.5 billion of auto receivables and $300 million of floor plan. We've already taken a LOCOM adjustment to the purchase price, and there was some -- a positive impact in our allowance when we did that because we were reserving for consumer loans in Puerto Rico after last year's hurricane, but those have already gone through the numbers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Switching gears, a quick question on the C&I. Is there a way you can break down kind of how you're seeing borrower demand by maybe the different groupings, by large corporate, middle markets, small businesses? Maybe are you seeing any pickup in demand in one of those segments offset by somewhere else? And also touch on how most of the growth this quarter was in foreign -- what was going on with the foreign growth?","Timothy Sloan","Yes, so I would describe in the C&I side, the demand is good, but I wouldn't describe it as great. And to your point about kind of the various businesses, I think the corporate demand tends to be more transaction-deal oriented, so there have been a number of acquisitions, mergers and the like that have been more up to drive that business. So it feels a little bit more episodic today than maybe in other cycles. I think kind of the middle-market demand is -- and we saw growth in our middle-market banking business, so that continues to be good. Small business was again good. I wouldn't describe it as great. In terms of some of the other -- the capital finance business, particularly on the equipment side, was actually very good. And I think you're seeing medium-sized and small businesses take advantage of the write-off capabilities in the new Tax Act, which is a positive, I think, long term for the economy. We're continuing to see real, nice opportunities in our asset-backed finance, ABF business, really across industries. So there's no kind of one driver there. And on the reduction side, we did see a decline in the financial institutions business, primarily driven by demand from financials outside the U.S. So overall, I would say C&I is good but not great, and there's a little story in each one of them. But I think it does reflect an economy that's growing 3-ish percent.","John Shrewsberry","I mentioned in my comments that our average drawn rate on revolving credit facility has been about 40% not only year-over-year, but basically at every month throughout the year. That's on $500 billion worth of commitments, so a broad swathe of every business, every industry. It's mostly U.S. but a range of regional geographies, et cetera, not much movement in people's utilization of available credit.","Timothy Sloan","And that's really driven by the fact that so many of our customers are just so liquid today, which is one of the reasons why credit quality is so good.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay. No, that was very helpful. And then just a quick question on the Pick-a-Pay. I mean, I guess, what's the motivation behind selling that portfolio down? I mean, it's a 12% yield now. I mean, I understand there was a fairly large gain on the piece that you just did sell. But as you look forward, how do you think about that relative to what you need for NII and trying to grow NII and selling it down becomes a headwind at that point?","Timothy Sloan","Yes. Go ahead, John.","John Shrewsberry","Yes, it's a good question. I mean, it's a portfolio that we designated as noncore a long time ago. They're -- it's a portfolio of borrowers who, while they've improved since we originally acquired the portfolio and the merger with Wachovia, are still not of the same credit quality as our average prime jumbo borrower. So they're still a little bit -- it is a lower credit quality mortgage portfolio. In this environment where the market or the bid for yield is so hot, we make comparisons of how many years' worth of net interest income we're essentially capturing at once from somebody who's willing to pay today -- or receive today's yields for those higher coupons. And from time to time, it's made sense to do it. That bid could fade, and we'd be happy riding it out with those portfolios over time. But it's partially economic and opportunistic and, frankly, a continued realization that, that is a noncore portfolio. It's something that we wouldn't originate today. We wouldn't have originated for ourselves. And over time, it's intended to go to zero.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore.","John Pancari","A few questions here. Just on the wealth management side, wanted to see what your updated commentary is around some of the attrition in the business. Is it still -- in terms of people leaving, is it still that they're \u2013 wouldn't otherwise people that you would be okay with leaving, as you indicated that some of those departures were okay to leave? Or are you starting to see some attrition mount that's creating a little bit of a top line pressure there?","Timothy Sloan","Yes. I wouldn't necessarily describe it as a concern on our part. I think what you're seeing is an aging and retirement of the FA population. I think it's somewhere between 1\/3 or 40% of the population -- or the attrition is just folks retiring, which we've been planning for, for a while. The -- in addition, we had one episodic impact, and that was that when Wachovia purchased A.G. Edwards, there was a 10-year agreement structure, and that 10-year agreement structure matured in the second quarter. And so we saw a little bit of an increase there. I think overall, what we're -- when you look at the first quarter to the second quarter, I think we're down less than 200 FAs, and the overall quality of the FAs has actually increased a bit. I think that this is a challenge that the industry has because the average age of an experience level of FAs in the market is just a little bit older than your average banker. And so we're going to continue to deal with that. I think the key for us is to make sure that we've got the right transition place -- in place, which Jon Weiss and David Kowach are very focused on, make sure that we've got -- we're continuing to develop the new FAs in the salary and bonus kind of business model structure and then making sure that we're continuing to invest on the digital side, Intuitive Investor is an example, so that the new demographic of investors has got additional options in addition to a real high-quality traditional FA model.","John Pancari","Got it. All right. And then on that front or at least on the investment front, either personnel or technology, when it comes to the expense saves that you're looking for, are you still good with $2 billion in 2019 falling to the bottom line?","John Shrewsberry","Well, yes, we are. But in terms of the -- our overall expenses for '19, this $52 billion to $53 billion that we're guiding to is a way to think about what that means in connection with run rate expenses, investment expenses, everything else that's going on. But yes.","John Pancari","Okay, all right. And then lastly, I know you brought up -- John, you brought up the stress capital buffer factor and kind of sizing up the deployment opportunity here. Do you have any initial take on that impact? I'm assuming you've really looked at it to a degree here. Any initial take on what that means for the quantification of your excess capital? I mean, by our early math on our side, it seems like it could be a fairly sizable hit for a number of the banks.","John Shrewsberry","It's too soon to tell because we're still at the NPR stage and a lot could change. We submitted our own comment letter back. It's posted on the Fed's website, so you can get our institutional thoughts on what they might do next with their proposal. I agree that as we looked at the expected impact on everybody, it would appear to be a little bit higher than what folks have targeted for a CET1 level today. Having said that, I think maybe because of our business model, the initial calculated impact to us is probably at the lower end of that range, especially for the larger banks. But I think it's too soon to tell. We could all use a little bit more transparency to understand where the numbers are really coming from. And at the margin, we have a bias against having really volatile year-to-year capital levels if business models aren't really changing and absent an actual realized change in the economic environment. And it doesn't feel like we're there yet, so that's what we're shooting for.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.","Gerard Cassidy","John, you guys obviously had a nice increase in the net interest margin in the quarter. And I think you mentioned that one of the benefits was the less negative impact of the hedge ineffectiveness. Can you quantify for us how many basis points that was of the increase?","John Shrewsberry","Three.","Gerard Cassidy","Okay. And going forward, should that continue to be incrementally growing? Or is this -- or is it now just baked in and it shouldn't really have an impact going forward?","John Shrewsberry","Just like before as it was moving down, it -- at the margin, what seems to matter most there is what's going on with our highest-cost deposits that end up sitting in cash as we have been increasingly liquid. So we've described what's happened to the balance sheet as some higher beta deposits have run off. Those were -- those diminished the net interest margin. They produced net interest income, but they diminished the margin. And when they're reduced somewhat, then the margin goes up, even though net interest income is probably a little bit lower. So I would look to those things as quarter-to-quarter impacts. It's hard to forecast what's going to happen with hedge ineffectiveness because that has more to do with the basis between LIBOR and OIS and a couple of other things, at least what runs through NIM. And then, of course, whether we're deploying cash into loans will have an impact, and what we pay for deposits will have an impact. So like a lot of things, I do think we should all be looking out for the retail deposit repricing experience in the industry, which has been very low to date. And if anything, it's going to have an impact both on net interest income or NIM in the near term. It'll be paying more for those types of deposits, which hasn't happened yet.","Gerard Cassidy","Okay. I see. And speaking of deposits, I think you guys identified in your wealth management area some of the customers took their deposits to move them into higher-yielding alternative deposits. Do you have products that you can offer to them so they don't leave the bank, they could stay in the bank, though I know it would cost you more money to keep them?","John Shrewsberry","We have a very big money market mutual fund complex in Wells Fargo Asset Management. And that is the first place that when it's appropriate for a customer to be moving some liquidity out of their bank account and into an asset management instrument, we want to be the ones to do that for them, so.","Timothy Sloan","But just to emphasize, the platform is an open architecture platform, and we talked about FAs a little bit earlier. I mean, our advisers are providing the appropriate advice for our customers in terms of what makes sense for that customer and client. Sometimes it's to a Wells Fargo mutual fund money market and sometimes it's to treasuries or some -- it's whatever makes the most sense for that customer. But we've got the broad product set if the customer wants to maintain their -- those balances at Wells Fargo.","Gerard Cassidy","I see. And Tim, in one of your answers, you had talked about, historically, Wells has seen the commercial real estate competition or headwinds. Can you give us a little more color of what you're seeing today, whether it's lower yields on loans or underwriting standards are actually weakening where loan-to-values are higher? And how does it compare at this point in the cycle to your memory of past cycles?","Timothy Sloan","Good question. I think that what we're seeing is, overall, kind of a slowing of construction activity. So when you look at the detail that we provided in the supplement about the Commercial Real Estate business, we've seen a decline in construction opportunities. That's not atypical at this point in a cycle, that's for sure. There's a real constraint in terms of, candidly, availability of labor and underlying commodity prices have increased. So that's affected the pace of new home construction. That's a little bit different than in prior cycles at this time, I would say. I think overall in terms of kind of the many perm type commercial real estate loan, we are seeing a deterioration in underwriting standards. It's been occurring for some time, so I wouldn't say that it's necessarily accelerating. And then -- but I think relative to kind of other cycles, this is -- it's nowhere near what we saw in 2006 and '07 where we're literally telling folks to put their pencils down. And so I wouldn't describe it as anywhere close to that. But again, you need to be prudent when you're lending short on a very long-term asset.","John Shrewsberry","And incidentally as it relates to underwriting standards, it's not all bank-to-bank competition. The competition here is as broad as it's ever been with life companies, mortgage REITs, other asset management types of vehicles, sovereign wealth funds. Any pool of capital that's out there looking for return has got its finger in the pot of commercial real estate finance. One item Tim didn't mention, which is -- which will be one of the tests as we go through this cycle, is retailer-related commercial real estate, so malls and shopping centers, given the focus that folks have on the strength or the ability to compete with different types of retailers. That's probably the -- one of the single individual stripes of risk that is mostly in play in commercial real estate these days.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. And just lastly, John, you've been very clear on the expense guidance for the next two years. If I recall, I think in your fourth quarter assumptions, the FDIC surcharges will come out not just for you, but for the industry. Can you give us an update where that stands, if that timeline is still good and how much that will be for you folks?","John Shrewsberry","Yes. So I think the industry originally estimated that, that surcharge would have run its course by the end of Q2 of this year. Now it looks like it's going to run through Q3 of this year. And I think the annual benefit to Wells Fargo from the FDIC surcharge is...","Timothy Sloan","A couple hundred million.","John Shrewsberry","Yes, it's more than that.","John Campbell","$300 million.","John Shrewsberry","$300 million. So we'll be missing a quarter of that benefit in this year because it's pushed out a quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth Usdin","You mentioned earlier that the consent order has clearly not affected your ability to grow. Loans obviously have not been growing. And the balance sheet continues to shrink well below the limit you need to stay well under for the consent order requirements. So are you at a point where you get comfort here on the balance sheet or -- and you try to just maintain a reasonable size? What's -- if the trends continue as they've been, what happens to the balance sheet size from here?","John Shrewsberry","Well, I think we're out there competing for deposits, the type of deposits that makes sense for us, those that provide the most liquidity benefit. And we're competing for loans day in and day out. And that's what's going to drive the size of the balance sheet. We've talked about the competition for loans and the fact that we've got some portfolios running down on purpose, some where we've tapped the brakes like commercial real estate and auto, although we're probably more open for business in auto than we have been over the last several quarters. But nonetheless, we're still -- we're not growing RWA or GAAP assets at any exciting pace.","So what happens with customers on the deposit side, what happens with customers on the loan side is going to drive what the right size is for our balance sheet. There are some other, and we've talked about them in connection with the asset cap, there are some businesses where we can essentially put on balance sheet for securities financing or other things that probably run up GAAP balances and leverage a little bit faster than that natural loan growth type of activity. But there's no -- there's -- frankly, there was never a forecast or an approach to try and drive the size of the balance sheet larger. We can -- we're at scale in every business that we operate in. We're really more focused on getting more profitable, growing customer relationships, growing the number of customers and then taking what the -- what our risk appetite and the markets will give us on the loans side. And I think we could operate under $2 trillion for, frankly, a good long time and be very increasingly profitable and serve all the customers that we have.","Kenneth Usdin","Yes. And that's -- my follow-up is going to be along those lines, which is as you continue to work on efficiency of the balance sheet, are there still a bunch of those either lower quality or non-quality deposits that you continue to kind of move out? Or is that now kind of -- we've seen this big decline in the foreign offices, obviously, and a couple other areas. So how close are you onto that max efficiency?","John Shrewsberry","We're not operating at max efficiency because there's no pressure to do that. So we're still serving many of those customers in that area. And if it ever came down to a decision between one type of a customer deposit, for example, to take or another, there are other levers to pull. But it's just -- it's not a constraint that's weighing on the company at this time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Long with Raymond James.","David Long","Wells has been investing heavily in compliance and operational risk as well as IT. Is there a way for you to quantify the number of maybe FTE adds you've made there over the last year?","Timothy Sloan","On the risk side, I think one of the highlights that we've provided at Investor Day is that we had added about 2,000 folks, team members in the risk function kind of year-over-year.","John Shrewsberry","Which is disproportionately in operational risk and compliance.","Timothy Sloan","Exactly. And on the IT side, John, I think that the headcount has been pretty flat?","John Shrewsberry","Well, I mean, headcount there is both employees as well as people who work on a contract basis. We've talked about it in terms of dollars. I think our aggregated IT expenses is in the $8 billion range these days. Now a portion of that is risk related and lots of it isn't. It's transforming. It's modernization. It's move to cloud. It's our data environment. It's a number of things. But a meaningful portion of it is in reduction of technology and information security risk at the margin.","David Long","Okay. Do you have a number for maybe or a concentration of your FTEs that are revenue generating versus sort of your back-office support, when it would include the compliance, risk and IT and then maybe how that would compare to a year ago or three years ago?","John Shrewsberry","Yes. So there's a couple -- I don't have the number at my fingertips, but I can tell you that one of the things to take account -- take into account in doing that is the way that we're increasingly using self-serve and technology to enable customer service and sales. So for example, we've described 12% of our new deposit account opens happening digitally and 43% of our credit card new accounts happening digitally. Previously, those sales would have happened through people, and now those sales are happening through technology. So the -- it's a little apples and oranges over the past few years with the passage of time. I'd say sales, service and operations, though, just in -- to your question in particular, sales, service and operations probably account for between 70% and 75% of our headcount. And staff and technology and, call it, whatever other means are between 25% and 30% of headcount. And that hasn't changed very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.","Vivek Juneja","Couple of questions. The asset cap, can you give us an update on where -- timing on that, Tim, when, how long? What are you thinking currently?","Timothy Sloan","Vivek, no change in the update from Investor Day and that we're working very constructively with the Fed. We've gotten some very thoughtful feedback from them. And our expectation is that sometime in the first half of next year, we'll be able to move through that. I think the point to emphasize there is that our goal is not to just meet expectations so we can get the asset cap lifted. Our goal is to make the fundamental investments and changes that we need to make in how we manage operational and compliance risk at the company. That's the goal, and that's where -- really where we're focused, but no update from a timing standpoint.","Vivek Juneja","Okay. John, a question for you. As I look at your RWA, it was flat. Your total assets were down on a period-end basis. So any color on where we -- you saw some increase in the risk weighting on the balance sheet?","John Shrewsberry","I would think of it more as the GAAP assets that came down had very low risk weights, because it's -- we're running down high runoff factor deposits that -- where the asset side is sitting in cash. So what remains is something akin to the same RWA that was already there. That's the easiest way to think about it.","Vivek Juneja","Got it. Okay. One last one, wealth management, heard the answers earlier. Any color on -- I heard you talk about wealth management clients' deposits are moving now to [indiscernible]. But when I look at your wealth management client assets, those were down. So any color on what the difference is? What's going on there?","John Shrewsberry","Yes. I don't think every dollar of a money market mutual fund would have stayed inside Wells Fargo. Some of it -- much of it did, as Tim described. There are other puts and takes. There's market movements. There's customers coming and going. The Rock Creek AWM, actually, that would be in asset management, not in wealth management. I see wealth client assets are up 3% year-over-year and down a little bit quarter-over-quarter, yes. There's nothing in particular that, that's attributable to.","Timothy Sloan","Yes. Vivek, a portion went into other assets that we're managing. A portion went outside the company. And again, if that's the right thing for the client, that's fine.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.","Marlin Mosby","I wanted to ask you a little bit more strategic question. I kind of tricked -- played in my brain when you were talking about the service charges on deposits and how you became so much more customer-friendly. At this point, you can become and kind of re-place yourself at a very competitive position versus your competition. It won't matter because you're dealing with so many other issues that you're having to go through from the headlines and all that. But eventually, when you come out from under that, the positioning that you have created will make a difference. And so I'm just kind of thinking, as you've gone through these things and become more customer-friendly in so many different areas, do you think you've gotten to where your pricing is favorable to the rest of the market enough that it could eventually have an impact on the rest of the industry once you come out and you don't have those other pressures?","Timothy Sloan","Yes. Marty, it's a really good question. I think our focus is -- and again, you asked it from a strategic standpoint, so let me maybe step back and take it at a higher level. If we have information that can help our customers manage their finances better, and our vision is to help our customers succeed financially, then we should provide that information to our customers, period, right. Over the long run, that is a winning, winning business model. In the short run, as we've talked about, it's been a drag on deposit service charges. And from my perspective, making that -- taking that short-term pain from a revenue standpoint to make the long-term investment in terms of providing the right products, services and information to our customers, we'll make that all day long, right.","And so in -- as it relates to Overdraft Rewind or the breadth of our real-time and our balance alerts capabilities, there's no question that those are industry leading. And over time, we think that's going to provide us with a competitive advantage. And we're going to continue -- as we talked about some of the innovation that I highlighted in my earlier comments and the breadth of innovation that Avid talked about at Investor Day, we're going to continue and hopefully increase the pace of that innovation. Again, in the short term, sometimes that has a negative impact on revenues. Over the long term, that makes our customer relationships more valuable. It makes them want to do more business with. It makes them more stable. And for example, we're seeing that in terms of the growth of primary checking accounts. And we're seeing that in terms of the value of those primary checking relationships, which continues to occur. It doesn't happen in one quarter, right. And that's one of the challenges when you try to balance that short term versus long term.","Marlin Mosby","Let me throw, as my follow-up, a specific example of we've been able to put interest on DDAs. And as the ECRs are all going up and some of these deposits are beginning to flee, would that ever be a concept in the sense of another kind of game changer that would be customer-friendly that might give you a competitive advantage if you started to re-shift the way you look at that -- the way you do that account -- those accounts?","Timothy Sloan","Well, specifically on the treasury side, you mean?","Marlin Mosby","Yes, yes.","Timothy Sloan","Well, I think the driver on the treasury side, even though price is important, it's much more important to provide the breadth of products and services and to invest in technology because you're generally dealing with sophisticated businesses. And for example, that's why we introduced the biometric iPrint, right, so that treasurers and money managers can move things more quickly and have more safety and security. I mean, historically, we've always ranked at the top in the treasury management business in terms of our capabilities. And so I think there, the focus should be much less about price and much more about continuing to invest in technology and services.","John Shrewsberry","Yes. That's a part of the business that helps the customer -- the commercial customer run their business. It helps them with their procure to pay. it helps them with shortening up their receivables cycle. It reduces the need for working capital in their business. And that's the value-add, and we wouldn't want to move away from that.","Timothy Sloan","Great. Well, I want to thank everybody for your time and for your questions. I know it's been a very busy morning for all of you. I do also want to take the opportunity to thank our 265,000 team members. I think we've got the best team in the business. They're working very hard to not only serve our customers but meet and exceed our six goals. So again, thank you very much, and thank you for your trust in Wells Fargo.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference.","John Campbell","Thank you, Regina. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our Interim CEO and President, Allen Parker; and our CFO, John Shrewsberry will discuss first quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our second quarter earnings release and quarterly supplements are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I\u2019d also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today\u2019s call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed today, containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement. ","Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our website.","I will now turn the call over to Allen Parker.","Allen Parker","Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us for today's discussion of our second quarter results, which included strong quarterly earnings. On our call last quarter, I outlined my three top priorities for Wells Fargo, which are focusing on our customers and team members; meeting the expectations of our regulators, and continuing our company's important transformation. This morning, I want to update you on the progress we made on these priorities over the last 90 days.","After spending a lot of time meeting with and listening to our team members and customers across Wells Fargo, it's clear to me not only that our team is dedicated to providing outstanding customer service, but also that this commitment is benefiting our customers who are choosing to do more business with us.","Our results in the second quarter reflected our progress in this area. And I would call your attention to just a few of the metrics that demonstrate that progress. Period end loans and deposits grew on both the linked quarter and year-over-year basis. Branch customer experience survey scores have now increased for four consecutive quarters and in June, reached their highest levels in over three years.","Primary consumer checking customers grew year-over-year for the seventh consecutive quarter. New investment assets referred by our community banking team to our Wealth and Investment Management team reached their highest quarterly level in two years. And by continuing to meet our wholesale banking customers\u2019 needs for asset-based financing during the quarter, we increased our industry leading market share in these financings.","Our commitment to our team members during the second quarter included the completion of our 2019 team member experience survey, which gave all our team members an opportunity to share their feedback. Feedback we\u2019ll use to continue to improve the team member experience through new technology, streamline processes, and career and skill development programs.","We also continue to strengthen Wells Fargo's leadership team through both internal promotions and external appointments. In the second quarter, we added three new members to our operating committee. Two of these additions were Saul Van Beurden or new Head of Technology and Julie Scammahorn, our new Chief Auditor, and the most recent change to the operating committee was the addition of Derek Flowers, who will lead our newly created Strategic Execution and Operations Office. As a result of the changes in our operating committee over the past three years, almost all its members are now either new to Wells Fargo or new to their roles.","The formation of the Strategic Execution and Operations, or SEO team is an important step in our work to meet the expectations of our regulators, which is another of my top priorities. This team will focus on achieving across all our businesses, the operational excellence that will enable us to execute more effectively on our regulatory priorities and further drive our transformation, which will benefit all our customers and team members.","By centralizing a substantial part of the work related to our regulatory priorities, work that's being performed across all our different businesses, we believe will be more efficient and effective in all these efforts.","The leader of the SEO team, Derek Flowers is a 21 year company veteran, who most recently was our Chief Credit and Market Risk Officer, where he maintained our strong credit discipline and in the process displayed substantial skills in organization and execution.","Reflecting our deep management team Mary Katherine DuBose, who joined Wells Fargo in 1998 and was most recently a leader in wholesale banking, has assumed the role of Chief Credit Officer and Jeremy Smith will lead market and counterparty risk. I'm confident that Mary Katherine, Jeremy and their teams will continue our company's strong tradition in both these areas.","My final top priority is continuing the important transformation of Wells Fargo so that we can build on our already strong foundation to become even more customer focused, innovative and better positioned for the future. This transformation is multifaceted, but it involves three essential components.","First, we must strive for excellence in the way we conduct our business every day. Our work must be thoughtfully designed, seamless, and of the highest quality. And we must also constantly look for ways to improve, whether that improvement involves simplifying an operation, using technology to make things faster and easier, or seeking ways to be more streamlined and efficient in our work. ","Second, we must focus on and achieve high quality execution in all we do, approaching each task with urgency, a well-designed plan and an unwavering focus on getting the work done properly and on time. And finally, each one of us must act with absolute integrity in every situation. It's just a few examples of the work we're doing as part of our transformation.","We're relentlessly focused on business process management, an effort to ensure a more consistent approach to how our work is done by simplifying the ways we conduct any given process and reducing the associated risk. This work is designed to achieve savings, enable our team members to be more productive and deliver more consistent desired experiences for our customers.","We're also pursuing business simplification, so we can concentrate our efforts on businesses where we believe, we have the leadership position that's required for us to excel long-term. On July 1st, we completed the previously announced sale of our Institutional Retirement and Trust business, and we expect to complete the recently announced sale of Eastdil Secured in the fourth quarter.","We're also transforming our businesses to reduce risk, improve customer service and become more efficient. An excellent example of this work is our auto business. Throughout 2017 and 2018, under the leadership of Laura Schupbach, we made fundamental changes to this business, including centralizing functions by consolidating 57 business centers across the country to create [for] [ph] regional hubs, reengineering processes, automating pricing and decision making and enhancing the customer and team member experience.","As we were implementing these changes, we ceded market share as expected and reduced the size of our auto portfolio. Now with most of these transformational changes complete, our auto portfolio returned to growth in the second quarter for the first time since 2016 and in line with our expectations. Just as important this growth has been disciplined and has resulted in a higher quality portfolio. As part of our ongoing transformation, we\u2019ll continue to make similar fundamental durable changes in how we run our businesses throughout the company.","Let me close my remarks by touching on a few additional topics. We realized that you are all appropriately focused on the level of our expenses, while we're making progress and continuing to address our expenses with urgency. We still have work to do. And as John will explain we expect our 2019 expenses to be near the high end of the range we specified in our previously provided guidance.","As we stated last quarter our strategic and financial targets beyond 2019 will be established once we have a permanent CEO in place, but we\u2019re still at the point where the savings we\u2019re achieving are not reaching the bottom line. And we anticipate that this could continue next year. ","We\u2019ll update you further on our 2020 expense expectations over the remainder of this year. I know you're also interested in the status of a CEO search, which is a top priority for our Board of Directors and is well underway. While there has been and will continue to be much speculation in the media and otherwise regarding the search, the Board and the search committee do not plan to provide updates on their progress until they have made a final selection. Accordingly, we don't have any additional information to provide today.","Separately, I want to note that during the second quarter, Charles Muskie was elected to our Board of Directors, where he will serve on the Audit and Examination Committee. Chuck has many years of leadership experience at large financial institutions and other major corporations, both as a Director and as an Executive and we\u2019re all looking forward to working with him.","Finally, as you all know, we received non-objection to our 2019 capital plan during the second quarter. The capital plan includes a 13% increase to our third quarter 2019 common stock dividend to $0.51 per share, subject to approval by our Board of Directors. And gross common stock repurchases of up to $23.1 billion for the four quarter period beginning third quarter 2019.","Our CCAR results demonstrate the strength of our diversified business model, our strong capital position, our sound financial risk management and our commitment to return excess capital to our shareholders in a prudent manner over time. We're all committed to doing what's right for all our stakeholders and we\u2019re proud of the work we completed during the second quarter to bring us closer to our goals. While there's a lot of hard work that still needs to be done, I'm confident and optimistic that we\u2019re taking the right steps to build an extraordinary financial institution.","John will now discuss our financial results in more detail.","John Shrewsberry","Thank you, Allen. Good morning, everyone. We share some of the highlights of our second quarter results on page two, including earnings of $6.2 billion or $1.30 per diluted common share. Our ROE increased to 13.26% and our ROTCE was 15.78%. We returned $6.1 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends, and net share repurchases in the second quarter, up from $4 billion a year ago.","In his comments, Allen highlighted the positive business momentum shown on this page and I'll provide more detail on these results throughout the call. On the next page, we summarize noteworthy items in the second quarter, including a $721 million gain on the sale of $1.9 billion of Pick-a-Pay PCI loans. The remaining balance in the Pick-a-Pay PCI loan portfolio was $1.1 billion at the end of the second quarter, down from $8.8 billion a year ago, reflecting portfolio sales and runoff. ","We had $150 million reserve release, primarily driven by strong overall credit portfolio performance and our effective income tax rate was 17.3%. We currently expect the effective income tax rate for the remainder of 2019 to be approximately 18%, excluding the impact of any unanticipated discrete items.","We highlight some year-over-year results on page four, compared with the second quarter 2018 revenue was stable with an increase of $477 million in noninterest income largely offset by a $446 million decline in net interest income. Our expenses declined 4% from a year ago. I will highlight the key drivers later on the call. Our net charge-offs remained near historic lows at 28 basis points and our $150 million reserve release in the second quarter was the same amount as a year ago. Our capital levels remained above our internal target, even as we reduced common shares outstanding by 9% from a year ago. ","I'll be highlighting the balance sheet and income statement drivers on pages five and six throughout the calls, we\u2019ll turn to page seven. Average loans were up $3.4 billion from a year ago, but declined $2.5 billion from the first quarter, driven by lower commercial loans. The average loan yield was up 16 basis points from a year ago from the repricing impacts of higher interest rates, and it declined 4 basis points from the first quarter due to changes in loan mix and the repricing impact of lower interest rates.","Period-end loans increased $5.6 billion from a year ago with growth in first mortgage, C&I and credit card loans partially offset by declines in junior lien mortgage loans as well as commercial real estate loans. Over the past year, we've sold or moved to held for sale a total of $9 billion of loans. In addition to the $1.9 billion of Pick-a-Pay PCI loans that we sold in the second quarter, we also moved $1.8 billion of first mortgage loans to held for sale. We moved these loans to held for sale as we intend to sell them rather than recognize recoveries and retained earnings as we would be required for adoption of CECL.","I\u2019ll highlight the drivers of the $1.6 billion linked quarter increase in period-end loans starting on page nine. Commercial loans increased $19 million from the first quarter, C&I loans were down $288 million, as growth in our credit investment portfolio from purchasing CLOs in loan form was offset by declines in commercial capital, corporate and investment banking and commercial real estate credit facilities to REITs and non-depository financial institutions. ","Commercial real estate loans increased $105 million from the first quarter, the second consecutive linked quarter increase, as growth in mortgage lending was partially offset by runoff of construction loans reflecting cyclicality of commercial real estate construction projects and our continued credit discipline. Lease financing increased $202 million from the first quarter, driven by growth in our equipment finance business.","As we show on page 10, consumer loans increased $1.6 billion from the first quarter despite $1.9 billion of Pick-a-Pay PCI loan sales and the transfer of $1.8 billion of first mortgage loans to held for sale. The first mortgage loan portfolio increased $1.9 billion from the prior quarter, driven by $19.8 billion of mortgage loan originations held for investment. 38% of our total mortgage originations in the second quarter were held for investment, which was up from 26% a year ago. This shift benefited loan growth and helped us meet the home financing needs of our customers. But these loan originations do not generate mortgage banking fees.","Junior lien mortgage loans were down $1 billion from the first quarter, as paydowns continue to outpace new loan originations. Credit card loans increased $541 million, up from a seasonally low first quarter. As Allen highlighted, our auto portfolio grew for the first time since 2016, with the balances up $751 million from the first quarter and originations up 17% while maintaining credit discipline. Other revolving credit and installment loans declined $533 million from the first quarter, on lower margin loans as well as lower student loans and personal loans and lines.","Turning to deposits on page 11, average deposits declined $2.3 billion from a year ago as wealth and investment management and wholesale banking customers continue to allocate more cash into higher yielding liquid alternatives. Average deposits increased $6.9 billion from the first quarter driven by higher retail banking deposits, reflecting increased promotional activity, partially offset by lower wealth and investment management deposits.","Our average deposit costs of 70 basis points increased 5 basis points from the first quarter and 30 basis points from a year ago, reflecting higher deposit rates in wholesale banking and wealth and investment management, deposit mix shifts as customers allocated more balances to higher yielding categories, and retail banking deposit campaign pricing for new deposits. We provide an update on our deposit betas and expectations on page 12.","Our deposit beta reflects current market conditions, including repricing lags from prior Fed Funds rate increases and deposit campaigns for new retail deposits, which have resulted in a greater percentage of higher yielding promotional deposit balances. These drivers are reflected in the cumulative one year beta increasing to 57%, up from 43% last quarter. It's important to note that the deposit beta calculation can produce higher short-term betas in periods when Fed Funds stabilizes or declines, even if the pace of increases and deposit pricing slows.","The cumulative beta since the start of the cycle in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 38% as of the end of the second quarter. If the Fed Funds rate remains at current levels, we expect our cumulative through the cycle beta to continue to trend upward albeit at the lower end of our previously guided range of 45% to 55%.","On page 13, we provide details on period end deposits, which increased $24.4 billion from the first quarter. Wholesale banking deposits were up $37.4 billion from the first quarter with growth in corporate and investment banking, commercial real estate and corporate trust and also included an elevated level of large short-term deposit inflows.","Consumer and small business banking deposits declined $12 billion driven by lower wealth and investment management deposits from the seasonality of tax payments, as well as clients continuing to reallocate cash into higher yielding liquid alternatives. Retail deposits also declined, as growth in CDs and high yield savings was more than offset by typical tax related seasonality.","Net interest income decreased $216 million from the first quarter, driven by balance sheet mix and repricing including the impact of higher deposit costs and lower interest rate environment, as well as $73 million from increased premium amortization costs from higher MBS prepayments. We currently expect MBS premium amortization to increase in the third quarter. These declines in net interest income were partially offset by one additional day in the quarter and higher variable income.","Net interest income was down 4% in the second quarter and down 2% in the first half of 2019, compared with the same periods a year ago. Last quarter, we said we expected net interest income to decline 2% to 5% this year compared with 2018. And if the rate environment we're in today persists, we would expect to be near the low end of the range or near 5%. As always net interest income will be influenced by a number of factors, including loan growth, pricing spreads, the level of rates and the slope of the yield curve. ","Turning to page 15, noninterest income increased $191 million from the first quarter, with broad base growth including higher trust and investment fees, other income, service charges on deposit accounts, card fees and mortgage banking. I'll highlight some of the drivers of these increases in more detail.","Deposit service charges increased $112 million from our first quarter that had higher fee waivers. We expected deposit service charges to increase now that the customer friendly changes we've made, which meaningfully reduce these fees are fully on the run rate. These changes continue to benefit our customers. And in the second quarter, we send an average of more than 38 million zero balance and customer specific alerts a month and helped over 1 million customers avoid overdraft charges through overdraft rewind. The increase in deposit service charges in the second quarter also reflected higher treasury management fees in wholesale banking.","Trust and investment fees increased $195 million from the first quarter, primarily due to higher asset base fees on retail brokerage advisory assets, reflecting higher market valuations at March 31st, and higher investment banking fees from increases in debt and equity underwriting. ","Mortgage banking revenue increased $50 million from the first quarter, as lower servicing income primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates, including higher loan payoffs was offset by higher mortgage origination fees. Mortgage originations increased $20 billion from the first quarter due to typically higher seasonality and higher refi volumes from lower interest rates. Applications in the second quarter increased $26 billion from the first quarter. We ended the quarter with a $44 billion unclosed pipeline the highest pipeline since the third quarter of 2016. And we expect originations to increase in the third quarter.","Residential held for sale mortgage loan originations totaled $33 billion in the second quarter, and the production margin on these originations declined to 98 basis points, down 7 basis points due to sales execution timing. Margin started to widen later in the quarter and we currently expect the production margin in the third quarter to increase modestly.","Turning to expenses on page 16, expenses declined 3% from the first quarter and 4% from a year ago. I'll explain the drivers starting on page 17. Expenses were down $467 million, from the first quarter, driven by seasonality lower personnel expenses. The decline in compensation and benefits reflected $676 million in seasonally lower personnel expense and $243 million in lower deferred compensation expense, which is P&L neutral, partially offset by the full quarter impact from salary increases, as well as one additional payroll day.","Revenue related expenses increased $260 million from higher commission and incentive compensation expense, primarily in home lending, WIM and wholesale banking. Third-party services increased $212 million from higher outside professional services and contracts services expense. Finally, running the business discretionary expense increased $105 million, primarily driven by higher advertising and promotion expense.","As we show on page 18, expenses were down $533 million from a year ago, driven by lower operating losses, core deposit and other intangibles amortization and FDIC expense. While our expenses declined in this quarter as Allen stated, they're still too high, and we're working hard to deliver on our 2019 expense target.","Since the beginning of 2018, we\u2019ve realized billions of dollars of expense savings through our efficiency initiatives including reducing FTEs by approximately 18,000 through attrition and displacement. However, during this period, we've also added approximately the same number of FTE in risk compliance and technology, resulting in our total FTE being relatively stable.","We currently expect our 2019 expenses to be near the high end of our target range, as investments in risk management, including data and technology have exceeded expectations and are anticipated to continue. Also, revenue related expenses are higher, given the strength in mortgage banking due to lower rate environment, as well as strength in capital markets. Just to be clear, we won't forego revenue opportunities to hit an expense target.","Finally, our deferred comp expense was $471 million in the first half of 2019, compared with $57 million for the same period a year ago. Since this expense is subject to market fluctuations and is P&L neutral, we're excluding the deferred comp expense from the calculation of our expense target. As a reminder, the full year impact of deferred comp expense last year was a $242 million reduction in expenses and we achieved our expense target even with this benefit.","Turning to our business segments starting on page 20, community banking earnings increased $324 million from the first quarter, driven by seasonally lower personnel expense.","On page 21, we provide our community banking metrics. We have $30 million digital active customers in the second quarter, up 4% from a year ago, including 8% growth in mobile active customers. Primary consumer checking customers grew for the seventh consecutive quarter on a year-over-year basis. New consumer checking customers acquired through the digital channel were up 45% from a year ago and 48% of new general purpose credit card accounts were originated through the digital channel in the second quarter.","We already highlighted our brand survey scores, which reached their highest levels in more than three years in June. The recent improvement in our scores has been partially driven by an increased focus by our branch based team members on educating our customers about our industry leading digital capability.","On page 22, we highlight the decline in teller and ATM transactions, down 7% from a year ago, reflecting continued customer migration to digital channels, and we consolidated 38 branches in the second quarter. We had strong card usage with both credit and debit card purchase volume up 6% from a year ago. During the second quarter we were recognized for the third year in a row as the number one debit card issuer in Nielsen's annual rankings.","Turning to page 23, wholesale banking earnings increased $19 million from the first quarter, driven by lower provision for credit losses. Wealth and investment management earnings increased $25 million from the first quarter, driven by seasonally lower personnel expense and higher asset based fees. The sale of our Institutional Retirement and Trust business, which closed on July 1st, did not impact second quarter results but will be reflected in our third quarter performance.","Turning to page 25, we continue to have strong credit results with our net charge-off rate declining to 28 basis points in the second quarter, and net charge-offs down $42 million from the first quarter, driven by lower consumer losses. Non-accrual loans declined $983 million from the first quarter with lower non-accruals in both the commercial and consumer portfolios. Consumer non-accruals included a $373 million decline from the reclassification of $1.8 billion of first mortgage loans to held for sale.","Last quarter, I provided our initial CECL expectation, which we've updated based on the composition of our loan portfolio as of June 30st. We currently estimate that the impact of the adoption of CECL will be an approximate $1.5 billion reduction in our allowance, including recoveries related to residential mortgage loans that were previously written down during the last cycle and are below their current recovery value.","The change from the estimate we provided last quarter primarily reflects a reduction in our expected recoveries on loans previously written down due to the designation of $1.8 billion of residential mortgage loans to held for sale, as well as additional refinements to our assumptions and changes in our portfolio composition during the quarter.","The ultimate effective of CECL will depend on the size and composition of our loan portfolio, the portfolio\u2019s credit quality and economic conditions at the time of adoption, as well as any refinements to our models, methodology or other key assumptions. As a reminder, as the industry experiences credit cycles, we anticipate more volatility under a lifetime reserving approach versus the incurred loss approach.","Turning to capital on page 26, our CET1 ratio fully phased in increased to 12% as continued strong capital returns and modest RWA growth were more than offset by the capital generation from earnings and unrealized gains in OCI. ","Our 2019 capital plan, which includes up to $23.1 billion of gross common stock repurchases, reflects our goal of reducing our CET1 ratio toward our current internal target of 10% over the next two years. As a reminder, our target may increase modestly to 10.25% to 10.5% due to the implementation of distress capital buffer and CECL.","Similar to last year, our current plan subject to market conditions and management discretion is to use approximately 65% of the gross repurchase capacity during the second half of this year, with the remainder use in the first two quarters of 2020.","In summary, our second quarter results reflected increased customer activity, strong credit performance and higher capital returns. Our expenses are too high and while we're working hard to execute on our expense initiatives, we also have higher ongoing investment spend. I'm confident that the investments we're making to transform Wells Fargo and meet regulatory expectations will benefit all of our stakeholders including our customers, our team members, our shareholders and our regulators. ","And we\u2019ll now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. ","Allen Parker","Hey, John.","John Shrewsberry","Good morning, John.","John McDonald","Hi, good morning guys. John, on the net interest income outlook, so you indicated that if the rate structure and environment stays the same, you'd be at the low end around 5%, which is consistent what you said before. Just wondering, does that include the idea of a Fed cut or price in any Fed cuts? And if not, what would be the incremental impact of each Fed cut, if you did get some from there?","John Shrewsberry","So it does account for one to two, depending on when they happen, et cetera, this year. And if you just wanted to isolate a 25 basis point Fed cut, and if really only the front end was moving in the long end it was not. We estimate that in the first year that's worth a little bit under $100 million.","John McDonald","Okay. And into -- if you're at negative 5 for the year that assumes one to two cuts?","John Shrewsberry","Yes.","John McDonald","Okay. And then could you elaborate on Allen's comments about the expenses, previously you had indicated some confidence, not in a specific target for 2020, but at least having 2020 expenses lower than 2019? Is that something you're less confident in now? And what was the comment about kind of the jumping off into 2020? Thanks.","John Shrewsberry","Sure. So we\u2019re re-forecasting every 90 days. And our most recent forecast puts us at the higher end of our range for this year. And currently, our reforecasted 2020 is relatively flat with that number. Things will change will continue to reforecast all of these initiatives are in play. But this renewed vigor and emphasis on getting things right from a risk and control with associated technology perspective has put upward pressure on that. ","John McDonald","Okay. Got it, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS.","Saul Martinez","Hey, guys. So a couple follow-up questions -- to John's questions. First, just elaborating on the commentary on expenses I think which said Allen was we've generated billions of dollars and expense savings. They haven't flown to the bottom line because you've had incremental investments in things like I believe risk management, regulatory compliance, operational risk. ","So are you saying that in 2020, if you're assuming sort of relatively flattish expenses, any incremental cost saves will be offset by additional investments in these things? Because I would think that at some point you have these investments in the run rate, and you actually start to see it flow to the bottom line, especially given what -- to be what seems like somewhat bloated cost structure relative to your peers.","Allen Parker","Saul, thank you for your question. Let me just start by saying that as you would expect, we're all very focused on our level of expenses, and we're doing everything we can to engage in vigorous risk management. We're going to continue to do that. As John alluded to, what we've seen is a greater need for us to make investments in terms of risk, compliance, and audit. All those things that we're going to need to make investments in, in order to satisfy the requirements of our regulators, but also, at the same time build the financial institution we know that that we can be.","Those are our needs that in some cases are evolving over time and where we're making decisions about what incremental investments we need to make. And as I said at the outset, we do believe that that sort of increased investment can be an offset, or could be an offset to the savings that we expect to achieve in 2020.","Saul Martinez","Okay, all right. That's helpful. To change gears on NII and deposit betas, you've given color on what\u2019s sort of embedded in your guidance for deposit betas, assuming I guess the Fed Funds remains at current level. How do we think about deposit costs, though, if the Fed cuts in July, and has multiple cuts this year? Just, not necessarily the beta, but just the trajectory of deposit costs. ","And, also migration [DBs] [ph], how much of a lag do we see between when the Fed starts to cut and when we actually see a stabilization in deposit costs? Because usually that will take -- that could take a quarter or two. And how much scope is there for deposit costs to come down this cycle, given that, on the upswing deposit betas were lower than what they have been in past cycles? So can you just help us understand some of the moving parts of it around deposit costs of the Fed cut?","John Shrewsberry","Sure, it's a good question. One question you didn't ask is, of course, what happens on the asset side of the Fed cuts and they move immediately. So it's a little more painful for the first couple of quarters because LIBOR assets or prime assets for that matter price down right away and deposit costs take a little bit longer. And there's less room to move, because as you pointed out, we have an all in deposit cost right now of 70 basis points after all the moves that we've had in Fed funds.","And so we will be -- I mean, it will be easy enough, I suppose in the most -- in the highest beta deposit categories on the way up, it will -- we have the easiest time moving down. But where we've continued to outperform, in the big, massive consumer deposits, et cetera, deposits are still really, really inexpensive, and there isn't as much leverage on the way down.","So it will take a couple of quarters, I think, as you suggested to sort of fully stabilize and then we will be repricing down quickly where we can where we were quick to give depositors the benefit on the way up. And less likely, for example, for promotional activity to exist in exactly the same way, but it'll take a little bit. And I'm not sure that in a normal policy reversal with a stair step path down for Fed funds, how long or if ever, you get back down to the single digit basis points in total that we had as a deposit cost in the wake of the financial crisis.","Saul Martinez","And in your guidance of one to two rate cuts, what are you -- I guess, are you baking in sort of an immediate recalibrated reduction in asset yield? And then, sort of a lagged effect on deposit costs. I\u2019m not asking you to give me the specific numbers, but directionally kind of how\u2026 ","John Shrewsberry","That\u2019s exactly right. [indiscernible] have the contracts operate on the asset side, and then there's the behavioral things on the deposit side that we just talked about.","Saul Martinez","Got it. All right, thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","John Shrewsberry","Hey, Ken.","Allen Parker","Hi, Ken.","Ken Usdin","Hey. Thanks, good morning guys. On the business sale side you guys have talked about I think the expected contribution or detraction from the retirement sales and then Eastdil in the fourth quarter. Can you give us an update of how you're thinking about just the portfolio of businesses? And are there other things that you still might think of also that don't fit with the slim down company going forward and how are you thinking about those?","John Shrewsberry","I would say that the list is pretty short right now in terms of things that we\u2019re working on or thinking about when this year is done and the two things you mentioned are closed. I think we will be opportunistic and our eyes are open, but there isn't much else that's in the immediate runway. And that\u2019s distinct from asset sales that we\u2019ve conducted where the economics have made sense, or the risk return made sense we\u2019ve talked about that with Pick-a-Pay and now some of the loans that have this asymmetric CECL impact are loans we might sell that\u2019s just different from businesses.","We have also incidentally sold packages of mortgage servicing rights over the last year, you\u2019d probably expect to see us do some of that so we can optimize our mortgage servicing portfolio. But in terms of discrete businesses the list is -- I would say is pretty short after the two that are closing later this year or the one more that\u2019s closing later this year. ","Ken Usdin","Okay, got it. And then just one more follow up on the cost side earlier this year, you had talked about how your underlying cost control have been doing even better and have been offset by the incremental investments. And I guess as you recalibrate it would seem that you were kind of on a steady-state basis doing a really nice job of whittling down the programs as you had discussed previously. And so as you look ahead on the side of the equation are there more opportunities to offset incrementally some of the incremental adds that you still have to contemplate through next year and beyond.","John Shrewsberry","There is enormous opportunity on the cost takeout side. The question for our team right now is how to prioritize that versus getting things right from a risk control and compliance perspective. Because in some cases, those desires are competing for the same technology resources, for example, are the same subject matter expert bandwidth, for example. There is a very long list of ways to make Wells Fargo continually more efficient and getting that prioritized along with some of these very urgent requirements in our risk and control environment is really what the management team is most highly focused on.","But there is an enormous opportunity for cost compression as we get better and better on the control side as we get better and better on the business process management side, as Allen said, we\u2019ve hit the tip of the iceberg in terms of the possibility of simplifying and streamlining how we get our operations done.","Ken Usdin","Got it. Thanks, John. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.","John Shrewsberry","Hi, Erika. ","Erika Najarian","Hey, good morning. Wanted to just ask another question on expenses if I may, so you mentioned that you had concluded this quarter that there is a little bit more work to do and given consensus expectations for 2020 of $51 billion. I think the reforcasting to flat to 53 may surprise the market. And what you mentioned in your responses to my peers is that a lot of the investments this year have to do with control and business processes. ","I\u2019m wondering though if you are done recalibrating sort of how you are thinking about investment. In other words I didn\u2019t necessarily hear anything in terms of offensive technology spend and I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s going to take a longer time for us to see that cost opportunity, because you\u2019d rather prioritize a transformation of the franchise both on a regulatory side and on the offensive side so to speak on tech.","John Shrewsberry","Yes, it\u2019s a great question and it\u2019s part of why a quarter ago we suggested that 2020 was cloud for us to forecast given that there's a new CEO on the way in because the questions that you are asking are critical ones that will a new CEO, a permanent CEO is going to have a point of view on. In the meantime, what we\u2019re focusing on is as we just described, the trade-off -- not really a trade-off, but the prioritization of risk and control related expense to improve our environment to make ourselves better operators and to achieve the objectives that have been held out for us. And it does deprioritized somewhat either, further efficiency development or in some offensive activity. There's still plenty of offensive activity going on.","But those of that we\u2019ve set, Allen has set that the priorities that we're operating under currently along with the Board. And as we look out a year, I think it makes sense to contemplate that there'll be somebody else at the table who has got a meaningful voice of it.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And just one more follow-up question, I promise. Allen, I fully appreciate that you can\u2019t give us an update on the CEO succession. I'm wondering though, if you could share, since you have been with the company since March of 2017, and Wells Fargo is making progress, I'm wondering if having the interim position transition into prominence as part of the consideration for the Board.","Allen Parker","Well, Erika, let me start by saying that the search is being conducted by the independent directors, primarily through a search committee. And as a result, I haven't been involved in the search. There has been a lot of speculation back and forth about the candidates in the process, but as you know the Board said at the beginning, they wouldn't be providing any sort of updates along the way as to process or candidates.","Knowing the Board members, they're focused on doing this right. They're working to identify somebody who understands the challenges that Wells Fargo is currently working through, but also understands its extraordinary potential. When the Board asked me to take on the interim role, I assured them that I would do the best I could in the role for as long as we -- as long as they needed me. And that's really what I've been focused on, trying to move the company forward together with the operating committee to the best of my ability. But from the very beginning they said they were going to be seeking someone from the outside, and as far as I know they have never wavered from that.","Erika Najarian","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. ","John Shrewsberry","Hey, Matt.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Good morning. You guys have given some very specific net interest income clarity for this year. Any thoughts on where it might bottom? You did allude to some further balance sheet optimization, potentially still to come, as you think about de-risking. And frankly, like when I look at consensus, it seems like maybe it's not thinking about it right, where it bottoms out. So any thoughts on either where it bottoms with whatever rate assumption you want to use, or maybe kind of the exit 4Q 2019 level and some of the puts and takes to consider next year.","John Shrewsberry","Yes. So I -- as it relates to optimization, we've -- the loans that we've talked about that we intend to move out, I think encompass, at least the way we're thinking about it today, pretty much the whole opportunity. There aren\u2019t other legacy portfolios of higher yielding loans that we\u2019re deemphasizing. So that will run its course, auto is growing. So that looks a little bit different and will have an impact for next year.","And 2020 is going to be impacted by where we finish this year, what's going on with loan and deposit flows, this discussion about where deposit pricing for our peers -- for us and our peers is at that time, depending on whether the Fed is marching down or if things are very stable, and of course, could go either way and it\u2019s relatively benign economic environment overall and can't see a compelling course for much more action than what people are currently imagining or having priced in. So we could -- if we stabilize in the mid-ones from a Fed Funds perspective, for example, what that means for deposit pricing that'll matter.","And then at the long end of curve, if we get some steepening, we've got a little bit since we were below 2% in the tenure. If we get more steepening from there, that creates a bigger reinvestment opportunity. And I think, on an annualized basis 50 basis points at the long end, it's probably worth, $400 million, $450 million to us over the course of a year based on our average pace of reinvestment. But that'll have a big impact.","So how all of those things land is going to make a difference. One thing that we haven't talked about and as much as these rate cuts and the interest rate environment are making a little bit harder for us to make money to the extent that they really do elongate this recovery and we end up with benign credit conditions and we end up with robust consumer spending and flows and businesses remain healthy and borrow and continue to invest even at these relatively subdued levels. That's an interesting trade off as a bank, because we've got a lot to -- a lot of good things happen from an extended expansion.","So I can't -- that matters in terms of how we respond to the question, because of the rates of loan and deposit growth will be different in the continued expansion than they would be without it. So all those things matter. Right now the\u2026","Matt O\u2019Connor","Now just the back half\u2026","John Shrewsberry","Go ahead. ","Matt O\u2019Connor","Sorry. Go ahead.","John Shrewsberry","No, no please.","Matt O\u2019Connor","I'll just say, how about just the back half of this year, obviously, the bond premium amortization is going up in 3Q, which is a drag to net interest income. Does the net interest income dollars bottom in 3Q in your rate assumption or is there a further decline in fourth quarter? ","John Shrewsberry","I don't have the two quarters side-by-side in front of me, but we do in our in our expected case is down just a little bit less than 5% from where we are today. And if we do get a 25 or even 50 basis point cut in the third quarter, my sense is that the fourth quarter is going to be the one that bears the brunt of the impact of that as assets repriced down quickly. So, I think about that way.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay. All right, thank you.","John Shrewsberry","Thanks. ","Operator","Your next question comes in the line of John Pancari with Evercore.","John Shrewsberry","Hey, John. ","Allen Parker","Hi, John. ","John Pancari","Good morning. On the headcount point you made that you added 18,000. Do you expect additions on that front to continue in the risk and oversight area? And then also, is there any way you can help us size up, how big is your risk department now in terms of headcount? Thanks. ","John Shrewsberry","So the specific answer to how big the risk department is, is 11,000. It's hard to apples and apples compare that with others, depending on where people draw lines between who does what to whom. For example, where a big testing group sit whether they sit in the risk department or in an operations department or someplace else. But my guess is that we will end up -- well, we have we have open positions now. So we will be continuously adding for a while to risk.","And when I say risk, risk is sort of a -- are the people who work for the Chief Risk Officer. It's the second line in the financial services parlance, but there are people in control functions in the businesses who are doing the actual work, right. So the risk department is setting policy and looking into businesses and setting expectations for businesses and testing the businesses, but the businesses are controlling their own risks.","And those are areas that have had to be developed, staffed up, et cetera, particularly around -- really the focus here would be operational and compliance type risks. I think our credit risks, our market risk, etcetera, have been historically very strong and continue to be today. So the newer muscle that's being developed in all of the businesses are these control teams, who go process-by-process, product-by-product and transaction flow by transaction flow to as Allen said, try and ensure excellence in what we do so that we're not generating unexpected operational risk or compliance failures.","John Pancari","Thanks, John. And then how does that 11,000 headcount level compare to before the sales practices that you surfaced?","John Shrewsberry","Yes, it's another apples and oranges because people weren't all in the same place, but it's at least doubled over that time frame, if you\u2019d put it on the apples-to-apples basis.","John Pancari","Okay, thanks. And if I could ask just one more, just want to see if you have anything -- any kind of color, you can provide on the status of where you stand with the DOJ, the DOL, and sec investigations? Thanks.","Allen Parker","At this point, there are really no developments to report our discussions with them have been ongoing, but at this point, there are no developments that we can really disclose.","John Pancari","Okay. All right. Thanks, Allen.","John Shrewsberry","Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","John Shrewsberry","Hey, Betsey. ","Betsy Graseck","Hey, good morning. Question, a candidate have asked the question on the expenses from a different angle. I'm interested in understanding how much of the investment spend that\u2019s going on here is or the incremental investments that\u2019s going on in supporting revenue growth, not just the risk management side of the business. ","John Shrewsberry","Yes, it's tough to draw a line. I would say that on the investment spend front, if you're thinking about like enabling technologies or new capabilities, et cetera. It's a minority of the investment spend. The majority of it is really more on the things that we're talking about in terms of compliance and risk management. But having said that, the downside of not being excellent in those areas was produced it's more than its share of cost over the last few years. So from economic perspective, it's probably we got as high an NPV as anything else that we're doing. But specific as it probably be as less than half and more than half.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. And then on branch rationalization, I noticed that, your branch rationalization numbers have been increasing. Do you feel like you're at pace there? Or is there a room for that to accelerate? I'm just wondering, how much of branch rationalization is in your run rate today? ","John Shrewsberry","It's a great question. So there is two kinds of branch rationalization, there's the consolidation of branches where we take two branches that are close by that are -- and we study the patterns of their customers and realize that if we close one, we're going to -- we\u2019ll capture and retain virtually all of the customers using the remaining open branches in the market. And we've done a lot of that and we've had very good success at retaining virtually all of the deposits associated with that.","So that will run its course, because we will take out all of the consolidatable branches based on geography over some period of time. But Mary has been working, and her team are working really hard on that. The other kind, which is either selling or closing branches has been something that we've done a little bit of, we sold the package of 50 odd branches to Flagstar in the middle of or toward the end of last year. And these are discrete market areas where it's slightly outside of our supply lines or outside of our core market and it's a better set of assets to be owned by somebody else.","So we've got other packages of those that we've considered, but as deposits have gotten a little bit more expensive and as premiums have been a little bit less reliable, the economics of that move around from time to time. So we've been thinking -- we've been looking at those packages and opportunities and thinking about the competitive dynamics in the markets. And so we haven't really pushed any since we sold that first package, although there are others that probably make sense.","And then there are some branches that may just be worth closing because there wouldn't be a natural buyer. And we don't have any branches for which the costs exceeded the revenue. So it's not really an urgent matter. But there are some that are more or less efficient than others, some that are very low growth, some that are harder to service, et cetera. And all that is in the calculus. ","So I think we had -- Mary had said a couple years ago that she thought we're vectoring it on 5,000 branches down from 6,300 at the outset of the program, I think we're probably in the 5,400 range right now. And I think she has got line of sight down to about 5,100. And then the question is how hard do we want to push and what's the deposit value calculus for those -- for the last remaining ones.","Betsy Graseck","Okay.","John Shrewsberry","All against this backdrop of the secular decline in the kind of routine branch visits that you see in our numbers as people do more and more of the routine stuff digitally.","Betsy Graseck","Now does the branch strategy have any impact on the loan growth? I'm just wondering, if as you are coming to the end of the branch rationalization process does there have an impact on loan growth in the various categories?","John Shrewsberry","It could have an impact on -- it will have an impact on loan growth, it will have an impact on deposit growth and it will have an -- including new customer growth, and it'll have an impact on referred asset growth on the -- to the advisory side, because people do those things in branches. So those are all -- those we've experienced it, we witnessed it, and we try and calculate what we think that's worth and that's part of the calculus that Mary's team runs as they refer loans to mortgage or refer student loans or refer small business loans or refer assets to the -- to WIM, et cetera. Those are all healthy byproducts of the branch system and the things that you lose when you close a branch.","Betsy Graseck","Yes, I mean, do you feel like any numbers around what loan growth pressures are in your run rate and when you are done with the branch rationalization, do you feel like there could be some uplift there?","John Shrewsberry","Yes, I guess, there could be. I think there's a couple other things that are contributing to the same phenomena. In the wake of sales practices, it took a long time, or longer than expected time for branch personnel to really get back in the groove of making as many recommendations or referrals as they had previously. I think we've gotten better at that they've gotten better at that overtime. ","So that's sort of contributing to a rebound in the number, I think we're trying to make it easier for people to do business with us digitally. And so, we wouldn't have this drop off in quite the same way, when a branch closes and that's going on at the same time. So we haven't teased out the pieces of what's not happening, as a result of those branches closing. We have picked up the primary checking customer deposit number, so you can do it apples-and-apples. But on referrals there's nothing to specifically attribute.","Betsy Graseck","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes in a line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","John Shrewsberry","Hi, Gerard.","Gerard Cassidy ","Hi, how are you. John can you share with us LIBOR obviously in this quarter fell pretty dramatically relative to Fed Funds and you guys gave us a nice break out of the NIM following to 2.82%. How much would you point to as the LIBOR drop contributing to that decline?","John Shrewsberry","Actually not that much, I would say so one month LIBOR I think drop 6 basis points in the quarter if I\u2019m right about that and it didn\u2019t contribute that much to the drop in our -- I think our commercial loan yield overall dropped by a single basis point. So not that much there is other things going on, there is spread compression going on, going the other way we also had some recoveries in that line, and we had some fees that got amortized into that line as well. But LIBOR was going against us, but I wouldn\u2019t point to that and say that that was the source of a big piece of what happened in NIM, it was a piece. ","Gerard Cassidy ","Okay. And then second, if I recall last year's CCAR you guys were able to repurchase a good portion of your shares in the first couple of quarters of CCAR and essentially frontloaded the buyback. Can you share with us what the outlook is for this year's CCAR in terms of the allocation of the buybacks each quarter, is it again frontloaded like last year or is it more evenly split over the four quarters?","John Shrewsberry","The expectation is in the first two quarters we will do about two thirds of it and then the second two quarters the remaining third.","Gerard Cassidy ","Great. Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. ","John Shrewsberry","Hi, Vivek.","Vivek Juneja","Hi. Couple of questions, one simple one, how much is the expansion revenue impact of the business sold to principal, which close on July 1, and how much would come from Eastdil?","John Shrewsberry","Yes, so there is nothing in the second quarter, as we said. We will disclose all of the bits and pieces of principal in our 10-Q in a couple of weeks. So we haven't really announced that yet but you will see it. Importantly, we will be operating under a transition services agreement with principal for a period of time. So on the expense and even FTE side you'll see those numbers in our run rate for a period of time. We will call them out. So it's easy to adjust for it, but they don't all disappear on the closing date.","And then Eastdil, we'll talk about that when it closes at some point in the fourth quarter and you guys very specific guidance as a way to think about how to calibrate what the impact it has on Q4 and then the impact it will have on 2020.","Vivek Juneja","Okay. And the expense guidance you just give for 2020, John, does that factor in the sale of Eastdil, I recognize from your comments that principal obviously won't have much of an impact at least for the near-term?","John Shrewsberry","It does not yet account for the impact of the sale Eastdil, so their numbers are in our run rate until it actually happens. And then, again, we will adjust -- we will allow people to make adjustments and we will too for what comes out.","Vivek Juneja","Okay. Second one for you, John, trading revenues could you break those out that your total trading revenues between FIC [ph] and equities and give us this quarter as well as something comparable for last quarter and a year ago?","John Shrewsberry","I don't have all that in front of me. I don't know that we -- I don\u2019t think as a matter of course we break it out that way, which didn\u2019t say that we couldn't or shouldn't or we won't but we don\u2019t currently do that.","As you would expect, I would say disproportionately on the trading revenue side the bid offer in fixed income products represents a much bigger piece than $0.10 per share on the equity side. And then in the total related revenue, the contribution, which is more of a derivative mark to market or carry from equity derivatives probably makes a bigger impact it looks more like a fixed income business, frankly. So, we will some consideration as to whether that is going to be helpful as specific disclosure going forward, but I don\u2019t have it all sitting in front of me. ","Vivek Juneja","Thanks. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.","John Shrewsberry","Hi, Steven. ","Steven Chubak","Hi. Good morning. ","John Shrewsberry","Good morning. ","Steven Chubak","So wanted to start off with a question on capital targets. Just given your strong CCAR results, and your pretty steady and consistent track record there some encouraging commentary we just got from the Fed on managing to maybe a smoother planned transition from CECL inclusions in CCAR. I'm just wondering whether your thinking has evolved at all around the 10.25% to 10.5% target. That you guys had said it previously, whether there's any potential for you to manage to a lower target, if you continue to demonstrate strong results within CCAR?","John Shrewsberry","That's a great question. And as soon as we see the NPR on the stress capital buffer, and have a real sense for how CECL will get implemented in stress than we\u2019ll know and we will update. We've -- I think we've been a little conservative suggesting that the combination of both of those things has suggested to-date that there'd be more volatility in capital requirements, which probably means that most GSIPs, that the margin would need to carry a little bit more so that they didn't end up having a shortfall on a particular CCAR date.","Again, because stress capital buffer works as a point estimate and is -- and can create that kind of volatility, if whether it's by multi-year averaging, or in some other way, they reduce the risk of a hard transition like that then we may very well consider operating with capital target that we have today. We just we don't quite know enough. I'm hoping that in the next couple of quarters we\u2019ll really know and then we'll just -- we'll pick a number and defend it. ","But that's what's caused us to imagine 10.25% to 10.5% and until -- and now of course, we're expecting this NPR that should really help us understand what our target could be or should be.","Steven Chubak","Got it. And just one follow up for me, just a question on the securities book, the blended yield right now is still pretty elevated above 3% today. I know continued yield pressure is contemplated as part of the 2019 guide for NII. But as we look out to 2020, I was hoping you could speak to philosophically what type of securities you might be reinvest in, as the book matures, and maybe what your blended reinvestment rate sits at today given the current shape of the curve?","John Shrewsberry","Yes, it\u2019s a good question. So the investable universe for our investment portfolio has shrunk over the course of the last several years because of capital -- a finer point on capital allocation and for liquidity purposes and other reasons. So the big buckets or the biggest bucket for us is agency mortgage securities, but the big buckets are RMBS, a handful of different high grade corporate securities. We've got a reasonably large muni book, and then we've been a big CLO investor for some period of time.","And I mentioned earlier that some of that or more of that actually is getting done in loan form starting in the first quarter and continuing into the second quarter. So given market depth, market size, what's available, et cetera, I think we're going to end up continuing to do more in agency mortgage securities. The CLO universe is only so big, the muni universe is only so big and high grade corporates are, as this is the wrong point in the cycle to be incrementally leaning much harder on that. ","And so as we do our various trade-offs, thinking about shape of curve, cost of funds, OCI risk, spread risk, the range of things and of course, available sources of liquidity, it pushes us more towards agency mortgage securities.","And in terms of yield targets or what's rolling on, rolling off. So we sort of make determinations, alco-by-alco [ph] and implement them throughout the course of any quarter. But suffice to say that we sort of -- with few exceptions, we continue to try and stay invested rather than then look for particular target and pile in. We sort of scale up when the opportunity is a little bit bigger, and we scale down when the opportunity is a little bit worse. But because of the nature of prepayments and amortization and other cash flow coming off of that portfolio, this need to sort of continue to go back and make those determinations is constant. But it's going to reflect the market that we're in as we reinvest.","Steven Chubak","Helpful color. I'm going to sneak one more in if I may, just on fee income. Some of the key trends, including card income, deposit service charges, it was encouraging to see them being quite positively this quarter. I know there's some seasonality in these line items, but just curious what your outlook is for some of the biggest fee buckets in the second half. And are the -- I\u2019m also wondering if the impacts of customer friendly actions are now fully baked into the run rate today?","John Shrewsberry","So, yes, on that last question. So in trust and investment fees, if the S&P remains above 3000, then you should feel pretty good about the second half, because it was a pretty direct correlation between how that line item performs, plus inflows minus outflows, but the big piece of it is being multiplied times the S&P times of fee rate. So that feels pretty good, this is a good time for mortgage, the capacity constraints in the business are leading to expanding margins into the third quarter, this is the busy season. So my sense is that that's going to feel pretty good in the second half of the year.","On deposit service charges, so, yes, we're comping over the customer friendly actions, we did have a disproportionate level of fee waivers in the first quarter, which makes the first quarter to the second quarter probably look like a little bit of steeper jump than I would trend from this point forward. Because we're always doing business with more customers and we've had increases in treasury management as well and wholesale, which flows into that line. So that's good.","On card fees, that will be more seasonal as you expect. Fourth quarter is a big quarter, first quarter is a low quarter, so second quarter is recovering from the first quarter based on consumer spending patterns. And so I wouldn't expect two to three to look like one to two in terms of the shape of that curve. Hopefully, that's helpful.","Steven Chubak","Very helpful. And thanks for taking my questions. ","John Shrewsberry","Yeah, you bet.","Operator","Your final question will come from the line of Eric Compton with Morningstar.","John Shrewsberry","Hello, Eric Compton. ","Eric Compton","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I have a couple questions. I'm going to go back to expenses. And my first question is just, do you have any sense of, I guess, what percentage of the investments have ramped up in 2019 and it sounds like they're going to be ramping up even more in 2020? What percentage are permanent versus what you might be able to roll off, once the build-up is done?","John Shrewsberry","Yes, it\u2019s a good question, there will definitely be role off as processes mature, as business process is simplified, as we do things in fewer ways and supporting technology. Similarly, compresses and simplifies, it's hard to put a number on that the -- but there's the expectation and the understanding among everybody here who is building enhanced capability is that once built, it needs to be on a path to continuous improvement. Because we are getting simpler, we are getting more automated, our customers are getting more self-serve, we're reducing the number of products et cetera, and more and more controls are moving to an automated state. ","So, whenever a bundle of process goes through that, peak to maturity timeframe, the expectation is just to pick a number that you can have a line of sight into call it down 20%, down 30% for those activities. That's certainly how we thought about it when we rolled up our staff groups into mature portions of them. But we'll be giving more color on that as we come closer and as we get through the peak build in some of these areas of capability.","Eric Compton","Got you, that's helpful. And to wrap it up, so I just want to make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. So it sounds like the kind of the amount of investment in 2020 should be assuming underlying cost saves were kind of the run the business type stuff in the background, kind of the incremental investment and the compliance risk management stuff that\u2019s ramping up even more in 2020, I guess this is the first part of my question.","And then two is, is that related at all or is there a connection between that and feedback from and or progress with the regulators?","John Shrewsberry","So what you'll see in 2020 is the full year effect on the add side of things that are being added throughout the course of 2019, at a minimum. There may also be areas where net new capability, staff, supporting technology, et cetera is like it has been in 2018 and 2019 is added in 2020. But at a minimum, you'll see a full year effect of what's been added during 2019. Just like on the cost save side, we'll get the full year benefit of costs that have been taken out in 2019, in 2020. ","And on the second part of your question without a doubt, with every new leader that joins us with a particular area of expertise, there's -- that creates feedback for us to execute against and with every bit of everybody feedback from many of our stakeholders including regulators, there's -- there are -- it creates a clearer vision of what good looks like and people build in that direction. So that feedback has been helpful.","Eric Compton","Great. Appreciate you taking my questions. ","John Shrewsberry","Thank you. ","Operator","I\u2019ll now turn the conference back over to management for any further remarks.","Allen Parker","Well, thank you very much.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference.","John Campbell","Thank you, Regina. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our Interim CEO and President, Allen Parker; and our CFO, John Shrewsberry will discuss third quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our third quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our Web site at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause the actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement.","Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release, and in the quarterly supplement available on our Web site.","I will now turn the call over to Allen Parker.","Allen Parker","Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for today's discussion of our third quarter results. Our earnings included a number of significant items that John Shrewsberry will discuss, but I'll note at the outset that our underlying business fundamentals were strong. That strength was demonstrated by, among other things, increases in loan and deposit balances both from the second quarter and from a year ago, our highest branch customer experience scores in over three years, and continued growth in primary consumer checking customers.","As you all know, Charlie Scharf will join Wells Fargo next week as our new CEO and President. I've had the opportunity to spend a great deal of time with Charlie, and I'm convinced that he has the right combination of experience, business savvy, and leadership ability to position Wells Fargo for an even more successful future. I look forward to working with Charlie on a seamless transition as he assumes his responsibilities as CEO, and I return to my role as the company's General Counsel. It's been an honor for me to serve as our Interim CEO and President over the last six months. I am proud that during my time in this role, the company continued to move forward, and we made progress on our top priorities, which include focusing on our customers and team members, meeting the expectations of our regulators, and continuing our company's important transformation.","Let me provide just a few examples of our most recent progress. In the area of leadership, we made important hires during the third quarter in Technology, Merchant Services, and Wealth Management. In addition, within Consumer Banking, we named leaders to new roles that will help us better serve our customers. David Kowach, who was most recently the head of Wells Fargo Advisors, assumed a new role as the Head of Community Banking, reporting to Mary Mack. We created this role because we believe that having a single dedicated leader supporting our team members and customers in our branches will significantly further our ongoing transformation.","We also formed within Consumer Banking, a new Enterprise Customer Excellence Group that will, over time bring together functions from across the company and give us broader insight into the customer experience. This new group is under the leadership of Andy Rowe, who led Consumer Segments and Consumer Strategy for the last two years. And in the area of innovation and technology, we made several important announcements during the third quarter. Wells Fargo's ongoing commitment to exploring and investing in emerging technologies through the Wells Fargo Startup Accelerator program was demonstrated by our adding two new companies, one focused on augmented reality and the other focused on climate change risk. The total number of companies in that portfolio is now 25.","We also announced plans to pilot, next year, Wells Fargo Digital Cash, which is designed to enable us to complete internal booked transfers of cross-border payments running on our first distributed ledger technology platform. This new technology should drive operational efficiencies by providing longer operating windows and real-time processing. Finally, we announced a data exchange agreement with Plaid, a leading data platform. With this agreement, our customers will have greater control over the bank account information they share with Plaid-supported apps, including the ability to turn on or off data sharing through Wells Fargo's Control Tower.","I want to conclude my comments this morning by thanking the members of our operating committee, our other senior leaders, and all our team members for their efforts, dedication, and perseverance during the last six months. In particular, I want to thank Doug Edwards for his strong and thoughtful leadership as our Interim General Counsel during this period of transition. We continue to have a lot of work ahead of us, but the unwavering focus of our team members on serving our customers are also working tirelessly to transform Wells Fargo has enabled us to make substantial progress toward our goals over the last six months.","Looking forward, I am confident that the extraordinary strings of the Wells Fargo franchise, when combined with our new leadership and our collective commitment to work hard to achieve further improvements will result in a company that is well-positioned to benefit our shareholders and all our other stakeholders.","John will now discuss our financial results in more detail.","John Shrewsberry","Thank you, Allen, and good morning everyone. We had a number of significant items in the third quarter that impacted our results, which we highlight in slide two. We had $1.9 billion of operating losses, predominantly reflecting litigation accruals for a variety of matters, including a $1.6 billion discrete litigation accrual for previously disclosed retail sales practices matters that was not tax deductible and reduced EPS by $0.35 per share. We had a $1.1 billion gain from the sale of our Institutional Retirement and Trust business, which contributed $0.20 per share to EPS. We had gains of $302 million from the sales of $510 million of Pick-a-Pay PCI, and other PCI residential mortgage loans.","We had $244 million in mortgage servicing rights valuation adjustments driven predominantly by higher prepayment rate estimates on our MSRs. These valuation adjustments resulted in our mortgage banking revenue declining from the second quarter despite an increase in mortgage originations and higher production margins. We had a $105 million impairment of capitalized software reflecting reevaluation of software under development. We also had a modest $50 million reserve build compared with the $150 million reserve release last quarter.","Finally, we partially redeemed our Series K Preferred Stock, which reduced diluted EPS by $0.05 per share as a result of elimination of purchase accounting discount recorded on these shares at the time of the Wachovia acquisition. This partial redemption will reduce the amount of our quarterly preferred stock dividends by approximately $23 million, starting in the fourth quarter. While our financial results in the third quarter were impacted by these items, as Allen summarized and we highlight on slide three, we continue to have positive business momentum with strong customer activity.","We\u2019ve reviewed some of our year-over-year results on page four. Compared with the third quarter of 2018, revenue was stable with an increase of $1 billion in non-interest income driven by the sale of our Institutional Retirement and Trust business, largely offset by a $947 million decline in net interest income. Our expenses increased $1.4 billion from a year ago, driven by $1.3 billion of higher operating losses reflecting higher litigation accruals. Our net charge-off rate remains near historic lows at 27 basis points. We had a $50 million reserve build in the third quarter compared with the $100 million reserve release a year ago.","We maintained strong capital levels even as we reduced common shares outstanding by 9% and increased our quarterly common stock dividend by 19% from a year ago. I will be highlighting most of the balance sheet drivers on page five throughout the call, so we will turn to page six. Our effective income tax rate increased to 22.1% in the third quarter, reflecting a net discrete income tax expense of $443 million, predominantly related to the non-tax-deductible treatment of the $1.6 billion discrete litigation accrual. We currently expect the effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter to be approximately 17.5%, excluding the impact of any unanticipated discrete items.","Turning to page seven, average loans were up $10.3 billion from a year ago and increased $2.3 billion from the second quarter. This was the first time we had both year-over-year and linked quarter growth in average loans in nearly three years. Period-end loans increased $12.6 billion from a year ago with growth in C&I, first mortgage, credit card, and auto loans partially offset by declines in commercial real estate, junior lien mortgage, and other revolving credit and installment loans. We grew loans even as we sold or moved to held-for-sale a total $7.4 billion of consumer loans over the past year.","I will highlight the drivers of the linked quarter growth in loans starting on page nine. Commercial loans were stable linked quarter as growth in C&I loans and leased financing was largely offset by declines in commercial real estate loans. C&I loans were up $2 billion with broad based growth in corporate and investment banking and the purchases of CLOs in loan form in the credit investment portfolio.","These increases were partially offset by declines in commercial banking and lower government and institutional banking and middle market lending and in commercial capital driven by seasonally lower commercial distribution finance dealer floor plan loans. Commercial real estate loans declined $2.2 billion from the second quarter with declines in both commercial real estate mortgage and commercial real estate construction loans reflecting increased market liquidity, higher refinancing activity, and continued credit discipline. Leased financing increased $276 million from the second quarter, driven by growth in large ticket direct finance leases in equipment finance.","As we show on page 10, consumer loans increased $5 billion from the second quarter. The first mortgage loan portfolio increased $4.2 billion from the prior quarter driven by $19.3 billion of originations held for investment and the purchase of $1 billion of loans as a result of our exercising service cleanup calls to terminate over 20 pre-2008 securitizations. This growth was partially offset by pay downs as well as sales of $510 million of PCI mortgage loans. Junior lien mortgage loans were down $1.2 billion from the second quarter as pay downs continue outpaces new originations. Credit card loans increased $809 million primarily due to seasonality. Our auto portfolio continued to grow with balances up $1.1 billion from the second quarter.","Originations increased 9% to $6.9 billion. We have been successfully regaining market share while maintaining our credit discipline. Our market share growth reflects the benefit of the transformational changes we have made in the business including process improvements that have resulted in faster credit decision response times.","Turning to deposits on page 11, average deposits increased 2% from both a year ago and the second quarter. Average deposits increased $22.4 billion from the second quarter with growth in wholesale banking as well as retail banking deposits which continue to benefit from promotional rates and offers. Our average deposit cost of 71 basis points increased 1 basis point from the second quarter, the lowest linked quarter increase since the fourth quarter of 2016.","The increase from the second quarter was driven by continued retail deposit campaign pricing for new deposits so that we begun lower promotional rates in terms in response to market conditions. The increase was also impacted by unfavorable deposit mix shifts.","On page 12, we provide details on period-end deposits which grew 3% from a year ago and 2% from the second quarter. Wholesale banking deposits were up $6.6 billion from the second quarter driven by seasonal growth in middle market and business banking as well as growth in our commercial real estate business. Consumer and small business banking deposits increased $11.9 billion from the second quarter driven by higher retail banking deposits including growth in high yield savings and CDs. Wealth and investment management deposits grew as clients reallocation of cash in the higher yielding liquid alternatives slowed during the quarter.","Mortgage escrow deposits grew $4.1 billion from the second quarter reflecting higher mortgage payoffs. These increases were partially offset by a $2.5 billion reduction in corporate Treasury deposits, the second consecutive quarter of declines. Net interest income declined $470 million from the second quarter primarily due to balance sheet re-pricing driven by the impact of the lower interest rate environment as well as $133 million of higher MBS premium amortization costs due to higher pre-payments.","We currently expect MBS premium amortization to continue to increase in the fourth quarter but at a slower pace. We also had lower variable income and smaller positive impact from hedge ineffectiveness accounting results. These declines in net interest income were partially offset by favorable balance sheet growth and mix and the benefit of one additional day of the quarter. As you can see on the chart on this page, rates have been volatile and the yield curve has flattened significantly over the past year.","Net interest income was down 8% in the third quarter and down 4% in the first nine months of 2019, compared with the same periods a year ago. As we stated last month, we currently expect net interest income to decline approximately 6% for the full-year compared with 2018. As always, net interest income will be influenced by a number of factors including loan growth, pricing spreads, the level of rates and the slope of the yield curve.","Turning to page 14, non-interest income increased $896 million for the second quarter driven by the gain from the sale of our institutional retirement and trust business.","Let me highlight a few of the other linked quarter trends. Trust and investment fees were down $9 million, growth and retail brokerage advisory fees, asset base fees in our asset management business and investment banking fees was offset by the decline in trust and investment fees as a result of the sale of our IRT business. While we no longer recognize trust and investment fees from this business, we will continue to administer client assets for up to 24 months, and the buyer will pay us a fee for certain costs we incurred during this transition period.","This fee was $94 million in the third quarter and was recognized in other non-interest income. Mortgage banking revenue declined $292 million from the second quarter driven by a $419 million decline in servicing income primarily due to the valuation adjustments on our MSRs reflecting higher prepayment rate estimates. Partially offsetting this decline was $127 million increase in net gains on mortgage loan originations and sales activities. Mortgage originations increased $5 billion from the second quarter due to higher refi volumes from lower interest rates with refis increasing to 40% of originations in the third quarter. We ended the quarter with a $44 billion unclosed pipeline consistent with the second quarter and we currently expect fourth quarter originations to remain at a similar level to the third quarter.","Residential held for sale mortgage loan originations totaled $38 billion in the third quarter and the production margin on these originations increased to 121 basis points with higher margins in both retail and correspondent channels, driven by capacity constraints. We had $956 million of net gains from equity securities in the third quarter primarily due to realized and unrealized gains from our affiliated venture capital and private equity partnerships. These gains were partially offset by lower deferred comp plan investment results which are largely P&L neutral. ","Turning to expenses on page 15, expenses increased from both the second quarter and a year ago, largely due to higher operating losses, primarily reflecting litigation accruals.","To explain the drivers we will start on page 16. Expenses increased $1.8 billion from the second quarter driven by a $1.7 billion increase in operating losses. The increase in compensation and benefits reflected higher salaries expense primarily driven by one additional day in the quarter, a change in staffing mix and higher severance expense partially offset by lower deferred comp expense.","Infrastructure expense increased due to higher equipment expense reflecting the $105 million impairment of capitalized software, predominantly in our wealth and investment management business as well as higher occupancy expense. These increases were partially offset by lower advertising and promotion, FDIC expense, as well as lower T&E expense.","As we show on page 17, expenses increased $1.4 billion from a year ago, driven by $1.3 billion of higher operating losses. As we've previously discussed, investments and risk management including regulatory compliance and operational risk as well as data and technology have exceeded expectations and have offset the expense efficiency we've achieved in other areas. We currently expect our 2019 expenses to be approximately $53 billion, which is at the top end of our $52 to $53 billion target range. This excludes annual operating losses in excess of $600 million and also excludes deferred comp expense, which is largely P&L neutral and total $476 million through the first nine months of the year.","Turning to our Business segments starting on page 19, community banking earnings declined $2.1 billion from the second quarter, primarily driven by higher operating losses reflecting higher litigation accruals.","On page 20, we provide our community banking metrics. We have 30.2 million digital active customers in the third quarter up 4% from a year ago, including 7% growth in mobile active customers. Primary consumer checking customers grew for the eighth consecutive quarter on a year-over-year basis.","Branch customer experience survey scores have increased for five consecutive quarters and reached their highest levels in more than three years in September. The continued improvement in these scores reflects the transformative change we've been making to provide a better customer experience. We've enhanced training and coaching for our team members in our branches including an increased focus on educating our customers about our industry leading digital capabilities.","On slide 21, teller and ATM transactions declined 6% from a year ago reflecting continued customer migration to digital channels. We've consolidated 130 branches in the first nine months of this year, including 52 branches in the third quarter. We continue to have strong card usage with credit card purchase volume up 5% from a year ago and debit card purchase volume up 6% from a year ago. This was the eighth consecutive quarter of achieving at least 5% year-over-year growth in both debit and credit card purchase volume.","Turning to page 22, wholesale banking earnings declined $145 million from the second quarter, driven by lower net interest income reflecting the impact of the lower interest rate environment. We've expanded the key metrics that we provide for this business and as you can see we grew unfunded lending commitments on both a year-over-year in linked quarter basis. We're a large processor of commercial payments as evidenced by our ACH payment and commercial card spend and we grew our year-to-date market share and investment banking driven by higher market share in loans indications. We're also a market leader in high-grade issuances. We had record volume in the third quarter commensurate with the industry with September being particularly strong and the fourth highest month on record for the industry fueled by the rally and treasuries.","In general, our commercial customers continue to see moderate demand and no widespread issues related to trade uncertainty and interest rate changes. We'll continue to monitor business performance closely, but today, while our customers are cautious, the most common concern they identify their ability to hire enough qualified workers. Wealth and investment management earnings increased $678 million from the second quarter, driven by the gain on the sale of our institutional retirement and trust business.","Turning to page 24, we continue to have strong credit results with our net charge-off rate declining to 27 basis points in the third quarter. All of our commercial and consumer real estate portfolios were in a net recovery position in the third quarter. Credit card net charge-offs have been relatively stable as we've been thoughtful in our efforts to generate new account growth, including the launch of our Propel American Express Card last year, and while auto and net charge-offs increased from the second quarter due to seasonality, they were down from a year ago even as we've grown originations by 45%. We're generating growth in originations, while maintaining our strong credit discipline with consistent loan de-value, payment to income, and FICO scores.","Non-accrual loans declined $377 million from the second quarter with lower non-accruals in both the commercial and consumer portfolios. Non-accrual loans were 58 basis points of total loans, their lowest level in over 10 years. We closely monitor our commercial portfolio for signs of weakness and credit quality indicators remains strong. Our internal credit grades are at their strongest levels in two years and since third quarter of 2017 our criticized loan balances have declined 20% with broad-based improvement across all commercial asset classes.","We currently estimate that the impact of the adoption of CECL at the beginning of next year will be a reduction in our allowance of approximately $1.4 billion. Just over half of the reduction reflects the expected decrease for commercial loans given their short contractual maturities exceeding the expected incremental allowance for consumer loans that have longer or indeterminate maturities.","As a reminder, we have a smaller credit card portfolio than our large bank peers which reduces the impact CECL adoption will have on our consumer loans. The remainder of the expected reduction in our allowance predominantly related to the increase in collateral value of residential mortgage loans, which were written down significantly below current recovery value during the last credit cycle. The ultimate affect of CECL will depend on the size and composition of our loan portfolio, the portfolio's credit quality and economic conditions at the time of adoption, as well as any refinements to our model's methodology and other key assumptions. Also, as the industry experiences credit cycles, we anticipate more volatility under a lifetime reserving approach versus the incurred loss approach.","Turning to capital, on page 25, CET1 ratio, fully phased-in, decreased to 11.6% driven by returning $9 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases in the third quarter. This was up 50% from the $6 billion we returned last quarter. As a reminder, similar to last year, our plan subject to market conditions and management discretion is to use approximately 65% of the gross repurchase capacity under our most recent capital plan in the second-half of 2019.","In summary, while we had a number of significant items that impacted our third quarter financial results, we had strong underlying business fundamentals, including growth in loans and deposits, increased customer activity, strong credit performance, and higher capital returns. I'm optimistic that our continued efforts to transform Wells Fargo and the fundamental strengths of our franchise will continue to position us well for success.","And Allen and I will now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.","Allen Parker","Good morning.","Erika Najarian","Hi, good morning. Morning, as we think about what the forward curve is telling us, and obviously it's been quite a volatile outlook for the forward curve, and some of the momentum that you talked about on the growth side in lending. As we think about the 6% NII decline in 2019, given sort of the forward curve plus that momentum, how should we think about NII decline expectations for 2020?","John Shrewsberry","Yes, well, it's complicated, because there's a lot of things going into it include where rates go versus what the market is suggesting, what happens with loan pricing, deposit pricing, and a variety of things, but if we, in the various scenarios that we run thinking about, let's say, the 9\/30 implied forward curve, which suggests Fed funds in the 170 area, 12\/31 of this year the 10-year just under 170, and then a year forward, Fed funds in the 120 area and Fed funds still in the 170 -- pardon me, 10-year still in the 170 area. That with a range of assumptions about loans and deposits probably gets us to down low-to-mid single digits in net interest income. Maybe not as much of a decline from '18 to '19, but versus a number of scenarios, but it seems to be that would seem to capture it.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And my second question, obviously you can't speak for the new CEO. The questions that we're getting from your investor base is that they're trying to gauge how much further investment there needs to be sort of going forward. And you mentioned yourself, John, that the investments in risk compliance and data had exceeded your expectations. And again, you can't speak for Charlie, but as you think about how those investments played out relative to investments in, let's say, innovation, and as you think about where you are versus peers, is there a significant catch-up gap because you've spent a lot of those dollars on risk compliance and data, how should we think about investment spend from here?","Allen Parker","Yes, so I think when Charlie arrives, we'll conduct a complete strategic review of where all the businesses stand and where we -- what our opportunities are, et cetera, including a review of how we've been investing on the risk compliance side, et cetera, and then formulate a view going forward. One thing that probably doesn't get enough focus is that a lot of the money and time that we've spent on the risk and control side of things really does enable further innovation. So, the money we spend in technology and data, for example, has huge customer impact down the road. So, there's not an either or necessarily, there's a lot of mutual benefit from running a more controlled environment. But that will be work that we all do together with Charlie after he arrives and then present conclusions at the right time.","Erika Najarian","Got it, thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill.","Scott Siefers","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question.","Allen Parker","Hi, Scott.","Scott Siefers","John, sort of a follow-up question on costs, I guess if I look at the reiterated 2019 expense guide, it implies a pretty meaningful downdraft in costs in the 4Q, maybe if you could just take a moment to go through sort of the puts and takes and how you bring costs down in the coming quarter? And then just along the lines of costs into 2020, I know you had previously suggested that costs could be flat in 2020, is that still something you're thinking or now with Charlie coming on board, do we sort of just sort of wait till he comes on and take a look at things, and then give him complete discretion on what the cost outlook looks like?","John Shrewsberry","Yes, so on the second half, I think you answered that, which is we should wait and allow him to have an input onto the composition of how we're spending money in the future. For Q4 though, as you pointed out, it does imply a step down. And I think the biggest sources of that are other professional fees and some labor-related expense. But it does require that, that\u2019s how the math works, and that's how we're forecasted right now.","Scott Siefers","Okay, perfect, thank you. And then just separately on mortgage, I think you had said that the originations should stay around this quarter's level into the fourth quarter. Hopefully, I heard that correctly. Maybe if you could just sort of comment on where you see gain on sale margins trending with a nice uptick this quarter? And overall, given the moving parts that you see, should we expect mortgage revenues to be at or above what we saw this quarter, particularly if we don't get the same sort of MSR noise?","Allen Parker","Yes, so on the origination side, it's hard to say what the full quarter gain on sale is, but we do think it'll be in the neighborhood of where it's been recently, it was just, call it, 120 basis points, which was a big tick up and welcome. On the servicing side, well I wouldn't expect there to be any revaluation in the fourth quarter. We think we\u2019ve got that in the third quarter. We -- recall that we are in a flatter curve environment, and so the carry for holding treasuries is a hedge to the MSR. Sometimes, it works for us in a steeper curve environment, and sometimes it's either neutral or works against us when the curve gets flatter. So we shouldn't earn as much on the hedge but we probably wouldn't have the type of valuation items we saw in Q3.","Scott Siefers","Okay, all right, terrific. Thank you very much for the color.","Allen Parker","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research.","Allen Parker","Hi, John.","John McDonald","Hi, good morning. Hey, John, wanted to ask about deposits -- deposit pricing. With the deposit cost increases slowing, might we have seen kind of the end of the deposit cost rise for you guys this quarter assuming rates stay flat to down from here, kind of just trying to think if this could be the max paying quarter for NIM where you had the deposit costs up and loan yields down, and maybe some just puts and takes for the fourth quarter on NIM versus this quarter?","John Shrewsberry","Yes, so my expectation is that deposit costs will be cheaper in the fourth quarter reflecting what you described in terms of kind of the burning out of the higher cost deposits that got layered in before the Fed began to ease. Having said that, that is still -- there was less room to go down on the deposit side, and so if rates continue to move down on the asset side it still works against us even if deposit costs aren't rising. So we have to be as vigilant as we can to keep deposits costs as low as it makes sense for the businesses and customers that we serve. But even if they're not rising there's still leverage working against us in a declining rate environment.","John McDonald","And in terms of good guys, bad guys, and fourth quarter versus third, what's worse and what's maybe better than what you experienced this quarter on just a NIM percentage?","John Shrewsberry","Well, I think we're imagining having a little bit higher level of MBS premium amortization. So, that will be working for us in the fourth quarter. It depends, I'd say in terms of wholesale pricing, wholesale banking, deposit pricing. Working with the higher beta customers to make sure that we reduce those as quickly as possible, there is probably more room to run on that with a little bit of divestiture time that could be a benefit. The burnout of more promotional activity on the consumer side is probably a net benefit, and those are some of the bigger items.","John McDonald","Okay, and guys, one more follow-up on the expenses.","John Shrewsberry","Sure.","John McDonald","Is it accurate for us to think that there are some elements of your inflation and expenses that are temporary, and helping you get to the best-in-class and satisfy your regulators, and then other parts that are permanent, like helping you stay best-in-class and keep satisfying regulators and some of them what you're building might get more efficient over time, and obviously a lot of it will stay?","John Shrewsberry","Yes, I think it's a good point, there's a real opportunity for, for taking best-in-class and then making it much more efficient. I think we should -- maybe it was last quarter, one of the things that we mentioned is that we're building a control environment for the company as it exists today, and there is just through process consolidation and process reengineering, there's an opportunity for the company to be a whole lot more simplified as we roll forward, and both the cost of delivery and the cost of overseeing that from a risk and control perspective would be expected to be more efficient. Some of that is converting multiple manual processes to just a fewer processes, and some of it is from converting manual process to automated process, but all of that is upside from where we -- from the day that we determine that we think we've achieved the best-in-class requirement from an operational risk and compliance perspective.","John McDonald","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Hey, thanks. Hey, John, one follow-up on the NII side, so you keeping their minus 6 NII I got for the year kind of gets you 11 fours for the year, and down even five next year kind of holds you at that 11 four-ish, and so I know there're so many potential permutations of what happens with the rate environment, but maybe you can just help us talk through how much you expect the balance sheet to grow then, or how -- versus how close you're starting to get towards the asset cap, and what constraints if anything, might you have as this gets further out? Thanks.","John Shrewsberry","I mean within the relevant range of expectations of loan and deposit growth, I wouldn't think of the asset cap as being as really coming into play in our forecast horizon, in part, because there are plenty of levers that we can pull that don't have real customer impact in terms of consumers and our business customers, and we've talked about some of those before in terms of some of the institutional deposits that we take or other wholesale funding that we use, and then, there are some assets that don't work that hard for us from a balance sheet perspective. So, I guess the low single-digit growth rates for loans and deposits is probably a reasonable proxy for a reasonable placeholder for thinking about how 2020 unfolds, could be a range of different outcomes, but that would be consistent with what I mentioned earlier in terms of how you might forecast the different rate paths and getting to a low to mid single-digits down percentage in net interest income for 2020 versus 2019.","Ken Usdin","Understood, thanks, and a follow-up on the fee side, we got the IRT coming out, did you spoke about it, was in the deck, and then you've got Estill [ph], can you just help us understand how you are thinking about how that just nets out as we get past this year as well in terms of revenue and expense trajectory? Thanks, John.","John Shrewsberry","Yes, well, so with IRT, I think we actually have a -- this page in the back of the supplement that shows you exactly what to expect there, and not to oversimplify it, but it's on the order of $100 million a quarter I think from both revenue and expense, at least as we process it. Estill coming out starting in the fourth quarter, it was probably a little bit bigger in terms of dollars of revenue per quarter, and you'll see it mostly in the commercial mortgage brokerage line item in the P&L, it shows up in a couple of others areas too and have investment banking fees, but similarly the expenses approximate the revenue in our own experience. So when we finished Q4 and we talked about our 2019 expenses, and we will provide a reconciliation for people to be able to show where we ended up and we'll be sure that to call out both of those things. Actually, it won't really impact -- IRT won't impact it because the expenses are still in our run rate, and we're recovering them, Estill will be a minor adjustment, because there won't be expenses for Q4.","Ken Usdin","Understood, thank you, John.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore.","Allen Parker","Hi, John.","John Pancari","Good morning. Staying on the loan growth topic, you saw some pretty good declines in the commercial real estate portfolios this quarter again and just want to get your updated thoughts there, that's the one area that you're expect to see some runoff still or another words lack of growth, I guess? Thanks.","Allen Parker","So we had a couple quarters with small growth and then we shrunk again a little bit this quarter. As I understand it, I think our commitments for construction financing are actually up in the third quarter, which will come through as funded loans. That really is one market where","there's late cycle behavior. There's lots of non-bank competitors, there are more non-bank competitors than bank competitors. And so we really have to pick our spots in order to maintain our risk reward, credit and pricing and loan terms quality, and it's also one of those areas where, frankly, your weakest loans end up getting refinanced away from you, which is also late cycle behavior by the way, so we're still very comfortable with what we have on the books, but I wouldn't look for it to grow meaningfully until the cycle turns and until our best customers have really interesting opportunities to put their own capital to work and we help them do it. So I could be wrong, but it feels to me like it's going to be treading water while our best customers either refinance deals that were already in or prudently take advantage of what the market offers them.","But I don't see it as an area for outsized growth.","John Pancari","Okay, that's helpful. And then separately on the fee side, the equity investment gains saw a pretty good jump in the quarter, if you could just give us a little bit of color on what drove that and if you can give us a little thoughts in your outlook there? Thanks.","Allen Parker","Sure. There's a couple things that drive that, one is it's a great time to be realizing from both private equity and venture portfolios. And so, our teams have been selling into that and that's where we've been at the high point in the cycle for a while now. So with respect to the second part of your question, I expect that to reflect what kind of private market we're in and if it still is a strong and financing is accommodating it as it is today then I expect that that they'll continue to harvest and things will be good. It's a little bit harder of an environment for them to be putting capital to work because asset prices are so high. The other thing that contributes to is we had a change in accounting a year or so ago which is causing us to recognize unrealized gains where they said there's a subsequent capital raise in a private deal that causes us to have to mark up our position, and it's always been true if one of those companies goes public, but our affiliate still ends up owning shares for a period of time that we write up, we recognize the gain even though we haven't liquidated our position. So that's contributing, that will contribute to some more volatility here because that can only be one way even though it's been a benefit for the last year.","John Pancari","Okay, got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Allen Parker","Hi Matt.","Matt O'Connor","Good morning. So it seems like the NIM percent could bottom somewhere in the 250s, and I'm just trying to get a sense of is that like a reasonable NIM when I think about your mix, right, everyone's trying to compare you to both your bigger peers and your smaller and you don't have as much credit card as some, does that hurts you, also not as much trading book as some that should help you. And then, you know, just to throw a couple of things like there's still some assets where it seems like you're over earning, like in the securities book, but there's also some deposits that you're overpaying. So what are your thoughts around, kind of, again based on some of the things that you set for 2020 in NII and thinking about just keeping rates for the four curve is like that NIM in the 250s like is that a normal NIM for you in this backdrop, or there's still some?","John Shrewsberry","So we're not currently forecasting over our horizon to quite hit that level. I mean it's not that far off either of where we are today or what's likely to unfold. I agree that but while we do have some special things on the asset or the liability side. The sale of Pick-a-Pay loans they were contributing to interest income and to them is probably something that isn't going to be replicated. So I think once that fully runs through the comparison periods, I mean it's affecting them already. That's out, and I don't think there is that much more on the loan side. It's high yielding that's rolling off.","On the liability side, we did mention that there are some promotional deposits and other things that are burning down because they were in place as we were on the way up in rates, and so that will be a benefit, but I don't think we get quite to 250 in our forecast horizon. A lot of things go into that, of course, and we don't manage to them. We're much more thinking about dollars of net interest income, but if that's helpful.","Matt O'Connor","Okay, and I was kind of thinking 250 is broadly speaking, but that is helpful. And then just specifically like as we think about, you know, exiting fourth quarter at net interest income, you're obviously going to be caring or absorbing higher than normal bond premium amortization. So we don't want to run right all that. What is the level of the bond premium amortizationthis quarter? You said they increased at 131, but what's the run rate?","John Shrewsberry","Yes, for MBS it's just under $400 million for the quarter and it was just under $250 million for the second quarter, and we think it'll be up a little bit in the fourth quarter. So it's been about $775 million year-to-date through the third quarter.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. And then just last question all this, as we think about exiting this year, just assuming rates stay where they are now, does that go to zero or there's still going to be just some ongoing amount in the fourth quarter?","John Shrewsberry","I assume there'll still be some ongoing amount, if we stay in this context for 10 year and mortgage rates with the velocity of prepayments. You heard me mentioned that we're at about 40% refis right now in our own production, and our pipeline is this big coming out of the third quarter as it was going in. And so, that may take months or even quarters for the -- in the moneyness of the outstanding stock of mortgages, you know, agency mortgages to work their way through the system, but there is a whole lot more people who are in the money for refi today than a few quarters ago. So I don't think that's going to abate quickly.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. And I could just be greedy here and squeeze in one other thing. You've talked about the increased spending in regulation compliance controls related areas versus two or three years ago. Is there a dollar amount that you can provide on that increase or I think at one point you did talk about the headcount increase, maybe you could update that and we can make some estimates if you can't give us a dollar amount? Thank you.","John Shrewsberry","Yes, I don't have a crisp answer for you only because it appears everywhere. It appears in the front line and appears in the second line, it appears in technology, it appears in a variety of areas. I think we'll try and put a comparison together for folks to get a picture of not only what we think about it, how we think about it historically, but how we think about it going forward back to John McDonald's question of what do we look like at the high watermark versus what efficient looks like over time. I think matching detail that people should be able to understand as that story unfolds, and I think as we finish this work that we do with Charlie and we talk about what the next steps are expense-wise, that's a reasonable expectation from our team.","Matt O'Connor","Okay, thank you.","John Shrewsberry","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Long with Raymond James.","Allen Parker","Hi, David.","John Shrewsberry","Hi, David.","David Long","Good morning, everyone. Looking at your securities portfolio, what type of yield do you have rolling off the securities book this quarter, and then what are you looking at for reinvestment yield?","Allen Parker","Yes, I think in general we're reinvesting about 25 basis points down from what has been rolling off, and of course it depends on whether it's agency MBS, which is the bulk of our purchases. We also have some treasuries and agency debentures, and we have some structured products and other things, but on average, I think our purchases in Q3 were just North of a 3% yield and what's been rolling off from a coupon perspective has been high threes from a yield perspective has been not terribly different than 3%. So, in agency MBS in particular, I want to say that we're probably down, gosh, 25 to 25 plus basis points on a reinvestment rate basis.","David Long","Okay, got it. And then the second question I have relates to the potential future litigation losses and I know in the -- in your Q, you give the number and it seems to be rising in most course. Do you have that number? What the number may be here in the as of September 30?","Allen Parker","No, it'll keep -- the number will keep being refined until we file the Q, which will happen in a couple of weeks. So be on the lookout for that for the latest, which will include everything we know up until that day.","David Long","Got it. Thank you for taking my questions.","Allen Parker","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.","John Shrewsberry","Hi, Vivek.","Vivek Juneja","Hi. Hi, John. I thought let me just start with a question that either if you could respond to. So there was an issue that came up in the middle of the third quarter that the New York Times reported about accounts close that we were being charged fees after they were closed, can you give some color on this issue when it was discovered, a number of customers, what's involved? Were you on the timeline of all of this, and actually overarching why this even is coming up now?","Allen Parker","Vivek, thank you for the question, I guess what I would say is that at this point, there's really not any further information that we can give you with regard to that situation. We have obviously in response to the article that appeared gone back and looked at all our account closure information and we've been working very hard. closely with our regulatory agencies ever since then, we're at the point now where we're coming to some conclusions about what happened, but it would frankly be premature at this point for me to really give you any information in that regard, and we're taking a look at what happened. We're trying to determine the veracity of what was said in the New York Times. And perhaps most important, we're trying to determine whether we ought to make any changes at all with regard to the way that we've been conducting ourselves in that arena. I wish I could be more forthcoming in terms of information, but it's still in progress, and it's been an effort in which we've been engaged very closely with our regulators.","Vivek Juneja","You mean when you say conducting yourselves as in just the whole process of how it works, account closures et cetera or something else?","Allen Parker","Yes, the whole process of account closures is complicated in any financial institution because there are situations where people close their accounts voluntarily, whether they call a call center or they walk into a branch, and there are also situations where accounts have to be closed for legal or regulatory reasons, and there are a variety of considerations that go into how that's done, and we're going through very carefully and looking at all those considerations and coming to the conclusion as to the changes, if any, that we ought to make with respect to the way that we've handled ourselves in the past.","Vivek Juneja","Completely separate question for John. John, you mentioned about the promotional retail deposits. Are you completely stopping it? Are you just reducing the rates that you're offering by the amount of rate cuts that you've seen which is what several other players have done with their higher yield offerings?","John Shrewsberry","So there always be some level of promotional activities should reflect the market conditions that we're competing in both in terms of rates and terms. I think like a lot of people and with the expectation of lower rates shortening up initial terms, so that we are not overpaying for a longer period of time, they might have previously felt like it was necessary in a rising rate environment. So we've -- there's some of it in the third quarter, we've eased off on pricing, we've eased off on terms, but just like your firm, there will always be some amount of it to make sure that we're competitive market-by-market and to test and learn.","Vivek Juneja","All right. One last, if I may. You in the past have given us loans to non-depository financials outstanding. Could you give the number what that is this quarter?","John Shrewsberry","Let's see. I'm looking at the papers around me here. I don't think it's changed much during the course of the quarter. Yes, I don't know. We'll follow-up with you on that. There wasn't a meaningful move in that category during the course of the quarter, but I'm not having handy.","Vivek Juneja","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Compton with Morningstar.","Allen Parker","Hi, Eric.","Eric Compton","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So my first question is you made the comment that one of the areas of expenses that you expect to be helping you meet your full-year guidance is from that other professional fees line item, and I was just curious if you have any more color around why that might be dropping? What might be causing that, if that's related to perhaps progress on some of the risk and compliance spending and maybe taking some more or higher percentage of those activities in-house? Any more color on what's driving that?","John Shrewsberry","Yes, that's a good question. So some of it is definitely","having taken some of it in-house. The amount by which we're talking about it changing frankly isn't indicative of a giant pivot one way or the other; it's still a category that's too high. It represents both consulting type firms where we've been getting expertise as well as labor augmentation or staff augmentation, particularly in technology labor where we've been, we've been hiring people as contractors, where we haven't been able to hire as quickly as necessary. I think like all firms, there's a portion of our workforce in that area that is on contract. So with the shift in the fourth quarter is the current forecast just based on what's rolled on and what's rolled off and the current body of work, but there's still a lot of it going on. It's still a level that's too high, and as we roll forward and think about what efficient looks like, there's no doubt that that category coming down, substantially will be high on the list of sources in a more efficient state to be operating in.","Eric Compton","Okay, that's helpful, and then one last question. I appreciate it, if you don't want to comment on this too much, but just going back to the legal reserve estimate, understanding the official number will come out in the Q, but we had that $800 million jump and now we're getting that $1.6 billion charge or the jump in the high-end of the legal reserve estimate, and now the charge in the current quarter and just the operating losses, and just curious if there's any color on, do you get a sense we're starting to get more towards the light at the end of the tunnel when it comes to this? Should we start see this, the legal reserve estimates start to trend down? Is that your sense? Just any more color around, I guess, behind the scenes, what's going on there?","John Shrewsberry","As you preface to your question with we really can't provide anything in the way of color on this. As you know, we don't provide information as to the portion of our reserves that's applicable to any particular litigation or other items and with regard to the DOJ and SEC investigations that began in 2006, we really don't have any update beyond what we said in our prepared remarks and what we previously disclosed in our last quarter 10-Q, our discussions with the DOJ and SEC are ongoing and when we have more information to disclose, we'll of course do so.","Eric Compton","Absolutely, you said 2006 you meant 16?","John Shrewsberry","Yes, I'm sorry. There is nothing from 2006.","Allen Parker","Nothing from 2006, thankfully.","Eric Compton","Okay. And I appreciate it. Thanks for taking the questions.","Allen Parker","Sure. And while the next one is coming back, the number is $104 billion as of September 30 for the exposure, total exposure to non-bank financials.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS.","Saul Martinez","Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. Good morning. So I feel like hate to beat a dead horse with the NII, but I feel like either I'm taking the guidance to literally or missing something, but the outlook is still for NII to decline 6% on the reported basis and I guess $1.8 billion decline versus the first-half, it seems to suggest that the fourth quarter NII is roughly about $11 billion and even if you do a little bit better than that, it still implies in a pretty substantial declines in NII in NIM degradation, the fourth quarter versus the third quarter and everything a lot of what you said John, in terms of less incremental headwind from premium, deposit costs maybe starting to peak out and even reduce a little bit or fall a little bit next quarter. The piece to headwind from the purchase credit impaired PCI should start to moderate just because you're selling less of it at least on a sequential basis. It seems like that the balance sheet mix and re-pricing element is pretty pronounced to get there. So I guess what am I missing and is it really just that the impact of the rate cuts, the lower long end, is that pronounced in terms of the impact on asset yield?","John Shrewsberry","Well, I think at the asset side that's sort of fully reflecting re-pricing down. We talked about the deposit costs not being higher, probably being a little bit lower, and it gets you to the types of numbers that you described.","Saul Martinez","Okay.","John Shrewsberry","Very close.","Saul Martinez","Okay, but the math is right, I guess the math is right that 6% would be in the 11 billion or so range for the fourth quarter on a reported basis?","John Shrewsberry","That's right.","Saul Martinez","Okay, all right. I just wanted to be clear. So wanted to just maybe ask about a different topic and I apologize I was on a little bit late at Allen if you addressed it, but any update on where you stand on the consent order and remediating the operational risks and controls, and it seems like there's a lot of blocking and tackling there in terms of all of the processes that you're looking at identifying risk and controls and were appropriate remediating those. Can you just give us a sensing on, you know, regardless of what the Fed does and when they lift it, where you feel like you are in that process and do you feel like you need to get past that before you can really attack the cost structure in a meaningful way?","Allen Parker","Yes. Thanks. Let me start on that and I'll turn it out to John, I mean our conversation with our regulators are of course confidential supervisory information, but I can say that our engagement with the regulators has been very constructive and we're in constant dialogue with them on a number of fronts. As everybody recalls, several of the regulators made public statements earlier in the year in which they express their disappointment with the progress we've made up until that time. In response to that criticism, which of course we accepted over the last six months, we re-coupled our efforts with regard to trying to satisfy their expectations, and I made clear, I know Charlie will as well that the entire Wells Fargo team must continue to act assertively and decisively to meet the regulators expectations going forward.","With regard to the issues raised in the Fed consent order, the feedback that we are getting from the Fed on a constant basis is enabling us to continue to make progress in terms of responding to their expectations. We're a good ways down the road, but I think it's fair to say that we have a substantial amount of additional work to do and of course at the same time we've designed and implemented and we're constantly working -- doing enhance our new risk management framework, and that's fundamentally transforming how we manage risk every day throughout the organization in a way that I would describe as much more comprehensive integrated and consistent, and at the same time, we're enhancing frontline risk, independent risk management and the audit function. So that we can ensure multiple layers of review and better visibility into issues as they emerge, and obviously the goal of all this is to prevent the occurrence of the kinds of issues that we had in the past. And as John alluded to before, we're also emphasizing operational excellence throughout the company. Our biggest focus there is on business process management in an effort to try to deliver greater consistency.","So I guess what I will say, and I'll turn it over to John to talk about some of the financial impacts. There is a great deal of work to do to meet the expectations of our regulators. They're appropriately high, but we're committed to completing that work. We're working very hard and we're confident that we'll be able to complete the work in a manner that's timely and just as important up to the highest standards of professionalism and durability going forward.","John Shrewsberry","Yes. And so, to the second part of your question, so we've had these efficiency programs in place for the last few years, which began before this biggest push in response to the Fed consent order and some other regulatory feedback, but through that process, we've got hundreds of programs that have gone activity-by-activity and said about taking unnecessary costs out, and then at the same time we've embarked on this getting it right from an operational risk, compliance, governance perspective, including all of the enabling technology, which is where all this money is being reinvested.","So, as I mentioned earlier on this call, the big opportunity once Wells Fargo both internally and from a regulatory perspective has chin the bar for being excellent at operational risk, compliance, and governance overall like that we believe that we are in credit risk and some other areas, is a massive simplification because as we go down this business process management path, we inventory and uncover the fact that we do just about everything we do in many different ways, and there is a huge opportunity to compress that to get more consistent. It improves the customer experience, the team member experience. It's easier to control. It's easier to automate, and it's much less expensive to deliver, and I think from an investor perspective, it's important to know that we are fixing our status quo Wells Fargo the way that our individual processes have currently operate and then there is the opportunity to re-engineer.","Now that may look different after we have sat down and done a complete strategic review with Charlie, but it is how the team has set about doing the business or doing the remediation that's necessary to improve the company today starting with the way things are done today, but there is from my perspective an extraordinary efficiency opportunity in modernizing that.","Saul Martinez","Great. That's really helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your final question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","John Shrewsberry","Hi, Betsy.","Betsy Graseck","Hi, good morning. Two quick questions, one just on MSR revaluation, I mean I realized that there was some pre pays in the quarter, and I know that you guys are really good estimating that. So just wondering if there was something else? Or, was it just a more violent movement expected? And is it a onetime in your opinion that it's not going to pop back up I would expect, but just wanted to get your understanding on that?","John Shrewsberry","Yes. Well, it was a bigger move than was expected, and I am always -- I am reluctant to say that it could never happen again, but the way we estimate the customer response to their in the moneyness for a refinance given what we know about -- what type of cohort they are following is the basis of how we estimate that, and it happens -- it's been happening at a faster pace, and so we think we have captured that in this valuation adjustment.","Betsy Graseck","Okay, and then on the auto lending side, I know you highlighted that the reconfiguration, restructuring of that business is now finish, and we saw some really strong results this quarter with originations up. What was it, 9% linked quarter? Do you feel like it's the start of the rebalancing of that auto business? Is this is a run rate that you think you can keep for the - I don't know foreseeable future? I am just trying to get a sense of the sizing of the auto book that you think you can get back to post this restructuring of that business?","John Shrewsberry","Yes, my sense is that if we still liked the risk reward, so if consumer credit stays about where it is and if used car value stay about where they are, that there is an opportunity for us to grow further. So as I mentioned, the growth that we have gotten so far is really by doing more in the same upper rationale on credit tiers, and we previously ran the business with -- including little bit more in the -- at least in the non-prime category, and my sense is that we will probably begin to do that too over the course of the next couple of quarters. We are easing into it, but I don't think of this uptick as aberrant, and I think that there is more to do.","Betsy Graseck","Okay, thanks.","John Shrewsberry","Yes.","Allen Parker","Let me close our call by thanking all of you for your questions and for joining our third quarter conference call. As always, I would also like to thank all our team members for their hard work, dedication, and enthusiasm. Best regards to you all. Take care.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you all for joining.

I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Rowe, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Rowe, you may begin your conference.","Jim Rowe","Thank you, Regina. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today, during which our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf; and our CFO, Tim Sloan, will review fourth quarter results and answer your questions. ","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our fourth quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement. ","Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our website at wellsfargo.com. ","I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf.","John G. Stumpf","Thank you, Jim. Good morning. Happy new year, and thanks for joining us today. A year ago, we were excited about all the opportunities we had ahead of us, even in a challenging economic environment, and I couldn't be more pleased with all that we accomplished in 2011. We earned a record $15.9 billion, up 28% from 2010. We grew deposits by $72 billion, up 9%. We grew loans by $12 billion and grew our core loan portfolio by $33 billion. We achieved record retail banking cross-sell of 5.9 products per household. We improved credit quality with net charge-offs down 36% from a year ago. We began our expense initiative and remained focus on our target of $11 billion in noninterest expense in the fourth quarter of this year, 2012. We grew ROA by 24 basis points and increased ROE by 160 basis points. And we remain committed to helping homeowners stay in their homes, with over 720,000 active or completed loan modifications initiated since the beginning of 2009. ","We also increased capital levels while providing shareholders with a higher return on their investment by increasing our dividend and repurchasing 86 million shares of common stock. We also redeemed $9.2 billion of high-cost trust preferred securities. We accomplished all of this while completing the conversion of Wachovia's retail banking stores, the largest conversion in banking history. Our 6,239 retail banking stores are now on a single platform, serving customers coast to coast. In most mergers in financial services, customer service typically declines, but our team members remain committed to providing outstanding customer service as reflected in Wells Fargo, once again, ranking #1 in customer satisfaction among large banks based on a national survey. ","2011 was a remarkable year, but I'm even more excited about the opportunities that lie ahead as we enter 2012 as One Wells Fargo. We have submitted our board-approved capital plan to the Fed, and we are focused on returning even more capital to our shareholders. We remain focused on better serving our existing customers and welcoming new customers as we grow market share, both organically and through acquisitions. And we remain committed to strengthening the overall economy by lending to our business customers to fund growth and create jobs, by helping homeowners stay in their homes through participating in Home Preservation Workshops and loan modifications and by being active volunteers in the communities where we live and where we work. The vision -- this vision has guided us for decades, meeting our customers' financial needs, will continue to drive our growth in the year ahead. ","Let me now turn this over to Tim Sloan for more detail on our financial results. Tim?","Timothy J. Sloan","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. My remarks will follow the presentation included in the first half of the quarterly supplement starting on Page 2. John and I will then take your questions. ","As John highlighted, we achieved outstanding results in 2011, including a very strong fourth quarter. We generated record earnings of $4.1 billion, up 1% from the third quarter and up 20% from a year ago. Earnings per share were a record $0.73, also up 1% from last quarter and 20% from a year ago. This is the eighth consecutive quarter of EPS growth. In fact, by almost any measure, our results in the fourth quarter moved in the right direction, demonstrating the underlying strength of our diversified franchise. We had linked quarter growth in revenue with growth in both net interest income and noninterest income. We had higher pretax pre-provision profits, loans, deposits and securities available for sale. We also had strong credit quality, and our capital levels continue to grow. ","On Page 3, we highlight our continued strong diversification, which is a major differentiator for Wells Fargo and is a key driver of our ability to generate growth over time and through various economic cycles and interest rate environments. Let me start with a few highlights of the drivers behind our balance sheet and income statement growth, and I'll add more detail later in my remarks. ","Starting with the balance sheet. We generated strong loan growth this quarter with loans up $9.5 billion. Our core loan portfolio, which excludes the planned runoff from the liquidating portfolio, was up $13.7 billion from the third quarter. We, once again, purchased securities this quarter with balances up $15.4 billion from the third quarter as we continue to redeploy cash. We also generated strong deposit growth with balances up $24.6 billion. ","Now let's turn to the income statement. Revenue grew by 5% from the third quarter, driven by strong loan growth and deposit growth, as well as fee growth throughout our diversified businesses. Expenses increased as expected in the fourth quarter, but we are still targeting $11 billion in noninterest expense in the fourth quarter of 2012. ","Let me now cover our results in more detail. As shown on Page 6, period-end loans were up $9.5 billion from the third quarter, our third consecutive quarter of loan growth, while we continue to reduce the size of our liquidating portfolio. Excluding the runoff of $4.2 billion of liquidating loans, our core loans grew by $13.7 billion, including organic loan growth of $6 billion. ","Commercial loans grew $5.6 billion, driven by portfolio acquisitions, new loans and new customer activity. Loan growth in the fourth quarter included the purchase of $2.1 billion of U.S.-based commercial real estate loans. We have purchased several portfolios over the past few quarters, which reflect our ability to capitalize in the opportunities generated in this business environment and provide attractive returns for our shareholders. While we have -- while we already have relationships with many of these customers, these portfolio purchases also provide us with new customers that we hope to do more business with in the future. ","Consumer loans also grew this quarter, up $3.9 billion from the third quarter, driven by the reconsolidation of $5.6 billion of reverse mortgage loans and was reduced by the runoff of $3.6 billion of liquidating consumer loans. We had loan growth in our core auto portfolio. Our credit card portfolio growth reflected strong account growth and seasonality. We believe we're well positioned to grow loans organically and through acquisitions, and we expect loan growth to continue. ","We also continue to generate strong deposit growth, with average deposits up $29.5 billion from the third quarter and up $74 billion or 9% from a year ago. Average core checking and savings deposits grew $30.9 billion or 4% from the third quarter and were up 12% from a year ago. Consumer checking accounts were up 3.2% from a year ago. We achieved this growth while continuing to bring down our deposit cost, which were 22 basis points in the fourth quarter, down 3 basis points from the third quarter and down 9 basis points from a year ago. We have grown deposits while reducing our deposit cost for 5 consecutive quarters. ","Tax equivalent net interest income increased $369 million from the third quarter, benefiting from a $24 billion increase in average earning assets and a 5 basis point increase in net interest margin. Earning asset growth this quarter was broad based, with increases in loans, securities and mortgages held for sale. We funded the growth in these assets by continuing to successfully attract low-cost deposits and by reducing cash and other short-term investments. ","The balance sheet continue to reprice in this low-rate environment but we were able to offset that through pricing discipline, including a 4 -basis point decline in interest-bearing deposit cost and reducing long-term debt by $10 billion in the fourth quarter.  ","Noninterest income increased $627 million from the third quarter or 7%. This growth was driven by an increase in mortgage banking revenue of $531 million, up 29% from the third quarter, driven by higher margins and strong originations. Originations increased $31 billion or 35% from the third quarter. The unclosed mortgage pipeline remained very strong at $72 billion at quarter end. Trading, debt and equity gains were up $337 million from the third quarter. Linked quarter growth in trading gains benefited from $275 million of higher deferred compensation plan investment results, which is offset in expense, and stronger core customer accommodation trading. The linked quarter comparison also benefits because you recall that the third quarter included a loss from resolving one legacy Wachovia position. Noninterest income also benefited from $153 million gain on the sale of H.D. Vest in the fourth quarter. ","Credit card fees were down $333 million from the third quarter, reflecting the first quarter of lower debit interchange fees, which reduced debit card fees by $365 million in the fourth quarter. Card fees benefited this quarter from strong growth in consumer credit cards, with new account growth up 6% from the third quarter and up 90% from the fourth quarter of 2010, driven by very strong growth in the east. ","Noninterest expense increased 7% from the third quarter. We highlighted on the call last quarter that we expected expenses to increase in the fourth quarter. Let me walk you through the drivers of the increase on Slide 11. ","Third quarter expenses included a $210 million benefit due to lower deferred compensation expenses, and the fourth quarter had a net deferred compensation expense of $56 million. These 2 amounts increased fourth quarter expenses by $266 million compared to the third quarter. After adjusting for this amount, the remaining increase in expenses were driven by 3 primary factors. First, mortgage and capital markets personnel expense increased approximately $300 million, driven by higher revenue in the third -- in the quarter, which is largely reflected in higher incentive compensation. Secondly, we have seasonally higher equipment cost and higher foreclosed asset expense. Combined, these increased expenses by approximately $200 million. Finally, we had approximately $100 million of higher cost associated with the mortgage servicing regulatory consent order. ","We currently expect first quarter expenses to remain elevated, driven by seasonally higher comp and benefit expenses and, our final quarter, Wachovia integration expenses, but partially offset by continued gains from our expense initiatives. In the second quarter of 2012, we expect expenses will decline by $500 million to $700 million from the first quarter, driven by the elimination of merger expenses and lower comp and benefit expenses, which as I just mentioned, will be seasonally higher in the first quarter. ","Our expenses in 2012 will reflect the benefit from our expense initiative, and we continue to target noninterest expenses declining to $11 billion in the fourth quarter of 2012. We expect to capture most of the savings through the consolidation of consumer lending businesses, combining staff functions and technology groups, moderation of cyclically high mortgage costs, including loss remediation and simplifying customer interaction to improve service and efficiencies. ","Turning briefly to our segment results starting on Page 13. Community Banking earned $2.5 billion, up 8% from the third quarter, driven by stronger mortgage banking revenue. Sales trends remain strong. Core product sales in the West were $7.6 million, up 9% from the prior year, and core product sales in the East continue to grow by double digits. Retail Banking cross-sell continue to grow to a record 5.92 products per household, up from 5.7 a year ago. And while cross-sell in the East continue to grow to 5.43, there is still plenty of opportunity to further increase cross-sell to the 6.29 products per household in the West. ","Wholesale Banking earned $1.6 billion, down $172 million from the third quarter, reflecting lower loan loss reserve release. Revenue increased 5% from the third quarter as many businesses, including commercial real estate, banking, government banking and international, generated strong loan and deposit growth, and fixed income sales and trading and investment banking results benefited from improved market conditions. Wholesale Banking continued to generate strong broad-based loan growth from both new and existing customers, with average loans up $11.4 billion or 4% from the third quarter. This growth reflects the purchase of $2.1 billion of U.S.-based commercial real estate loans, as well as growth across from all portfolios, including: commercial banking, which has grown loan for 17 consecutive months; international; commercial real estate; capital finance; asset-backed finance; government banking; and corporate banking. Average core deposits increased $14 billion from the third quarter, up 7% and are up $38 billion or 21% from a year ago. Wholesale Banking businesses continue to increase market share, including our investment banking market share growing from 4.2% in 2010 to 5.1% in 2011. ","Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement earned $325 million, up 12% from the third quarter. This growth was driven by a 6% increase in revenue. Revenue benefited from the $153 million gain on the sale of H.D. Vest and $59 million of deferred compensation plan investment gains compared to $128 million loss in the third quarter. Excluding these items, revenue was down 5% on lower asset-based fees, retail brokerage transaction revenue and securities gains. Average core deposits increased $3.2 billion, up 2% from the third quarter, reflecting both the flight to quality and our continued success in attracting client assets, including deposits. Managed account assets were up 7% from the third quarter, driven by strong net inflows. Since managed account asset fees are priced on a quarterly lag, first quarter revenue will benefit from the improved fourth quarter markets. Our continued focus on meeting our customers' financial needs is reflected in achieving a record cross-sell of over 10 products per WBR household. ","Our credit quality remains strong in the quarter as shown on Page 16. Net charge-offs were stable from the third quarter and down 51% from the peak in the fourth quarter of 2009. We remain pleased with how our loan portfolios are performing, and we expect them to continue to improve in 2012. Reflecting our continued improvement in credit quality, we had a $600 million reserve release in the fourth quarter. Absent a significant deterioration in the economy, we continue to expect future reserve releases in 2012. ","Nonperforming assets continue to decline, down $879 million from the third quarter, reflecting a $596 million decline in nonaccrual loans driven by a lower commercial real estate non-accruals and a $283 million decrease in foreclosed assets. Loans 90 days or more past due were up modestly, $119 million, while early stage retail delinquency balances were stable, with rates up modestly on lower loan balances. ","On Page 18, we highlight what we believe our mortgage servicing portfolio is the best in the industry. The majority of our $1.8 trillion residential servicing portfolio, or 69%, is serviced through the agencies. Our private securitizations where we originated the loans are very -- are a very low portion of our total portfolio. ","Reflecting the quality of our portfolio, our delinquency and foreclosure rate was over 400 basis points lower than the industry average, excluding Wells Fargo, based on the most recent publicly available data. Our total delinquency and foreclosure rate was 7.96% in the fourth quarter, down from a peak of 8.96% in the fourth quarter of 2009 but up modestly from the third quarter due to seasonality. Total repurchase demands were stable compared to the third quarter and went down approximately 31% from a year ago. ","As shown on Page 20, our capital position continue to improve, with our Tier 1 common equity ratio increasing to 9.46% and our estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio under current Basel III proposals growing to 7.49%. We redeemed $5.8 billion of trust preferred securities in the fourth quarter, with a weighted average coupon of 8.42%. We purchased 26.6 million shares in the fourth quarter and an additional estimated 5.6 million shares through a full repurchase transaction that will settle in the first quarter of 2012. As John mentioned at the beginning of the call, we submitted our capital plan earlier this month, and we expect to response no later than March 15. We have a great story to tell, reflecting the performance of our diversified model and the strength of our balance sheet. We remain focused on returning more capital to our shareholders as we continue to grow our capital levels. ","In summary, our strong fourth quarter and full year 2011 results reflected the benefit of our diversified model, which provides us with many opportunities for growth. In the fourth quarter, we grew earnings, revenue, loans, deposits and capital with strong contributions throughout our consumer and commercial businesses. As we begin the new year, we're encouraged by the signs the U.S. economy is doing better, and we believe Wells Fargo is in a unique position to further benefit from the opportunities that drove a record performance in 2011. ","I will now open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","If I could just focus on the net interest margin percent and net interest income dollars to start. Last quarter, the market was disappointed in the NIM percent, specifically. You guys probably had one of the worst NIMs last quarter. It seems like this quarter, you'll probably have one of the best ones. And I appreciate there's a lot of moving pieces. But as you look forward, maybe you can give some insight on how you think the NIM percent and the net interest income dollars will trend from here and if we can expect similar volatility to what we've seen.","John G. Stumpf","Matt, you focused on the fact that it's difficult to look at the NIM on a quarterly basis and there can be some volatility quarter-to-quarter, so I don't want to provide any specific guidance on the NIM. But as we've said, generally, we think that the NIM is trending down a bit given that the -- that rates are lower. However, as you pointed out, our net interest income was up, and the reason that net interest income was up was because we were able to grow loans and continue to invest in high-quality securities.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And I guess as a follow-up on that, as I think about the loans that are running off and the loans that you're purchasing, they're starting to converge a little bit in terms of magnitude, meaning just the runoff is less of a drag from -- or so far. Now going forward, there have obviously been some portfolios in the news since speculation of you bidding on some, but what do you think the opportunity is for additional loan purchases from here? And maybe some comment on how those yields compared to what's running off.","John G. Stumpf","Matt, we are taking lots of tires. We are in a unique position that we're not capital constrained. We can do things that make good sense for us economically for our stockholders. As you know, and you know, Wells Fargo well, we are cautious. It have to make a lot of sense for us. And if all we get out of this is sore toes, that's fine also, but there -- because we don't have to do something. But the deals we've done so far, we like a lot. It brings customers. It brings earning assets. And of course, we're not going to do these things unless they're good economically for us. So that's just one of the opportunities we have going forward, and I suspect we'll see more things. And again, if we do some, they'll be done at the right way. If we don't do any, that's also fine.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And how did the yields compare? You show us the runoff portfolio yields, but how about the loans that you're purchasing and might be looking at. How do those yields compared to what's running off?","John G. Stumpf","Well, there -- these are attractive IRRs. We wouldn't do them unless that'd be the case.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","One follow-up on Matt's question on liquidity. Tim, maybe just a little bit of color of what led you to deploy liquidity this quarter and into what did you deploy that. And do you still feel like you're sitting on excess liquidity? And what will drive the pace at which you further deploy the liquidity you have?","Timothy J. Sloan","Sure. As you know, the first call on our liquidity at any time is going to be for loans. And we had good loan growth this quarter both organically and through acquisitions, which we're excited about. When you look at our investments in the securities portfolio, there really weren't a whole lot different than what we looked at in the third quarter. The timing was a little bit different, because you recall, in the third quarter, there was a lot of volatility that occurred in a good portion of the third quarter. So we invested, more or less, ratably across the quarter, which is a good thing. We really didn't change the complexion of the securities portfolio. We continue to invest in high-quality assets across duration -- the duration of the portfolio didn't significant change. As to your last question about capacity, one of the great things about the company is that we're continuing to grow deposits. And we feel like we've got -- have more than ample liquidity to continue to grow and service our existing customers, maybe look at some acquisitions, as John mentioned, and continue to invest in the securities portfolio.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then on expenses. Can you talk a little bit more color about the drivers of the decline that you expect in the second quarter? Specifically, first, the merger integration expenses will stop in the second quarter, will those stop for good? And then also in the personnel decline that you're talking about in the second quarter, is that seasonal, the mortgage banking, or is this some of the consolidation of functions that you're doing? Can you give a little more color there?","Timothy J. Sloan","Sure. So if you go back to Slide 11, I think that the first -- I'm sorry, Slide 12. The first part of the question relates to the integration, and the integration expenses will be over in the first quarter. So we won't be talking about them again after first quarter. So that's number one. Number two, the incentive compensation and expenses and employee comp in the first quarter is more seasonal. It's not necessarily cyclical. It's not necessarily tied to any business. It's just in the first quarter, you tend to have more incentive comp and in terms of when you recognize it, as well as the fact that you might recognize payroll taxes at a higher rate in the first quarter.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And if you're going to walk us down from second quarter down to the fourth quarter, where you hope to get to $11 billion, the drivers of that would be the other things on this table on Page 12?","Timothy J. Sloan","Correct. And again, to reiterate, we feel good about being able to see the expenses decline from the first to the second quarter by $500 million to $700 million, which takes us a long way to get to that $11 billion.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And the last thing for me is on share repurchases. The forward contract that you entered for the first quarter of $5.6 million, is that the entirety of what you're approved for this quarter? Or you have approval to do additional open market purchases in the first quarter beyond that?","Timothy J. Sloan","Yes. Matt, I'm not going to comment on any specifics of the capital plan from last year, as well as what we submitted for this year.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, okay. You just said that you hope to do more in 2012. I guess you said that already, Tim.","John G. Stumpf","That's correct. Yes, more is more as I said before. And our shareholders have been very patient, and we'll have to just wait until the 15th of March.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Erika Penala with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Could you give us a sense of what you think on the -- in terms of mitigating some of the Durbin headwind, on what you could accomplish with regards to implementing deposit fees in 2012?","John G. Stumpf","Well, Erika, we have talked a lot about the fact that, in most cases, our customers pay for all the convenience we offer them through more products and services with us, and that's always been the case around here. And in fact, if you look at the hit we took in the fourth quarter, now that the debit interchange number is all through that, it was actually a little less than the $2.50 after tax that we have talked about because we're doing more business. And we actually have more accounts now. So -- but we're always looking at ways to tighten our belt, offer more value, look at ways that customers how they want to pay us for the services we provide, and that's an ongoing process.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And I hear the message loud and clear, in terms of not answering any questions about what was submitted to the regulators with regard to your capital plan. But I have a timing question. I'm wondering if there are opportunities that are more sizable for M&A that could be coming out of Europe or even in the U.S. Does the fact that you're not going to get an answer from the Fed until March 15 deter you from doing anything between now and then?","John G. Stumpf","There was some background noise during the question, so people put their phones on mute. That would be great while they're not speaking. But anyway, we have -- as I mentioned, we continue to kick tires. We're looking at things, and we'll do that. We're doing that continuously. But again, we're cautious. We don't had to do anything. If we do something, it will be a bolt-on business or it'd be an add to something we're doing right now, either in terms of capability or capacity or new customers. And that'll continue even during this process.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","But just to follow-up and clarify. The fact that the capital plan is outstanding for approval doesn't impact your ability to make an announcement before March 15, in terms of any M&A.","Timothy J. Sloan","No, it doesn't.","John G. Stumpf","No, it does not.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Real quick on the -- it looks like you grew your residential loans by $6 billion, looking at the average balance sheet. If I'm incorrect, can you tell me what did you grow it by? And if you did, was that a change of policy? It's the first time we've seen some material growth in that residential portfolios.","Timothy J. Sloan","Well, Paul, we did reconsolidate $5.6 billion of reverse mortgages that we have previously sold, based upon some clarifying guidance that SEC provided to the entire industry. So that was the primary driver for the growth in the residential loan line this quarter.","John G. Stumpf","The economics stay the same, Paul, but that -- it's more of an accounting.","Timothy J. Sloan","We earn a servicing fee that loans continue to be insured by the FHA, so it was more of accounting transaction than anything.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay, okay. And real quick on the HAMP program that was announced over the quarter, do you think that's going to be material? Are you guys at all, or do you think there's still too many roadblocks for that program to have any impact at all in the mortgage market? Not the HAMP part, the HARP.","John G. Stumpf","Yes. You're talking about the HARP 2?","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Yes, HARP 2.","John G. Stumpf","Yes, there's going to be some customers, and we're ramping up. We're going to be helping them, and it's hard to say today how many and so forth. But we're eager to help customers who have 7% and 8% coupons refinanced down to 4%, notwithstanding their loan-to-value issue, which has been the issue. But again, it's hard for me to predict how big that will be. Incidentally with HARP 1, we've been doing a lot of those. This is -- kind of takes it above the 1.25 or whatever the number is. So we'll catch up to you in there, but I don't -- this is not going to be a refinance boom equal to 2003, for example. I mean, a lot of -- there's been a lot of refinancing going on. But there are some customers there, and we're eager to help them.","Timothy J. Sloan","Yes. Paul, I think the administration set an expectation of about 1 million mortgages as part of this program, and that seems about right to us.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And then we've seen a lot of turmoil come out of Fannie and Freddie recently, a lot of a political fallout from their high salary. We just saw Williams just stepped down. Are you seeing -- I mean, is -- do you -- how -- do you think it is a negative for Fannie and Freddie going forward, or you don't think it's really -- it's business as usual out there?","John G. Stumpf","Well, I don't know that I focus on that. I mean, we're focused on helping customers. And whatever happens with Fannie and Freddie, I mean, we're getting support and approvals that we need. Of course, you know there's been a small increase in the GPs. That probably affects things more than what's happening at Fannie and Freddie's management levels.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ed Najarian with ISI Group.","Edward R. Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, just 2 quick questions. Tim, I appreciate no sort of forecast for the net interest margin, but do you mind going over some of the big pieces that you see in terms of your ongoing ability to reduce funding cost, like more TRUPs redemptions, long-term debt, lower deposit cost? Could you just sort of remind us how you sort of think about the opportunity remain?","Timothy J. Sloan","Well, let's -- sure. Let's start in reverse order. I think, first, on lower deposit costs. I mean, the team has done a terrific job over the last couple years of reducing deposit costs. And given where rates are today, we think that there's still more room to reduce deposit cost. Specifically what that -- the number is, I don't know on a quarterly basis. But if you've seen the last couple of quarters, it's been pretty consistent. And so we're optimistic that we'll continue to make progress even as we grow deposits, which is pretty important. I think if we were reducing deposit across and not growing deposits, that would probably not be a good thing. In terms of the TRUPs, we had a -- or we called about 7 -- or we have about $7.5 billion that are still outstanding and $2.7 billion have a call date in 2012, right. Beyond that, I don't want to provide any specific guidance about the TRUPs. That's part of our capital plan submission, so we'll leave it at that. In terms of long-term debt, we think that we've done a nice job of reducing overall debt. I think, over time, in our overall debt over the last 3 years, I think it's down 53%, which is really good results. But I think, over time, you'll probably see us be a little bit more active in the market as opposed to continuing to decrease long-term debt. But I do think, given where rates and spreads are, that we can reduce our overall debt cost even if we do have to raise some debt in the future.","Edward R. Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then is there a portion of noninterest-bearing deposits that we should think about maybe going away in 2012 because of escrow deposits related to the very strong mortgage origination quarter?","Timothy J. Sloan","Well, escrow deposits were up, I think, slightly. Actually, I can't recall the specific number off the top of my head...","John G. Stumpf","Around $35 billion.","Timothy J. Sloan","But they were up a bit. And that's really reflective of what's going on in the mortgage market. Certainly, if the mortgage market continues to be a strong as it is right now, they'll be the same as the mortgage market comes down a bit. Escrows will be down. But those are the only deposits I will look at as being concerned about, non-interest-bearing deposits being concerned about moving away based upon what's going on in the economy.","Edward R. Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then finally, sort of mixed trends on the linked quarter credit quality improvement. We saw delinquencies tick up a bit. Could you put a little more color around your thoughts? You mentioned that you thought you expected more reserve release in 2012. I don't really expect you to quantify that but maybe that thought in conjunction with sort of the trends we saw in credit metrics this quarter.","Timothy J. Sloan","Yes. That's a fair question. Overall, we were very pleased with credit. We continue to have very strong credit. Where we are right now is consistent with the expectations that we've been talking about for the last couple of quarters and consistent with what we're seeing at this part of the credit cycle. NPAs were down almost $900 million on a link quarter basis. That was very nice progress. Charge-offs were stable. Retail delinquencies, 30-plus delinquencies, were normally up and in the fourth quarter due to seasonality and they were stable this quarter, so we're pleased about that. It's an item that we've all forgotten about but our PCI loans continue to perform better than what our expectations. Now almost $4 billion better than our original projections and that we still have 27.5% coverage in terms of the non-accretable on the PCI. So we continue to feel good on credit. Our expectation is that credit will continue to improve throughout this year. It's not going to improve at the same -- we don't think it will improve at the same rate as what we saw over the last couple of years but we'll continue to see improvement. And again, as you mentioned and I'll reiterate it, I think the fact of the matter is that our loan loss reserve release are likely to continue this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Todd Hagerman with Sterne Agee.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Just a follow-up on the last question. Just how should we -- Tim, with your outlook on credit and again, just you look at the kind of the stabilizing trends that we've seen in the last couple of quarters, if I think about the loan loss release and your expectations, how is the housing market kind of factored into the equation and the consumer in particular as you guys look out the next 12 to 18 months?","Timothy J. Sloan","Well, the housing market clearly is factored into how we think about our loan loss reserve. And to the extent that the housing market gets better, that's a good thing; if it gets worse, it's a bad thing. But the primary driver in terms of consumer delinquencies and losses is jobs. That's the primary focus from our perspective in terms of the portfolio. But again, at this point in the cycle, where we've had a lot of improvement and the economy is growing but growing very slowly, it's not a surprise that we've seen a couple of quarters of reduced improvement. But remember, even in this quarter, our consumer losses were down, which we're pretty pleased with.","John G. Stumpf","Yes, and think of it this way. Since 2008, underwriting in some of these portfolios have changed. So all of a sudden, you have 8 and 9 and 10 and 11, that becomes a more substantial part of your portfolio. And if you look at our delinquencies on residential real estate and you look at how well we're doing in commercial, I couldn't be happy with our progress on credit.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I guess, what I'm getting at is just in terms of the embedded reserve and granted your coverage ratios are very strong. But I guess what I'm driving at is kind of the embedded or assumptions in terms of home price decline, unemployment, that sort of thing in terms of, as you factor into your outlook on credit.","John G. Stumpf","Well, that's all factored in there. I mean, we look at that. We consider that. We obviously have a -- we stressed these portfolios and we look at indicators. And as Tim mentioned, on the consumer side, where you typically see a seasonal run-up in consumer delinquency, we didn't. So that bodes well for the future.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then if I could just real quickly switching gears, just on the mortgage side. The reps and warranties cost ticked up a little bit in the quarter. Can you just talk about kind of just, again, the trends that you're seeing? Is that something that should be, is it going to be fairly lumpy? Is it something specific more with Fannie versus Freddie in the quarter in terms of the earlier stage delinquency buckets, if you would? Just kind of trying to get a gauge on what your expectations, what happened in the quarter?","Timothy J. Sloan","Actually, the fourth quarter results in terms of the mortgage repurchase reserve were pretty stable. Total demands outstanding both in terms of the number and the balance were stable in the fourth quarter and recall they're down over 30% from the prior year. The new demands that we saw for the '06 to '08 vintages are still up as John said, that was the vintages that are most problematic. But again for us, relative to the rest of the industry, it's less than an issue. But they were up for Fannie, that's been consistent now for about 3 quarters. Freddie was still within our expectations. But again, it's important to note that our realized losses were $272 million, which were down in the fourth quarter from $384 million in the third quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Foran with Nomura.","Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","On the FHA insured loans that are 90 days more past due and still accruing, I recognize the risk really is on your balance sheet but can you just talk about the trends? They seem to be bouncing around between $14 billion and $15 billion up until the middle of this year, and then there's been a pretty significant ramp over the past 6 months. Is that timing or is that deterioration of FHA loans overall? And as a follow-up, is there any signs that there could be risk to the banking industry of the FHA potentially putting some of these losses to the banks?","Timothy J. Sloan","Well, let me jump on the first part of your question and I'll let John answer the last. I think that what you're seeing is the fact that we're a very large mortgage lender in this country and that our volumes are up and our market share is up. So it's understandable that because our FHA\/VA origination volume has increased since the end of 2008, that there's going to be a natural increase in delinquency. If you look at the performance of these mortgages relative to what we've seen in history, they're not performing any, they're actually performing better than what we've seen historically, it's just that we're a bigger lender. And as you point out, these continue to be guaranteed by FHA\/VA. John, I don't know if you have any comments about FHA and VA.","John G. Stumpf","Yes. We've not seen any change in how they handle their guarantees and their situations. So I have nothing to report on that.","Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Fair enough and a separate question. I guess ambitions in capital markets and retail brokerage and specifically, a lot of things are coming to market as other banks are forced to deleverage and as some of the wholesale business models come under pressure. How do you think about the trade-off between organic growth in those areas versus any pockets where acquisitions might make more sense?","John G. Stumpf","As I mentioned in either my formal comments or just made a few minutes ago, we're taking tiers. We're taking lots of tiers and our use of capital on the acquisition side will be for businesses that are bolt on to existing areas of expertise that we have and you've seen that recently, where we did a couple things with Irish assets here in the U.S. It will be places where we can either add skill or scale for customers. And it will, and think of things starting with customers. That's kind of who we are. So, and if we do, like I mentioned, if we do some things, it will be done right, the right price, it will be compelling for our stockholders. If we can't find those things, we won't do them. So it's really that simple.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Mutascio with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Christopher M. Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Tim, I had a quick question, just follow up on the securities portfolio. I mean, I know you said that you bought throughout the quarter but there's still a pretty big difference between the end of period balances and the average balances for the available for sale. Should I suspect to see the average balances on the available for sale to catch up to the end of period balances in the first quarter? It's about a $20 billion difference between the 2 right now.","Timothy J. Sloan","Chris, that may be the case. Again, it take some time. When you look at the quarterly numbers, you can get a little bit of distortion. But yes, I think that it's more likely that they'll catch up than not.","Christopher M. Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And similar to that, on the trading side, your trading assets on an end of period basis were roughly, what, $77 billion or so and even running in more in the mid-50s. Is that $77 billion a decent run rate going forward in 2012 or that line item?","Timothy J. Sloan","Yes, I don't think so. I think -- it's a good question though. The primary driver for the increase was that we had some conforming mortgage production, agency conforming mortgage production that we decided to hold over through the end of the year because we thought we could get a better execution in the first part of 2012. Because the production had already been securitized just by accounting definitions, it had to be classified as a trading asset. We've now -- and it was about $20 billion as you point out. About $19 billion of that $20 billion is already settled and we'll settle the remaining one sometime this week. So I would not look at that increase in the $77 billion as the run rate in the future.","Christopher M. Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So there's no economic gain in the first quarter with the $19 billion removal from trading assets?","Timothy J. Sloan","There was just a modest positive impact in the fourth quarter. There will be a gain in the first quarter but it's not significant to the company. We just thought we could get a better execution.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","First question on loan utilization and commercial and industrial loans. Has that picked up or is this really acquisitions and market share gains?","John G. Stumpf","It's acquisitions and market share gain. We've seen nothing really -- just very, very modest. It didn't account for much.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","So this commercial loan growth that we're seeing in the industry, why are we seeing it if there's not that natural demand?","John G. Stumpf","Well, first of all, there's fewer players that are sharing it. And we have more people on the street and an offering that includes not only loans but other things that help customers succeed, so. And we're not capital constrained. At least we have that escape for us.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And you didn't mention Europe, to the extent that there's opportunities there?","John G. Stumpf","You mean to buy in Europe or to buy...","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Market share gains.","John G. Stumpf","Well, we're -- 98% of our revenues come from the United States, 98% of our people are here. We're really focused on -- there's so much growth and so much opportunity here. I mean, I wouldn't rule out -- I never say never in anything. But I can tell you, we are really focused on serving our domestic customers now that we have Wachovia integrated. And surely we help individuals and companies as they do business overseas and vice versa. But our focus is really, our primary focus I should put it that way, is domestic.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","So how does the European crisis impact you if at all? Is it a nonevent or you -- how could impact you?","John G. Stumpf","Well, it impacts us as foreign banks, especially European banks, are trying to solve for their capital requirements. And they are, as you've seen, offering assets and businesses for sale. And we have -- we have been successful in some of those. And our direct exposure to the 5 most challenged countries, the sovereign exposure is next to nil and our overall exposure is also very small. So we don't have a lot of direct exposure to the troubled countries of Europe. But surely, if Europe's challenges worsen and I'm not going to expect that, but if they do worsen, that would have an impact on the overall U.S. economy or could have an impact and then we could get impacted but our exposure is quite indirect, if you will.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Then, last question, on your expense plan. When you talk about it, you talk about getting rid of your merger expenses and a lower comp and benefits and it doesn't sound so structural. It sounds kind of cyclical. Just the way you talk about it, I know you said there's some technology in consumer lending. Can you just explain in more general terms, why do you have these extra expense savings, I guess you're looking to go from, what, $12.5 billion down to $11 billion by the fourth quarter of this year. Is this all just a cycle or is there something more fundamental happening?","Timothy J. Sloan","Well, I think there's something more fundamental that's happening. The progress that we're making is being masked by some of the items that we've been very specific to call out. But as we mentioned on Slide 12, we've reorganized and consolidated our consumer lending businesses. There will be a lot of savings related to that. We're combining many of our staff functions and technology groups and we can do that now that we're almost done with the merger. We do believe that there's some cyclically high mortgage costs that are going to roll off. So it's a combination of a lot of different things but it is a result of a lot of hard work and effort on the part of the team.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Should we characterize this as a second look at expenses now that the merger integration is complete? Just as a second look at the old Wachovia First Union merger? Is there -- how would you describe it?","Timothy J. Sloan","Well, I would describe it as being more reflective of what's going on from an economic standpoint, from a regulatory standpoint. We made a lot of really thoughtful decisions about how we were going to be organized in a different environment in the first quarter of 2009. And we've made a lot of success. We've had a lot of success in integrating the platform. As you recall, about a year ago, we've stepped back and said, \"Well, how do we want the company to look going forward?\" And we're making some changes reflective of what's going on in the environment right now. I think it's really important that we continue to improve. This isn't just about reducing expenses this year and hoping for the best. It's about a focus on providing more value to our customers. That's the primary driver of our expense initiatives, how can we drive more value to our customers and be more efficient.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Guggenheim.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to ask you a couple of questions. One is on the efficiency ratio, taking your $11 billion, which is very clear and I like the way you're putting that out there. But the business will move up and down, hopefully, revenues as we saw this quarter, starting to see some improvement. So if you look at the efficiency ratio coming into the year, we were kind of in the mid-60s, sort of 63% to 64%. As we got through the third quarter, it improved to 60%. In the fourth quarter, it ticked up about 1%. If I take the $11 billion and just kind of put it on the income statement, it actually brings our efficiency ratio down below 55%. Is that kind of the goal we're looking at? I was just trying to equate it, so we can move from just the $11 billion into somewhat of an efficiency target as well.","Timothy J. Sloan","Yes. Marty, it's a fair question. But candidly, we have not set a specific efficiency goal. We set a run rate. So the efficiency is going to be whatever it's going to be based upon where our revenues are going to be in the fourth quarter. But clearly, we think that a 60% rate is too high.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","And so the seasonality of the revenues this quarter, given the mortgage always has a strong fourth quarter hasn't really over -- I did say I want to make sure we weren't overemphasizing that number to get down to 53%, something like that would be doable given the assumptions we have.","Timothy J. Sloan","Yes. Marty, I don't know if 53% or 54% is doable. I think historically, if you look at the company, we've been down in that range. The company's changed a little bit. But again, we haven't set a specific efficiency goal target. We're focused on that $11 billion.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","And I have one other question that I wanted to kind of see if you can walk through in the sense of the mortgage putbacks. It's really kind of a 3-layered question. I hate to throw this at you. But one is, are the primary reasons for the deficiencies, can you kind of highlight why, we're dealing with agencies, which was a very regulated process, we're still seeing that they can throw back at us these deficient loans or the delinquent loans because of paperwork and deficiency in the process. Have those issues changed at all, so did you see a year ago different issues than we're seeing today or are they about the same? And then lastly, what would be your guess in the sense of what percent of the originations we did? To me, this is the critical assumption. I would have the deficiencies that are out there. So if we take a sample of a 1,000 loans, where we see that the deficiencies have been getting back to us with a 30% or the 40% of the loans. What's kind of the range that you think the loans that we're originating would have in the sense of deficiencies?","Timothy J. Sloan","So a lot of questions there Marty, which I appreciate. That's okay, it's okay. I think that when you think about the kind of the context of the repurchase demands that we're seeing, there isn't anything really new. I think that what we've seen is a steady review by Freddie Mac and then Fannie Mae during this year accelerated its view. But the issues are really not that different. And from our perspective, as we look at our portfolio, it has much more to do with vintage than anything. And we're slowly but surely kind of working our way through the vintages. The repurchases was pretty flat. Our losses were down for the quarter. In terms of the answer to your bigger question, what I'd like to do on that one, Marty, is just punt and have our IR folks get with our mortgage folks and get back to you because they're going to provide you with a better answer than I'm going to.","John G. Stumpf","I just think that percentage if we could look at some sample size, would give us some subset that we're dealing with, that kind of puts an upper bound which in my mind, we have to be approaching after the agencies have gone through 2 and 3 years of looking at this stuff. Unless they're coming up with new stuff, eventually they're going to run out. And it seems like we're, at some point, you're going to approach that number.","Timothy J. Sloan","I look forward to getting to that point too.","John G. Stumpf","Marty, the biggest thing in 2006 to '08 was stated income. I mean, that was -- and of course, that's all changed since 2008, so. But we'll get back to you on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I just wanted to kind of ask about the mortgage bank. You had obviously great revenue numbers this quarter particularly on the production side and great production numbers for this quarter. Usually, that tends to follow through it to good revenues in Q4. Can you talk a little bit about the margin on production and anything else that might be impacting the mortgage bank as we look at first quarter?","Timothy J. Sloan","Yes. I think that the margin was up from the third quarter. It was up to 190 basis points from about 134 in the third quarter. And that's something that you see typically in periods of increased demand. And as we've mentioned, we've taken share so that's good. I don't know where the margin is going to be in the first quarter. Clearly, 190 is very attractive. We hope that it continues to be in that range. It might. It might not.","John G. Stumpf","Just as a comment about the Mortgage business, we like the Mortgage business. We like that business. And we have a -- we've been taking share in that business. For 2\/3 of Americans, it's the most significant financial asset they'll have. If you're going to be in the consumer business, we believe you have to be good at the mortgage business and it's a balanced business. So again, I can't predict where volumes and originations are going to go. But we believe this is a strong business for our company and we like it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research.","Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions on the investment bank. The market share gains that you're seeing in the investment bank, can you just -- I mean is that due to any one particular activity or segment? If you could just give us a little color about that.","Timothy J. Sloan","No, it's not, Nancy. I think it's just reflective of the fact that it's a different competitive environment, number one. Number two, we have many more relationships than we had a few years ago. And we've got a great team and so they're out providing advice and service to those relationships but it was really pretty broad based. It's not for one specific product or trading activity or industry. It's really reflective of the fact that when we think this is a good business for us and we think we can continue to grow it, but we're going to grow it in our way that's very focused on risk and very focused on providing the right product and service to the client.","John G. Stumpf","It's mostly about us doing more with existing customers. We've already had a relationship. We already lent them money. We already did something with them. And now, because we have 15,000 brokers that are able to help sell a debt issuance or an equity offering. As Tim mentioned, we have great folks who play team ball.","Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division","My add-on, my second question will be just an add-on to that. I mean you guys clearly have benefited in quarters like this quarter from not being identified as a capital market\/investment banking company. And I guess my question would be, how big a market share do you actually ever want to have or how big do you want the investment bank to be in relation to the rest of the company to continue that premium, I think, you're getting for not being identified as an investment bank?","John G. Stumpf","So, Nancy, here's how I think about that. I think, first of all, we love the capability of our people and -- but we think of investment banking or capital markets as another product, another arrow we have in our quivers. We sit down with medium-sized companies and large companies. This is a product and a service that we have that we believe can help them succeed financially. If they choose us for that, that's terrific. If they choose us to do their stock transfer business or treasury management instead of that, that's also terrific. I'm not driven by league tables around here. I'm driven by conference room tables. I want to see us sitting around a table helping customers. So if we grow because we're helping customers, terrific. If we don't grow because their business isn't there but we're getting paid a different way, that's also terrific. And that's where I think we are fundamentally different. We don't have a standalone Head of Corporate Finance that reports to me that has a league table goal. I could care less about that. It's a product that reports into our overall commercial business. They're very good people, they do terrific work. I can't tell you how excited I am about the kind of -- the way they play team ball and work around here.","Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division","John, I'd like to get your perspective on one other thing as well. Jamie Dimon said a few days ago that given the stringency of this stress test, the CCAR, the 13% unemployment, et cetera, et cetera. He expected after you get the results of that and he implied that he does not think there will be capital raising needed on the part of major American banks as a result. Do you hope that, that would be the definitive word on capital? Do you expect that -- do you have that same expectation?","John G. Stumpf","Well, I don't know other banks as well as he knows other banks. So I know this company. And we surely believe we're in a good spot. But I would make a general comment. What we've been through the last 3 years in the U.S., there's been a lot of capital grown, organically and just through earnings and a lot of capital was raised. The industry is far stronger than it's been in the past. And it takes strong banks and a strong financial system to support a growing economy. This country is in a much better position than a lot of our European counterparts because of the strength of the banks. So I don't know what the stress test is going to show for each institution. I don't have a vision of that. But I know in our case, I don't worry a lot about our capital to support growth in this for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I had a couple of questions. One is on the excess liquidity that you have. Can you just give us what number you calculate that to be?","Timothy J. Sloan","We don't really calculate an excess liquidity number at the company, Betsy. I think that it ebbs and flows based upon deposit growth and the opportunities we see in terms of loan growth and acquisitions and investing the securities portfolio. So I mean, I wish I could give you a specific answer but that's not the way we think about it.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So I guess, the reason I asked that question is I'm thinking about your firepower for investing in loans going forward. Do you feel like that rate of change is decelerating or accelerating?","Timothy J. Sloan","Well, I think it's about the same. As we talked about, we got a tremendous amount of deposit growth in the third quarter. We got a lot of deposit growth in the fourth quarter when you think about it, we're up $30 billion in one quarter and then turn the clock back and how that would feel 2 or 3 years ago. But we've got more than enough dry powder to take advantage of the organic growth that we're seeing from our customers, which is strong as well as look at any acquisitions. But as John said, we're going to look at a lot of acquisitions. We may make none of them, we may make a lot but we feel good about where we are from a liquidity standpoint.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Can you just give us a sense of what your hurdle rates are for the kind of loans you're seeing? You mentioned earlier on the call that you've been seeing a lot of opportunities, you're being selective. Can you just give us a sense as to whether or not your hurdle rates have changed or what they are for the C&I loan book for example?","Timothy J. Sloan","So I'd rather not be specific about what our hurdle rates because if we're in a competitive situation, then our competitors might know what we're trying to solve for. But I can tell you, as we look at the portfolios that we purchased today, those portfolios have been higher-quality portfolios and the yields have been consistent with our existing commercial real estate portfolio. We really don't -- we don't have a specific hurdle rate that we would necessarily apply to every portfolio or every business because the risk in those businesses and portfolios can be different. You got to do it kind of deal by deal, opportunity by opportunity, just like when you underwrite a new loan that you look at the risk to that existing customer. And also, Betsy, we bring other things. We bring, when we do sit down with a potential seller, we also want to get paid for the trust these folks have in us that we'll complete the deal, and that we have the capacity to complete the deal. We don't re-trade it. So these are all, these all add into the mix. And in some cases, we're not even the highest bidder when we get deals.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Sure, okay. And then lastly on C&I, the average is up nicely around 4% to 4.5%, 4.6%. Q-on-Q, the end of period was up a little bit less, just under 2%. So I guess -- and that's in an environment based on the HA data that were showing accelerating C&I EOP into the end of the quarter. So did you see competition kind of heating up and you're backing off? Or opportunity just wasn't just as great? Can you just explain why the EOPs are different?","Timothy J. Sloan","Yes. I think the important thing is to appreciate that you shouldn't get too focused on what happens quarter-to-quarter because you can have a lot of the activity that happens over the quarter. I would not be concerned about our ability to grow commercial loans at all.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Was there originally a pullback a little bit relative to what we saw from the HA? Was it a function of the competition that you see?","Timothy J. Sloan","No, no, no. We didn't necessarily pull back. A lot of it can just be timing. I mean we have a bunch of loans that and transactions you're working on that could, you think might close toward the end of the year and they don't. They close in the first part of the next year or the  next quarter.","John G. Stumpf","And there's also some seasonality here also.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So your average growth rates are better for forecast than you think than EOP?","Timothy J. Sloan","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Fred Cannon with KBW.","Frederick Cannon - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered but I just want to follow-up on the last one about loan growth. If I look at your end of period loans and exclude the $5.6 billion in reclassifications and then the $3.6 billion in purchased average bank loans, I have the quarter-on-quarter loan balances essentially flat, which suggests that your organic growth is essentially offsetting your portfolio, your run-off portfolio decline. Is that a fair way to think about where you are right now? Or is that understating what's going on?","Timothy J. Sloan","No. I think it understates what's going on. I think the important thing from our perspective, Fred, is that we've got the ability to grow loans in various loan types, as well as make acquisitions. And depending upon the timing in the quarter or any given quarter, some might be growing faster than others. And I really think you've got to think about it as a total of all of them. And I wouldn't look at loan growth that we had from acquisition as being a bad thing. That's just part of the opportunities that we have to grow.","John G. Stumpf","And only a couple of billion of it showed up in the fourth quarter, so you can't look at all of the purchase. Some of that was on the third quarter. So there was actual growth in the fourth quarter.","Frederick Cannon - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. Just one more, Tim. Just looking at the yield on the security, you probably already covered this. The yield on the security portfolio has come down fairly significantly over the last year and even in the quarter-on-quarter. Is that just inherent in the flat yield curve environment? And just in terms of the opportunities to invest in securities, inherently lower yielding is just what you face right now?","Timothy J. Sloan","Yes, yes. I think that's right. I mean, I think that the rate of decline is slowing just a little bit but that's a very fair characterization, which again is why we're focusing on net interest income as opposed to just the yield.","Operator","Your final question will come from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets.","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just one last follow-up on the drivers to the growth on the C&I side. Do you have any color on kind of the relative strength of the different segments, be it kind of large corporate or syndicated middle markets, small business and just as, is there any one area where you're seeing better opportunities to take share?","John G. Stumpf","Well, it's more on the type of business as opposed to the size. If you look at anybody or any company involved in the commodities, they're doing quite well and because commodity prices are up, there's lending opportunities there. Agriculture is pretty good, energy is pretty good. So if you -- and manufacturing actually is doing quite well. On the other side, if it's around residential real estate, not so good. So it depends more on that than on size.","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And any comments just broadly on how  pricing's holding in?","Timothy J. Sloan","Pricing continues to be, to hold in pretty well during the quarter.","John G. Stumpf","And think of our pricing. We price at the relationship level. So it's not only the price on the loan, it's the price on the treasury business, the 401(k) business, the stock transfer business and a whole bunch of other things. So we think it's  probably differently than a lot of other companies.","John G. Stumpf","And thank you all for joining us. Again, we were proud of what our team did in the fourth quarter of 2011 and we're excited about 2012. Talk to you next quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call.

My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)","I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Rowe, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Rowe, you may begin your conference.","","Jim Rowe","","Thank you, Regina, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today during which our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf; and our CFO, Tim Sloan, will review fourth quarter and full year results and answer your questions.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our fourth quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I\u2019d also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today\u2019s call that are subject to risks and uncertainties.","Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings; including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release, and in the quarterly supplement available on our website.","I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf.","","John Stumpf","Thank you, Jim. Happy new year everyone and thanks for joining us today. We\u2019re excited to share our strong results for the quarter and for the year. We just completed our 12th consecutive quarter of EPS growth with record quarterly earnings in the fourth quarter of $5.1 billion, 24% from a year ago. These strong quarterly results are just part of an outstanding year of achievement for Wells Fargo.","Let me start by highlighting all that was accomplished during 2012. We earned a record $18.9 billion in 2012, up 19% from 2011, and we also grew earnings per share by 19%. We generated 6% revenue growth and pre-tax pre-provision increased by 13%. We improved our efficiency ratio by 250 basis points to 58.5% for the year.","We grew total loans by $30 billion, up 4% while reducing our liquidating portfolio by $18 billion. Our liquidating portfolio is now half the size it was four years ago at the time of the Wachovia merger. We now have over $1 trillion of deposits, up 9% from a year ago.","Credit quality continued to improve but charge-offs is down $2.3 billion. We achieved a record retail banking cross-sell of over six products for household. We grew return on assets by 16 basis points and increased return on equity by 102 basis points. We increased capital levels growing our estimated tier 1 common equity under Basel III to 8.18%.","We increased our dividend by 83% and repurchased approximately 120 million shares of common stock. In addition to these financial metrics, we also continued to grow organically and through acquisition purchasing loan portfolios and several businesses which not only brought new customers to Wells Fargo but allowed us to better meet the financial needs of all of our customers.","The housing market began a steady rebound during 2012 while many measures of activity and prices remained low by historical standards and a complete recovery will still take some time. There is no doubt that a corner was turned which is a real positive for our economy and for Wells Fargo.","We originated $524 billion in residential mortgages in 2012, helping over 2 million homeowners refinance or purchase a new home. Our industry, our regulators and our elected officials made progress this past year in helping to restore some stability to the housing market. Early in the year we finalized an agreement with the AGs and federal agencies regarding mortgage servicing, foreclosure and origination issues.","We also reached the settlement with the Department of Justice regarding origination practices and as we just announced, we reached the settlement associated with Independent Foreclosure Reviews which will end the large quarterly expenses associated with the Consent Order.","And regarding the draft, the qualified mortgage definition that was just published yesterday, we are still reviewing the details. But so far, it looks like the CFPB issued a rule that should benefit consumers across America by providing strong protection, while also ensuring that credit is available. By putting these issues behind us, we can focus more of our resources on serving our customers and creating long-term franchise value.","We generate strong results in 2012 even with regulatory changes and an uncertain economic and political environment. As we start the New Year, we believe we will benefit from some signs of growth that we are seeing in the economy, jobs are being created and home prices are increasing.","However, there is still a lot of work that needs to be done. The last minute agreement that averted the fiscal cliff was a good step but it did not fix our country\u2019s long-term problems. We need to work on both sides of the equation, spending reductions and revenue increases.","We need to increase clarity, certainty and confidence, and we can do this if the private and public sectors work together with the unified focus on strengthening our nation\u2019s financial and economic future, uncertainty is the enemy of business and we simply cannot afford that today.","We know our customers especially in the small and middle market segments needs certainty and clarity. They have cash and the desire to grow. We need confidence so they can feel encourage to invest and hire again.","With all that we accomplished last year, I believe Wells Fargo has never been better positioned and I\u2019m very optimistic about the year ahead. Wells Fargo is over 160 years old and we continue to manage our company for the long-term. The vision that has guided us for decades, meeting our customer\u2019s financial needs will continue to drive our growth in the year ahead.","Thank you again for joining us today. And now Tim Sloan, our Chief Financial Officer will provide more details on our financial results. Tim?","Tim Sloan","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. My remarks will follow the presentation included in the first half of the quarterly supplement, starting on page two, and then John and I will take your questions.","As John mentioned, Wells Fargo had a very strong quarter, with record earnings of $5.1 billion, up 24% from year ago. Earnings per share were a record $0.91, up 25% from the fourth quarter of last year. We\u2019ve now achieved 12 consecutive quarters of earnings per share growth and the seven consecutive quarters of record EPS.","Total revenue of $21.9 billion was up 7% from year ago. We grew revenue on a year-over-year basis every quarter in 2012. We also generated positive operating leverage. Pre-tax pre-provision profit increased 12% from year ago and we continue to have strong credit performance.","We generated strong deposit in loan growth. Our ROA was 1.46%, up 21 basis points from year ago and our ROE was 13.35%, up 138 basis points from year ago. Our capital levels remained strong with our estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio under Basel III growing to 8.18%.","As you can see on page three, our fourth quarter results build on the strong performance we achieved throughout the year. As John highlighted and as the charts on this slide demonstrate, we had an outstanding year of growth across a variety of measures. Revenues grew by 6%. Net income grew by 19%. We had solid growth in loans and strong deposit growth. Our ROA was 1.41% for the year and ROE was 12.95%.","We are in a much better position today than we were year ago and we look forward to taking advantage of all of the opportunities ahead of us. Our continued strong quarterly and annual performance reflected the benefit of our customer focused business model and our diversified sources of growth. The combination of our scale and our level of diversification is a significant advantage for our company.","Before I review the drivers of our results this quarter let me spend some time discussing some noteworthy items that impacted our results as highlighted on slide five. Taken together, these items had little impact on our bottom-line but they did cause some unevenness in some of our line items. ","Our gains on equity investments this quarter totaled $715 million. Our private equity business has been a core part of Wells Fargo for a long time and by its very nature results in this business can vary. The results in the fourth quarter were $393 million higher than the previous 7 quarter average reflecting strength in our private equity business, including the gain on the sale of Becker Underwood. The $393 million of above average equity gains equates to $0.05 of EPS. ","Our total operating losses this quarter reflected $644 million of incremental accrual to fully reserve for our costs associated with the independent foreclosure review settlement that was announced earlier this week and additional remediation related costs. This accrual reduced EPS by $0.09. We contributed $250 million to the Wells Fargo Foundation reducing EPS by $0.03 continuing our commitment of giving back to the communities that we serve. ","Finally, our income tax expense in the quarter included a $332 million benefit associated with the realization for tax purposes of a previously written down Wachovia life insurance investment which reduced our fourth quarter effective tax rate to 27.4%. This benefited EPS by $0.06 a share. ","Let me briefly highlight the impact of the independent foreclosure review settlement. Our portion of the cash settlement was $766 million and as I just mentioned, our operating losses this quarter reflected $644 million to fully reserve for the settlement and additional remediation related costs. ","We also committed to an additional $1.2 billion for foreclosure prevention actions which will not result in any additional charges since it is covered through our existing allowance and PCI non-accretable difference. We are pleased to have the high cost of complying with the consent order behind us, which when taking into account both the internal and external costs resulted in approximately $125 million in quarterly expenses in 2012. ","Let me comment on some of our key drivers this quarter, which I\u2019ll discuss in more detail later in my remarks. Our balance sheet growth accelerated in the fourth quarter with solid growth in loans and continued strong deposit growth. Our short-term investments in Fed fund sold balances increased by $36.9 billion and we grew our AFS portfolio by $5.8 billion, including agency MBS purchasers that occurred late in the quarter as rates rose and yields became more attractive. Our credit quality also continued to improve in the fourth quarter as it did throughout 2012. ","Turning to the income statement on page eight, we generated robust revenue in the fourth quarter reflecting strong non-interest income growth across our businesses and stable net interest income. The increase in non-interest expense was entirely driven by the higher operating losses in the foundation contribution that I highlighted earlier. ","Let me now cover our business drivers in more detail. As shown on page 9, period end loans were up $30 billion from the fourth quarter of 2011 and up $17 billion from the third-quarter of this year. This is the largest linked quarter increase over the past four years. ","Commercial loans grew $8.7 billion in the quarter. This growth reflected strong activity in a number of businesses, middle market lending, commercial real estate, asset-backed finance and corporate banking. Consumer loans increased by $8.3 billion with growth in first mortgage, auto, credit card and private student lending. This growth benefited from the retention of $9.7 billion of new conforming fixed-rate production similar to last quarter.","With the recent increase in rates providing better investment opportunities we currently do not plan to retain any -- retain additional first-quarter production. We do expect to hold an additional $2 billion to $3 billion of our fourth quarter originations that we\u2019ll fund this month. This demonstrates the flexibility of our diversified model. Our liquidating portfolio continued to shrink declining $17.8 billion from a year ago and down $4.1 billion in the fourth quarter.","We continue to have strong deposit growth in the fourth quarter with average deposits up $64 billion from a year ago and up $29.6 billion from the third quarter with growth across our franchise. We also continue to lower our deposit costs with average deposit cost down -- of 16 basis points in the fourth quarter, down two basis points from the third quarter and down six basis points from a year ago.","Our ability to continue to grow deposits while reducing costs has been a real strength of our franchise. While this strong deposit growth continued to put pressure on our margin, it is important to note that given most of this growth was a non-interest bearing deposits, this deposit growth has been essentially neutral to our net interest income.","The increased deposits provide us with many opportunities to meet other financial needs of our deposit customers and if the loan demand we have in the fourth quarter continues, we can better redeploy our quarter strong deposit growth to foreign loan growth.","As shown on page 11, tax equivalent net interest income was essentially flat from the third quarter with 3% growth in average earning assets. The 10-basis point linked quarter decline in the net interest margin was driven by three primary factors.","First, our strong deposit growth caused cash and short-term investments to increase reducing the margin by eight basis points. Second five basis points of the margin pressure was driven by the ongoing repricing of the balance sheet in the current low rate environment and the fact that we were cautious in our reinvestment activity.","However, as rates rose late in the fourth quarter, we did purchase approximately $5 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities and as rates rose again last week, we purchased another $5 billion of agency MBS. These declines were partially offset by the benefit of three basis points of higher variable income.","As you\u2019ve heard me say frequently, our focus is on growing net interest income over time. The chart at the bottom of this page shows that even though the net interest margin declined 18 basis points in 2012, compared with 2011, we were able to grow net interest income by $472 million. Growing our net interest income remains our focus and we believe we can continue to generate growth even in this low-rate environment.","Non-interest income increased 16% from a year ago and was up $754 million, or 7% from the third quarter. This growth was broad-based and included strong equity gains, as I highlighted earlier but also reflected strong business momentum across the company with deposit service charges up 3% due to product pricing changes, trust and investment fees were up 8% primarily due to stronger investment banking and retail brokerage asset-based fees, and other fees were up 9% on higher investment banking advisory activity.","Mortgage banking revenue increased $261 million or 9% from the third quarter, with higher servicing and origination fees. Net servicing income was up $53 million reflecting higher net MSR head results, which were partially offset by higher unreimbursed foreclosure costs. Mortgage gain on sale revenue was up $208 million from the third quarter despite approximately $340 million in forgone revenue from retaining $9.7 billion of conforming mortgage loans, which I\u2019d mentioned earlier.","The revenue impact was higher this quarter than last quarter as margins widened overall and more of our retained production came from the retail channel which is a wider margin business. Third quarter results included a $379 million provision for mortgage repurchase losses, which was $83 million lower than the third quarter.","Mortgage originations were $125 billion in the fourth quarter, down $14 billion from the third quarter, reflecting normal seasonality and the elimination of our wholesale channel, which originated $8 billion of loans in the third quarter. 12% of our origination volume this quarter was from HARP. The unclosed mortgage pipeline at quarter end was $81 billion, up 13% from a year ago and we would expect to benefit from seasonally stronger applications in the first quarter.","Turning to expenses on page 13, fourth quarter expenses increased $784 million from the third quarter due to the higher operating losses from the independent foreclosure review settlement and the $250 million foundation contribution that I mentioned earlier on the call. Even with these items, our expense efficiency ratio of 58.8% was within our targeted range of 55% to 59% and if you adjust for our noteworthy revenue and expense items this quarter our ratio was actually at the lower end of this range. However we believe expenses will remain elevated in the first quarter due to seasonally higher personnel expenses as we have every year. ","Our efficiency ratio in the fourth quarter was 190 basis points lower than a year ago. While we have made progress in improving our efficiency, we believe our expenses are still too high and we will continue to focus on opportunities to reduce expenses that do not impact our ability to grow revenue. For example, since 2008 we reduced the size of our overall real estate occupancy portfolio by over 16 million square feet net of growth. Over 4.5 million square feet of this reduction occurred in 2012. ","We continue to see opportunities to reposition our real estate holdings in the next few years, and we are experiencing more than 20% higher efficiency in the construction of all new office projects using improved design and build-out standards. ","When looking at our results it\u2019s also important to consider that some of our costs are elevated because of the current environment. We highlight some of these costs on slide 14. They totaled approximately $790 million in the fourth quarter alone. The OCC consent order added approximately $125 million of expenses in the fourth quarter and roughly $500 million of total expenses during 2012. The settlement that was reached earlier this week with our regulators will allow us to significantly reduce both the external and internal costs in the first quarter and fully eliminate these costs by the second-quarter. ","In the fourth quarter we had $221 million of foreclosed asset expense, which totaled $1.1 billion for the full year. The improvement in the housing market will reduce these expenses over time. We also have higher costs that reduced mortgage banking revenue. We added $313 million in the fourth quarter and $1.7 billion during 2012 to our repurchase reserve not related to current originations. ","Servicing fees were reduced by $127 million in the fourth quarter and $677 million during 2012 to reflect higher cost of service and unreimbursed foreclosure costs as foreclosure timelines continue to extend. In addition, we had a total of $2.2 billion of operating losses in 2012, almost $1 billion higher than the amount we had in 2011 as we resolved many significant matters related to our mortgage business. ","Turning to our segment results starting on page 15, community banking earned $2.9 billion in the fourth quarter, up 14% from a year ago and up 5% from the third quarter. Retail banking achieved a record cross-sell of 6.05 products per household, up from 5.93 a year ago. Our credit card business continues to grow with credit card balances up 4% linked quarter to a record $24.6 million with a record $12.6 billion of purchase dollar volume in the fourth quarter. This growth reflects seasonal holiday spending and strong account growth. ","New consumer credit card accounts grew 11% from fourth quarter of 2011 with household penetration increasing to 33%, up from 29% a year ago. We remain focused on meeting the needs of our small business customers with business checking accounts up 3.7% from a year ago, and we extended $16 billion of net new loan commitments to small businesses across the U.S. in 2012, up over 30% from year ago.","Wholesale Banking earned record net income of $2 billion in the fourth quarter, up 24% from a year ago and up 2% from the third quarter. Wholesale Banking continued to have solid deposit growth and as I mentioned earlier, they also had strong loan growth that was broadly diversified and gained momentum late in the quarter with period-end balances increasing $8 billion or 3% from the third quarter. ","Wholesale Banking has generated nine consecutive quarters of loan growth. In addition to meeting the financing needs of our commercial customers, we continue to better serve all of their financial needs is reflected in Wholesale Banking cross-sell growing to 6.8 products, up from 6.5 products a year ago.","We\u2019ve seen better penetration across our diversified product line, including strong growth in investment banking, with investment banking fees from commercial and corporate banking customers up 30% in 2012 versus 2011, and strong sales of our industry-leading treasury management products, including -- increasing treasury management revenue by 13% in the fourth quarter compared to a year ago.","Additionally, commercial credit card purchase volume increased 25% in the fourth quarter from a year ago reflecting strong account growth and increase usage among existing customers.","Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement earned a record $351 million, up 4% from the third quarter and up 13% from a year ago. The year-over-year growth was especially strong considering that fourth quarter 2011 included $153 million gain on the sale of H.D. Vest.","Earnings continued to benefit from higher asset-based fees with WBR client assets up 7% from a year ago, including strong growth in average core deposits up 6% and retail brokerage managed account assets up $50 billion or 20% driven by strong net flows and market performance.","In addition, WBR continue to effectively partner with retail banking to meet all the financial needs of our customers increasing cross-sell to 10.27 products per household up from 10.05 a year ago.","Turning to credit quality on page 18, trends continue to show improvement with fourth quarter net charge-offs of 1.05% of average loans. Net charge-offs were impacted by the completion of the implementation of the regulatory guidance issued by the OCC at the end of the third quarter, which increased our net charge-offs by $321 million in the fourth quarter. Excluding this impact net charge-offs were 89 basis points of average loans, 47 basis points lower than a year ago.","Reflecting continued improved credit performance and also incorporating estimated losses attributable to Hurricane Sandy. We released $250 million in loan loss reserves in the fourth quarter. Absent significant deterioration in the economy we continue to expect future reserve releases in 2013, but a lower level than 2012.","Nonperforming assets decreased $744 million from the third quarter and were down $1.5 billion from a year ago. Loans 90 days or more past due decreased $57 million from the third quarter and were down $613 million from a year ago. Early stage consumer loan delinquency balances and rates also declined from the third quarter a year ago.","Our servicing portfolio continued to perform better than the industry with our delinquency and foreclosure rate over 400 basis points lower than the industry average, excluding Wells Fargo, based on the most recent publicly available data.","Our total delinquency and foreclosure rate was 7.04% in the fourth quarter, down from 7.96% a year ago. We added $379 million to our repurchase reserve this quarter, down $83 million from the third quarter. Our repurchase reserve balance increased to $2.2 billion up 9% from third quarter. Our repurchase reserve incorporates current demand levels considers all vintages and anticipates probable future expected demands.","The unpaid principal balance of outstanding repurchase demands were down 3% from third quarter, reflecting a lower level of new demands from both the GSEs and private investors.","As shown on page 21, our capital levels continue to increase with our Tier 1 common equity ratio growing to 10.12%, up 66 basis points from a year ago and up 20 basis points from the third quarter. Our estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio under Basel III capital proposals increased to 8.18% in the fourth quarter.","We purchased 42 million shares in the fourth quarter and entered into a forward repurchase transaction for an estimated 5.9 million shares that is expected to settle in first quarter. During 2012, we purchase a total of approximately 120 million shares at an average price of $32.35.","We remain committed to returning to more capital to our shareholders. Our 2013 capital plan that we submitted to our regulators last week requests an increase in capital distribution to shareholders as compared to our 2012. But remember, our request is subject to Fed review and non-objection. ","As I\u2019ve highlighted, 2012 was an outstanding year for Wells Fargo. We generated growth throughout our businesses, we reduced risk, including lower credit losses, and we increased our returns. However we\u2019re even more optimistic about all the opportunities that we have in 2013 to continue to benefit from our business momentum and slowly improving economy. We remain focused on reducing expenses and we believe we have further opportunities to improve our efficiency ratio, and we should benefit from reduced environmental costs in 2013. ","We are optimistic that loan growth can\u2019t continue in 2013 and we believe we will be able to grow net interest income even if rates remain low. We have opportunities throughout our consumer and commercial businesses to continue to grow market share and increase cross sell.","And now I\u2019ll open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Tim, I was wondering on the share count. In 2012 the share count was flat despite about 4 billion of share repurchases. Just kind of wondering what\u2019s the strategy with regard to share count. Is it to just offset, use buyback to offset employee issuance or to really steadily reduce the net shares outstanding?","Tim Sloan","Well, you\u2019re absolutely right John. This last year in terms of our total purchases that\u2019s what we\u2019re able to accomplish to keep shares about flat. We\u2019re hopeful that over time as we continue to return more capital to shareholders that we will have the ability to increase the amount of shares that we can repurchase. But that\u2019s subject to the capital plan that we just submitted. So over the long-term we would like to do better than what we did this year. ","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. And in terms of the gross issuance, was there anything unusually high by your issuance this year or was 2012 kind of normal year for employee issuance?","Tim Sloan","I would say it\u2019s -- it was a relatively normal year. As you know having our team members received some of their compensation based upon on the shares is really important to make sure that the team members and shareholders are very aligned in terms of the long-term growth of the company. ","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","And then on expenses, should the look-back expenses start to come out immediately beginning in the first-quarter, those are gone?","Tim Sloan","I wouldn\u2019t assume that they would be completely gone in the first quarter. There\u2019s going to be some clean up this month and maybe trailing into next. They will clearly come down materially, I don\u2019t know what the exact number is going to be. They will be completely out of the run rate in the second quarter. ","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","And on the mortgage side, as originations come down if that happens in 2013, how quickly can the mortgage expenses come out?","Tim Sloan","We\u2019ve got some good track record in doing that and our mortgage folks have seen cycles before. You saw what we were able to accomplish in 2011 in the second quarter and then also in 2010. There is a bit of a lag, so I would say there\u2019s about 60 to 90 day lag, so call it a one quarter lag but we can move pretty quickly. ","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Okay and then one thing on the margin, on the five basis point of pressure that you attributed to rates and spreads coming out. Should we assume that, that pace continues for that piece? There\u2019s obviously moving parts in the net interest margin but for that piece of it does that hold at that kind of five basis point pressure?","Tim Sloan","John, I wish I could give you a guarantee of what specifically the impact will be. It does seem to have moderated a bit but it\u2019s really a function of all the mix of loan growth and also of securities purchasers. But it seems like it\u2019s moderating a bit.","John Stumpf","And remember John, we\u2019ve been pretty thoughtful about reinvesting but we saw some opportunities late in the year that is still shuttling. And we also saw great loan growth in the fourth quarter. So all those things have an impact. ","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","And those MBS balances you mentioned may gain towards the end of the fourth and into the first quarter. Tim, those are funded with the cash balances, right? They\u2019re only earning about 25 basis points a year, increasing the yield there, right?","Tim Sloan","That\u2019s correct. But it was 16.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. 16 that you\u2019ve done so far.","John Stumpf","No, no. I\u2019m talking about 16 basis points.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","On the yield. Okay.","John Stumpf","In terms of deposit cost.","Tim Sloan","Yeah.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Got it. Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","John Stumpf","Thank you, John.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Erika Penala of Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","Erika Penala - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Good morning.","John Stumpf","Hi Erika.","Erika Penala - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Hi. My first question is on the excess liquidity. I guess, from the first part, of the $27 billion in average growth escrow that you saw this quarter, how much of that do you think is sticky and if you think most of that is sticky, I appreciate the commentary you made about, if loan growth continues at this pace, you can absorb some of that liquidity but that still leaves you with some excess. Could you give us a sense of what your deployment strategy is going to be for the next year?","Tim Sloan","Erika, you raised a really good point and that is we did see very outsized deposit growth and the fact of the matter is that a good portion of that deposit growth came toward the end of the quarter. And whenever that happens, we want to be careful to watch that deposit growth overtime to make sure that we do think it is sticky.","What\u2019s interesting is that notwithstanding that we\u2019ve had periods like this over the last couple of years, one in point would be the third quarter of 2011. But that deposit growth has been maintained here. So we\u2019re optimistic that we can maintain a good portion of that deposit growth. My guess is we probably -- it maybe difficult to maintain all of it.","And so it creates a real opportunity for us because the way that we think about deposit growth is not just to fund our loan growth or fund investments. It\u2019s broadening the relationships and bringing new relationships into the company and so that gives us an opportunity not only to invest and increase, spread income over time but to be able to broaden those relationships so that we can grow fee income, which is really what you saw this quarter.","We saw broad-based fee growth and the way that we think about that fee growth this quarter is reflective of all the deposit growth that we\u2019ve had over the last couple of years, which has been pretty exciting.","","John Stumpf","Let me add to that Erika, first of all we feel no urgency to have to put something to work that might not be economic for us. We had excess liquidity last summer. And today MBSes are 30, 40, 50 basis points richer or higher yield. And as Tim mentioned, virtually all these deposits are part of our relationships. We\u2019re here to serve customers and these deposits, I think, we\u2019re moving share today.","And this is going to benefit this company for years and years and years to come and a lot of that revenue does sharpen the non-interest income side. If you think back four years ago, we had about $650 billion of non-CD deposits in this company. Today we have $950 billion. I mean, yeah there has been periods of faster growth, slow growth but we\u2019re moving share and I can be happy about this.","Erika Penala - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Understood. And my second question, if I could, is a follow-up to John\u2019s. Again, we appreciate the comment on the first quarter with regards to the seasonality in pay as well as some of the $125 million is still going to linger in the run rate. But if we think about the second quarter, and I take $12.9 billion that you posted, take out IFR settlement of $644 million, the charitable contribution of $250 million and take out $125 million.","Is $11.8 billion a good sort of run rate based for your second quarter. Obviously, there are moving parts. You mentioned the mortgage production-related expenses and investment in the franchise. But is $11.8 billion a good starting point for the second quarter?","Tim Sloan","Erika, the math that you just did is reasonable. However, I don\u2019t know what our expense run rate is going to be in the second quarter. What I do know is that we\u2019re going to continue to focus on reducing expenses and improving our expense efficiency ratio.","If revenues are up, I would expect expenses to be a little bit higher and that\u2019s a good thing. As long as we\u2019re delivering those, our revenues at a reasonable return and seeing an improvement in the expense efficiency ratio. But again we\u2019ve been very clear we still believe that our expenses are too high. But we\u2019re focused on improving the expense efficiency ratio as opposed to providing the target in terms of the hard dollar costs in any quarter. ","John Stumpf","Tim is absolutely right. We\u2019re not going to be slavish any absolute number. But as Tim mentioned the take-away tooth burns. Expenses are still too high. We\u2019re focused on that. And I would love to see expenses go up if it\u2019s appended to increased revenues. ","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse","On the servicing side of the house if people are generally somewhat concerned about volatility in the -- on the origination income. But I noticed that your annual kind of servicing fees for kind of clipping the coupons are close to $1 billion and yet your net income -- your net revenue that your report is about $250 million, it was $200 million last quarter. So all the market value and hedging costs, are that number in between, can you talk a little bit what could -- might get so that you could report kind of a cleaner number there? What has to happen in terms of the level of refis, is it a change in rates because you\u2019ve got -- you\u2019ve had a backup in rates in the last few weeks. So just talk about that a little bit?","John Stumpf","Sure, Moshe. That\u2019s a good question. I think when you look at the results in 2012 you saw a number of things that occurred in terms of the servicing income. I think one, which we called out is just the higher level of unreimbursed expenses related to lengthening the foreclosure timelines and foreclosure costs. As we talked about we will review those as being environmental which is why we called them out. I can\u2019t promise you how quickly they will come down but our guess is they will come down and there will be less -- over time there\u2019ll be less of an impact on the value of servicing.","The other phenomena that you saw and it occurred to a greater extent in the first quarter and into to a lesser extent this quarter was our assumptions around the discount rate. We had a discount rate change in the first quarter, we had a small discount rate change related to access servicing in the fourth quarter that impacted the number by about $53 million. And again we\u2019re hopeful that we don\u2019t see those kinds of discount changes over time. ","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse","Just kind of on a unrelated topic, you mentioned the growth of deposits you are seeing and service charges, has there been any kind of pricing either from you and your competitors, pricing changes in the service charge area that are worth noting?","John Stumpf","One of the initiatives that we have had over the last year is to simplify our checking account -- accounts and also to make sure that we were being paid appropriately for the services that we provide. So we\u2019ve repriced the checking account base this year in the company and that\u2019s been an initiative in our retail banking group and notwithstanding that they\u2019ve been able to grow deposits and over the year grow accounts.","Tim Sloan","There\u2019s not much change in the competitive landscape. ","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Ed Najarian with ISI Group.","Ed Najarian - ISI Group","So I guess my margin questions were sort of asked already but one more quick question. You outlined that you had $11.9 billion of unrealized gains in the securities portfolio. Now that we\u2019re in a Basel III world and that accounting has capital on a B3 basis. Is there any desire or anything being done to try to protect that against a rising rate environment or how do you think about that in terms of capital and the desire to protect it?","Tim Sloan","Well, it\u2019s two ways to think about it. It\u2019s a good question and of course you know how much we enjoyed talking about the NIM. So any additional questions are terrific. But the way that we think about it is that we look at the underlying risk return for any security and we do that every day for our entire portfolio. And so you really need to start looking at that on a security by security basis. And there are certainly days when we look at some of our investments and we decide that it makes sense to go ahead and sell. But remember that we think about that -- the -- that portfolio, the AFS portfolio as a longer term investment portfolio. So you don\u2019t really see a lot of sales, it tends to be a little bit of the exception, because again we\u2019ve invested those for the long-term.","I think in terms of the potential capital impact, you\u2019re absolutely right, it does take, it is going to be a potential impact and that\u2019s one of the reasons why we think it\u2019s prudent to have a cushion in addition to the minimum 8% Tier 1 common equity under Basel III estimates that we\u2019ve talked about now since Investor Day.","And we\u2019re making a lot of progress in terms of growing our Tier 1 common equity 8.18%, so we are going to be at 9%, hopefully in the next year or so. But again that\u2019s another reason to have a question. But I wouldn\u2019t look to us try to monetize that $11.9 billion, because we think we\u2019re getting the good risk return on the spread income for those investments.","Ed Najarian - ISI Group","And you wouldn\u2019t do anything necessarily from a hedging standpoint above and beyond what you\u2019ve historically done to try to protect that?","Tim Sloan","No. I don\u2019t I think that that would make sense because and what you\u2019d have is you have an asset that\u2019s generating income that\u2019s not mark-to-market and versus hedge that\u2019s potentially marked. And that creates a mismatch in, the industry that\u2019s created problems and that\u2019s just not how we think about it.","John Stumpf","And as a -- as if rates do backed up, there is a whole bunch of other things that happen with the company, I mean, actually earnings increased with your margin. So it might not be quarter-to-quarter and that\u2019s why Tim about, that\u2019s why we are going to an extra buffer, but if rates back up that would be a good thing for us. We love that.","Ed Najarian - ISI Group","Right. Right.","John Stumpf","\u2026 for the right reason, because economy is getting better and so forth.","Ed Najarian - ISI Group","Okay. And then just one quick follow-up, I take it from your answers to John and Erika\u2019s questions that, you\u2019re not feeling any special urgency to get the excess liquidity here reinvested. It sounds like, when you talked about some additional security -- securities purchases in the beginning of this quarter, but it sounds like you\u2019re going to take your time and sort of judge your rate environment, and invest that excess liquidity more over time than right away, is that the way to think about it?","Tim Sloan","That\u2019s absolutely right. It gives us great flexibility in terms of running the company, so you\u2019re spot on.","John Stumpf","That\u2019s right, Ed. We think that\u2019s a real benefit of the company.","Ed Najarian - ISI Group","Okay. All right. Great. Thanks guy. Appreciate it.","Tim Sloan","Thanks Ed.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets.","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","John Stumpf","Hi, Joe.","Tim Sloan","Hi, Joe.","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets","The C&I growth was much stronger in the fourth quarter, so it looks like the fiscal cliff concerns really didn\u2019t dampen customer demand much. What were some of the key drivers to the increased volumes this quarter, was there any increased line utilization and just how do you feel about the outlook for C&I growth in the year ahead?","Tim Sloan","Yeah. Joe, just a quick answer on line utilization, it was up slightly, but it wasn\u2019t a primary driver. Actually was kind of interesting because the fiscal cliff negotiations and the potential for increases and changes in tax rates actually had slightly positive effect on loan growth in the fourth quarter, particularly toward -- on the commercial side and particularly toward the end of the quarter, so there was some amount of growth related to some of our customers taking actions and so on and so forth.","But when you look at the growth within Wholesale Banking, it was pretty broad based. Our middle market lending business grew, our commercial real estate business grew, corporate banking grew, asset-backed finance grew.","So we were very pleased with the performance and again, it just creates an opportunity to broaden relationships particularly with new customers. But it was very broad based and I would say that fiscal cliff was a net positive to loan growth.","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. So it sounds like you feel pretty good about the sustainability of this momentum going forward there?","Tim Sloan","Well, there is going to -- there\u2019s always some seasonality, I should have mentioned that, I apologize. There is some seasonality, there could be -- we could see a bit of that fall off in the first quarter if that was primarily related to the fiscal cliff.","But we feel confident that we can continue to grow our loans in Wholesale. As we mentioned we have been able to do that for a number of quarters and we\u2019ve been able to do that for a number of quarters in many of the Wholesale Businesses.","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Then my other question was just, if you could just talk little bit more about your reaction to the new qualified mortgage rules announced yesterday by the CFPB and just how might that effect your origination volumes going forward?","John Stumpf","Yeah. Joe, I -- as I mentioned in my comments, I think that CFPB found the right balance and listened to a variety of constituencies or people who they employ. And I think regarding the QM, it\u2019s going to provide -- it provides its broad, it provides clarity and I think it\u2019s going to help more Americans get more credit and that\u2019s good for housing, good for America. ","Well, let\u2019s step back a second. That\u2019s not the old issue that you need to be sold for. We still have the GACs out there. We have FHA seminar issues. We have the QRM that need to be decided. You have issues around states of their own things, new services. There is a whole bunch of other things going on here but this is a positive move.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","A couple questions, one on the purchase reserves and one just general. So on the purchase reserves I know you indicated that you\u2019re making a reserve for old vintages. And we hear from other institutions they\u2019re just making the reserve for vintages that have been requested by the agencies. So I am wondering if you have been requested by more vintages than you\u2019re hearing your peers are or if you\u2019re just taking current requests and applying it to everything that you\u2019ve got?","John Stumpf","A good question particularly with a lot of the noise in the market. Our reserving process is the same as it\u2019s always been. There is really nothing new this quarter relative to any other quarter and that is we reserve for all probable and current future demands from all vintages, all vintages. It\u2019s based on all the conversations we have, all the documents we receive. So it really hasn\u2019t changed, we take into consideration any of the conversations we\u2019ve had with the agencies and we feel very good about the reserve that we have today","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","And you are making some increase to the reserve even today, so conversations obviously change over time and you just take those conversations reflect against vintages. Is that fair?","John Stumpf","That\u2019s correct, Betsy. That\u2019s absolutely right. ","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","And then secondly on just the loan loss reserves we had some commentary from FASB about proposal for moving to life of loan reserving. And I guess I am not sure I am understanding your first take on that, how you think that would impact your reserve process and the levels and if you could tie it into your comment do you think that the reserving -- the reserve release is likely to slow in \u201813 versus \u201812?","Tim Sloan","Let me take the last part of your question first. The primary driver in terms of why we think the reserve release will probably slow this year is that we\u2019re seeing a -- while we continue to see improvement and reduction in loan losses is improving at a slower rate than it was a year ago and two years ago, still seeing improvement. That\u2019s great. In addition we\u2019re seeing a growth in the loan portfolio. So we think we\u2019re going to see reserve releases but the expectations that it will be a little bit less than what we saw or it will be less than what we saw in \u201813. ","In terms of the Fed\u2019s discussions again that\u2019s a real work in progress right now. It\u2019s something that is probably going to take a few years to determine -- it will probably increase our reserving level, it will probably be more of a one-time increase, and then you\u2019ll see reserve on a current basis probably come down. But again I don\u2019t want to speculate too much on that because it\u2019s still a work in process, but I think it would be -- likely to be one-time reset for the industry and then the new world will potentially be lower reserves on a current basis. ","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Are there any loan categories today that you are doing a form of life of loan reserving or would all -- your loan category need to be -- ","Tim Sloan","No, for us it would impact all of the loan categories. ","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Paul Miller with FBR.","Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets","Did I hear you correctly when you were going through the balance sheet growth that you\u2019re not going to grow your residential portfolio anymore, did I hear that correctly?","Tim Sloan","Yes and no, let me clarify, Paul. What we -- we\u2019ve been very clear to call out the amount of first conforming first mortgage production that we otherwise would sell in a quarter and we did $9.8 billion of that in the third quarter and then we had $9.7 billion of that in the fourth quarter and then there will be another $2 billion to $3 billion from fourth quarter production that will close in January.","Okay. That\u2019s conforming first mortgage production. But what we will continue to do is we will continue to hold all of our non-conforming or jumbo mortgage production on balance sheet and I think our growth in the fourth quarter was about $4 billion. And we like that business, such a great business for us.","Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets","And of the $125 billion, just to clarify that you produced in the quarter, does that $9.7 billion come out of that $125 billion and you sold roughly $115 billion. Is that correct?","Tim Sloan","No. That doesn\u2019t. The $125 billion is what we sold.","Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets","Okay. So you produced close to $135 billion to $140 billion?","Tim Sloan","No, no. I\u2019m sorry, Paul. I misspoke. I apologize. The 125 billion includes the $9.7 billion.","Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets","So we\u2019re trying to create -- okay, so we\u2019re trying to back into a gain on sale margin. We should back out that 9.7 billion?","Tim Sloan","That\u2019s correct.","Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets","Okay. And then you talked about that, that about $9 billion of the decline in the pipeline was from exiting the brokerage channel. Have you made any other -- did you tighten up the corresponding channel at all as that? I know you said you\u2019re not going to expand the channel anymore. Have you tightened it up?","Tim Sloan","No. And again it was $8 billion of production that we had in the wholesale channel in the third quarter that we didn\u2019t have in the fourth quarter because we exited that channel by the end of the third quarter. But the corresponded channels still a very important part of our origination that we did not tighten up underwriting standards for the corresponded channel.","Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets","Okay. And the pipeline channel was down roughly 20%. Was that also due to the exit of the brokerage channel?","Tim Sloan","By a small amount, yeah. I would just describe the decline in the pipeline as much seasonal as anything else. It\u2019s still -- and we ended the quarter with one of the strongest pipelines that we\u2019ve ever had in our history. So we\u2019re very excited in terms of how we\u2019re entering the first quarter.","Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets","And then just to clarifying other comment. You did say that you expect production in the first quarter to be greater than the fourth quarter for mortgage production?","Tim Sloan","No. Not necessarily.","Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets","Okay. I\u2019m not going to ask you then?","Tim Sloan","Yeah. No, no not necessarily. Just we start the quarter with a higher pipeline then we did a year ago.","Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets","Okay. I understood.","John Stumpf","But Paul, we\u2019re still excited about the mortgage business. We still think it\u2019s lots of opportunity there?","Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets","And then, I don\u2019t know if you guys -- can you guys make any comments about the gain on sale margins. Is the profitability in mortgage banking holding up despite the fact that we\u2019re seeing rates go up 10, 20 basis points last week or so two weeks ago?","John Stumpf","Yeah. It has. In fact, our gain on sale in the fourth quarter was 2.56% versus 2.21% in the third quarter. So they were up in the quarter. Again these are very high levels. We\u2019re very pleased to have these gains but they -- and so because they are high, the likelihood is they could come down a bit. But it\u2019s a very, very good business right now.","Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets","Well, I was wondering -- I mean, as of today, we got two weeks under our belt and we\u2019ve seen the -- because of the fiscal cliff, the fiscal cliff agreement that came out that they backed, the 10 years backed up that 20 basis points. But ongoing operability in these mortgages are still -- haven\u2019t really backed of at all for the first couple of weeks of the year.","Tim Sloan","Yeah. A fair question. I haven\u2019t looked over the last couple of weeks in terms of what the profitability -- last week, what the probability in terms of loans we brought in, in the last week. But it\u2019s profitable right now.","Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets","Okay. Hey guys. Thank you very -- go ahead. Thank you.","John Stumpf","However, the volumes of the spring season typically the better sell season, so your purchase money, there is still lot of activity in the mortgage business.","Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets","Okay. Hey, guys. Thank you very much.","John Stumpf","Thank you.","Tim Sloan","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank","Good morning.","John Stumpf","Hey, Matt.","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank","Two unrelated questions. First, when we look at your wholesale borrowings, so I just confess, I\u2019m thinking about short-term borrowings, long-term debt, foreign deposits, things like that. I mean, I realize some or little bit longer term than others. I\u2019m curious why we haven\u2019t seen those buckets come down when you\u2019ve had all the strong deposit growth?","Tim Sloan","Well, remember the strong deposit growth that we had in the fourth quarter was just in the fourth quarter. In fact, in the fourth quarter you saw our long term debt decline a bit and the way that we think about our long term debt levels today is that they are about where they need to be. And so much of what you will see us -- what you saw us do last year is just replacement. We still think it\u2019s appropriate to have a certain level of long term debt, that\u2019s very important in terms of our long term debt ratings. So it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019re going to see a big decline in that this year. ","John Stumpf","But Matt, if you go back four years ago look at our numbers, I think we had something over $4 billion of short and long-term debt, now it\u2019s down to a combined 180 or something like that. So over time it has come down as we\u2019ve grown deposits. We think some debt to maintain our ratings and support the balance sheet is important. ","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank","And as you think about the other buckets outside of long-term debt, short-term borrowings, foreign deposits, are those at appropriate levels, I guess I thought that instead of growing the liquidity you would just bring that down (inaudible) just the OpEx or the NIM would it under so much pressure from adding from the Fed fund?","Tim Sloan","Well, the foreign deposits we have are from customers. So candidly I hope those deposits are going to grow over time. In terms of short-term borrowings you could see a slight decline in our short-term borrowings because of the increase in deposits. ","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank","But I guess the overall message is like as we think about the liability side of things, there is not a lot of levers to pull from a mix point of view, like you\u2019ve done a lot of what you can do\u2026","Tim Sloan","Yeah I guess I would say the following. First, we still have about $2 billion, $2.5 billion of troughs that will likely come off the balance sheet this quarter, early second-quarter. And then I do think that if you look at the costs of our long-term debt even as it\u2019s staying -- coming down a little bit but staying the same you\u2019re seeing us make progress in terms of reducing the long-term debt costs just because when you look at the rate environment today versus when we originated some of our long-term debt, it\u2019s just lower today. ","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank","And then just separate topic, as we think about progression of legacy mortgages it\u2019s a big picture like first you\u2019re dealing -- the industry is dealing with some reserve build and actual charge-offs and there have been a lot of various servicing related agreements with the state attorney general, OCC, the Fed, are we -- it feels like we\u2019re pretty -- and of course with all the put backs on the servicing, it feels like we are pretty far along on the servicing side or is there another round or two like outside of servicing that we should be aware of or will you wrap it up some of these remaining servicing issue, do you think a lot of the legacy mortgage costs go away?","Tim Sloan","Here\u2019s what I think about that, we went through this country especially with housing industry its really difficult period. You would expect that your litigation costs, all those sort of things will be elevated during that period. You\u2019re right, we put a lot of stuff behind us, some of that is inherent to the business, as the business gets better I\u2019d expect less of that but I\u2019m pleased with how much we\u2019ve gotten through with a lot of that behind us. ","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank","But I guess just it\u2019s somebody who is not has involved in this, as lot of the folks on the call, well calling and say oh, I thought the bank settled on this last year and obviously it\u2019s different people or different constituencies coming in on the servicing side, whether it\u2019s the actual investors or I guess the politicians or the regulator, are there avenues that any other folks would take like maybe on the origination side or just kind of other skeleton on the closet that we might be seeing?","John Stumpf","Well, I mentioned in my comments that we\u2019ve settled the origination and servicing and we [settled lookback], we settled a variety of things. So I can predict what\u2019s all going to come up but I can tell you I am pleased that with this far through the process, we\u2019ve gotten a lot of big things behind us. ","Tim Sloan","And Matt, I would just note that even as we\u2019ve had to be a part of these settlements and they clearly had a financial cost to the company, throughout that entire period we\u2019ve generated record earnings.","John Stumpf","12 quarters in a row it\u2019s been a very difficult period of time, that\u2019s just talks about the diversity in earnings power of this company.","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank","Yeah. Absolutely. Fair point. And obviously a lot of your expenses relate either you have them lower than some.","John Stumpf","And also look at the performance of our portfolio. I mean, 400 basis points better than the average for the industry is and that\u2019s ultimately the opportunity decide on these things in many cases.","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thank you very much.","Tim Sloan","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Fred Cannon with KBW.","Fred Cannon - KBW","Hi. Good morning. Thanks so much. Most of my questions have been answered. I just had a couple follow-ups. One on the qualified mortgage, John, you were generally positive about the direction. There has been some concern about the jumbo market and some of the press report has said that the qualified mortgage about 20% of -- more of jumbo loans currently been made might not be able to be made as qualified mortgages. I wonder if you could comments a little more specifically about the jumbo market?","John Stumpf","I think it\u2019s early yet to comment, because I\u2019ve not read in detail more of our people had enough time to really understand everything that\u2019s in the CFPB\u2019s Q. But let me just say this about the jumbo market.","We loved that business. We\u2019ve been it for a long time. In many cases these are best customers and we do a lot of other things with them. So I doubt at least I\u2019d be surprised, if whatever happened there would have a big negative impact on the jumbo market.","Fred Cannon - KBW","Okay. One of the 804 pages like, that\u2019s understandable not to get through it, yeah.","John Stumpf","More than the 600.","Fred Cannon - KBW","I wonder but John on the expenses and I know you guys are doing, focus on operating leverage. Within your expense controls, I wonder if you could comment about your thoughts about your branch network at this point in time in terms of both -- within kind of thinking about managing expenses about both the numbers of branches, but also the configuration of kind of the footprint of your current branches, especially given and where technology is today?","John Stumpf","Sure. Couple of things there, first of all, I think, we have the best team on the plan running our distribution. And I couldn\u2019t be happier about the 6,000 or so stores that we have and stores still today remain incredibly important in the overall distribution community. Even though online, especially tablet, the so called lean-back technology is changing the industry.","Most customers choose their first financial services provider based on proximity to where they live and we have a store within 2 miles of half the American population. It\u2019s a huge advantage.","But we used to build 5,000 square foot stores with a 10 penny sign. Now we\u2019re building 10 penny stores with a 5,000 square foot sign. It\u2019s more important because if customers come there and then use other technologies, they want to be able to go and say, that\u2019s where my money is, that\u2019s where I can go if there is an issue, that\u2019s where I go if I have a big transaction to do. So, stores still remain an incredibly important part of the ecosystem of delivery.","That might change over time and the tablet or the smartphone is changing the way customers do business with us. They are on with us much more. They are learning more and we\u2019re doing, have all kinds of experiments and test going on, paperless stores and more self-service.","But and change is not new to us. I mean we\u2019ve been -- we had at one time in this company one service model. It was a stage coach and that went away after a few years and we have tried something else, so this is -- I find this exciting.","Fred Cannon - KBW","So I would be fair to say, John, that, what, the numbers of branches could even drift up from here, but the square footage will probably be coming down?","John Stumpf","Yeah. That could be. Actually the most important thing and you probably know this, in distribution is distribution density. People want distribution, where they live, work, recreate, travel and so forth, that is and we are gaining retail share faster today we have in my 35 years or 30 years with the company.","So it\u2019s a -- but distribution -- physical distribution remains a critical part of it. But size is the way you staff it, the number of people and all of that sure that needs to evolve. And it is evolving. But we\u2019re not in the camp that you can circulate the greatness.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies & Company.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company","The one further on the environmental expenses, we understand, were the content order -- 125 should be out of the run rate by the second, and Tim, to your point about being 800 million now still on a quarterly run rate. I was just wondering you could kind of give us just a general understand of the rest of it, the 675 that you\u2019re still carrying. What\u2019s the tail-off of that as we go ahead, and the biggest one being -- are we closer to the end of the putback reserve build?","Tim Sloan","I wish I knew the answer to -- specific answer to the question, Ken, because it\u2019s a real good one. It\u2019s one that we think about a lot around here. Maybe just to give you a sense of some of the magnitude, if you look back in the fourth quarter of 2011 our foreclosed asset expenses were $390 million, they were 221 this quarter that was down from the third-quarter, down from the second-quarter. So you\u2019re seeing those costs, for example, come down quarter by quarter and not necessarily by a lot but that will never go down to zero but certainly we can continue to make progress on that.","As it relates to our repurchase reserve build, I think that the biggest mistake anybody in this industry can make is predict when that\u2019s going to end because we just don\u2019t know. We\u2019ve been fortunate over the last that we peaked in the second-quarter and we\u2019ve seen a decline in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter, can\u2019t promise you whether that\u2019s going to continue but at some point we will be through all the vintages we will have all the conversations and will be done. But I don\u2019t know the pace at which that can continue. So I\u2019d love to give you a specific number, but I just don\u2019t know, we just do believe that they\u2019re going to be coming down over time. And that\u2019s what you\u2019ve been seeing over the last few quarters. ","Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company","And then my second one is the gain on sale question question again on the mix, it being up 30 basis points or so, how much of that was the market versus how much of that was the channel mix you had because of the lack of the wholesale product in the mix of origination?","Tim Sloan","Well, clearly some of it was related to channel mix because you think at the margin we didn\u2019t have any wholesale origination versus having more retail. I don\u2019t know what the exact impact that was on the margin, apologize we can follow up with that but the margin was up over 30 basis points quarter to quarter. So it was a combination of both.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company","The important thing is that retail generally comes with at a higher margin rate, so we shouldn\u2019t necessarily look at it that is inappropriate, right?","Tim Sloan","No, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s inappropriate, that\u2019s the gain on sale margin, there\u2019s also higher costs and expenses associated with the two. But it\u2019s a very, very good thing from our perspective. ","Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company","My last one is just on the non-controlling interest, it didn\u2019t change on the balance sheet but it was doubled the amount there normally is, it\u2019s actually extra $0.02 that you paid out this quarter. Any color you can provide us on that?","Tim Sloan","That was directly attributable to the gains that we had in the private equity business that we mentioned, so in our equity gains and so that\u2019s really an offset to that. We didn\u2019t necessarily feel like we had to offset that when we called out that impact. But you\u2019re right, that\u2019s actually [de duck] to the net of impact. ","Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company","That\u2019s incremental to the number that you showed us in the press release?","Tim Sloan","Yes, that\u2019s correct. ","Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company","The bottom line is that it shouldn\u2019t be at that level going forward because it was specific to the sale of the business. ","Tim Sloan","Correct, unless we have -- if we have more gains -- the gains are a good thing, right but that\u2019s what we would -- that\u2019s correct, it\u2019s d doc to us. ","Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company","And then my last tiny one, is just on the -- on the putback question, the reserve addition of the provision was 379, can you tell us what the actual losses were this quarter?","Tim Sloan","Hold on, I will get that number in a second. It\u2019s in -- $206 million.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company","$206 million. Okay. Great. Thanks very much guys appreciate it.","John Stumpf","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.","Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer","Good morning.","John Stumpf","Hey, Chris.","Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer","Hi. Given the Becker Underwood gain this is a good quarter, I ask you about a business you do not get to talk about that often which is the venture capital business. I know it\u2019s been magnificent contributors since the Norwest days, but looking at your disclosures, at year-end, it looked like you had about a $1.4 billion invested in VC fund of various types at September about a $1.3 billion. And you had $1.5 billion of gains there this year and I\u2019m wondering are you still able to invest in that fund in the venture capital business? Are you still making new investments or does the Volcker Rule kind of put this into liquidation mode.","John Stumpf","That\u2019s a really good question. I think, our best guess of the impact that we are going to see from the Volcker Rule and again I want to be careful because Volcker Rule has not been finalized yet, is that it would eliminate or\/and our ability to invest in a private equity fund or real estate opportunity fund as a limited partner. That seems pretty clear that that business would get eliminated or that activity would get eliminated as part of Volcker.","However, we believe that we will continue to be able to invest and we continue to invest today in Norwest Venture Partners and Norwest Equity Partners, which we believe will be allowed under the Volcker Rule.","Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer","","And those are your investments in those funds are what we see in page -- in your 10-Q, the $854 million and $83 million?","John Stumpf","Well, yes, but there\u2019s also still a legacy amount of equity investments that are related to limited partnership investment that we\u2019ve made over time or previously and those are going to come down over time. But again, we believe we will continue to be able to invest in NVP and NEP.","Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer","Okay. Excellent. And then lastly, I guess, just not the NIM question, but in net interest income dollars question. And that\u2019s that it seems like since the first quarter of 2011 net interest income has been $10.8 billion plus or minus. I mean, you\u2019ve been holding it steady and loan growth has been like this quarter it was 1.3%.","So, you\u2019ve had to run just to keep still and yet you said, you think expect net interest income dollars to start going up. And I guess what gives you the confidence that you know the treadmill that you\u2019re going to be able to run faster than the treadmill in the year ahead?","Tim Sloan","Well, I think it\u2019s a good analogy. It certainly has been a treadmill because our folks have been working very hard. But I think what gives us confidence is that\u2019s what we did when you compare 2012 to 2011. We grew net interest income dollars in this environment.","John Stumpf","Almost $0.5 billion.","Tim Sloan","Right. And so, we like it to be higher, you bet, we would. But I think we\u2019ve been able accomplish that, not necessarily on a sequential quarter basis each quarter, but year-over-year we\u2019ve been able to accomplish that with the headwinds that we all know we\u2019ve experienced in the net interest margin. So, I guess, we just look at it and say, we hope history repeats itself because we think we can do that.","John Stumpf","Our liquidating portfolio, we are getting closer and closer to the end of that because when we wake up in the morning, the first day of the quarter, we know historically $5 billion or $6 billion would shrink on that side, while it was $4.1 billion this last quarter. So we are going to work through that but the investments we are making, some of the on balance sheet, some of the loan growth, all of that helps. And also we have reduced liability cost 2 basis points across the Board. That\u2019s important.","Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer","All right. That\u2019s it for me. Thank you.","John Stumpf","Thank you.","Operator","Next question will come from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Good morning.","John Stumpf","Hey, Mike.","Tim Sloan","Hey, Mike.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","I have questions on the good, the bad and the ugly.","John Stumpf","I think you had last time. I think that\u2019s you had. You want to start with ugly first?","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Okay. I thought it was. Okay. I don\u2019t want to repeat myself too much. Let\u2019s start with the good. Page 26 of the supplement, the nonaccretable difference, I think the good news is, as you said, housing is doing a little bit better. So why do you still have $7 billion of non-accretable difference or 23% of the unpaid balance. What constraints you from recognizing more of that back to accretable yield?","John Stumpf","Well, the analysis that we do is done on a quarterly basis where we look at our expectation related to future loss, we look at the default rates, re-default rates and the like. And we make adjustments over time. You can see in the pages from supplemental we\u2019ve made adjustments over time. In fact, in the third quarter we increased -- we moved I think about 400, $500 million from non-accretable to accretable. and our expectation is over time is that if we believe that housing prices are going to -- if you believe that housing prices are going to continue to increase and we do that, that won\u2019t the last time that we would move non-accretable to accretable. It just didn\u2019t happen based upon our models in the fourth quarter. ","Mike Mayo - CLSA","And also in the good category, just a general question, how much longer -- this question I did ask last time, how much long do you think this gain on sale margin will hold a much longer, we have more of a refi boom based on your own website 30 year conforming is now 3.6% and under 3.5 for most of last quarter. And you need to have some expectations and you guys have to plan on that, do we have one more quarter, two more quarters, two more years, what\u2019s your best guess?","John Stumpf","You know what I don\u2019t know for sure, but in the fourth quarter we provided some detail in terms of our servicing portfolio and we cut the portfolio, you can get this on the website. You can cut the portfolio based on note rate and then we also segmented by loan-to-value and we also segmented it by FICO score. And what you see there is there are hundreds of billions of dollars of opportunities, I am not publishing you that we get every one of those refinancing opportunities but there\u2019s hundreds of billions of dollars of refinancing opportunities that are just in our existing portfolio alone. So it doesn\u2019t feel like this is absent a big increase in rates that that this is going to be the last quarter that we\u2019re going to see good volume originations from our refinance activity. ","So it could last a couple more quarters, sure it could last through the end of the year. Your guess is as good as mine but there is a lot of opportunity out there. We start the quarter with a very strong pipeline, one of the strongest pipelines in our history, so we feel confident and we\u2019re optimistic about continued originations in the mortgage business. ","Tim Sloan","Mike, think about this, the average rate in the portfolio, securities portfolio is 4.77% and the street rate is 3.25, 3.5, I don\u2019t know exactly where it is from day-to-day, but so on average there is at least a 100 basis point opportunity there, customers typically are using the money, they do that 50 basis points. Now it\u2019s going to be little more difficult, yet it is marketing and retail more important, absolutely, that\u2019s placed to us. We have the largest retail sales force, we have thousands of team members in our stores. We\u2019re talking to customers everyday and finding leads. So this is what we do. So again, I don\u2019t know how many quarters it\u2019s going to be. I don\u2019t know all that. But I am optimistic.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","And under the bad category, the loan utilization has not improved a whole lot. I guess you\u2019re saying it\u2019s good because you\u2019re moving market share, but why isn\u2019t loan utilization going up, why is it there\u2019s more demand from the customers?","John Stumpf","Most of our commercial customers, their balance sheets are strong as I have seen in years and years. They are sitting with tons of liquidity and cash flows. So what -- it\u2019s kind of logical that they would use our cash firstly they would borrow. But a good part of that whole story is we are growing in spite of that. The day will come when they will start to use those lines again. We\u2019ve already had all the embedded costs, just think what happens then. So I view this as kind of good, not a bad. ","Mike Mayo - CLSA","And then the ugly, I know you don\u2019t call this as ugly, the last margin question. And you brought up that last year grew despite the margin and all that, but late quarter didn\u2019t look as good. Look if you core deposit pricing goes down by two basis points and your loan repricing goes down by five and your securities pricing goes down by 11. That\u2019s not a good formula. So when do you think that margin decline goes away?","Tim Sloan","You know what, if you tell me where rates are going to be on any scenario then I can give you a better idea. I don\u2019t know where rates are going to go, Mike. I think it\u2019s a very fair question, right.","But the important thing, right, when you think about Wells Fargo is not to be overly focused on the net interest margin. We get half -- about half of our income through spread income. We get about half of our income through fee income. You saw diversified growth on the spread income side in terms of loans, the best that we had in a long time, right. More important -- as important, you saw diversified growth in fees.","And so, sure we\u2019re on that the net interest margin is under pressure. But even in a quarter where the net interest margin was down 10 basis points. Again, mostly because of deposits what we think long-term is a great thing, in terms of growing that deposit growth, our net interest income was about flat, right. I view that as pretty strong performance in this environment.","John Stumpf","And I also suggest a lot of companies would kill for our margin. Feel pretty good. I mean, yeah, it\u2019s come down but for the all the reasons that Tim said, why would we turn away deposits from our customers. It -- we are not -- surely we look at the margin, surely we think about that, but we don\u2019t run a business according to it.","So and I know we\u2019ve had this discussion many times. But for a company that can grow revenue 6% to 7% without any help really, much help from the -- from half of your revenue side that\u2019s a very strong company.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","All right. Thank you.","John Stumpf","Thank you.","Tim Sloan","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Marty Mosby with Guggenheim.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim","Good morning.","John Stumpf","Good morning, Marty.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim","I want to follow-up on. Hey, I want to follow-up on one of the questions that your answer to Mike on the refinance activity. You brought up that the average rate is $4.75, the street rate is around $3.50. So half of your customers are still in a position where they should refinance?","What are the two main reasons that are holding them up with all the HARP out there and all the other programs and initiatives, what helps to get those customers back in front of you and able to do the refinancing, at this point they really should be able to do?","Tim Sloan","Yeah. Marty, I don\u2019t know or wouldn\u2019t necessarily agree that it\u2019s half of the servicing customers. It\u2019s certainly a large portion. So if you think our servicing portfolio is about $1.9 trillion, I think, when you look at how we\u2019ve cut the servicing portfolio and some of the work that we did last quarter that we provided, I think, the numbers probably a quarter to maybe a third of the $1.9 trillion.","What keeps some people as they are toward the end of the maturity of their loan and they look at it and say, you know what it doesn\u2019t make sense or they\u2019ve got other things to do or their loan -- their LTV might be high and it might, they might be -- they could, excuse me, they could apply for the HARP program and it takes a while to do that. So there is a lot reasons why folks do it. It\u2019s not because our team is not out there working very hard to try to help them refinance their loans.","John Stumpf","Yeah. I would also say that there has been so much volume coming that it\u2019s taken 90 days or it\u2019s been a long process. Now that we\u2019ve built up our team, we are looking more at. We can shorten that period of time which it takes to refinance is 60 days. So, I think, that\u2019s an advantage.","But the real advantage is, we\u2019ve got this retail distribution, working together is, all our personal bankers and commercial bankers who look for these opportunities refer to a mortgage company, so that\u2019s really one of our strengths and how we are going to harvest this and serve these customers.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim","Okay. Staying on mortgage for a second, if you look at the hedging value at 67 basis points, we actually saw an uptick couple of basis points this quarter. As you\u2019re looking at rates now moving really in an upward direction at some pace in the future. What are you doing with your hedging, such that, you lightened the bite of the hedging negatives as rates go up and allow the value of the increased value and servicing as the extension of the life bringing some of that to the bottom line to help offset whatever, down draft you might see on the origination side.","Tim Sloan","We\u2019re not going to fundamentally change our hedging strategy. We don\u2019t want to think about the MSR as a way to speculate on interest rates, right. That\u2019s just not -- none of us around here are smart enough to know where interest rates are going to go. But we are pretty good at doing what our mortgage team is very good at doing. And that is putting a hedge in place that keeps the appropriate level of risk so that we can look at our servicing asset and generates the income based upon the fundamentals of the business as opposed to the direction of rates. ","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim","And I guess instead of really betting on interest rate, there\u2019s almost like we\u2019re paying for insurance that you don\u2019t really need to have because further drops in interest rates are not as feasible as it will be before rates were higher?","Tim Sloan","Marty, that\u2019s a fair point except you know what if we were sitting here a year ago we might have said the same thing and then we would\u2019ve been wrong we would have a big loss in the MSR, we\u2019ve had to on hedge, and you could have said the same thing two years ago. So at some point you\u2019re going to be absolutely right, I just not and we\u2019re not smart enough to know exactly when that inflection point is going to be and we\u2019re just not going to use the MSR to speculate on rates. ","John Stumpf","This is a really good business and that\u2019s not making any sense for us. ","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim","When you look at the asset quality and the net charge-offs dropping down to -- if you take the OCC impact of around 89 basis points. So we have gone from 130 in the fourth quarter last year to a little less than 90 basis points. That trend, you would think, as the underwriting and the lack of demand and the cleanup in the portfolio and run off of some of the more troubled portfolios or ones that have a little bit more pressure could really in a good time end up less than 75 basis points. Do you kind of see that migration over the next couple years?","Tim Sloan","I hope you\u2019re correct. I think we\u2019ve got to be a little bit careful because in some of our businesses we\u2019re already experiencing much less than typical loan losses, for example in the wholesale business. It\u2019s about as good as it is going to get. Now we could see a little bit of improvement but that part of the business we\u2019ve already seen a decline. The disproportionate share of our loan losses continue to come from the home equity portfolio, that portfolio continues to reduce in terms of overall size. ","So we\u2019re hopeful that the loan-loss rate that we experienced in net or gross of the OCC guidance will continue to go down, whether or not we can get to 75 basis points only time\u2019s going to tell but we\u2019re clearly going in the right direction. ","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim","And then last question, thanks for spending so much time, is you talked about the yield curve steepened at the end of the year that you started to go and hit some of those higher yields. What kind of critical level are you looking at in a sense that the yield curve can steepen as we saw much quicker than the Fed ever starts to tighten interest rate? As you start thinking about deploying liquidity, what are some of the levels that your [Alco] guidelines or thought process brings you to be a little more aggressive on the liquidity side?","Tim Sloan","Well, Marty, if you look back at where rates rose to right toward the end of year. So we think about the two inflection points that we saw was a few days to a week period as the fiscal cliff negotiations seemed to be going fairly well, that rates backed up pretty significantly and that was a good indication of some of the inflection points that we were looking at. And then likewise when the Fed minutes were released last week and it was a little bit of surprise in terms of the dissension or healthy conversations minutes, maybe that\u2019s a better way to describe it among the various our Fed governors, voters and not that rates rose again and we took an opportunity -- we took that opportunity to buy. So it\u2019s at those levels we feel are pretty attractive over a long-term basis. ","John Stumpf","Marty, we don\u2019t have any sad number that we say this is a number that which we will buy for the next 30 or 60 day or whatever. It\u2019s a very dynamic that are in process. We\u2019re looking, we\u2019re reading, we\u2019re thinking, we\u2019re -- so that\u2019s kind of how we go about this. And with the bias towards conservatism and making sure that we understand in the whole asset liability mix and so forth. ","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research LLC.","Nancy Bush - NAB Research","One sort of universal question, it\u2019s applicable to you and I think it\u2019s applicable to the industry as well. Your ROE has improved to about 13%, which is one of the better ROEs in the industry. So, I guess, my question is how do we look at normalized ROE, not only for you, but for the rest of the industry? I mean, the 13% is good. It\u2019s below your historical levels. Is it desirable or is it possible to get back to those historical levels?","Tim Sloan","Yeah. That\u2019s a really good question. I think that fundamental to the question is just that when you look at the level of equity that the industry is going to have to hold in the next few years or beyond that is just higher than it was pre-crisis. So, I think, it\u2019s unlikely when you compare pre-crisis return on equity to post-crisis what we are experiencing now that we are going to get back to that high teens that even in some quarters low 20s returns on equity.","Now, having said that, at our Investor Day we provided a range of return on equity between 12% and 15%, the reason we provided that range is that the level of economic activity and interest rates as we know can drive our return. So, our best guess is that in the current environment relatively slow growing economy that we\u2019re obviously making the best of that in lower rates, we think will be the middle to lower end of that range. If rates tick up and the economy starts to pick up a bit, we think we can be at the higher end of that range and hopefully get up to the mid-teens. Hopefully that helps.","Nancy Bush - NAB Research","A question for you, John, I mean, the QM, I don\u2019t know, how it has come out relative to what the industry expected. But it\u2019s clearly going to keep some people out of mortgage market, who got into the mortgage market before. You expect that that now that we have the QM and you are going to be getting, I think, a higher quality customers resolve that the consumer groups are now going to start screaming about people being kept out of the mortgage market, who were getting mortgage loans before?","John Stumpf","No. It\u2019s hard to speculate or comment with any confidence on what others might see in it. I guess, I\u2019d just go back to couple of things. First of all, I don\u2019t know everything that\u2019s in the 800 and some pages. But what I do know about it, it solved a couple of issues I think are really important.","It created a broad standard or we got as many loans as possible into the QM definition. And number two, there is good clarity around legal protections and risk and so forth. And there is also a debt to income or consumer debt or mortgage debt vis-\u00e0-vis income. So there are some bright lines.","Hopefully, that will encourage more participants in the industry, more borrowers and I think that\u2019s all good. Now, whether in that -- but I don\u2019t think that alone will open up the floodgates of credit because all these other things went on that I had mentioned that are still unresolved, but I think this is a step in the right direction. I really do.","Nancy Bush - NAB Research","Okay. Thirdly, I would just ask you a question that could have been hanging around the Atlantic article which highlighted your accounting issues. This is not new. It\u2019s bringing up a lot of the issues that have been brought up before. Can you just give me your reaction to that and is there anything that you or anybody else in the industry can do to make some of these things like VIEs more transparent?","John Stumpf","First, let\u2019s talk about transparency. We want -- in fact this team is available to anyone of you and call us, we\u2019re not hearing these things from our investors. When I became CEO, we reinstituted or started the live call. We have the credit supplement.","The company is a pretty plain vanilla in the way we operate the company. Yeah, there are -- there is levels one, twos and three assets in this but that doesn\u2019t make them less credible just that sometimes there is not market prices we can do. So we have to go through cash flows and establish values that way.","I have never seen us to be more transparent. So if there is other things we can do, I\u2019m all ears for it. But I\u2019m not hearing that from investors and frankly I\u2019m not hearing that kind of commentary from most of the people including analysts that I talk to. But people are going to write what they want to write and they can make their own choices about where they invest their money.","Nancy Bush - NAB Research","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Chris Mutascio with Stifel Nicolaus.","Chris Mutascio - Stifel Nicolaus","Good morning, John and Tim, happy New Year to you.","John Stumpf","Hey, happy New Year, Chris.","Tim Sloan","Happy New Year.","Chris Mutascio - Stifel Nicolaus","And Tim, I had a real quick question for you a follow up on the reserves. You mentioned that your reserve releases will be lower in \u201813 than \u201812, but they could still continue to some degree. If I back out the charge-offs from the OCC guidance related charge-offs in both third quarter and this quarter, because I think you guys have mentioned they were already reserved for. It looks like that you did under provide last quarter, provision was $200 million lower the net charge-offs. But this quarter if I backed them out your provision would be $70 million higher. So in essence have the reserve releases already ended?","Tim Sloan","No. Not at all.","Chris Mutascio - Stifel Nicolaus","Okay.","Tim Sloan","There are so many puts and takes that go into our reserve release -- our reserving methodology that ultimately than produces our reserve release or if you look back a few years of reserve bill, I wouldn\u2019t just focus on the impact of the OCC guidance as the primary driver for that, just a lot of puts and takes. And if we thought that the reserve releases had ended, we\u2019d say so.","Chris Mutascio - Stifel Nicolaus","Okay. Is there any thought, I mean, you may have asked this before and I know it\u2019s a difficult question to answer, but with FASB and with the environment we are from a regulatory perspective and where reserves were heading into the crisis? Any thought of where reserve to loans in a range and up post re-regulation versus the financial crisis? If we were at one to one in a quarter pre-crisis are we up to $1.50 to $1.75 when all is said and done on a reserve to loan basis or is that still too difficult to us retain?","Tim Sloan","That\u2019s a really fair question and I wish we had a great answer for you, but there has been a lot of discussion and a lot of commentaries and jawboning from the regulators on this topic. So I would describe it as a work in process.","We think that we\u2019re appropriately reserved and we are hopeful that overtime our reserves can come down as long as our portfolio -- the credit losses and the portfolio continues to improve which is what we\u2019ve been seeing.","Chris Mutascio - Stifel Nicolaus","All right. Well, thank you for the answer and good luck to you the rest of the year.","Tim Sloan","Thank you.","John Stumpf","Thanks.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Andrew Marquardt with Evercore Partners.","John Stumpf","Hey, Andrew.","Tim Sloan","Hi, Andrew.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners","Good morning, guys. How are you?","John Stumpf","Good.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners","A couple of ticky-tack questions for you. First on the margins, this last quarter you went through a couple of items in terms of the cash build burden, in terms of the NIM impact and reprising. But then also there was variable sources benefited few basis points. What was that or what is that and how do we think about that? Is it seasonal one timer, how do we think about that?","Tim Sloan","I think that as we\u2019ve described variable it\u2019s a broad definition. The primary drivers this quarter for the variable income was higher fee income. So what that means is that when we have a loan we are -- and we charge a fee on a loan, that fee generally accrues over the life of the loan. When that loan is paid off early then we go ahead and recognize any of the unamortized portion of the loan fee.","So, that was a primary driver this quarter. I wouldn\u2019t call it seasonal or one time. We see that from time to time within the business. Some quarters, it\u2019s higher, sometimes it\u2019s lower.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners","Got it. Was it about the same last quarter or was this quarter a little bit higher?","John Stumpf","I\u2019ll go back and look. I think it was a little bit higher this quarter. And again that\u2019s not a typical for -- in terms of the -- but the amount of the variation is not a typical to what we\u2019ve seen on a quarterly basis but it was a little bit higher.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners","Okay. Thanks. And then on asset quality and the reserve question, Chris I think just mentioned.","John Stumpf","Yeah.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners","I wanted to ask more granularly on Hurricane Sandy implications you had mentioned it on the earlier comments in your release. How much of an impact was it really this quarter, was it in charge-offs, less reserve release, how do we think about it?","John Stumpf","It really wasn\u2019t in the absolute charge off number because it was -- we think about the timing of Hurricane Sandy. So, it was probably -- it was primarily in the reserve -- in the methodology that we use. We assume that we are going to have some additional losses in the future from Hurricane Sandy.","So, we wanted to make sure that we were appropriately reserve which we believe we are based upon our best estimates right now. But as you can appreciate, we\u2019re very early into our true analysis or finalizing the analysis. It\u2019s going to take a while to see what the ultimate impact is. But we think there were appropriate reserve based upon some conservatism assumptions right now.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners","Can you quantify how much the impact was this quarter?","John Stumpf","I\u2019d rather not. It was any -- the reason I don\u2019t want to go into the specific details is because when you think about the reserving methodology, again there\u2019s lots of puts and takes. Some things go up, some things go down but just rest assured that we think we are appropriately reserved.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just lastly on the tax rate, even adjusting for the settlement this quarter, it looks like -- the tax rate looks a little bit low 31% on an adjusted basis. How do we think -- is that lower than what it\u2019s been recently, is that a new kind of run rate or should we think about going back another 33%, 34% rate?","Tim Sloan","Yeah. What I would do -- that\u2019s a fair question. What I would do is go along the direction that you are and that is a back out the impact that we had in the fourth quarter and which is why we called that out, because we don\u2019t think 27% is sustainable. And then you get to that the number that you are talking about 31%, 32%. I think that 31%, 32%, 33% is a reasonable number. But it\u2019s more likely to go up a bit in 2013 and what we\u2019ve seen in 2012.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners","Okay. Great. Thanks guys.","Jim Rowe","Okay. Thanks very much everybody. We had a full set of discussions and we really appreciate your interest in Wells Fargo. Happy New Year again and we will see you at the end of the first quarter.

Thank you for joining us today. The second quarter was another strong quarter for Wells Fargo. We earned $5.7 billion in the quarter by our continued focused on creating long-term shareholder value to meeting our customers' financial needs including growing loans and deposits and deepening our relationships with our customers. ","Let me highlight our growth during the second quarter compared with a year ago. We generated earnings of $5.7 billion, up 4% from a year ago and earnings per share up $1.01 per share, up 3% from a year ago. We had strong and broad based loan growth and our core loan portfolio is up $51.3 billion or 7%. Our credit performance continued to improve with total net charge-offs down $435 million or 38% from a year ago, and our net charge-off ratio was only 35 basis points annualized on average loans. Our outstanding deposit franchise continues to generate strong growth. With total deposit up $97 billion or 9%. We've grown deposits by an average of $265 million everyday over the past year. We deepened relationships across our company. Retail banking cross-sell was 6.17 products per household. Wholesale banking cross-sell was 7.2 products and wealth, brokerage and retirement cross-sell was 10.44 products. We reduced expenses from a year ago while we continue to invest in our businesses including strengthening our risk management infrastructure.","We also follow through our commitment to maintain strong capital ratios while returning more capital to shareholders. In the second quarter we increased our common stock dividend by 17% and continued to reduce our share count. We returned our net $3.6 billion to shareholders in the second quarter, up significantly from $1.6 billion a year ago. I am also proud that during the second quarter Wells Fargo was ranked the most respected bank in the world and the 11th most respected company overall according to Barron's Magazine 2014 ranking of the world's most respected companies. This recognition is a result of our dedicated team members remaining focused on our consistent vision and their commitment to meeting our customers' financial needs. ","While the economic recovery remains uneven, there are many indicators that economic growth is accelerating and we remain optimistic about the opportunities the recovery provide to Wells Fargo and for our customers. The strong improvement employment in June demonstrated the strength in a labor market with unemployment at lowest level since September 2008. The housing market rebound remained on-track with home prices up 8% from a year ago and up 25% from the low in June 2011. Despite these increases home affordability continued to remain attractive due to historically low mortgage rates and rising household incomes. In June, the conference board's measure of consumer confidence reached a six year high and vehicle sales reached an eight year high. The economy is also benefiting from strong energy production with domestic crude oil production running at the highest level in 26 years and our reliance on foreign energy sources has been falling for nearly a decade. ","I am confident that the economic recovery and our diversified business model will continue to provide opportunities for future growth as we remain focused on helping our customers meet their financial needs. ","Now John Shrewsberry, our CFO will provide more details on our second quarter results. John? ","John Shrewsberry ","Thanks, John. And good morning everyone. My comments will follow the presentation included in the quarterly supplement starting on Page 2. John and I will then answer your questions. Wells Fargo had a very strong quarter as demonstrated by fundamental drivers of long-term growth. We earned $5.7 billion in the second quarter; down a $167 million from the first quarter but keep in mind our results last quarter included a $423 million discrete tax benefit and $0.08 per share impact. Our pre-tax income grew $303 million from the first quarter. Revenue grew from first quarter including both net interest income and noninterest income. Core loans grew 8% annualized and average deposits grew 9% annualized. We grew pre-tax, pre-provision profit for the third consecutive quarter and credit quality continued to improve. Capital remains strong and we returned more capital to shareholders. I will highlight the drivers of this growth throughout the call today.","As John highlighted and as you can see on Page 3, we had strong year-over-year growth in loans and deposits. Our growth in EPS and net income reflected this benefit along with the reduction in expenses and an improvement in credit quality. Our results were driven by momentum across many of our businesses. One way to demonstrate this business momentum is through noninterest income growth. Mortgage fees while up from first quarter were down $1.1 billion from a year ago due to lower refinancing volume. Excluding mortgage fees, fee income was up 9% from a year ago reflecting broad based growth in retail brokerage, deposit service charges, card fees, commercial real estate brokerage commissions, trust and investment management, merchant processing and market sensitive revenue. That's the benefit of our diversification. We have over 90 businesses focused on meeting our customers' financial needs. We also grew net interest income from a year ago. And as you know growing net interest income measured in dollars has been our focus as deposits and other sources of liquidity have growth more rapidly than loan demand or other attractive investment opportunities.","Page 4 highlights our revenue diversification. While our balance between net interest income and noninterest income has been consistent, the drivers of noninterest income can vary each quarter. For example, equity investments were 9% of our fee income in the first quarter but declined to 4% in the second quarter. Other businesses such as deposits, investment banking and mortgage contributed more to fee income this quarter resulting in overall fee income growth demonstrating the benefit of diversified business model.","Let me highlight some of the key drivers of our second quarter results from a balance sheet and income statement perspective starting on Page 5. Our balance sheet is never been stronger, capital liquidity, asset quality, funding mix are all exceedingly strong. We increased average earnings assets by 3% from the first quarter by growing loans, increasing short-term investment in trading assets and purchasing securities. In addition, our credit quality continues to improve. Investment securities increased $8.7 billion from first quarter reflecting $17 billion of purchases primarily U.S. Treasuries and federal agency debt partially offset by run off. We also improved our liquidity position in response to continued heightened regulatory expectations. We issued $7.8 billion of liquidity related long-term debt and increased liquidity related short-term funding by $5.9 billion. Total short-term investments grew to $238.7 billion which helps us meet our regulatory obligations and provides dry powder to grow loan and invest in securities.","Turning to the income statement on Page 6, revenue grew $441 million with growth in both net interest income and noninterest income. The $246 million growth in noninterest expense was primarily due to higher revenue based incentive compensation and deferred compensation expense and an increase in operating losses primarily from litigation accruals related to various legal matters. I'll explain the drivers of our expenses in more detail later on the call. ","Income tax expense increased from the first quarter which included $423 million discrete tax benefit. As shown on Page 7, we continue to have strong, broad based loan growth in the second quarter. Our 12th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth even with the continued reduction in our liquidating portfolio of $56.5 billion over the same time period. Our core portfolio which excludes our liquidating portfolio grew by $51.3 billion or 7% from a year ago and was up $15.2 billion or 8% annualized from the first quarter. Period end loans were up $29 billion or 4% from a year ago and up $2.5 billion from the first quarter. This growth was impacted by the transfer of $9.7 billion of government guaranteed student loans to held for sale which removes them from total loans. These student loans have been included within our liquidating portfolio since we stopped originating them in 2010. We transferred this portfolio to held for sale at the end of the second quarter reflecting our intent to sell our entire government guaranteed portfolio. However, we remained committed to the private student lending business. Excluding this transfer, total loans would have increased to $12.2 billion or 6% annualized linked quarter.","On Page 8 we highlight how broad -based our loan growth continues to be at Wells Fargo. C&I loans were up $19.4 billion or 10% from a year ago as we successfully grew loans across our commercial businesses including asset backed, corporate, government, commercial and asset based. Real-estate 1 to 4 family first mortgage loans grew $7.3 billion or 3% with growth in high quality nonconforming mortgage primarily jumbo loans. Foreign loans grew $6.2 billion or 15% from a year ago reflecting growth in trade finance and the U.K. Commercial Real Estate acquisition we completed in the third quarter of last year. Auto loans were $5.5 billion or 11% reflecting strong origination as we remained the number one auto lender in the country while maintaining our focus on pricing for risk. Commercial real estate loans were $4.4 billion or 4% reflecting new origination and an acquisition in the third quarter of last year. Credit card balances were $2.4 billion or 10% with new accounts up 4%. Our growth rate has been above the industry average reflecting new account growth, product enhancement and increased usage among our existing customers. Deposit growth also remained strong in the second quarter with average deposits growing $91.7 billion or 9% from a year ago and up $24.2 billion from the first quarter, up 9% annualized. Average deposits totaled $1.1 Trillion and we benefited from strong growth in both commercial and consumer balances. Our average deposit cost declined to 10 basis points in the second quarter, down 1 basis point from the first quarter and down 4 basis points from a year ago. Our ability to generate strong deposit growth while reducing deposit cost demonstrated the fundamental strength of our outstanding deposit franchise. We have been able to grow deposits by offering best in class products and excellent customer experience and robust multi channel option. Our primary consumer checking customers were up 4.6% from a year ago. Our ability to grow primary customers is important to our results because these customers have more interaction with us, have higher cross-sell and are more than twice as profitable as non primary customers. ","As shown on Page 10, tax equivalent net interest income increased $184 million from first quarter benefiting from an additional day in the quarter organic loan growth in higher mortgages held for sale in trading assets. Our NIM declined from the first quarter to 3.15% driven by customer deposit growth which essentially neutral to net interest income but reduced the margin by approximately five basis points. Liquidity related actions we took in the second quarter to meet increase regulatory liquidity expectations reduced the margin by one basis point however higher income from variable sources including higher PCI resolutions and periodic dividends offset this decline. Balance sheet repricing in growth once again did not impact the NIM this quarter as the majority of the repricing from the higher rate environment to the current rate environment is behind us. ","Noninterest income increased $265 million from the first quarter with growth across our diversified businesses including mortgage banking, investment banking, deposit service charges, card fees, retail brokerage, commercial real estate brokerage and insurance, offsetting a $460 million decline in market sensitive revenue. Market sensitive revenue declined 34% from first quarter while all other noninterest income grew 8%. Trust and investment fees increased $197 million or 6% from first quarter on higher investment banking and retail brokerage asset based fees. Mortgage banking grew $213 million from first quarter, up 14% with growth in both originations and servicing. The second quarter benefited from a seasonally stronger purchase market with 74% of our originations coming from home purchases, up from 66% last quarter. Total originations increased to $47 billion, up 31% are unclosed pipeline increased to $30 billion at the end of the quarter, up 11%. We also continue to see improvement in our net servicing results for servicing revenue up $97 million from the first quarter reflecting higher MSR hedge performance and an increase in net servicing fees reflecting the benefit of lower servicing and foreclosure costs. ","As shown on Page 12, expenses were up $246 million from the first quarter while our efficiency ratio remained at 57.9% reflecting our revenue growth. The key drivers of our expenses included personnel expenses declined $106 million from the first quarter which included seasonally elevated incentive compensation and benefit cost, salary increased as expected due to annual merit increases and one extra day in the quarter. Personnel expense included $130 million of higher revenue based incentive compensation in the second quarter which is a type of expense increase we like to see because we are growing the top line. Additionally, personnel expenses were impacted by $84 million in higher deferred compensation expense which offset in trading revenue. Outside professional services and advertising expense increased from the first quarter levels which tend to be seasonally lower. And operating losses increased $205 million from the first quarter largely due to litigation accruals for various legal matters. We remained focused on managing expenses and we expect our efficiency ratio will remain within our target range of 55% to 59% for the third quarter. ","Turning to our business segment starting on Page 13, community banking earned $3.4 billion in the second quarter, up 6% from a year ago and down 11% from first quarter primarily from higher taxes. Retail banking cross-sell was 6.17 products per household, up from 6.14 a year ago. Our debit and credit card businesses continued to grow benefiting from account growth and higher usage. Debit card purchase volume was up 8% from a year ago driven primarily -- driven by primarily checking customer growth. Credit card purchase volume was 16% from a year ago with new account growth and more active accounts. Active accounts were up 14% as the Wells Fargo credit card is becoming more top- of-wallet for our customers. Credit card household penetration increased to 39%, up from 35% a year ago. We remained committed to serving our small business customers at an increased primary business checking account customers 5.2% from a year ago. During the second quarter, we launched Wells Fargo Works for Small Business, an initiative that provides guidance and services to small business owners. This new initiative is resulted in strong engagement with small businesses across the country including millions of views of our online video series and increased traffic to wellsfargoworks.com. ","Wholesale banking earned $2 billion in the second quarter down 3% from a year ago and up 12% from the first quarter. Loan growth remained strong and broad based across businesses, up 8% from a year ago and up 2% from first quarter. Capital finance increased $2 billion from first quarter driven by higher utilization rates, new customer growth and growth in factoring assets. Commercial banking grew $1.8 billion from the first quarter with widespread growth across geographies and industries. Commercial real estate grew $1.4 billion driven by new loan originations including customer M&A activity. In addition, corporate banking, government and institutional banking, asset backed financed and equipment financed portfolios all grew from the first quarter. Revenue increased 7% from the first quarter reflecting diversified growth across a number of wholesale banking businesses. Investment banking revenue growth was broad based across product categories. Eastdil Secured, our commercial real estate brokerage business increased revenue, strong performance in public and private markets. Asset management fees grew -- from increased market valuation and in flows. Total assets under management increased $35 billion from a year ago. Long-term assets including equity and fixed income strategies were up 12% while money market funds have declined by 4% from a year ago. The shift out of money market funds moderating growth in total asset under management but revenue benefited from the shift to higher fee generating long-term assets. Wholesale banking revenue also benefited from the sale of 40 insurance offices in the quarter. ","Wealth brokerage and retirement earned $544 million in the second quarter, up 25% from a year ago and up 15% from the first quarter. The strong year-over-year results reflected 9% revenue growth driven by recurring revenue. Net interest income was 11% from a year ago and asset based fees were up 14% benefiting from market performance and continued client demand for plan based advisory solutions. Our brokerage advisory assets have grown to $409 billion, up $78 billion or 24% from a year ago. Loan growth remained strong with average loans of 12% from a year ago driven by growth in high quality nonconforming mortgages in security based lending. We also benefited from the partnership involving WBR and community banking to better meet our customers' saving retirement planning and investment needs and we increased the number of private bankers in our banking stores by 22% from a year ago. ","Turning to Page 16, credit quality continue to improve with second quarter credit losses down $108 million from first quarter and the net charge-off ratio decline into 35 basis points of average loans. Losses in our commercial portfolio were only 3 basis points of average loans and consumer losses continue to decline to 62 basis points. Nonperforming assets have declined for seven consecutive quarters and were down $686 million from first quarter although the pace of improvement is slowed. We had a $500 million reserve release is same as in first quarter. We continue to expect future reserve releases, absent a significant deterioration in the economy but expect a lower level of future releases as the rate of credit improvement slows and the loan portfolio continues to grow. Our estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III using the advanced approach fully phased-in increased to 10.09% in the second quarter. Our share count declined in the quarter reflecting the repurchase of 39.4 million common shares and we executed a $1 billion forward repurchase contract which expected to settle in the third quarter for approximately 19.4 million shares. We expect our share count to continue to decline throughout 2014 as a result of anticipated net share repurchases. We also increased our dividend to $0.35 per share in the second quarter a 17% increase. Our net payout ratio in the second quarter was 66% in line with our recent guidance of 55% to 75%. ","In summary, our results in the second quarter demonstrated the momentum across our fundamental business drivers including growing loans and deposits, increasing both net interest income and noninterest income while credit improved and capital remained strong. While we've demonstrated our ability to grow during the variety of economic and interest rate environments, we are well positioned to benefit from an improving economy and higher rates. Our diversified business model provides us with many opportunities to better meet our customers' financial needs as economic growth become robust. Our strong balance sheet with our large balance of short-term investments primarily driven by our strong deposit growth provides us the ability to further grow loans and invest in securities. We are optimistic that our outstanding franchise and our focus on serving the real economy will continue to produce strong results. ","We will now open up the call for questions. Jim?","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","(Operator Instructions). Our first question will come from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question. ","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Hi, good morning. John, was wondering on the legal side of things. Can you give us a sense of what type of legal issues you are building reserves for? And also can you comment whether you are having discussion with the DOJ and mortgage task force, made up of state AGs that other banks are having discussion with?","John Shrewsberry ","The best disclosure for our legal activity is found in our Q and K where there is great detail on item that are probable and estimable and frankly even more matters, we can't comment on anything specifically. The items that I referred in the expense section or variety of matters that essentially added up to the number that you saw. ","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","On the loan growth, can you comment what you are seeing in terms of utilization of lines by customers, is that getting better and what's driving what appears to be slight kind of acceleration in the loan growth you saw this quarter. ","John Shrewsberry ","","Well, we called out one area where there has been an increase in utilization in the comments that was in capital finance but overall in wholesale banking utilization is relatively flat, it's ticked up just a little bit. So this is -- this loan growth isn't just driven by that. ","John Stumpf ","John, the nice thing about the loan growth is broad based. If you look at it's consumer, it's private banking area, commercial and cross so it's really broad based, it is one of the -- I think the strengths in what we have been doing the last number of quarters especially this quarter. ","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. And then last thing for me John on the net interest income side of things. Do you know at this point is the liquidity building you have been doing, is that done or you are not sure yet on that front? ","John Shrewsberry ","We think that where we stand today is probably about where you need to be and if the final rule making around LCR comes in a little bit differently then the actions that we have to take shouldn't materially change things so we are about where you need to be.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. And seems that the churn has stopped with your reinvestment rates kind of looking like they match your roll-off rates. So I guess from -- with that perspective in mind, are you looking to grow an interest income dollar kind of in line with loan growth from here or there are other factors we should think about? ","John Shrewsberry ","Well, you should be -- should look at the balance sheet at every period and assess what types of inflows we have of additional liquidity and what we have done with it. Some of will be loan growth, there will be more security growth; there will be some that sits in cash while we wait to make decision about securities investments. So the facts and circumstances will lead it on that path but back to your question about roll-off and roll-on, it appears that the NIM hasn't been diminished by a change in pricing scheme with respect to loans or securities for that better because of what you described. ","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein"," ","Okay. And you are still looking to grow net interest income from the current levels? Do you still think you can do that? ","John Stumpf ","Absolutely","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question. ","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks, good morning, everyone. Hi, there. I guess first was just on-- upon -- question on the loan growth. I guess specifically in C&I end of period loan were up little over $9 billion or almost 5% sequentially, the strongest increase to the past year. I was just curious little bit more what's driving that? Are you are seeing signs of increase confidence among borrowers and may be more of a willingness to make investment? ","John Stumpf ","Joe, this is John Stumpf. We are seeing that. As I am always talking with customers and our talking with our team, there is as I mentioned in my opening comments, there is more optimism. I think consumer confidence is at six year high. It is not breakout but it's -- we are having more discussion with more customers about buying homes, buying autos, investing in infrastructure if you are a business, buying something so we are real economy company. We are in the real economy and there are certain sectors of economy that are doing very well. We are big energy lender both on renewal side and the hydrocarbon side, plus the real estate has been very good for us, little market such it's very broad based.","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, that's great, thanks. I guess the other question was just if you could talk a little bit more about what's your experience has been in mortgage with the spring selling season. And how do you feel about both volumes and staffing levels for the rest of the year there?","John Shrewsberry ","Sure. Well, we've been pretty clear on the record that we found the spring selling season to be little less than we have originally imagined, although it is nice growth from the first quarter just based on the time of year. And our view on the whole year in terms of mortgage origination is not inconsistent with the MBA and other published metrics. So you can see our pipeline going into the third quarter higher than it was going into the second. So that's probably means good things for the third quarter relative to the second quarter. The margins are holding in there. But we are not seeing -- we are not seeing a breakout returns to pre crisis levels of the enthusiasm around home ownership and so the purchase market is softer than we thought that it would be. ","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets","And is that like to drive any other right sizing on the staffing side or do you feel pretty good about where you stand there? ","John Shrewsberry ","I think -- we have been very good at being flexible about that work force. And adding as we needed to as production volumes increased and then making changes as production volume decrease. So I think we are keeping that in sync with the production opportunity.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question. ","Erika Najarian - Bank of America, Merrill Lynch","Good morning. Hey, my first question is a follow up to John's line of questioning. The first is you feel like you in are where you need to be in terms of liquidity. And the majority of the repricing from the high interest environment as you said John to the current interest rate environment is behind you. Can we assume that Wells Fargo's net interest margin is close to the bottom with the wild card being deposit growth being stronger continuing to be stronger? ","John Stumpf ","I would say this way Erika. Again, we don't manage to the margin; deposit growth has an impact on the margin. What we say -- what we are saying is we are focused on growing net interest income and we believe we can do that. And loan demands been good and that is good for growing net interest income. Secondly, we have millions of dollars available in that cash flow if you will, to make investments at the right time so we are optimistic about growing net interest income over the long term. The margin will be impacted by -- cost growth has a big influence on that. And again most at neutral to income if not neutral to the margin.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America, Merrill Lynch","And the second follow up question just as we think about the next quarter's earnings power, I know that it is in the appendix that you did reclassify about $2 billion from nonaccretable difference to accretable yield and you are expecting the yield on the Pick-a-Pay portfolio or the accretable percentage to be 6.15% from 4.98% this quarter, is that going to have a positive impact on net interest margin as sequential basis as we take into account all the different components of the core balance sheet that we talked about so far in this call.","John Shrewsberry ","You should think about that as worth about $65 million per quarter in terms of incremental accreted interest income. It's related to the $1.9 billion re-class from nonaccretable yield to accretable yield and over the life that it will accrete under and based on the balance it's related to. Helpful? ","Erika Najarian - Bank of America, Merrill Lynch"," ","Got it. And just -- yes, and the third follow up question is another follow up to John's. I know you are not going to answer any questions about litigation in depth but I guess as we think about further accruals in your litigation reserve, can we expect as we think about the next few quarters Wells Fargo continuing to maintain at 55% to 59% efficiency ratio despite potential higher operating losses from legal accrual? ","John Shrewsberry","I would say that given everything that we know we anticipate operating between 55% and 59%. ","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question. ","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Thanks, good morning. First question just on the mortgage business. I am just wondering John, two things. First of all, just your general sense of the gain on sale environment, obviously it is continue to reset lower but do you think we've gone to more stable kind of base here?","John Stumpf ","Yes, I do. I think the margins have been running in that 140 to 160 range and from what we see there is rationality in pricing. And those margins are look reasonable to us. We have no reason to believe it will be markedly different from that in the near future. ","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","And my second mortgage question and the servicing fees line, it had a nice expansion but with the book not growing and rates back down, so I am wondering can you give us some context of what the growth driver has been underneath that servicing fees line? ","John Shrewsberry ","Well, so it's -- it has a lot to do with servicing expenses. So fewer on reimburse expenses coming through, fewer foreclosure and default expenses so it is more efficient servicing operation and more of the net fees flowing to the bottom line. ","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Okay. So we will see that all in the Q?","John Shrewsberry ","Yes. ","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Okay. Then my third question is just on capital and capital return. Clearly $0.35 dividend, you earned $1.01; so above the 30% threshold that we've known to be the benchmark. So given that we are now past this year's stress test, can you just give us your thoughts around flexibility around and above that 30%? And kind of your post-game on how you have looked at this year's stress test process in that regard.","John Shrewsberry ","We think 66% payout ratio comes with the combination of repurchase and dividend is an excellent spot to be in. It is between the goal post that we set up 55% to 75%. Can't be much more precise than that but we hear our shareholders loud and clear that they want more return of capital. We are committed to executing on that so that's about all the rest to say. And we look forward CCAR process. ","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Okay. Then my last tiny one related to that is just -- the buyback was bigger, the share count just dripped lower. How close are we to finally getting that average diluted share count really starting to move downward?","John Shrewsberry ","That's a good question. You can see the point-to-point numbers that have changed. The average is what it is just because of the timing in the quarter between when we issued shares to our benefit plans and when shares were repurchased with repurchase was little bit more even throughout that -- throughout the quarter and the issuance was a little bit more front end loaded. So the average didn't change as much as the point-to-point but it will be probably be like that during quarter where there is slightly heavier issuance but yet we expect the net number to trend down the way we've described it. ","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead with your question.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Hi, what was the amount of gain on the sale of the 40 insurance branches? ","John Shrewsberry ","About a $100 million ","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Okay. And conceptually was there anything that offset that? I guess you had the increase in litigation accruals of $200 million. Anything else that would be kind of nonpermanent?","John Shrewsberry ","It's tough to describe expenses as permanent and non-permanent. I know you are looking for an offset for that non recurring revenue but the expense story is the efficiency ratio story, if we've got for example this quarter higher incentive compensation related to revenue growth that's going to move things around. We've got our deferred comp hedging that moves things around. So it is hard to give you a neat offset to that.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","How about the run rate in minority expense? There was a decline and that helped a little bit. Is that permanent? ","John Shrewsberry","It's hard to say whether that's permanent or not. We will work with Jim Rowe and get you something specific. So we can responsive to that","Mike Mayo - CLSA"," ","Okay. And then the increase in investment banking linked quarter was up a lot. Can you give any context to that? ","John Shrewsberry ","It's broad based so there is some equity capital market, debt capital markets, loans indication, M&A activity, it was just a busier quarter, I think that our investment banking share might have picked up a little bit but the whole market was busier in the second quarter than it was in first quarter. ","Mike Mayo - CLSA"," ","And mortgage originations, as you mentioned they were up linked quarter. And it seemed a little bit better than what you were saying at the Investor Day. So were things a little bit better? And if so, why? I know it's not as much as you originally thought for the spring selling season. But that's a little bit of a bump and I guess you expect a little more of a bump in the third quarter.","John Shrewsberry ","Well, the gain was at the low end of the range which is how we thought about and described in Investor Day. In terms of volumes they were -- I think we feel about the same as we did six weeks ago which it is was less than we had originally anticipated. So we feel about the same. We are glad the results are good. They are certainly up seasonally quarter-over-quarter. But we might have imagined a little bit more going in to year.","John Stumpf ","Mike, about 74% of our originations are production this quarter was purchase money and that really plays into our hand. We have long-term relationships with realtors and builders. We have a wonderful crew of people who are our team members are out calling so we should expect to do better vis-\u00e0-vis because others who don't have a sales force on the ground. ","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Okay. And then last question. I guess what -- I'd ask two sides of the same question. Are you taking too much risk in an area such as auto lending, where the loans are up 10% year-over-year? You have had some cautionary language from regulators, and it seems like every bank is expanding in auto lending. So are you concerned about that? On the other hand are you taking enough risk? Because based on our models which go back a couple decades, it looks like your net charge-off ratio for the firm is the lowest ever in modern history. So that would say take more risk. So where do you come out on that decision?","John Stumpf ","Well, Mike, you hit both side right. I mean it is I think 35 bases -- it is loss - I remember in my 37 years with the company and in the auto area specifically we looked carefully at what's going on with FICO scores and we look at delinquencies and a whole bunch of things there. So no I don't think we are taking inappropriate risks. Is that going for taking the right risks and we are finding the right place? And after all this is a business that we have been in long time and we don't come and show up and leave and secondly it is a short -dated asked that we know a lot about -- ","John Shrewsberry ","And you probably recall at Investor Day we had a specific slide on disclosure on the growth in the auto portfolio in particular that showed among other things over a long period of time what's been going on in our portfolio with FICO scores, average loan to value and payment to income ratio of our auto customers. And each of those has improved, not only over the last five years but improved meaningfully from pre crisis levels. So the portfolio actually looks really good. Our relationship with -- and autos and our business proposition there is that we own the relationship with dealers. We banked the dealers directly, we provide them with floor plan financing, and we provide them with real estate financing. We bank them personally and we are a very reliable takeout for indirect auto paper and we get more than our fair share as a result of the paper we want and the portfolio composition reflects that. ","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question. ","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Hi, thanks much. A couple questions. One is on the mortgage origination side. And I think you were doing some rollouts on July 1. Just wanted to see how those executed, and now that that's behind you, are there any opportunities to make that side of the business more efficient.","John Shrewsberry ","When you say rollout, do you mean changes in headcount? ","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Well, there were some technology changes and some systems-related changes, process-related changes that you did effective July 1.","John Stumpf ","Well, Betsy, we have been doing a number of those over a period of time, be more efficient and to give our sales force more information upon sale but that's not a big issue. I mean those things happen, that haven't any impact on the business. ","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then just looking forward a little bit less positive on the outlook for volumes for the full year. Is there any opportunity to peel back some of the investment in the production side of the business? Or are you sticking with your current plan at this stage?","John Shrewsberry ","We are very flexible about that. And constantly reading what we think we need in terms of capacity. As you know, the work force in that line of business has become flexible work force just because of the ebbs and flows of origination patterns as a refinancing opportunity comes into the money and then goes away. So I think we are very real time in responding and what we think we need. And if we think that we need more because the third quarter opportunity seems bigger then we will staff it up and if we think that we need less then we will dial it back."," ","John Stumpf ","Betsy, you are on important point and I think it has been asked couple of times this morning. In the mortgage's business besides having to be good underwriter, good servicers, and all those things, good at flexibility, wrapping up and wrapping down is a core competency here. And if you are in this business and you have to be good at that. ","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay. One other thing -- ","John Stumpf ","No. You never know what the volumes are going to be. ","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Sure; no. Then one of the things you did mention at Investor Day is that Mel Watt obviously had some suggestions for underwriting and potentially changing some of the elements of the grid and I know that you had indicated that there were several meetings that you were going to be taking -- that were taking place with you and others in DC around those suggestions. Can you give us any sense as to how those dialogues have been going? Any update on how you're thinking about underwriting in the credit box?","John Stumpf ","Well, those meetings with our mortgage company continue with Mel Watt and his team and others. I think the goals here is to get more credit corporately to borrowers who want to own homes and who can afford homes. And that's in the interest of borrowers; it is in interest of lenders like us, and interest in investors and the country. So we are trying to harmonize that. Some things in the past created less harmony. You low rates at one side encouraging borrowing and you have put backs from the GSEs on the other side that make lenders less willing to lend money. So we are trying to get everybody on the same page. I think he has been helpful in that and obviously we are participating in that. So and as we get more clarity there we can make loans, confirming loans that serve more customers. That's the goal there. ","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay. As I know you'd spent a lot of time with the FHA, and that at the margin helped open the credit box in certain parts. I mean do you feel like you're at the stage where we're likely to see any changes come this year? Or it's really more of a next-year event with the GSEs?","John Stumpf ","Well, I'll tell you predicting what happen in Washington on legislation is -- that's way above my pay scale so but the important point is here is that there are some incremental changes happening and that's helping open the credit box a bit and corporately so we are still doing full underwriting and those sort of things. But I hate to venture a guess on when GSE reform will become law. ","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Right. No, I was asking really more about when your credit box on GSEs would loosen up potentially versus what had happened at the FHA where you have already loosened up a little bit there so -- ","John Stumpf ","I understand, okay. Well, we are just -- we're keep working on that and I think there is lot of emphasis on may be sure again corporate customers get loans that they can repay. ","John Shrewsberry ","And capturing that first time buyer that lower credit quality customer may be very -- will be very important to that customer when credit becomes available but not likely to change the overarching view of what the size of the mortgage market is in 2014 or 2015. And it is not likely to have a big impact on earnings of mortgage originators. There is not that much going on there. It is very important to them but there aren't enough for those loans at 140 basis points to make a giant different. ","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","","Good morning. It seems like from here the efficiency ratio will be increasingly important, just given how low the credit costs are at these levels and you talked about maybe some less reserve release going forward. So just as we think about that efficiency ratio and being closer to the higher end, is there opportunity to migrate down in this environment? And if so, how do we think about the expense opportunity versus growing revenues?","John Shrewsberry ","Sure. Well, we are -- I will stand out by saying we are sticking with our 55% to 59% because that's where we think we will be through the cycle. We constantly focus on our efficiency, we spend a lot of time in that many programs designed to root out and to get the bottom of the most efficient use in resources that we can have. And that's important because there are areas where we continue to spend and invest money to have the right people facing customers and investing the right product for customers. And there are also areas like risk management, compliance, technology etcetera where we are making increasing investment to build the better company for the future. So all that's going on at the same time. And it would arrive that this 55% to 59%. You can rest assure that we are doing what we can to keep expense as efficient but I wouldn't count on a big lever there moving down closer to 55% all other things being equal to drive near-term performance.","John Stumpf ","So couple examples of things that we are doing. As you know about since the merger five years ago we've reduced the number of square feet that we used to house our people and through our stores and so forth from 100 let say 15 or 17 million square feet to 94-95 million square feet. We are testing and successfully so a new urban store if you will, neighborhood store, we have now three of those in the Washington area, have a very different expense component but still just as productive. So there is a lots of things we are working on. So we can use those dollars and savings to invest in other areas of business that John mentioned. Expense -- there is lot of focus on that here but not -- again I have said in the past we are not slavish to it. If our expenses grow because revenues growing up, that's a good thing. And we will make the investment that we believe will make-- need to make for the long-term success of the company. ","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","Okay. So if I am hearing you correctly, as we think about the efficiency ratio going forward, there may be some opportunities for it to tick down a little bit, more dependent on revenue.","John Stumpf ","I would say yes surely, it is a ratio. So no matter it is denominator, we are working both side of it. ","John Shrewsberry ","","And as we've said publicly in the past to the extent that we had revenue increases as a result of rates moving up. We probably migrate to the lower end of efficiency ratio because those dollars of revenue don't have expense attached to them. ","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank"," ","Okay. Yes, I'm harping on it because the efficiency ratio hasn't really moved the last several quarters. As we start thinking about the back half of the year and going forward the mortgage revenue comps get a lot easier and it feels like we could start seeing some improvement there so --","John Shrewsberry ","Have you noticed that were best in class at the ratio where we currently operate? ","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","Understood. Fair point. Just separately on the tax rate, last quarter came in low; you called out that gain both at the time and then again today. But today's or the second-quarter tax rate seems a little bit higher than at least what we were looking for. What is the outlook? Should we pencil in the 32% going forward or --? ","John Shrewsberry","Yes. You said pencil today's effective rate going forward. ","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","Okay. and then just lastly, I had a follow-up on an earlier question. The mortgage servicing revenue that is coming from the MSR gains, that is writing up the MSR because the expenses to service the loans are coming down?","John Shrewsberry ","That's right. The future cash flows are higher as a result of future expenses coming down, current and future expenses coming down. ","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","Okay. And is there still I feels like there is still opportunity to reduce the cost of servicing going forward, which therefore would increase the value of the MSR. It feels like there is still more of that opportunity there.","John Shrewsberry ","There maybe. We are probably in that middle innings of perfecting servicing over time. There are still -- and more of elevated level of troubled loans out there compared to what we hope to steady status years from now. And when that happens it will be in the future and the benefit of will be the discounted than future benefit of it but you are right, it is probably opportunities at some point in future. ","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Keith Murray with ISI. Please go ahead with your question.","Keith Murray - ISI Group","Thanks a lot. Can you spend a minute on cards? So you obviously have increased penetration impressively on the card side. Just a question: From penetration to actual usage, how long does it take? Obviously you guys have shown very solid loan growth on the card side. But how difficult, once they get a card from Wells, to get them to start using it, to move up the pecking order versus other cards?","John Stumpf ","This is an area that I think is one of our biggest opportunities in the company. If you look at Wells being as we all talk about in the real economy, we have leadership roles in variety of lending classes, whether autos, in consumer, small business, real estate and we are just passionate about helping our retail customers understand the value of having a Wells Fargo card and not only in their wallet but top of wallet. And there were some areas that we were under serving, especially our affluent and emerging affluent customers and our partnership with American Express is off to a very good start. Obviously, we do a lot of things, it was with VISA, and important in Master Card partners of ours. So we can sell a card to a customer at a fraction of the cost of someone else in the outside. We know these people better, we give them better products, and we have a lot of exciting benefits that we are giving as part of the card offering. And it is not only having the balances there. It's being involved with the customer on the payment side. So when we merge the two companies over five years ago, Wachovia came without a portfolio because he had sold their card business off so we are at about 22% penetration rate. Today we are at 39%. I always tell our people, do you know how many of our consumers have credit cards they all do. In fact, they have more than one card. Now, I don't know that we didn't get to 100% but we are marching smartly up the line and you are right, it is not only about the number of plastic cards we have outstanding, it is one that have been used. So I am thrilled with what we are doing. We have still lot more work to do. Big opportunity for us.","John Shrewsberry ","That's right. And it is both in the balances as well as interchange and utilization. ","John Stumpf ","And it just works beautifully. ","Keith Murray - ISI Group","Okay. Just switching gears to OLA, you had given us your thoughts on that on Investor Day. Obviously you guys issued some long-term debt this quarter. Do you feel like you're getting close to where you're going to wind up needing to be, for OLA? Or any updated thoughts and things you're hearing from Washington on that?","John Shrewsberry ","I wouldn't -- there is no real updated intelligence. We still are hearing and are of a mind that the range that will probably published at some point in the future is in the high teen to low 20s in terms of loss absorption cushion. We see ourselves on a risk based approached at the low end of that range and at or within striking distance of that range. So based on everything that we know today, we don't anticipate it having material impact on Wells Fargo.","Keith Murray - ISI Group"," ","Okay. And then just finally for me, we have read a lot about the SNC review and regulators focus on leveraged loans, etcetera. Just can you give us any thoughts related to that? And any changes you have seen this year in how the regulators are approaching it versus past years?","John Shrewsberry ","Well, they are talking about it lot and there is multiple regulators talking about it little differently so I think there is an effort to harmonize their points of view. But obviously they've got a big focus on what's going on with leverage lending inside of banks and banks mean different thing depending on which regulator and which firms are covering. So I would anticipate more clarity some time later this year or maybe beyond that but it really isn't enough for to understand what's going on and at some level to encourage certain types of behavior and discourage others. The big emphasis is on the most levered and most collateral free leverage lending. We don't anticipate having an extraordinary impact on Wells Fargo based on our business mix.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead with your question. ","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research ","","Hi, I was wondering if I could ask about deposit growth in the rising-rate scenario. And I guess if I oversimplify the two schools of thought or the two ends of the spectrum are deposits have only shrank industry wide in 2 of the past 90 years, and those were pretty marginal declines; so you can kind of bank on industry deposits growing. And then I guess JPMorgan was pretty explicit about the other end, where they feel like some of the need to drain liquidity out of the system as rates rise could drive deposits down as much as 10%. So I know there is a lot of uncertainty. Part of it depends on how the Fed acts. But as you think about liquidity planning and stress testing you do internally, any thoughts on the range of best-case and worst-case deposit growth you think about?","John Stumpf ","Let me just give overall view how we think about it. I think one of the things that -- is may be under appreciated about Wells today is the quality of our deposit franchise. And we have $1.1 Trillion of deposit at 10 basis points. About a $1 Trillion of core deposits and many of these -- most of these deposits what I would call transactional mean that people use these deposits either are they are checking accounts or saving accounts, we only have 30 to 40 billion [AR] of CDs, we have a very high quality deposit base. We are also growing primary checking accounts. Think about that. The primary account by between 4.5% and 5%, lower 5% depending whether it's small business or consumer. And in fact these some of the strongest growth number we-- I have ever seen. So because of the quality of our deposit franchise, the quality of omnichannel delivery system. And no one knows of course, it will become fact in history what happens with disintermediation about when rates rise and so forth. I am of the opinion that you are going to see at least for the first couple hundred basis points move up in rate, probably very little movement in disintermediation. You can make the argument that the squeeze down your M1 and M2 and some of the liquidity about the system. We found over time as you suggest early that deposit generally grow. And it might not grow as fast as but I am very confident about how all our deposit franchise will perform in a rising rate environment. ","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research ","That's very helpful. Maybe on the student loan sale, what's your thought process on the decision to sell as opposed to I guess the alternative of just letting it gradually run down over time? Is it a capital free-up or a regulatory? Or what's the benefit of selling out of it now?","John Shrewsberry ","Sure. Well, we had designated -- that the government guaranteed student loan business which is distinct from our private student loan business that we are very committed to over the long term. We had separated after government guaranteed part of the portfolio into liquidating portfolio in 2010 when we stopped originating those loans as that market changed. So they have been part of our run off portfolio for that period of time and amortizing down a little bit. We see the opportunity in the market to move those loans off the book. They are relatively low yielding. They are not strategic. We don't have bigger relationships with most of those customers and that's the decision. So we have transferred them all to held for sale status to signal this intend to sell, we are going about the process in the next quarter or so.","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research ","If I could sneak a last one in on MSR hedging -- or I guess more specifically the line item you give of $475 million, the market-related valuation changes net of hedge results. I feel like -- I always strip that out of core EPS; I always set it at zero and then I always end up being too low. It's almost always a positive number. Is that a number that through the cycle you would expect to be kind of a wash? Or am I just missing that there is a carry component to it because of the way you structure the hedge and things like that? Through the cycle it actually -- over the past 5 years it's averaged $200 million a quarter. And there is a volatile component to it, but through the cycle it should be some positive nonzero number?","John Shrewsberry ","It is a carry component. The bundle of instrument that we use to hedge the asset to create the right duration profile as rates move up or down that we think the value is -- changing value is neutralized. That bundle of instruments throws out positive carry. It will depend on the shape or the slope of the yield curve at different points in time. And of course in the past it has been impacted by other expense items that have been flowing through, they are less of them today. So it is a little bit more standout in terms of its net. And then there is also the influence of what happens when rate speed up or down -- prepayment rates speed up or not, and of course we have gone through a period recently where the asset is linked-in. So there is a lot of different things going on there. And it is not currently what through the cycle actually mean in this context because as rates move you are in different places and as the shape of the curve moves you are in different places that are different than a business cycle or credit cycle. But you can look at the performance over some period of time and set whatever average you think is right. But I think zeroing it our is probably conservative. ","Operator","Your next question is will come from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question. ","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse","Great, thanks. Most of my questions have actually been asked and answered. But one quick thing, that the -- you have taken a big step up in capital return. Just talk a little bit about what might influence you to go to the very high end of your range or to the lower end of your range, in subsequent periods.","John Shrewsberry ","So we are setting our expectations in our levels internally from one key card process to the next based on how we anticipate that we are going to earn and the negotiation if you will that we are having with regulators which -- it is part of what constructs the balance between dividend and repurchase. And if you think about an annual payout or if we thought about an annual payout based on the annual number, it would be a calculated number in that range. From quarter-to-quarter as I mentioned earlier with respect to what happen to share count, we've got different things going on with share issuance so that the net buyback will be bigger in some quarter than it is in others which is going make us look like we are dancing around inside the range. And that's the reason for moving around inside the range. Now, more importantly if growth opportunities began to emerge in a more meaningful way where we needed to retain more capital to put it work then that would also be a driver, I think Investor Day you probably recall that Paul Ackerman went through an analysis of the amount of capital that we thought was appropriate to set aside for asset growth and that's amount that was -- the amount of earnings necessary are available to distribute. So that's the starting process. ","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse","Just as a follow-up to that, any thoughts on portfolio acquisition opportunities in the current environment? Anything standing out?","John Shrewsberry","I wouldn't say anything standing out. We are at there looking in both consumer and commercial and commercial real estate assets. We've -- I mentioned in the loan growth context that we have done a couple of commercial real estate acquisition. These are all announced but that have happened in the quarter. Pardon me, that is happened in previous quarters. So we are looking at those. We have talked about card programs like the Dillard's program where we will be picking up a portfolio receivable in addition to managing that card program going forward with more opportunity there. So we are looking at lots of things. Some things make more sense than others but that's an interesting way for us to add both assets and new customers to the bank. ","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse","Got you. Very last thing. Just on that up sale, just two quick questions. Do you think you will sell it in one piece, or do you think you'd break it up into pieces? And do you service that portfolio?","John Shrewsberry ","With respect to the first half of the question it depends, we would be willing to sell at one piece. It is a big number. So it may happen in component pieces. And on the second half, we do not service those loans.","Operator","","Your next question will come from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Market. Please go ahead with your question. ","Paul Miller - FBR Capital Market","Yes, thank you very much. On the mortgage production side, the $47 billion that you guys produced, how much did you sell into the MBS market, and how much did you portfolio?","John Shrewsberry ","I don't have that number handy. I think the lion share of that was sold. ","Paul Miller - FBR Capital Market","Okay. Do you have handy with you what was jumbo?","John Shrewsberry ","About $8 billion, nonconforming mortgages increased $8 billion to about $96 billion. ","Paul Miller - FBR Capital Market","Then my guess is you put portfolioed all those nonconforming jumbos.","John Shrewsberry ","That's correct. ","Paul Miller - FBR Capital Market"," ","Go ahead. ","John Shrewsberry ","The question is whether that $8 billion is part of the $47 billion because if it then that answers the question at what we sold. So we will confirm that. ","Paul Miller - FBR Capital Market"," ","Okay. That makes sense given the MBS issuance data that has been out. I don't have June; but given May and July I think you probably issued probably somewhere between 33 and 35, so that would coincide with some of that. Have you been portfolioing any conforming loans on your residential portfolio? Or has it just been nonconforming jumbos?","John Shrewsberry ","Nonconforming, not portfolio conforming. ","Paul Miller - FBR Capital Market","Yes. Can you talk a little bit about the pricing of the jumbos? Are they 4.25%, 4.5%? Are they mainly 7\/1, 10\/1s? Are you portfolioing any 30-year?","John Shrewsberry","So it's a mix 5\/1, 7\/1, 10\/1 and 30 year and they are priced for their point on the curve.","Operator","Your next will come from the line of Chris Mutascio with KBW. Please go ahead with your question. ","Chris Mutascio - KBW","Good morning, John. John, how are you? As a happy Wells Fargo deposit customer, I got a letter in the mail several weeks ago, and I wanted to get your thoughts on it. It was changing the overdraft, no longer going from processing it from a high to low but going now to first received. I thought that already happened. I guess I was wrong. So I guess my question is: Will this have an impact on deposit service charges going forward with the change in the overdraft processing?","John Stumpf ","It is not going to be meaningful, no. ","Chris Mutascio - KBW","Okay. But has it happened in certain parts of the country? Because I'm here in Baltimore, Maryland; I thought it was the old Wachovia franchise. Has it happened in certain parts of the country? In other words the shift to first received and now we are converting other parts of the country? Or this is throughout the whole franchise?","John Stumpf ","Repeat that one. This is really as a process we are able to with debit; we are able to do it on a real time basis. And it was more incorporating that into that hierarchy with checks to get them synchronized and that was the reason for making that change. ","Chris Mutascio - KBW"," ","Okay. So again but the end result of that, this isn't any impact to deposit service charges going forward?","John Stumpf ","It is not to be meaningful. ","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research, LLC. Please go ahead with your question. ","Nancy Bush - NAB Research, LLC","Good morning, guys. A question about the spring survey from the OCC, where they made some fairly pointed comments about deterioration in credit quality, not only in leveraged lending. I think there was sort of a loosening of loan standards; I mean, there were a whole bunch of bullet points that were somewhat alarming from a credit-quality standpoint. Do you guys see that this is at an inflection point in credit quality? And do you feel or are you feeling increased pressure to maybe start building reserves rather than continuing to let them draw down?","John Shrewsberry ","So at least two different questions there. The first part on the competitive environment for loan. And it is a more competitive environment. There are lots of people out there. Lots of banks out there with a lot of liquidity competing for loans. And we do see more competitive -- more borrower friendly structures that we have to react to from one asset category to another. Now in some like in mortgage for example, part of it is just getting more clarity on what the rules are and what's going to work and what's saleable to agencies and things like that. And for other things -- for other types of assets, we mentioned auto earlier, there are people out there who for example are extending the terms on auto loans, so links that you might not seen in past. And of course we are all leverage lending is probably the most visible because it's pretty easy to measure the aggressiveness based on leverage multiple for example. So those things are happening. Our front line and relationship managers and others are confronted with having to make decisions about where we want to be in, where we don't want to be. We think we are very good at spotting that. And managing credit risk has been strength at Wells Fargo as you know for a very long time. With respect to reserving, we are looking at our risk allowance for credit losses every quarter and it reflects and its change reflects what's going on in the portfolio. When its bottom up analysis of what's in the portfolio, what it looks like, what's risk rated, how it is performing and what our expectations is for near term credit losses. And as we said here, we anticipate reserve releases declining over some period of time in part to reflect -- from 35 basis points it's hard to argue that whether it can get much better from there or sort of bounded by zero on the one side and would expect to gravitate more towards some whatever normalized means with some higher level of net charge-off. So that's going on the one hand and then there is portfolio growth. As we said, we had a lot of new loans put on and all things being equal at some point, our reserves will have to grow to reflect the increased loan balances which we think is a great thing because we want those loans on the books serving customers, earning interest and creating the environment to cross sell those customers. That's how I see them. ","Nancy Bush - NAB Research, LLC","Do you think you will have an ability to telegraph the change that will actually happen when you have to start building reserves? Because my guess is that the industry is going to be -- or Wall Street is going to be somewhat shocked when that starts to happen.","John Shrewsberry ","As I look at the industry data so what's going on with reserve releases from other banks, they have been trending and it begun to trend with a few exceptions back up towards zero. So I think people see that coming and it's a reflection of asset growth on one hand which is a good thing and then of course the big reserves that we put on at the -- in the heat of the crisis that in some cases were more than relative what was necessary. So we look at quarter-by-quarter, just to be clear, this is a gap exercise, we built it up based on what's actually in the portfolio and the experience that we are managing. As you have seen in the data right now our allowance for credit loss is pushing 5x what our actual charge-off experience is right now.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Andrew Marquardt with Evercore. Please go ahead with your question. ","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners","Good morning, guys. Thanks. Just a couple follow-ups here. Just to be clear on the line of questioning from Nancy on credit quality, so just looking -- it feels like, to your point, maybe it's hard to get much better than 35 basis points in aggregate and recovery seem to be less robust and maybe it's a very modest uptick in C&I. Like, how should we think about the level? I mean, should we think about it in this very low range for a period of time, and we're still very far from what you've previously deemed as normalized, the 75 to 85 basis points? How should we think about maybe that near-term?","John Shrewsberry ","","I think it's going to be hard for the 35 basis points to move rapidly to any much higher number. And we know what kind of assets we have been putting on the book for the last few years which I think we all believe are very high credit quality particularly on a historical basis. So normalization will happen over some period of time but at least from our perspective we wouldn't expect it to be an abrupt move. Credit is still quite strong.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners","Got it. Then just a little ticky-tack on the reserving. So not only for the loan growth that's picking up and relief from legacy issues for the industry, there is also this upcoming change in accounting at some point. Any update or thoughts on the CECL coming through, and when one might need to start thinking about that for the industry in general?","John Shrewsberry ","Yes. So what we know about that is that it sounds like it is going to happen. It is not final but we are going to be hearing about it from the Fed in the coming quarters. And at least the way I read it there is not going to be much of an opportunity to change anyone's mind. But of course for anybody who is included into this, this is life of low-- essentially life of loan reserving. The expectation, our expectation is that would begin to phase in the 2017 timeframe or later. And so it's not really today's issue and just for the avoidance of doubt, our reserving practices today do not reflect that future contemplated life of reserving -- life of loan loss approach. So it's out there, let's call it 2017 plus and something wrong and have to figure out how to adapt to. ","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners","Great, that's helpful. Then lastly just following on the balance sheet dynamic questions and the NIM optics and issues around deposits. Can you maybe just re-clarify in terms of deposit velocity in a higher rate environment that Brian had brought up earlier? How much -- I mean, do you if at all consider ring-fencing 5%, 10%, 15% of deposits maybe at risk of reversing in a higher rate environment as some institutions have indicated?","John Shrewsberry ","I wouldn't say that we don't describe it in our deposit stress testing internally in quite that way. And we talk about the types of deposit accounts that we have and we assigned what we think are the right level of behaviors to those accounts and through that we assess what we think the right level of liquidity is to carry and that liquidity comes in the form both of cash and cash equivalent which are extraordinary at Wells Fargo today as well as our securities are relatively liquid securities portfolio that we in a pinch would consider to be saleable or financeable. And answering a slightly different question, the sum of those two things is such a significant part of our balance sheet today that it seems like ample coverage for whatever portion of deposits might be -- might unexpected retract or disappear in the event of move up. ","John Stumpf ","And I think as I mentioned before I think we are going -- our deposit franchise will out perform competitors because of the nature of the kind of deposits we have and the amount of core deposits (inaudible) amount of retail core and I think there is going to be surprise, I think we will surprise ourselves and how well it's going to do. ","John Shrewsberry ","That's right. We have the relationships that we have with our deposit customers is cemented by the tools that we have that we use, that the products that we offer them and allow them to manage their money. So whether it's a consumer or a business customer, we've got the best in class interface that allows them -- and frankly it is hard to move away from -- in terms of moving money, analyzing money, investing money etcetera, the mobile convenience, the online convenience what we have referred to as this omnichannel relationship. It's not easy or convenient to want to change that. So something really has to be compelling about an individual depositor circumstances or we would have to really be tone deaf to what deposit pricing needs to do in order to retain our balances. So we feel really good about that.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners","Thanks, that's helpful. Then if you don't mind, just in terms of -- you've mentioned a couple quarters now how you've had this great continued growth in core deposits. But it's optically impacted the NIM but hasn't really negatively impacted the NII. Would a similar dynamic be envisioned in a higher rate environment if in fact the velocity was greater than one envisioned? In terms of it could go the other way and you could have an optically better net interest margin; but the NII could remain relatively stable despite all that. Or how should we think about that? Or how do you think about that?","John Stumpf ","What's happened in the past is typically what happen is that the margin will increase and net interest income increase because assets have reprised faster than liabilities will. So I mean \u2013 hypothetically we will wait to see what happens at that time.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners"," ","Got it, great, thank you, guys. ","John Stumpf ","All right. Well, thank you much everybody. We appreciate your interest in Wells Fargo. Thank you for joining the call. Excellent questions and we will see you next quarter.

This call is being recorded.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our third quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website at WellsFargo.com.","I\u2019d also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement.","Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our website.","I will now turn the call over to President and CEO, Tim Sloan.","Timothy Sloan","Thank you, Jim.

But I\u2019d like to focus on the events of the past few weeks and the impact on our company.","This week, John Stumpf announced that he was retiring from Wells Fargo and the Board. He made this decision because he believed his leadership had become a distraction, and therefore the best thing for Wells Fargo was for him to retire. This action demonstrates the dedication John has had to Wells Fargo throughout his 34 years with the company, including successfully leading us through the financial crisis and the largest merger in banking history.","As the new CEO, my immediate and highest priority is to restore trust in Wells Fargo. As you know, on September 8, we announced settlements with the CFPB, the OCC, and the Los Angeles city attorney related to sales practices in retail banking. I know that this is not the type of activity you expect from Wells Fargo and is certainly not what we expect from ourselves. We let down our customers, our shareholders, and our team members. We simply failed to fulfill our responsibility to all our stakeholders.","Our vision of satisfying our customers\u2019 financial needs and helping them to succeed financially is about building lifelong relationships one customer at a time. The core values of Wells Fargo are as true today as they were a month ago, a year ago, and 164 years ago. However, we had serious problems in our retail bank where products became the focus rather than the relationships with our customers.","Our senior management could have and should have done more. I'm fully committed along with the entire leadership team to fixing these issues and taking the necessary actions to restore our customers\u2019 trust.","We have a specific action plan in place to lead our company forward during this period, which is focused on outreach to everyone who has been impacted by retail banking sales practices, including our customers, our team members, our investors, our regulators, elected officials, and the communities that we do business in. It includes being transparent in our communication, and we've included a lot of information in this quarterly supplement for you.","On pages three and four, we provide some background regarding the sales practices settlements, along with details of the account review that was completed by PricewaterhouseCoopers. I believe most of these facts are familiar to you, but let me highlight a few key points.","The 2.1 million consumer and small business accounts that were identified as accounts that may not have been authorized cost Wells Fargo much more than the $2.6 million of fees we received, which we have fully refunded. And let me clarify that these accounts had a de minimis impact to the retail banking household cross-sell ratio that we report on a quarterly basis with the maximum impact in any one quarter of 0.02 products per household or 0.3% of the reported metric. At no time were all of the identified accounts included in our reported cross-sell ratio, because unused deposit accounts rolled off.","While the revenue generated was small relative to our annual income, and the impact on our cross-sell ratio was not material, the implications for our company and on the trust of our customers are significant. We\u2019ve made several changes to enhance our oversight, expand customer transparency, and improve the customer experience, which we highlight on page five.","Effective October 1, we eliminated product sales goals for our retail banking team members; and next year, we will introduce a new performance plan based on updated metrics around customer service, growth, and risk management. We want to make sure nothing gets in the way of doing what is right for our customers and the elimination of product sales goals has been positively received by both our team members and our customers. And we\u2019ve made system and process enhancements, including sending automated emails, application acknowledgments, and multifactor authentication.","We expect to spend a total of over $50 million this year enhanced quality assurance monitoring. We\u2019ve implemented an independent third-party mystery shopper program targeting 15,000 to 20,000 annual visits to our branches to test actual product purchase interactions. We\u2019ve added risk professionals to provide greater oversight and significantly expanded our customer complaint servicing and resolution process. We will continue to invest in process enhancements and product monitoring, a proactive monitoring, and we\u2019re committed to getting it right for our customers.","We\u2019re reaching out to all retail and small business checking, savings, credit card, and unsecured line of credit customers, and we\u2019re asking them to contact us if they have any concerns about their accounts or any aspect of the relationship with Wells Fargo. We've dedicated resources available 24\/7 for inquiries and questions.","In cases where customers believe they have received a product that they did not want or authorize and they are not satisfied with our resolution, we\u2019re providing an option of mediation through a third-party that is convenient and free for the customer. Our team members are proactively calling a meeting with their customers in all areas of the company.","Additionally, we\u2019ve been working on contacting the credit card customers identified by PricewaterhouseCoopers. As a reminder, their analysis included all credit cards that were open, but not activated. There are a lot of reasons why customers don't activate their cards, so we\u2019re trying to contact all unactivated credit card customers with open accounts to confirm whether they want their credit cards.","For consumer credit card customers identified, over half have closed their accounts, in part reflecting the passage of time as some of these accounts were opened five years ago. For those accounts that are still open, we\u2019ve called 166,000 un-activated customers so far and we\u2019ve spoken with 34,000 customers who have made a decision whether to keep or close their account. Of those customers, 17% have said that they did not apply for a credit card and 8% said that they did not recall applying for a credit card.","We\u2019re also focused on determining potential additional impacts that the identified consumer and small business deposit and credit card customers may have incurred. We\u2019ve allocated significant resources to this effort. We\u2019re contracting with a third-party firm to work with us as well as with the primary credit card bureaus to develop a plan for submission to the regulators for their approval.","Here's what we've learned so far. According to FICO, the impact on FICO scores from a credit card application varies based on a person's unique credit history. But, in general, credit inquiries have a small impact on FICO scores. For most people, one additional credit inquiry will take fewer than five points off their FICO scores for a period of up to 12 months.","We\u2019re working on determining potential financial impact for customers who obtained a loan with Wells Fargo or another company during the 12-month period where their FICO score may have been impacted by the credit inquiry. For example, if the loan was from Wells Fargo, and the customer was impacted by a lower FICO score, we will adjust the line size, modify pricing, and refund any additional costs incurred. As we did with our original account analysis, in all circumstances, our intent is to err on the side of the customer and to make it right. We've been actively monitoring and tracking our customer activity since the announcement.","In order to be as transparent as possible, on page nine, we are providing data to compare activity levels across a number of metrics in retail banking. When analyzing these trends versus the prior month, it\u2019s important to remember that September had two fewer business days this year than August.","While it is too early to determine the long-term impact, and we\u2019re prepared for things to get worse before they get better, here's what we\u2019ve observed so far. Our customer traffic to our branches and call centers remained at typical levels for September. Customers calling and speaking to a phone banker are up 4% from a year ago. And so far, formal complaints related to sales practices have been less than 1% of the calls we\u2019ve received.","Historically, approximately 70% of banker interactions are service, not sales related, and this percentage increased slightly in September. Customer visits with bankers in our branches, a subset of overall customer traffic, were down 10% in September compared with a year ago. The lower level of interactions in September was driven by lower internal referrals, decreased product offerings and reduced marketing.","We have begun to reintroduce marketing and will be gradually increasing our marketing efforts throughout the coming months. The drivers of lower banker interactions also resulted in new consumer checking account openings declining 25% in September compared with openings in September a year ago. To put this in perspective, account openings were down 143,000 from a year ago on a base of 33.2 million accounts.","We continue to have year-over-year growth in primary consumer checking customers, up 4.5% in September. As a reminder, primary checking customers are those who actively use their checking accounts and, therefore, this metric was not impacted by the accounts identified by PricewaterhouseCoopers. Our deposit customers continue to use their accounts with balances up $6.5 billion in September compared with August and debit card transactions up 9% from a year ago.","Lower referrals, marketing and product offerings also impacted credit card applications, which were down 20% in September compared with September a year ago. Applications were down 77,000 from a year ago compared with 7.8 million total active cards. We continue to see increased usage among our customers with active cards up 9%, balances up 10%, and transaction volume also up 10% from a year ago.","We are also actively monitoring customer experience scores with over 80,000 branch customer surveys completed in September. Loyalty scores in September were down from an all-time high in August, but were consistent with where they were as recently as two years ago. We also asked customers about the quality of their most recent branch visit. The score in September was down from August, but was also consistent with two years ago. Our enhanced focus on service seeks to bring these scores back to pre-settlement levels as we work to rebuild confidence and trust with our customers.","We\u2019re also tracking the impact from the announcement on our other businesses, which we highlight on page ten. Mortgage referrals from retail banking, which account for 10% of our year-to-date mortgage originations, were down 24% from August to September. Auto originations have been minimally impacted since over 90% of our originations were through the indirect channel in the third quarter. We remain focused on maintaining our deep and long tenured dealer relationship, which drive most of our origination volume in our auto business.","Within wholesale banking, our team members are actively meeting with customers and responding to their concerns. There have been a few state treasurers and municipalities who have made public announcements about temporarily suspending certain business activity with Wells Fargo, while several others have reaffirmed the relationship with us.","Overall, we did not see any meaningful change of business trends in wholesale banking late in the quarter and deposit balances were up 4% during the month of September and loan pipelines were in line with the second quarter. We've also seen minimal impact so far within our wealth and investment management business. September-ending deposit balances were up 1% from August month-end and up 11% from a year ago. Client transaction activity was muted in September, but largely reflected the market environment. Retail brokerage advisory flows in September were strong, up $1.6 billion from August.","September closed referred investment assets \u2013 these are the referrals resulting from the Wells community banking partnership \u2013 were more than $1 billion, in line with prior trends. But these referred assets are dependent on banker referrals, so we will be watching this trend very closely.","We\u2019ve always believed that our team members are our most important asset. And it\u2019s been disturbing to hear claims of retaliations against team members who contacted the ethics line. We are investigating these claims. We are also assisting former team members who left retail banking due to sales performance and who remain eligible for rehire and applying for available positions at the company.","Leaders throughout Wells Fargo have had ongoing regular outreach with their teams throughout our markets. Mary Mack, who was the new head of community banking, has met with team members in ten cities so far to gather ideas, concerns and questions from frontline retail managers at all levels to help inform the go-forward strategy for a service-driven community bank.","Eight additional executive officers and their leadership teams met with more than 116,000 team members across the country. During these meetings, we\u2019re reinforcing our code of ethics, business conduct, ethics line and non-retaliation policies.","We\u2019re also shifting our language in retail banking training and communications to make it more customer focused, less sales focused, and reinforcing our commitment to do what's right for our customers.","We offer all of our team members competitive pay and benefits, which we highlight on slide 12. For example, tellers and customer service representatives earn at least $12 an hour, 60% above the federal minimum wage. 99% of team members are eligible for company-sponsored health benefits and our benefits programs cover more than 515,000 team members, spouses, domestic partners and their dependents.","We believe that team member engagement is critical to our success. In each spring, our team members have the opportunity to take an anonymous survey administered through Gallup. It's a chance for our team members to share their perspective on what it's like to work at Wells Fargo.","In 2016, over 90% of eligible team members participated in a survey and Wells Fargo's overall engagement scores were above 88% of the companies represented in Gallup's database. While we ranked high on the survey, this is not a mechanism \u2013 the only mechanism to identify team member concerns, like sales practices, and we\u2019re implementing other ways for our team members to share their views with management.","Our team members are active in the communities where they live and work. And in 2015, the United Way ranked our workplace giving campaign the largest in the US for the seventh year in a row. We\u2019ve just finished our 2016 campaign last week. And during the time that has been very challenging for our company, our team members demonstrated their continued support for their communities. The preliminary contribution results are similar to last year.","We\u2019re also committed to team member development. And last year, we invested $300 million in team member training in credit, risk, technology and customer service. Additionally, we provided $21 million in tuition reimbursement. As we move through this period, we will continue to be transparent regarding trends across the company.","John Shrewsberry will now discuss the details of our financial results.","John Shrewsberry","Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Our strong financial results in the third quarter were relatively straightforward. And in order to allow extra time to take questions, my prepared remarks regarding our results will be shorter than usual.","I want to start on page 13 with a few key takeaways from our third quarter results, which reflect the benefit of our diversified business model and the momentum across many of our businesses. For the 16th consecutive quarter, we generated earnings of greater than $5 billion. Our loan, investment and deposit balances are all at record levels. Compared with the second quarter, we grew revenue driven by growth in net interest income. Many of our businesses had their best non-interest income results in five quarters, including strong mortgage banking results.","We grew revenue despite equity gains being at five-quarter lows and $780 million lower than a year ago. Expense growth was driven by higher operating losses and the contribution to the Wells Fargo Foundation. Credit quality improved including lower losses in our oil and gas portfolio and our capital position remains strong as we returned $3.2 billion to shareholders.","Turning to page 15, let me highlight a few balance sheet trends. I believe our balance sheet has never been stronger. We grew loans and deposits and our liquidity and capital remained strong. Our funding sources grew in the third quarter with long-term debt up $10.9 billion on $20 billion of issuances, including $9.2 billion that we anticipate will be TLAC eligible.","We also had strong deposit growth, up $330.4 billion from the second quarter. We purchased $57 billion of securities during the quarter, primarily agency MBS in our available-for-sale portfolio. The amount of securities purchased was higher than in prior quarters, but wasn't outsize when factoring in that we did not add duration in the loan portfolio with interest rate swaps as we had in prior quarters. We remain asset sensitive and will benefit if rates increase.","Turning to the income statement overview on page 16, revenue increased $166 million from second quarter, with net interest income up $219 million. The slight decline in non-interest income was driven by a $303 million reduction in market sensitive revenue, which is at its lowest level in the past five quarters and a decrease in other income reflecting the $290 million gain on the sale of our health benefit services business last quarter.","The $402 million increase in expenses from second quarter was primarily driven by $243 million increase in operating losses on higher litigation accruals. We also had a $107 million contribution to the foundation during the quarter. I will provide more detail on expenses later on the call.","As shown on page 17, loans grew 6% from a year ago and were up $4.1 billion from the second quarter. Commercial loans grew $1.9 billion from the second quarter on higher commercial real estate and C&I loans. Consumers loans were up $2.2 billion with growth in first mortgage loans, auto, credit cards, student lending and securities based lending.","On page 18, we highlight year-over-year loan growth. I'm not going to highlight each portfolio, but as you can see on this page, we had strong and broad-based growth across many of our commercial and consumer portfolios.","As highlighted on page 19, we had a record $1.3 trillion of average deposits in the third quarter, up $62.6 billion or 5% from a year ago and included 8% growth in consumer and small business banking deposits. Our average deposit cost was stable with second quarter at 11 basis points and up 3 basis points from a year ago, reflecting an increase in deposit pricing for certain wholesale banking customers.","Page 20 highlights our revenue diversification. Our results continued to benefit from our growth in earning assets and our diversified business model.","Net interest income was up $219 million or 2% from the second quarter, reflecting earning asset growth and one additional day in the quarter. The net interest margin declined 4 basis points from the second quarter, primarily driven by growth in long-term debt and deposits, partially offset by the benefit of earning asset growth. Net interest income grew 4% from a year ago, even with a 14 basis point reduction in NIM.","Non-interest income declined $53 million from the second quarter, which included a $290 million gain on the sale of our health benefit services business and declined $42 million from a year ago, which included $780 million of higher gains from equity investments. Across a number of our fee businesses, we had the best results in five quarters, including deposit accounts, trust and investment, mortgage banking and lease income.","Our mortgage banking results reflected strong residential and commercial mortgage originations. Residential origination volume was $70 billion, up $15 billion or 27% from a year ago and up $7 billion from the second quarter, which is typically the strongest quarter due to seasonality in the purchase market.","Applications were up 5% from second quarter and we ended the third quarter with a $50 billion unclosed pipeline, the highest since second quarter of 2013. Our production margin on residential held-for-sale mortgages was 181 basis points in the third quarter, up 15 basis points from the second quarter. Given our strong pipeline at the end of the third quarter, we currently expect origination volume in the fourth quarter to be up from a year ago, but down slightly from the third quarter due to seasonality in the purchase market. And we currently expect the production margin in the fourth quarter to be at or above the upper end of the range of the past five quarters, which was 188 basis points.","As shown on page 23, expenses increased $402 million from the second quarter, driven by $243 million of higher operating losses, reflecting increased litigation accruals. Operating losses could continue to increase related to outstanding legal matters such as sales practice issues as we\u2019ve disclosed in our 10-K filing RMBS. $125 million in higher salaries due to an extra day in the quarter and FTE growth, $107 million donation to the Wells Fargo Foundation and higher FDIC insurance expense, reflecting the increase in deposit assessments.","Expenses also reflected lower foreclosed asset expense from commercial foreclosed asset recoveries and lower commissions and incentive compensation expense reflecting the forfeiture of unvested equity awards from John Stumpf and Carrie Tolstedt. Our efficiency ratio was 59.4% in the third quarter and we expect the efficiency ratio to remain at an elevated level.","While our expenses increased this quarter, we remain focused on managing expenses while actively reinvesting in the franchise for future growth, which we highlight on page 24. We focused on reducing non-core businesses in order to simplify our organization and improve our risk profile. We\u2019re also working on creating a simpler and more collaborative way to seamlessly serve customers and team members by aligning similar teams in areas like marketing, finance and operations. We've also been reducing discretionary spending such as travel and facilities.","Earlier this week, we announced the formation of a new payments virtual solutions and innovation group that will be led by Avid Modjtabai. This new group will bring teams from across the company together to accelerate our focus on delivering the next generation of payments capabilities, advancing digital and online offerings and investing in new customer experiences and products. This new group includes our innovation, consumer credit card, deposit products, treasury management and virtual channels teams.","We continue to be active in providing our customers new products, services and technologies. For example, starting in the third quarter, customers can now send and receive real-time payments with any customer of a bank that participates in clearXchange network and our wholesale customers can now send and receive same day ACH.","We\u2019re also making it easier for our customers to open accounts through mobile channels including brokerage, business direct, and personal credit products.","Turning to our business segments starting on page 25, community banking earned $3.2 billion in the third quarter, down 9% from a year ago and up 2% from the second quarter. The decline from a year ago was due to the lower gains on equity investments. We've already discussed earlier on the call, many of the business trends within community banking, so I'll just briefly highlight that our customers continued to actively use our payment and digital products with debit card transaction volume up 8% from a year ago and credit card purchase dollar volume also up 8%. Mobile active users grew to 18.8 million.","Wholesale banking earned $2 billion in the third quarter, up 6% from a year ago and down 1% from the second quarter. Revenue was $7.1 billion, down 2% from the second quarter due to the gain last quarter on the sale of our health benefits services business. Revenue benefited from record net interest income, up 4% from second quarter and 12% from a year ago.","Loan growth was driven by acquisitions and broad-based organic growth with average loans up $48.7 billion or 12% from a year ago, the eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth. During the third quarter, we closed a portion of our acquisition of GE Capital's commercial distribution finance business. And earlier this month, we completed the final phase of [indiscernible].","Wealth and investment management earned a record $677 million in the third quarter, up 12% from a year ago and up 16% from the second quarter. WIM generated a pretax margin of 27% in the third quarter and had positive operating leverage on both a year-over-year and linked-quarter basis.","Positive operating leverage was driven by solid revenue growth, while continuing to invest more in the business. WIM\u2019s average deposits were up 10% from a year ago and average loans increased 12%, the 13th consecutive quarters of double-digit year-over-year loan growth. Client assets across WIM reached record highs this quarter driven both by market gains and continued positive net flows.","Turning to page 28, credit results improved from second quarter with only 33 basis points of annualized net charge-offs. Net charge-offs declined $119 million or from second quarter from lower oil and gas, credit card and consumer real estate losses, and continued commercial real estate recoveries.","Non-performing assets decreased $1.1 billion from second quarter with improvement across our consumer and commercial portfolios and lower foreclosed assets. Non-performing assets were only 1.25% of total loans, the lowest level since the merger with Wachovia in 2008. And for the first time this year, we did not have a reserve build.","Slide 29 provides details on our oil and gas portfolio. Outstandings declined to $16 billion, down 6% from second quarter, and there were no defensive draws again this quarter. Our total oil and gas loan exposure, which includes unfunded commitments and loans outstanding, was down 2% from the second quarter and down 11% from a year ago. We had $168 million of net charge-offs in the oil and gas portfolio in the third quarter, down $95 million or 36% from the second quarter, driven by improvements in industry conditions.","Non-accrual loans were $2.5 billion, down slightly from the second quarter, and criticize loans declined $1.1 billion or 13%. While another decline in commodity prices would have a negative impact on the performance of our oil and gas portfolio, given the current environment, we believe losses peaked in the second quarter.","Turning the page 30, our capital levels remained strong with our estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio fully phased in at 10.7% in the third quarter. Our net payout ratio was 61% as we returned $3.2 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases.","Regarding the new Fed proposal for the stress capital buffer, while the initial information provided by the Fed was limited, we have performed our internal analysis and the potential impact appears manageable and the overall changes to CCAR framework are generally aligned with our expectations.","I also want to provide an update on where we stand related to TLAC. As I mentioned earlier, we issued $9.2 billion of debt in the quarter that we anticipate will be TLAC eligible. However, this was partially offset by $2.1 billion of long-term debt rolling into the less than one-year maturity bucket.","In summary, our results in the third quarter demonstrated strength and momentum in a number of businesses. However, the impact on future performance from the sales practices related events late in the quarter is still unknown. We\u2019re working closely with our customers, our regulators and our team members to move forward and make things right.","Timothy Sloan","Thanks, John. Before we end our prepared remarks, I wanted to address a few of the most common questions that we\u2019ve been getting from all of you. The first is whether Wells Fargo's culture is broken. Our goal of building lifelong relationships with our customers and appropriately offering them additional products is still the foundation of our business model. But there was clearly something wrong and we will make the necessary changes to fix it.","The values we've always embraced, people as a competitive advantage, doing what is right for our customers, diversity and inclusion, ethics and leadership will continue to guide our company through this challenging period.","Second, we\u2019ve received questions about the sales practice activities, who was involved and what the timeline of events was. We have acknowledged that we've made mistakes. However, our board is conducting an independent investigation into our retail banking sales practices and related matters and we\u2019re not in a position to discuss those topics today.","Finally, we know there is uncertainty due to the events that have occurred over the last month, including this week. Let me outline what you should expect from us before we have our next earnings call 90 days from now.","First, in our retail banking business, we\u2019ll continue our outreach efforts to our customers and focus on making things right.","Second, we will continue to work with the board on their investigation as well as all the other inquiries we have received, including meeting the required deliverables under the consent orders.","And third, as you\u2019ve heard on the call today, we\u2019re committed to being transparent regarding business trends and you should expect updates on these activities during the quarter. We\u2019re also planning on an off-cycle investor day for next year where we will update you on our business strategies.","And finally, I know there is a lot we need to get right. And make no mistake, I get it and our team is on it.","Jim Rowe ","Before we open up the line for questions, for today, to be as fair as possible, we\u2019re asking that you limit your questions to one question and one follow-up, so we can get to as many questions as possible. Thank you. And with that, Regina, we\u2019re ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Timothy Sloan","Hi, Matt.","Operator","Matt, you may be on mute.","Matt O'Connor","Sorry, can you hear me?","Timothy Sloan","We can hear you now, Matt. Thanks.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. Apologies. I thought I saw a blurb out there that you\u2019re hiring 2,000 employees for various compliance controls areas. And I just want to see if that is true. And then related to that, as you think about the expense impact of all of this, any estimates on what that might be?","Timothy Sloan","Matt, the blurb really reflected the fact that we\u2019re moving approximately 2,000 of our team members that are in risk and control positions within our business lines to our corporate risk functions. Its\u2019 not necessarily a net increase in the number of team members.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. So, I guess, the broader question is, there\u2019s going to be some cost impact of the sales practice issue, probably some revenue impact as well. And do you have any estimates on what that might be. The revenue impact is probably a little bit trickier. But I would think there may be some way to frame some early thoughts on the cost side of things.","Timothy Sloan","It\u2019s tough to be specific because we will definitely be adding people in control positions as we build out the go-forward plan and have it agreed to by our regulators. So that\u2019s definitely a cost headwind. And I guess I would calibrate the relevant range in the tens of millions of dollars for that, specifically as it relates to this. And I think you're right on the revenue side. Some of the early trends that we\u2019re seeing just in terms of account openings etc. don't really have a revenue impact. They may ultimately, with respect to how incremental deposits are redeployed or transactional activity in cards, things like that, but they don't have an immediate revenue impact on this quarter, next quarter. The bigger picture, of course, some people have asked is, what will the business model feel like in community banking with a more service oriented culture rather than a more sales oriented culture. And you'll be hearing more about that as it\u2019s fully developed. It\u2019s our intention to to be successful in providing all of our customers with what they need in terms of financial products through a service oriented model. So that'll take some time to develop and to describe for people. And then it will work its way in over the course of the coming quarters, but it\u2019s a question that people have asked and it\u2019s one that we\u2019ll provide a lot of transparency around, so that people can understand the impact of that change as it\u2019s being made.","Matt O'Connor","So these costs and then any revenue give-up, do you feel like it\u2019s going to be absorbable in your current earnings power? Or I think the fear out there in the market is not just the headline risk, which will go away at some point, but I think the fear is kind of this $4 plus of earnings power, is that meaningfully at risk when you factor in some of the costs and revenue reduction, and I don\u2019t know if you can comment on that? Thank you.","Timothy Sloan","Thank you. It\u2019s tough to say with specificity. We have a very diversified revenue model as you know. There\u2019s so much coming from wholesale. There\u2019s so much coming from WIM. This will be a headwind in community banking. And it\u2019s one that we\u2019ll intend to absorb. But that\u2019s why we\u2019re upping our transparency, so that people can develop their own sense and we can share facts as they\u2019re happening.","Matt O'Connor","Thank you.","Timothy Sloan","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Timothy Sloan","Good morning, Erika.","Erika Najarian","Good morning. Maybe I can ask Matt\u2019s last question another way. You said return goals during investor day of 1.1% to 1.4% ROA. And I guess, really what the question is, is given the uncertainty of the community bank impact on revenue and expenses going forward, are there other levers within Wells Fargo in that you can deliver that 1.1% to 1.4% ROA within the next two years and can you grow earnings without any help from macro next year despite this uncertainty?","Timothy Sloan","Erika, it's a very fair question. And let me take the macro orientation of that first. It's always a function of what the economic environment is and what the interest rate environment is. But I think if you\u2019ve seen from our third quarter results that the other businesses that drive this company performed quite well in the quarter. And we\u2019re excited about their growth. But as John indicated, it's a little bit sooner to rate in terms of what the impact, the longer-term impact of the sales practices issues are going to be within community banking. But, boy, I'm very optimistic about the leadership of Mary Mack, very optimistic about our ability to work through those. But it's going to take a while. And as we said, it could get a little bit worse before it gets better. But I\u2019ll tell you, the team in community banking is up to it.","John Shrewsberry","I think those \u2013 what we announced at the last investor day in terms of targets are still a reasonable guideposts. I said just a little bit earlier, I think we\u2019ll still be at the higher end on expenses. And, of course, now in addition to what we just talked about with Matt about compliance costs, we\u2019re going to have incremental operating losses as a result of this litigation etc. That\u2019s got to work its way through. And that will definitely be around for a little while. As Tim mentioned, we\u2019re going to have an off-cycle investor day next May. And between now and then, we'll be talking a lot. And if we think that those aren\u2019t reasonable guideposts anymore, we\u2019ll tell people.","Erika Najarian","And my second \u2013 my follow-up question, part of your stock\u2019s appeal has always been the dividend and the overall capital return, and I'm wondering if some of the overhang from these issues from litigation, from potential DoJ investigation impact how you think about capital return going forward?","Timothy Sloan","Overall, it doesn\u2019t. We\u2019ve provided similar metrics in terms of the range of capital payout, and we are well within those this quarter, and our expectation is to continue to stay in those ranges.","John Shrewsberry","We certainly account for a broad range of stressed outcomes in the capital planning process as it relates to operational risk and operational losses. That\u2019s always been true. And it\u2019s true for other filers as well. So it will certainly be our intention to take a similar path going forward with the approach to distribution that we\u2019ve had.","Erika Najarian","Okay, thank you.","Operator","You next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Timothy Sloan","Good morning, Betsy.","Betsy Graseck","Hey, good morning. Hey, could you give us a sense as to why you chose Mary Mack to run the retail bank and give us a sense as to what she's bringing from the wealth management platform, from anything she's done at Wachovia and what your expectations are for how she\u2019s going to deliver?","Timothy Sloan","All good questions. First, Mary was the best person for the job. I could not be more excited about what she's been able to accomplish in this environment thus far. She brings experience not only within the brokerage business, but also in the retail banking business. And my expectations are very high and I hope she's listening because they\u2019re high and I'm pretty certain that she's going to be able to exceed the expectations. But she was the best person for the job.","Betsy Graseck","But is that \u2013 can you just give us a sense why \u2013 we\u2019re looking for a culture shift or culture enhancement, change in the business model, and that\u2019s a big ask. So I'm just wondering if \u2013 what you saw in her at \u2013 while she was running wealth management?","Timothy Sloan","Betsy, I saw an executive with decades of experience in the financial services industry and decades of experience at Wachovia and Wells Fargo, who's been through a variety of challenges in her career and who is an incredibly effective leader and somebody who I believe in, and our entire senior leadership team and the board believe, that who can effectuate the change that is needed on our retail banking platform.","Betsy Graseck","And is there opportunities to enhance the efficiency of that platform over time, not in the next several quarters as you work with the outreach with your clients, but over time given the digital investments spend that you've been making and I think given the fact you\u2019ve been running them as separate geographies, so maybe I'm wrong there, maybe very centralized.","Timothy Sloan","Well, the short answer is yes. And we talked about that a fair amount at investor day and we talked about it as part of an omni-channel experience. Our customers continue to use our branches as frequently today as they have a month ago, a year ago and so on. But having said, there is incredible opportunities to continue to improve our product set, how we offer convenience to our customers, how our products and our people interact with each other. And, candidly, that's one of the reasons why we announced on Monday the creation of the payments virtual 20 channel and innovation group. And if you want to ask why we picked Avid for that because she was the best person for the job. And that change, I think, I want to just reinforce is very important because what we've done is we've brought together all of the payments businesses, how so many of our customers, both retail and commercial, interact with us every day, we brought them all together. And we think that\u2019s going to create a fair amount of innovation, but also efficiency over time.","Betsy Graseck","Okay, thank you.","Timothy Sloan","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","John Pancari","Good morning.","Timothy Sloan","Good morning, John.","John Pancari","Just want to go to the wholesale impact. I know you commented on the select states, municipalities that have made some decisions to pullback business. Could you just clarify again, which states and municipalities have indicated \u2013 I believe, it was California. We\u2019ve also seen Chicago. And I believe Seattle. And then how we should think about that impact. Can you help us quantify the amount of revenue that you generally generate from that type of business?","Timothy Sloan","Sure. John, I'll start. Maybe John will want to jump in. I don't have a list of all the states and municipalities that have either indicated they want to put us on a temporary pause or those that have reaffirmed their business with us. In our investor day materials, we broke out the revenue associated with our government and institutional banking business. One of the benefits that we have at Wells Fargo is that we have these diversified set of businesses, and so frequently in our list of 90 different businesses, not every one of them is necessarily material in any one quarter to the impact of the company. Having said that, our goal is to earn all that business back. Those states and municipalities had chosen to do business with Wells Fargo for a reason. We have great people. We have great products. Are we disappointed that they decided to put us on suspension or pause? We are. But given the environment, it's not surprising. And we respect their decisions. But we\u2019re going to work hard to make things right within the company to earn that business back over time.","John Pancari","Okay. All right. Thanks. And the separately, back on to the cost side, I know you flagged the legal costs for the quarter and then you also alluded to a more focused marketing effort, I want to see if you have any way to help us quantify those two items at least for the near term. And then separately, the offsets that could come on the expense side to those types of items, I believe you allude to branch consolidation potential later on in your slide deck as well as the travel that you flagged on your comments, so wanted to see how we could think about the timing of that type of relief from those items.","John Shrewsberry","Sure. So this is John. There\u2019s a lot of puts and takes there, which is why we usually revert back to the efficiency ratio of target because while we\u2019re definitely going to have elevated compliance related costs and operational loss related costs, we\u2019ve got a lot of initiatives underway, some of which you alluded to. Some are immediate and some are over the forecast horizon of a couple of years. And it\u2019s designed to keep us in or below the high-end of 55% to 59%. So my guidance at this point is that we\u2019re going to be at the high end of that range accounting for all of those things that we\u2019re showing as levers in order to offset the elevated expense.","John Pancari","Okay. And no quantification of the legal costs this quarter, correct?","John Shrewsberry","It\u2019s difficult to do. It\u2019s very early for the matters that we filed in our 8-K and that you\u2019re reading about in the newspaper. And as those things mature over time, then they\u2019ll begin to have an impact. But they don\u2019t have a dollar impact yet.","John Pancari","Okay. Thanks, John.","John Shrewsberry","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Timothy Sloan","Good morning, John.","John McDonald","Hi. Good morning. Tim, I know it's early here, but maybe you could talk about what factors are you going to be balancing when you redesign the sales incentive scorecard? How are you going to make sure you don't overshoot and cut off legitimate needs-based selling and relationship building while also making sure you don't encourage the wrong behavior?","Timothy Sloan","Yeah, it\u2019s a good question, John. I think the focus is going to be, first, on \u2013 and this is a little bit high level, but I'm thinking about what are the drivers of developing those lifelong relationships with our customers. It\u2019s about service. It's about convenience. So think about our bankers being incented to provide good service, and so we\u2019ll be measuring that on an independent basis, to think about our bankers being focused on helping our customers do more business, but being measured on product usage and activity as opposed to individual product sales and also about an overall growth in assets and balances and also think about it being much more driven to a team approach as opposed to just on an individual basis. We think that that is going to be successful. Now, Mary and team are working on the specifics of that right now and when we complete the analysis and they recommend the program, that's one of the other areas that we\u2019ll provide some transparency about.","John McDonald","Okay. And then, so a follow-up for John, on the net interest margin and net interest income, when we try to assess the impact of what a potential rate hike would do, one rate hike, it\u2019s hard to discern what happened after the December hike last time because the first quarter, you had a few moving parts. What\u2019s your best guess of kind of what kind of help you get to your NIM from one rate hike? And then what\u2019s the ongoing impact to NIM on the side of \u2013 from TLAC issuance in terms of drag?","John Shrewsberry","The net number that I would look to for ease of modeling if we got one 25 basis point move would be something on the order of $150 million per quarter in the first year. There\u2019s a lot going into that in terms of asset liability mix, loan growth, deposit growth, TLAC issuance, etc. But that\u2019s a reasonable placeholder that accounts for the net.","John McDonald","Okay, thank you.","John Shrewsberry","You\u2019re welcome.","Timothy Sloan","Thanks, John.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Company. Please go ahead.","Timothy Sloan","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Miller","Hey, good morning, guys. Thank you very much. Hey, relative to some of the shakeup, you guys had an executive leadership. Has there been any thought to bring somebody from the outside? Because a lot of you guys have been with the bank for multiple, multiple years. And to bring somebody from the outside to give a fresh look of the culture.","Timothy Sloan","It\u2019s a fair question. It\u2019s one we've been getting. I think the board, by the changes that we\u2019ve made over the last week and a few weeks is comfortable with and very supportive of the management team. I think over the last few years, really since the financial crisis, we had a huge opportunity years ago to reset the entire team and we selected the best folks that were available for all the roles. Since then, one of the great things about the company has been how we\u2019ve been able to attract many senior leaders from outside the company, not only in our business lines, but also in many of our support functions, including corporate risk. So that's already really happened from my perspective.","Paul Miller","Hello?","Timothy Sloan","Yeah, you there? Go ahead.","Paul Miller","I'm sorry. And then, on the independent audit, is there any timeline for that? Did you disclose who is doing the audit?","Timothy Sloan","Well, it\u2019s an investigation that\u2019s being spearheaded by Shearman & Sterling, which is working on behalf of the board. It\u2019s independent and we don't have a date by which it\u2019s going to be finished. Hopefully, it will be finished as soon as practical, but I think independence and thoroughness is much more important than getting something done in a short period of time.","Paul Miller","Hey, guys. Thank you very much for taking my questions.","Timothy Sloan","Thank you, Paul.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Mike Mayo of CLSA. Please go ahead.","Timothy Sloan","Good morning, Mike.","Mike Mayo","Hi. Of the 115,000 accounts that were open without authorization and charged to fee, how many customers did those 115,000 accounts reflect? And what\u2019s been your retention rate of those customers?","Timothy Sloan","I think the customer count is somewhat lower than the incidence of the product count at least. With respect to the $1.5 million deposit accounts, which is the bigger number, but the ones that couldn\u2019t be rolled out. That\u2019s related to 1.1 million customers. So it was a 3:2 ratio there. So I\u2019d say it\u2019s somewhat south of a 100,000 customers for the 115,000 impacted accounts. And the retention ratio \u2013 I don\u2019t have the retention ratio at hand. It\u2019s not something that\u2019s independently being measured, at least not at this level.","Mike Mayo","I guess, a follow-up, this is a long wind-up here, but it\u2019s a little frustrating not getting that retention [indiscernible] the customers that were impacted the most, what\u2019s been your retention rate. I guess we can\u2019t really ask about the internal investigation. There\u2019s no timeframe. We can\u2019t ask who knew what and when. We can\u2019t ask why it took so long to stop the problem. This is the first time we\u2019ve had to ask a question on the call. We don\u2019t have Steve Sanger on this call. And so, it\u2019s a long wind-up like I said. A little bit more on potential branch closings. Slide, I guess, 24, you talk about, it could allow you to review the branch footprint for consolidation opportunities. 6000 branches. You\u2019re having success with digital delivery and it\u2019s exciting that Avid is promoted into this new position. I'm sure you\u2019ll look at that. Can you give us something concrete as relates to all this? Maybe when you look at the new chapter, what the potential might be for efficiency improvements, especially if you\u2019re telling us efficiency should be elevated for some time?","Timothy Sloan","Mike, listen, I appreciate your question. And as one of the many stakeholders at Wells Fargo, I'm sorry that we've disappointed you. But we just spent 30 minutes talking about what\u2019s going on at the company and we provided a lot of information. We provided new slides that provide a tremendous amount of detail on some of the retail sales practices issue and we deliberately and diligently walked through the performance of all of our businesses. And you know what, if that doesn\u2019t satisfy you, I am sorry.","Mike Mayo","All right. Well, maybe at the next year\u2019s investor day, do you think we\u2019ll hear more about how you\u2019ll configure your branches and kind of the next stage of that?","Timothy Sloan","Sure, absolutely. We talked about that at our last investor day. And that\u2019s one of the reasons why we want to accelerate the timing of our investor day because we want to provide increased transparency which we\u2019ve done today and we want to provide a more continuous updates as to how we are operating the company.","Mike Mayo","All right. Well, I look forward to the incremental updates that you give. Thanks.","Timothy Sloan","Likewise.","Operator","The next question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies and Company. Please go ahead.","Ken Usdin","Thanks a lot. I was wondering if we could just talk about the environment a little bit. Loan growth was okay, but, certainly, we've seen this kind of air pocket on the commercial side a little bit from the industry perspective. And I'm wondering if you could just talk about what you guys are seeing in terms of commercial demand, especially? And if you\u2019re seeing any just noted changes in terms of customer activity and whether you think that's either fleeting or whether you guys are a taking a different view of the extension or credit at all?","Timothy Sloan","I think, overall, in the wholesale businesses, as you said, every quarter can be a little bit different in terms of loan growth. We didn't see any trends in any of our wholesale businesses that would cause us concern that commercial real estate loans are going one way or asset-based loans are going another. One of the reasons why our loan growth in the third quarter was in commercial wasn't as strong as in prior quarter is because our energy book declined by \u2013 I can't recall exact figure \u2013 $1.5 billion to $2 billion. We\u2019re still very active in the energy industry. But it makes sense that there is a bit of a decline there. We had a few kind of larger underwritings that either paid off or were transformed into long-term debt or equity for our customers, but nothing alarming from our perspective.","Ken Usdin","All right. And then to follow-up, John, I noticed that the securities book was $390 billion at the end of the quarter. It looks like you're moving some of that liquidity and maybe also replacement of some of that loan growth. Can you just talk about the reinvestment philosophy? What kind of stuff you're investing in? And are you able to find a good ROA, ROE on moving the book into securities at this time, given where rates are?","John Shrewsberry","Sure. Well, the first call on that liquidity would be loans that we just talked about to the extent that there was incremental loan demand. We\u2019ve \u2013 versus how we\u2019ve deployed liquidity in the past, we, obviously, have more of a bias toward things that qualify for HQLA just because of the environment that we\u2019re living in for liquidity. So you\u2019ve seen a lot of agency mortgage-backed securities. You\u2019ve seen some treasuries. We\u2019ve actually got a program of late to be a little bit more active in the Ginnie Mae securities because of their liquidity properties. We also have a portfolio of \u2013 a smaller portfolio on the security side are somewhat more credit sensitive, so high-grade corporates or CMBS, things like that we replenish every quarter as well. The returns are okay and we have this lower for longer bias that makes us comfortable deploying capital in that way and liquidity in that way and the capital to withstand what happens if we\u2019re wrong about rates and we end up in a higher rate environment. But it\u2019s consistent with the approach that we\u2019ve taken over the last couple of quarters. We paused in the first quarter while there was a real, real drop in \u2013 it was market volatility that gave rise to risk-free rates going as well as they have. But now in the second quarter and the third quarter, we\u2019ve been back to converting cash into duration basically.","Ken Usdin","Thanks, John.","John Shrewsberry","That helpful?","Ken Usdin","Yep.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Brian Foran","Good morning. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about overdraft charges. A few articles out there have kind of maybe asserted some of the opt-in processes were over-zealous, let's call it, at the retail network, so is that something you've looked at as part of your review? And then, we don't get a ton of history from the reg filings, but it is broken out now. It seems like your overdraft was running about 12%, plus 12% year-over-year in terms of growth which is a good bit stronger than the industry, so even separate from any of the sales practice stuff, maybe just what was driving that kind of overdraft fee growth?","Timothy Sloan","Sure, Brian. We saw some of the same reports that you did. And, candidly, those were a little bit of a surprise. Having said that, like all facets of our retail banking business, we\u2019re going to review those. And to the extent there any issues, we will deal with them. But we\u2019re not aware today that they were a driver of overdraft income.","Brian Foran","Great. And then maybe on some of these new account production metrics, it's very helpful. I appreciate the disclosure. I'm assuming the average life of checking accounts and credit cards is pretty long, so is there like a rule of thumb translation you can give us? If the run rate of new accounts is down 25% for six months, let's say, is that a 1 percentage point headwind to balance growth, 2 percentage points? How should we think about that in terms of thinking about balance growth, all else equal over the next two years?","Timothy Sloan","Yeah. I would separate that into credit cards, one, and deposit accounts, second. I think credit cards it's a little bit tricky just because over the last few years we\u2019ve seen such gross in our credit card business in terms of penetration and our usage numbers have been good. But you could imagine a point where there \u2013 if credit card growth is down a little bit that in a year or so from now that we could see some decline. But, of course, that assumes that we don't make any other changes in our credit card products, in our offerings, how we interact with customers and the like. So don\u2019t have a great rule of thumb there. And, again, as it relates to the deposit accounts \u2013 and, John, jump in here if you feel differently \u2013 we\u2019re so new into the impact. And what we tried to do in the expanded disclosure is show you the decline in a monthly basis, but also give you a sense of what the impact was on the total base. I think that's how I would think about it. And I appreciate that you appreciated our increased disclosure.","Brian Foran","Thank you.","John Shrewsberry","And I guess the only thing I would add is that not all deposit accounts are equal in terms of the contribution to deposit balances. I think we have deposits growing by $6 billion when we have new accounts not opening as quickly.","Timothy Sloan","Brian, that\u2019s another reason why we want to continue to provide enhanced disclosure because we want to make sure that you are comfortable with how any of the headwinds we\u2019re facing right now are affecting business.","Brian Foran","Thank you, both.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","Timothy Sloan","Good morning, Eric.","Eric Wasserstrom","Hi. Thanks for taking my call. I guess my question gets back to, sadly, to the account issue. But can you describe if there's been any review of interactions and communications about these kinds of issues with the board? And just to sort of get to my follow-up, what I'm really wondering is, if this raises the risk of qualitative review, as it relates to CCAR or any other kind of regulatory action?","Timothy Sloan","So let me take the first part of that question. As I mentioned, the board has engaged Shearman & Sterling to do an investigation of retail sales product issues and other matters. And we want to be very respectful of their process. And we want that process to be taken seriously and to be viewed independently. So I don't want to comment on the specifics of how they\u2019re going to go about their review. But we look forward to\u2026","Eric Wasserstrom","Sorry to interrupt, but I guess I'm getting to the issue of \u2013 it seemed like at least from the press reports, this issue went on for several years before management made the board aware and I'm just wondering if that issue has been addressed.","Timothy Sloan","Well, here's how I would answer that and that is there\u2019s going to be an independent review and I think that it would be appropriate to wait for the independent review as opposed to jumping to conclusion about what media might think. I don't mean to be disrespectful to the media, but I don't know if they have all the facts and the review will look at all the facts and will make some recommendations, I'm sure.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.","Marty Mosby","Thanks.","Timothy Sloan","Hi, Marty.","Marty Mosby","Hey. You created a new role on the board, a Vice Chair, and you put Elizabeth Duke in that role and appointed her there. She has an extensive amount of industry and regulatory experience. You created that role for a purpose. Can you frame that a little bit for us and let us understand better what you \u2013 how you expect to leverage her in that role?","Timothy Sloan","Sure. Marty, I want to be very respectful of the fact that neither John nor I created that role, the board did. First, we have a terrific board. It\u2019s diverse in terms of the types of industries that they\u2019ve been involved in, their experience, and we just couldn't be more pleased with the quality of that board, in particular, having both Steve Sanger and Betsy being \u2013 Betsy Duke being willing to step up into these roles is I think absolutely the right decision that the board should be making in the circumstance. Separating the CEO and Chairman role is something that we've done in the past. But, again, in particular to Betsy, to have somebody like that with not only industry experience, but also regulatory experience in this environment to provide assistance for Steve is exactly what\u2019s needed.","Marty Mosby","And then not to Monday morning quarterback or rehash what you've done in the past, but, Tim, I really wanted to ask you, what, in this experience, has changed the way you think about the role of CEO, as you now assume it, and Wells Fargo as a company or a culture? And what is the key takeaway? Whenever you go through these extreme crises, there's always something that you've learned that will make the company better as you move forward. What have you learned that you're going to now take to the \u2013 your new role and be able to push forward?","Timothy Sloan","Marty, that\u2019s a great question. And by the way, don\u2019t apologize for being a Monday morning quarterback. Candidly, we deserve that and we\u2019re used to it over the last ferw weeks. I also want to preface my remarks by saying, I\u2019ve been in this role for less than 48 hours. And I want you to have high expectations for me, but actually I want to make sure that those are a bit tempered. When I think about the retail sales practices issues we\u2019ve had at the company, I wish that the business had escalated the issues sooner. I wish when the business escalated the issue that while the senior management team did a lot in response, I wish we could have done more. And I highlight that because I think that one of the lessons that I've learned \u2013 one of the lessons the entire company has learned and one of the reasons that we\u2019re organized the way we are today and we\u2019re making many of the changes that we\u2019ve talked about are that we've got to escalate issues wherever they occur within the company sooner. We\u2019ve got to deal with them sooner and we\u2019ve got to make sure that to the extent that they have any impact on our customers that we deal with that impact as quickly as we can. So it\u2019s about escalation and it's about speed and dealing with challenges and also dealing with opportunities as they come, Marty.","Marty Mosby","Do you feel that in that vein, being a high performer and being looked at as a high-quality bank for so long created some blinders, that maybe those blinders have now been taken off in your \u2013 like you're saying, reacting and moving quicker at this point?","Timothy Sloan","Yeah, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a fair question. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ve created blinders. But, again, the fact of the matter is we should have escalated these issues sooner and we should have dealt with them more quickly than we did. So to the extent that some of our prior success impacted that, so be it. I can assure you that we\u2019ve talked about what you just described a lot. And we\u2019re going to make sure that that doesn't create a blinder now or in the future.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Chris Kotowski","Good morning. I never thought I'd ask you about this page of your press release again, but I'm looking at page 31 at the accretable yield, which usually wiggles and wobbles by $100 million or $200 million a quarter, and all of a sudden the expected cash flows are down by almost $5 billion. So can you say what happened there and does that \u2013 is that a headwind to net interest income going forward?","Timothy Sloan","I'm glad you asked. I wasn\u2019t sure whether anybody was going to get there. But the \u2013 so the accretable balance was down $4 billion in the quarter. It stands at about \u2013 I think \u2013 about $11.2 billion right now. So what\u2019s happened here is that prepayments have sped up. We\u2019ve reached a point where a lot of these borrowers have gotten themselves in the money for refis because of the path of HPI and we\u2019re experiencing and modeling faster cash flows as a result of that. And so, frankly, in the near term, I think we\u2019ll see an increased interest income as more of that comes through. But what it means is those loans won\u2019t be outstanding for as long as we might have previously predicted because they will be refi-ed.","Chris Kotowski","So that would be elevated accretion into net interest income than the next four \u2013 couple quarters, whatever, as you experience that?","Timothy Sloan","Correct.","Chris Kotowski","Okay. And then, headwind in future quarters after that. Okay. And the other thing I was wondering is how should we think about the impact of the settlement on op risk RWAs? Obviously, the financial impact is minor, but the impact on your company has been big in terms of management and press and reputation and so on. So how quickly does it all get factored in and any light you can shed on whatever the algorithm is?","Timothy Sloan","Yeah. So it\u2019s tough to say because the chapter \u2013 the middle chapters haven\u2019t been written of what the op risk outcome is. We know what the settlement was, but we\u2019ve got a variety of legal matters that we have to attend to, all of which will factor into a future view of what the total op risk experience is from it. So at the margin, it would be increasing. I think I mentioned earlier, in CCAR, our own stress analysis, we concoct and imagine outsized op risk outcomes to demonstrate that we\u2019ve got the capital and earnings power to overcome them and the magnitude of what we\u2019re talking about here frankly, \u2013 while it\u2019s significant, is modest in comparison to what you can imagine in stress, both in our own scenario as well as in CCAR. And, of course, what it means from the regulators perspective is they think about our op risk capacity in the future is up to them. But it will have an increase with the margin. It doesn't have a material increase in the moment because the numbers, as you say, have not been that big on the scale of Wells Fargo's balance sheet and earnings power so far. But it\u2019s a headwind and op risk. We\u2019ve been fortunate to have had modest op risk outcomes relative to the GSIB peer group over the CCAR era and this feels different because of the severity of the reputational harm that\u2019s been created.","Chris Kotowski","Okay. Alrighty. Thank you","Chris Kotowski","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.","Timothy Sloan","Hey Brian.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Great, thank you. Hi. Quick question just on \u2013 easy one first, on the long term debt, I know you said it went up based on the TLAC issuance, but didn't you also have debt that you put on related to the GE deals for pre-funding those deals that was puttable? Is that still on the balance sheet or did you put that back this quarter as well?","John Shrewsberry","Yeah, it\u2019s still on the balance sheet. So it is puttable and it's FHLB asset financing. So it shows up as longer-term debt. And you can see that on page 15, I think, of today's deck. So still in place. Now, of course, we\u2019re just using it as part of the general liability structure overall and will use it as long as we think that it is a good component of the stat.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay. Thanks. And then on the slide where you're monitoring the customer activity in the retail banking, you note that consumer checking account opens were down 25% year-on-year, credit card applications down 20% year-on-year. But if you start to annualize those numbers, they start to get very large, if you think about the credit card applications. That would be down on a full-year basis down 12% year-on-year relative to the total outstanding. So is there a way to quantify what that monthly impact was as it relates to revenue? I'm sure like not all applications actually get opened, but\u2026?","John Shrewsberry","The waterfall there is that applications may or may not become approvals and approvals may or may not become activated cards and activated cards have to become utilized and utilized cards become balances and balances accrue interest. So there\u2019s a lot of steps that have to be gone through before applications have an impact on either assets or revenue. One of the reasons for showing this is to help people understand what the immediate impact is and then to roll it forwards, so we can see whether annualizing that September number is really the right way to approach. September, obviously, was the first month. It\u2019s the month where we pulled back on marketing. It\u2019s the month when our team members were probably the most uncertain in terms of what the go forward model is going to be as we pivot toward service. It\u2019s the month when our customers and prospects are first reflecting their real dissatisfaction with Wells Fargo, all those things put together. And those are going to change in different ways as we roll it forward. So it\u2019s the installed base that drives the P&L results and that is where it is. And Tim mentioned that we\u2019re going to roll this forward probably during the quarter, so people can see whether October looks like September and November looks like October and then we can start to build a projectable impact on the trend. Hopefully, that\u2019s helpful.","Brian Kleinhanzl","It is. Thanks.","Timothy Sloan","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Timothy Sloan","Vivek, how are you this morning?","Vivek Juneja","Good. Good, Tim. Congratulations even though we would have all hoped it would have been under better circumstances.","Timothy Sloan","Me too.","Vivek Juneja","A question for both of you. You took a charge in the second quarter for CFPB several months which was announced September 8. Why no disclosure in the financial filings and are you planning to change anything as you think about that aspect as you look forward?","John Shrewsberry","So it\u2019s tricky one because we certainly account for these items when they become known or probable and estimable under GAAP. But, separately, we\u2019re also \u2013 these are also part of a confidential supervisory information that \u2013 there\u2019s a limitation of how much you can talk about while you\u2019re in the middle of a negotiation with the regulator. They can talk about whatever they choose to and they do sometimes and other times they wait until it ends. So we think about the circumstances in the moment. We, obviously, would love to be just close with and help people understand what's going on. We\u2019re certainly taking the charges when we need to take the charge. But we\u2019re not alone in that discussion. And usually, the circumstances are governed by \u2013 in the case of a regulator, the regulator. So that\u2019s how I think about that.","Vivek Juneja","So not even without giving us the amount, you couldn't even disclose a set of facts or the existence of those discussions?","Timothy Sloan","Vivek, the way that I would think about it is that this stems from the lawsuit that the City of LA filed a year before that. And so, there were issues that we were dealing with. But as John said, we\u2019ve got to be very careful and respectful of what we disclose in terms of conversations that we have with our regulators and that's really important, and the so short answer is we followed appropriate policies, procedures, rules and disclosure requirements.","Vivek Juneja","Okay. Separate question, sort of linked to all of this regulatory scrutiny that's going on, Tim. As a G-SIFI bank, scrutiny, obviously, with all of these happening, is going to increase for you. Does that have any bearing on how you think about the asset size as one metric? You're almost $1.95 trillion, the third largest bank. Citi reported a gap, gets companies to widen [indiscernible] growing even faster. Is that something that factors into how big is too big or what does it mean longer term?","Timothy Sloan","Yeah. It\u2019s a fair question. I think \u2013 we\u2019re focused less on size because size is ultimately determined by our customers. It\u2019s not necessarily determined by us. We want to arm our team members with the right incentives and have them work together and provide a good advice and service to our customers and make sure that we\u2019ve got great products out there. That\u2019s what\u2019s going to drive our size. Having said that, we need to make sure that as we think about our returns, so putting the [indiscernible] you might use, which we do all the time. Are we getting and providing the appropriate returns for our investors based upon our size? That's how we think about it.","Having said that, we\u2019ve looked at across the company and you\u2019ve seen us exit some businesses that we believed would not provide us with as strong return as they might provide another owner. We sold our crop business. We sold our HSA business and so on. And because we appreciate in this environment and given the amount of liquidity and capital that we have that we\u2019ve got to be very mindful in terms of for how we deploy our assets.","Vivek Juneja","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research LLC. Please go ahead.","Nancy Bush","Good morning, gentlemen.","Timothy Sloan","Good morning, Nancy.","Nancy Bush","Couple of questions, Tim. The first one, much has been made of the investigation that the board is independently conducting, the Shearman & Sterling investigation. I have not heard everything that's been said about that, whether the results of that will be made publicly known when it's over.","Timothy Sloan","A good question. I do not know the answer to that. The board will decide that.","Nancy Bush","Okay. So there's no sort of regulatory imperative along with that? I'm assuming the regulators will have a look at that, but I'm just wondering if there's a transparency issue here that sort of needs to be overcome.","Timothy Sloan","Well, I wouldn\u2019t jump to a conclusion about whether it\u2019s a transparency issue or not. As you can see, we\u2019re trying to be more transparent in terms of the operations of the company than we\u2019ve ever been. But, Nancy, I want to be very respectful to the Board because that\u2019s the Board\u2019s decision.","Nancy Bush","Okay. My second question would be this. Obviously, there are going to some near term issues here, not only retaining customers, but in attracting new ones. And I'm wondering if there is any thought being given to deposit pricing or fees, et cetera, as one of the levers to attract these clients?","Timothy Sloan","Nancy, all good ideas in this company are on the table. And we\u2019ve got an impressive management team whenever a company and it\u2019s the certainly case for us faced with these kinds of challenges. It\u2019s absolutely appropriate to step back and think about all aspects of how we provide product and service and convenience to our customers. And we certainly are thinking about price. Having said that, when you think about the driver of our company, one of the drivers for our company for decades is building that lifelong relationship that's not based on price. So could we make some changes in our pricing of certain products, deposit or otherwise? Sure, we could. But I would not expect us to lead with price.","Nancy Bush","Okay. If I could just ask as an add-on to that. Obviously, your employees have really been put through the wringer through this whole process. Is there any thought about additional compensation or bonuses this year or something just as a way of saying, we're sorry?","Timothy Sloan","I think that saying that we put our team members through the wringer is an understatement. I really do. I really do. Especially team members on our retail banking platform. But it's throughout the company. We want to make sure that we retain the best people that we can. And we think we offer a very competitive set of compensation and benefits. We talked a little bit about that on one of the slides. But we appreciate that we\u2019ve got to recruit our team in this kind of environment and all ideas are on the table.","Nancy Bush","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Kevin Barker","Thank you. I just wanted to follow up on\u2026","Timothy Sloan","Hi, Kevin.","Kevin Barker","Hey, how are you doing? Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to follow-up in regards to your comments around the expenses and the efficiency ratio and you're saying it's going to be elevated. And you said it's going to be elevated or on the higher end of the 55% to 59% range into 2016. Are you now saying that that range is no longer valid and longer term \u2013 going into 2017, you might be above the efficiency ratio range or how should we think about that?","Timothy Sloan","You should think about it as an annual range. This quarter, we popped up above it, but still a good annual range. And if we start thinking that it\u2019s not, then we\u2019ll telegraph that to people. It\u2019s hard to be more specific. The operational or compliance-related issues are one set of cost that maybe can be modeled in the near term. But to the extent that we\u2019ve got lumpy operational losses that drive it up, those are just harder to predict and they\u2019ll happen when they happen. But if we think we\u2019re \u2013 the band is no longer the right band, then we\u2019ll tell you that.","Kevin Barker","Okay. And then when we think about the spend on marketing and compliance, are you expecting that to be offset by the potential to have branch closures or reductions in your branch costs in order to keep the expenses under control due to other areas or how should we think about the puts and takes around the expense number?","Timothy Sloan","Yeah. I wouldn't tie the two together. And I certainly wouldn't be focused on branch closures. What we\u2019ve talked about, and again I reflect back and how we described our branch platform at investor day, that we continue to update it all the time. We move branches around. We open new branches. We combine branches. We may close a few. I think this year, in fact, there\u2019s going to be a reduction unrelated to what we\u2019ve talked about here. But as John described, we\u2019ve got to look at our expenses and we have been looking at our expenses for some period of time to be able to keep the efficiency ratio within the range, even though it's at the upper end of the range because we need to invest not only in compliance, we\u2019ve got to invest in technology and bringing on new products and cyber defense and all of the above.","John Shrewsberry","Another thing, Kevin, is \u2013 as it relates \u2013 because other people have asked today with regard to that whatever might happen on the branch network side of things. That doesn't necessarily give you an immediate lift if you\u2019re thinking about today's elevated compliance cost or today\u2019s elevated marketing costs. If we\u2019re making moves on the physical distribution side of our business, that creates benefits in year two, year three, year four, but it\u2019s not really an immediate offset. So as Tim said, I wouldn\u2019t think about those as offsetting levers.","Kevin Barker","Okay. Do you think you can stay within your target if rates were to remain flat from where they are right now?","John Shrewsberry","Well, the way that range was constructed was with our expectation for rates, which is practically flat. But, for example, if we get a 25 basis point move in December, that wouldn\u2019t be unreasonable and that\u2019s essentially baked into being in that range. If we stay flat, we\u2019re not that far off of that. It\u2019s not that big. If we had a big move up in rates, which I think is highly unlikely, then that would probably move us down in the range. I think we\u2019ve said that before.","Kevin Barker","Yeah. Thank you very much.","John Shrewsberry","Thank you.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.","Timothy Sloan","Good morning.","Brennan Hawken","Good morning. Sneaking in under the wire here. Just wanted to follow-up with \u2013 on Marty's question. Tim, the response seemed largely tactical. And so, I guess, as far as thinking about changes that your leadership might mean, does that mean that your view on the strategic approach versus prior leadership is largely unchanged? And it's certainly true you haven't been in the seat very long, but the idea that you would be taking over is certainly something that wasn't out of the blue. So I'm sure you had some ideas coming in here?","Timothy Sloan","Well, I have lots of ideas, but candidly I'd be a lot more nervous if I were you if I came out with some new strategic plan for Wells Fargo in 48 hours. That would be pretty dangerous from my perspective. But, look, the company \u2013 when I think about the company that I joined 29 years ago, it\u2019s so different today. My guess is Wells Fargo is going to be different five years from now, 10 years from now and 15 years now. And you know what, I hope it is, because by changing and adapting to the environment we are in, that\u2019s one of the reasons why we've had a history of success, notwithstanding the last month or so. The last month or so has been a real challenge as we\u2019ve talked about on the call today and I am sure we\u2019ll continue to talk about for a while. But we've made some important announcements this week. Again, you might call them tactical. I think they're actually in the strategic bend. The creation of a new business line, the elevation of some new senior leaders in our wholesale banking and our community banking business as well as consumer lending. They\u2019re going to bring some new ideas. So, no, fair point that it\u2019s probably a little bit more tactical and strategic, but over time you'll see some updates and we'll talk about those over the next few months and I'm sure we'll talk about some of that at Investor day next year.","Brennan Hawken","Sure. And actually, the spirit of my question was actually in response to Marty's question. I think you had talked about making adjustments to the escalation methods on the back, right? So that was more the reference of tactical rather than the management changes that you\u2019ve made. Okay. Sorry, Time, go ahead.","Timothy Sloan","No, no. I appreciate it. Fair question. So a different direction here, for the second question. One of your wire house competitors did come out and confirm the recent stories on their policies for dealing with the DOL rule. Have you finalized your policies and can you tell us any details about those?","John Shrewsberry","So we\u2019re \u2013 this is John.","John Shrewsberry","We\u2019re still in the process of refining the overall implementation approach to be compliant with the rules. I think we\u2019re still going to approach every client relationship with an emphasis on every client having a customized plan that guides their investment activity. We\u2019re going to emphasize advisory solutions and continue to offer traditional brokerage for certain clients that include self-directed options. And we\u2019ll be sharing more details as we get closer to implementation. I think with each ensuing quarter between now and later in 17, you should expect to hear a little bit more about the specifics of the implementation. But we haven't reached the same conclusion in the same timeframe as the comparator that I think you're referring to.","Brennan Hawken","Thanks for the call.","Timothy Sloan","Thank you.","I know it's been a busy morning for everybody and our call has been a little bit longer than normal. But I really want to thank all of you for your thoughtful questions, the discussion I think has been incredibly helpful for both John and me and we look forward to continuing to provide additional disclosure to you as we move through the quarter. And we thank you for your interest in Wells Fargo.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for joining.

My name is Regina and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference.","John Campbell","Thank you, Regina. Good morning. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO and President, Tim Sloan, and our CFO, John Shrewsberry, will discuss preliminary results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our first quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our Web-site at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to [caution you that we] [ph] may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement.","Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release, and in the quarterly supplement available on our Web-site.","I will now turn the call over to our CEO and President, Tim Sloan.","Timothy J. Sloan","Thank you, John. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I know it's a busy morning for everyone. As we noted in our earnings release, our first quarter financial results are preliminary. These preliminary results are subject to change due to our ongoing discussions that we are having with the CFPB and OCC to resolve matters regarding our compliance risk management program and our past practices involving certain automobile collateral protection insurance policies and certain mortgage interest rate lock extensions, which the CFPB and the OCC have collectively offered to resolve for an aggregate of $1 billion in civil money penalties.","At this time, we are unable to predict the final resolution of the CFPB\/OCC matter and cannot reasonably estimate our related loss contingency. Accordingly, the preliminary financial results we report today may need to be revised to reflect additional accruals for the CFPB\/OCC matter when we file our final statements in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q with the SEC. It is important to note that these are not new matters.","Turning to our preliminary first quarter results, we earned $5.9 billion. Our results included continued strong credit performance, liquidity, and capital levels. We returned $4 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases in the first quarter, up 30% from a year ago. There were [indiscernible] noteworthy items that impacted our results, which John will highlight later on the call.","I want to focus my comments on the actions we took during the quarter to transform Wells Fargo as part of our efforts to build a better bank and rebuild trust with our stakeholders. These efforts include progress on our [six] [ph] goals.","Starting with our goal of becoming the leader in customer service and advice, we focused on new ways to create a better customer experience. This includes a number of changes to help our customers better manage their accounts by leveraging data and technology.","In the first quarter we rolled out predictive banking, which provides personalized insights and guidance to mobile deposit customers. A year ago we introduced automatic zero balance alerts and we now send over 20 million low and zero balance alerts a month. In November last year, we introduced Overdraft Rewind, which has helped over 800,000 customers avoid overdraft charges. We also offer our customers a variety of ways to waive the standard monthly service fees on checking accounts based on account usage or direct deposit, and as a result approximately 90% of our checking account customers do not pay a monthly fee.","These actions are designed to help our customers succeed financially and to build long-term relationships, and we have made changes to compensation and processes in our branches which are also improving customer service, and in the first quarter customer loyalty survey scores reached their highest levels since August of 2016.","Team member engagement is our second goal and I believe we have the best team in the industry. In March we increased the minimum hourly pay rate for U.S.-based team members to $15 an hour and approximately 36,000 team members received an increase. We also reviewed pay for team members whose salaries were slightly above the new minimum wage and this month we are increasing base pay for approximately 50,000 additional team members. In March, we granted an award of restricted stock rights to about 250,000 team members, including 50 shares of stock for full-time eligible team members and 30 shares for part-time team members. In the first quarter, our team member turnover continues to be about 15% below fourth quarter of 2016 levels.","Our next goal is being a leader in innovation. In the first quarter we rolled out our digital mortgage application which combines the power of Wells Fargo's data with a You Know Me customer experience. In many cases homebuyers are now able to receive preapproved loan decisions immediately, either online or through their mobile device. In March, 10% of completed retail applications were through our digital mortgage application.","We also started a team member pilot of our Control Tower feature designed to provide customers a comprehensive view of the places their Wells Fargo card or account information is connected. January, we were named one of only 12 companies in Apple's Business Chat pilot, which is a new way to connect with our customers and accelerates our customer service transformation towards messaging. Our industry-leading technology was recently recognized by Dynatrace, which named Wells Fargo's mobile app #1 in overall performance, functionality and quality, and availability.","As part of our goal of setting the global standard in managing all forms of risk, over the past 19 months we've taken significant actions to strengthen the way we manage operational and compliance risk at Wells Fargo. In March, [indiscernible] new risk management organizational design, which is an important step to ensuring that risk management functions operate independently and provide improved and effective oversight of our businesses. In addition, per the Consent Order, earlier this month we submitted governance and oversight, and compliance and operational risk management program plans to the Federal Reserve.","Our goal of making positive contributions to the communities we serve was recognized in the first quarter by United Way Worldwide, who named our workplace giving program #1 in the United States for the ninth consecutive year. We also increased our charitable contributions in the first quarter as part of our goal to increase donations to non-profit and community organizations by approximately 40% in 2018.","As part of our goal of delivering long-term shareholder value, we have been making progress on streamlining and centralizing [indiscernible] and our organizational structures. In our auto business, we completed the centralization of collections and funding from 57 regional business centers into three regional centers during the first quarter, which helps us to further standardize processes in that business. Our auto relationship team remains in the individual markets, keeping us close to our customers.","We are also closely looking at how our customers are using our channels. Branches continue to play an important part in serving our customers and we will have as many branches for our customers to use for as long as they want to use them. However, our customers are increasingly using our digital channels and digital sessions and they increased 13% from a year ago, while teller and ATM transactions declined 4%.","We closed 58 branches in the first quarter and we are on track to close approximately 300 branches this year, which is an increase [indiscernible] 250 branches we announced at our last Investor Day. As we highlighted last quarter, we currently expect our total branch network to decline to approximately 5,000 by the end of 2020.","I'm confident that we are on the right path with the transformational changes we are making and with our progress against our six goals. We have more work to do and it will take time to put all of our challenges behind us, but the result will be a better Wells Fargo for all of our stakeholders.","John will now discuss our financial results in more detail.","John R. Shrewsberry","Thanks, Tim, and good morning everyone. We highlight the noteworthy items that impacted our preliminary results on Slide 2. Our revenue included a $643 million gain from sales of Pick-a-Pay PCI mortgage loans; $250 million in mark-to-market unrealized equity gains due to the new financial instruments accounting standard, which I'll discuss a little later on the call; a $202 million gain on the sale of Wells Fargo Shareowner Services; and $176 million reduction from a LOCOM adjustment relating to $1.9 billion of loans transferred to held-for-sale.","Our expenses included $781 million [indiscernible] seasonally higher personnel expense, and $668 million of operating losses, largely litigation accruals. Our results also included a $550 million reserve release, driven by a significantly improved outlook on hurricane related losses. And our effective income tax rate in the first quarter was 18.8%.","On Page 3 we provide an update on the Consent Order. Tim mentioned, we submitted governance and oversight, and compliance and operational risk management program plans to the Federal Reserve. We take the Consent Order seriously and we'll work to fully satisfy all of the Consent Order's requirements. We are focused on compliance with the Consent Order's asset cap and maintaining liquidity and other financial risk management targets, while minimizing the impact to our customers, minimizing adverse long-term strategic effects, and maintaining our financial risk discipline.","With nearly $2 trillion in total assets, we believe we can meet our customers' financial needs and continue to deliver strong results without growing our balance sheet in the near term. As a reminder, prior to the Consent Order, we were already focused on reducing our exposure to riskier assets including certain legacy consumer real estate loans and near-prime and sub-prime auto loans. We have also maintained our credit risk discipline for new originations in commercial real estate during a period of high liquidity and increased competition, resulting in four consecutive quarters of lower balances.","Our balance sheet declined $36.4 billion from year-end, primarily due to a $32 billion decline in commercial deposits from financial institutions, including approximately $15 billion of actions taken to comply with the Consent Order asset cap. The earnings impact of managing within the asset cap was modest in the first quarter due to the minimal actions we needed to take. We'd expect the earnings impact to increase in subsequent quarters but we continue to estimate that the net income after tax impact will be $300 million to $400 million for the full year of 2018.","I'm going to highlight much of what's on Page 4 later on the call, so let me just point out that the decline in deposits drove the $20 billion reduction in cash and short-term investments in the first quarter, and the decline in stockholders' equity was driven by a $2.8 billion decline in [OCI] [ph], resulting primarily from higher rates.","I will be highlighting our income statement drivers on Page 5 throughout the call, so let me just mention that we adopted new accounting standards in the first quarter, which we summarized on Page 17 and 18 of the earnings release. I'll summarize here the two most significant impacts.","With the adoption of the new recognition and measurement of financial instruments standard, all equities, including those previously classified as AFS, are now required to be mark-to-market to earnings each quarter, and as a result in the first quarter we recognized $250 million of unrealized gains on equity securities. This accounting standard will increase volatility and while the impact this quarter was positive, in future quarters the impact could be negative or positive.","The second one is the adoption of a new revenue recognition standard, which didn't significantly impact our bottom line results but it does change where some of the revenue and expense items are reported. The most meaningful change for us is card fees. In the first quarter, card fees were reduced by $43 million due to card payment network charges which were previously reported in outside data processing expense now being netted against related interchange and network fees.","Turning to loans on Page 6, average loans declined $798 million from the fourth quarter, with commercial loan growth of $1.8 billion more than offset by a $2.6 billion decline in consumer loans. The decline in loan balances were not related to any actions we took in connection with the Consent Order but was driven by opportunistic or strategic loan sales, seasonality, and continued declines in certain portfolios that we've been reducing for some time including auto, Pick-a-Pay mortgage, and junior lien mortgage loans. I'll summarize the specific drivers of period-end loan declines starting on Page 7, but let me first point out that the average loan yields increased to 4.5% in the first quarter, the highest yield since the fourth quarter of 2012.","Commercial loans were relatively flat compared with fourth quarter, with C&I loans up $1.6 billion offset by continued declines in commercial real estate due to continued credit discipline in a competitive highly liquid financing market as well as ongoing paydowns on existing and acquired loans.","Consumer loans declined $9.5 billion [indiscernible] fourth quarter. The first mortgage loans were down $1.4 billion, driven by sales of $1.6 billion of Pick-a-Pay PCI loans. The sales were consistent with our ongoing evaluation of non-strategic portfolios and were similar to the decision to sell part of the Pick-a-Pay portfolio in the second quarter of last year. We continue to have growth in high-quality non-conforming loans, which were up $3.2 billion from the fourth quarter. Junior lien mortgage loans continue to decline as paydowns more than offset new originations.","Credit card loans declined $1.9 billion from the fourth quarter from seasonality, consistent with the decline we had in the first quarter of 2017. Balances increased $1.4 billion from the first quarter of 2017 due to higher purchase volume, and 11% growth in new accounts reflecting higher bonus offers, and a 55% increase in digital channel acquisitions. 43% of new credit card accounts in the first quarter were originated through digital channels. Our new credit cards have higher balances, 31% higher than a year ago. We expect credit card balances to grow as we continue to focus on digital channels and customer engagement.","Auto loans were down $3.8 billion from the fourth quarter and included the transfer of $1.6 billion of loans to held-for-sale as a result of the pending sale of certain assets of Reliable Financial Services, a Puerto Rican subsidiary of our auto business. This sale is expected to close in the second quarter.","After declining for five consecutive quarters, auto originations have stabilized the last two quarters. With the completion of the centralization of our collection and funding activities, which Tim highlighted earlier, we're now positioned to start to increase originations over time and currently expect the portfolio of balances to begin growing in early 2019.","Average deposits declined $14.4 billion from the fourth quarter, driven by lower commercial deposits. Average consumer and small business banking deposits declined $2.1 billion as higher community bank deposits were more than offset by lower deposits in Wealth and Investment Management, reflecting movement into other investments.","Our average deposit cost increased 6 basis points from the fourth quarter and was up 17 basis points from a year ago, versus the 75 basis point change in the Fed fund's rate. The increase in our average deposit cost was driven by increases in commercial and Wealth and Investment Management deposit rates, while rates paid on consumer and small business banking deposits have remained stable.","Since the increase in interest rates began at the end of 2015, [indiscernible] price-sensitive commercial deposits have been relatively consistent with the prior interest rate cycles, and we expect this trend to continue. It's important to note that our commercial deposits include a high percentage from financial institutions which drive our deposit betas higher as most of these deposits have betas of almost 100%. The response rate in Wealth and Investment Management has increased over the past couple of quarters but is still somewhat below historical trends, although we expect it to increase over time.","While other consumer [indiscernible] banking deposit pricing has not yet responded to rate movements, we expect deposit betas in that category will start to increase. However, the timing of the increase is difficult to predict.","Net interest income in the first quarter declined $75 million from the fourth quarter. The drivers of this reduction included an approximately $160 million decline from two fewer days in the quarter, $148 million from hedge ineffectiveness accounting, and $144 million in lower swap-related income related to the receive-fixed loan swap position that we finished unwinding early in the first quarter. These declines were partially offset by the net repricing benefit of higher interest rates.","Our NIM was stable at 2.84% as the impact of hedge ineffectiveness accounting and lower swap income was offset by the repricing benefit of higher rates. I also wanted to update that impacts from the tax act reduced our NIM by 4 basis points in both the fourth quarter from a one-time adjustment related to leverage leases and in the first quarter primarily from a decline in tax equivalent yield on municipal bonds. We expect the reduction in tax equivalent yield that we recorded this quarter to remain at approximately the same level throughout the rest of the year, and while it should not impact linked quarter trends, it will reduce year-over-year trends by approximately 4 basis points.","We highlighted on the call last quarter that we had started to unwind our receive-fixed commercial loan swaps, which provided a hedge against lower rates, and we completed that unwind in the first quarter. The cost of unwinding the swaps, which was approximately $1 billion, will be amortized through C&I interest income over the remaining life of the original contracts, which is approximately three years on average.","It's important to note that during the extended period of low interest rates since the swaps are entered into, they generated incremental net income of approximately $3 billion. While the elimination of these swaps will reduce interest income in 2018, it has increased our asset sensitivity to be slightly above the middle of our previously provided guidance of 5 to 15 basis points for a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve and is expected to improve interest income in future periods as interest rates increase.","From an interest rate risk management standpoint, we are fairly well-balanced and we will generally perform better in both higher and steeper interest rate environments. We have much larger repricing exposure for both assets and liabilities at the front-end of the curve and our earnings simulations are particularly dependent on deposit rate betas given the scale of that funding source.","While we have significantly less assets and liabilities with repricing exposure at the long end of the curve, our net asset sensitivity to long-term rates is a meaningful part of our overall asset sensitivity profile. This sensitivity reflects both the reinvestment and premium amortization that occurs in our long-term debt securities and loan portfolios.","Noninterest income declined $41 million from the fourth quarter. While the dollar decline was minimal, I want to spend some time describing the different drivers. Starting with deposit service charges, the $73 million decline from fourth quarter was driven largely by the impact of customer-friendly initiatives, including the first full quarter impact of Overdraft Rewind. Card fees declined $88 million from the fourth quarter. The new revenue recognition standard reduced these fees by $43 million. The rest of the decline was driven by seasonality.","Mortgage banking results were in line with the fourth quarter. Servicing income increased $206 million, driven by higher net MSR valuation gains, lower unreimbursed servicing costs, and lower payoffs. Residential mortgage origination revenue declined $200 million from the seasonal declines in originations with volumes down $10 billion from the fourth quarter. We expect originations to increase in the second quarter, reflecting seasonality in the purchase market.","The production margin in the first quarter was 94 basis points, down from 125 basis points in the fourth quarter. Approximately two-thirds of the margin decline was driven by market competition and the remaining one-third was driven by a higher percentage of corresponding originations in the first quarter which is significantly lower margins but also lower cost. Given current market pricing trends, we would expect our production margin to continue to decline into the second quarter. The $109 million decline in insurance fees was due to the sale of Wells Fargo Insurance Services in November.","Finally, other income was up $44 million. The first quarter included a total of $845 million of gains from the sale of Pick-a-Pay PCI loan portfolios and Wells Fargo Shareowner Services and the fourth quarter included an $848 million gain on the sale of Wells Fargo Insurance Services.","Turning to expenses on Page 12, expenses declined $2.6 billion from the fourth quarter, largely driven by $2.9 billion of lower operating losses. On Page 13 I'll explain the drivers in more detail.","The $594 million increase from the fourth quarter in compensation and benefits expense reflected $781 million of seasonally higher personnel expenses, in line with the seasonal increase last year. The seasonally higher personnel expenses will decline in the second quarter but salary expense is expected to grow reflecting increases which became effective late in the first quarter.","Revenue related expenses declined $233 million from lower commissions and incentive compensation, primarily in Wholesale Banking and home lending. Third-party services were down $213 million, primarily from lower project-related spend which is typically higher in the fourth quarter and from lower legal expenses. The $2.6 billion decline in running the business non-discretionary [indiscernible] category reflected lower operating losses.","On Page 14 we show the drivers of the $450 million year to year increase in expenses. Compensation and benefits expense increased $143 million, primarily due to salary increases and higher employee benefits expense, partially offset by the sale of Wells Fargo Insurance Services [indiscernible] reductions in Wholesale Banking. Our total FTE were down 3% from a year ago and also reflected lower FTE in Community Banking and consumer lending. The increase in expenses was also driven by a $386 million increase in higher operating losses from an increase in litigation accruals.","On Page 15 we highlight the expected full-year 2018 total expense range, which has not changed since we provided it last quarter. The range of $53.5 billion to $54.5 billion includes approximately $600 million of typical operating losses and excludes any outsized litigation and remediation accruals and penalties. We will provide a dollar range for 2019 expenses at our Investor Day in May.","Last quarter on our earnings call, we said that we expected to achieve a quarterly efficiency ratio with a 59 handle by the end of 2018. However, that expectation was prior to the issuance of the Consent Order. The expected decline in revenue from the balance sheet actions needed to comply with the Consent Order's asset cap will likely result in our efficiency ratio remaining above 59% throughout this year. However, we are still on track to achieve our targeted $4 billion of expense reductions by the end of 2019.","As a reminder, this does not include the completion of core deposit intangible amortization expense at the end of this year, which will amount to $769 million in 2018. It also doesn't include the completion of the FDIC special assessment, which we expect should happen by the end of this year. Finally, it doesn't include expense savings due to business divestitures, which we highlight on Page [indiscernible]. We provided a similar page last quarter, which we have updated to include the sale of Wells Fargo Shareowner Services in the first quarter.","Turning to our segments, starting on Page 17, Community Banking earned $2.7 billion in the first quarter. The majority of the benefit from the tax act was included in Community Banking results in the fourth quarter, which was the primary reason for the linked quarter decline in earnings.","On Page 18 we provided our Community Banking metrics. The primary consumer checking customer annual attrition rate was at the lowest level in five years and we've now had modest year-over-year growth in primary consumer checking customers for two consecutive quarters.","On Page 19 we highlight strong growth in credit and debit card purchase volume, both up 8% from a year ago. As Tim highlighted, customer loyalty survey scores reached their highest levels since August of 2016 and overall satisfaction with most recent survey visit \u2013 overall satisfaction with the most recent visit survey scores continue to improve. Our team members have made great progress by focusing on customer service and providing exceptional service remains a priority. We know that exceptional customer service leads to positive outcome, so we continue to reinforce that within our branches.","Turning to Page 20, Wholesale Banking earned $2.9 billion in the first quarter. Lower taxes drove both linked-quarter and year-over-year increases in net income. Wealth and Investment Management earned $714 million in the first quarter, and similar to Wholesale Banking, the lower tax rate drove the growth in [net income] [ph].","Turning to Page 22, our credit performance remained strong in the first quarter and our loss rate was 32 basis points of average loans. For the second consecutive quarter, all of our commercial and consumer real estate loan portfolios were in a net recovery position, including our residential and junior lien portfolio. Nonperforming assets have declined for eight consecutive quarters and were less than 1% of total loans for the third consecutive quarter.","As I highlighted earlier, we had $550 million of reserve release in the first quarter with approximately $400 million driven by a significant improvement in our outlook for 2017 hurricane related losses. As you may recall, in the third quarter of last year we increased reserve coverage by $450 million for potential hurricane related losses based on an initial review of our portfolio. The release this quarter also reflected continued improvement in residential real estate and lower loan balances.","Turning to Page 23, our estimated Common Equity Tier 1 ratio fully phased-in remained flat at 12%, still well above our target of 10%. Capital generation from earnings was more than offset by approximately 20 basis points of higher unrealized losses in OCI from higher interest rates and approximately 35 basis points of capital return to common shareholders. Risk-weighted assets were modestly lower than fourth quarter.","Given we are well above our internal target, we remain focused on returning more capital to shareholders and returned a record $4 billion through common stock dividends and net share repurchases in the first quarter, up 30% from a year ago. As a reminder, our share issuance in the first quarter is typically higher, reflecting annual issuances for benefit plans. Period-end common shares outstanding declined by 123 million shares or 2% from a year ago.","In summary, our preliminary results in the first quarter continued to reflect strong asset quality, liquidity and capital, and we remain on track to achieve our target of $4 billion in expense saves by the end of 2019. While we continue to have some near-term challenges, we look forward to sharing more information regarding our financial outlook and the transformational changes we are making throughout Wells Fargo at Investor Day next month.","And we'll now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ken Usdin","I wanted to ask you guys to talk a little bit more about the outlook for net interest income, and specifically, there are a lot of moving parts here with the asset cap impact, you mentioned it's supposed to increase from here, but then there is the benefits to come from the swap roll-off over time and the NII sensitivity improving, so can you help us just understand like do you have an expectation you can grow NII and what will drive that, will it be rate more than volume at this point?","John R. Shrewsberry","I'd say you mentioned the big drivers. The swap roll-off probably will be a net negative in 2018 because we are stepping down from the higher fixed rate to what currently is a lower floating rate. The expectation is that that floating rate moves up through where we were previously capped up on receiving fixed. So that's probably more of a 2019 benefit than a 2018 benefit.","With respect to \u2013 the biggest driver obviously will be the growth in loans and deposits. And related to that, what happens with deposit pricing, particularly among retail and small business deposits, will be a big driver. We, the industry, have been outperforming previous expectations in this early part of the normalization of short term rates and to the extent that there is a meaningful catch-up, which I think people think is a fair expectation, that will actually probably be a negative adjustment while we go through that until we figure out what the stable beta is for those types of deposits. So, I would say those are probably the big drivers.","At the longer end of the curve, we are continually reinvesting what's coming through in amortization and prepayments from a mortgage securities portfolio, and if long rates remain in the call it sub 2.80 range, then that won't be much of a driver. If they move up appreciably as the short end comes up, then there's an opportunity to earn more there as well.","One important point that I'd make that I don't think is really well appreciated is that a lot of what's been happening on the asset side of our books as we've run down some higher yielding assets on purpose is that there's an increase in overall credit quality that's coming with a lower spread component. So even though I mentioned that our loan portfolio has the highest coupon with the highest rate that it's had since 2012, that's happening at the same time that the credit quality profile is improving. So, it's not quite apples to apples when we're thinking about one year's assets versus the next.","Timothy J. Sloan","Ken, I would just reinforce a couple of themes that John mentioned. The asset cap really isn't impacting our ability to grow loans. I mean our folks are out there facing off with our customers every day across the entire platform. And so, I don't think we are going to have an impact from the asset cap on loan growth. Where you see an impact from the asset cap on deposits is primarily what you're seeing in the first quarter, at least for 2018, is related to some of the deposit relationships that we have in the financial institutions group, corporate and the like. Those tend to be higher cost deposits, and as we've talked about, generally have higher betas.","Ken Usdin","Yes, good point. And my follow-up would just be then on the asset cap related stuff to that point, Tim, John, how would that traject from here? Like you said, you only got a little bit of that impact. Does it get to a run rate quickly just from the actions that you have already taken or is it just going to kind of be a bleed-in as we go along?","John R. Shrewsberry","It depends on the organic rate of growth in underlying customer deposits and loans because the faster they grow, the more headroom we would create by taking up some of these [fake] [ph] deposits, as Tim described. And so, I guess if I were modelling it, I would bleed it in, but we still think 300 to 400 of [indiscernible] is the right number and it was negligible in the first quarter because of just the seasonal roll-down in the size of the balance sheet, and so it's more of the second half of the year realization.","Ken Usdin","Okay, understood. Thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","John McDonald","Just wanted to [indiscernible] what you can and can't do in terms of the \u2013 I know you can't say too much about the pending legal matter, but did the 1Q results include any provisioning for an eventual settlement with CFPB and OCC, are you able to put something in there, and you are saying that you might have to refine it from here?","Timothy J. Sloan","John, it's a really fair question, and given the status of our discussions, all we can really say is what we said in the earnings release and then what I said in my prepared remarks. So, I again appreciate the question but that's as far as we would be able to go today.","John McDonald","Okay. So just another somewhat related for you, Tim, with a lot of negative headlines in recent months, could you discuss how the team members and customers are dealing with the challenges here, specifically kind of how your employee and customer attrition, how has that been going in wealth management and the commercial businesses? We hear a lot of things outside the Company. What are you seeing in terms of reaction to headlines and all the challenges you have?","Timothy J. Sloan","John, it's a really good question, and as you and I have talked about and we've talked about on these calls, it's truly been \u2013 when we think about rebuilding trust, first and foremost our most important asset in this Company is our people. And so we have made fundamental changes in how folks are compensated, making sure that more of our team members, now all of them, have the ability to be Wells Fargo shareholders, which I think is an important connection between what we do for our customers every day and what we are doing for our shareholders.","We have made changes in how folks are \u2013 our incentive plans work, we've made changes in leadership and business practices, and the result has been a continued improvement in attrition or turnover. As I mentioned, it's about 30% better than it was in the fourth quarter of 2016.","I've heard the same anecdotal stories that you have about folks from some of our businesses leaving in mass. I don't know what company they are talking about because it is just not happening. Not only is team member turnover down across all of our businesses, but in particular we are able to attract really high quality folks in entry-level positions but at senior leadership positions in the Company.","In particular when we look at the Wells Fargo Advisors, as you mentioned, just because I hear about that just a little bit, the FA population that could be leaving to go to other competitors, that's down 24% year-over-year and in fact our experienced FA recruiting is up year-over-year and the productivity from our existing FA is up about 7% year-over-year.","So again, I hear the same anecdotal comments all the time but it's not impacting our business to serve \u2013 our ability to serve our customers and we just don't see it in the numbers.","John R. Shrewsberry","The other part of your question is around customer activity and I would say where we either see it, hear about it, talk about it from customers themselves or from team members is around our most publicly exposed types of customer groups. So the many types of business, there's more competition and more to talk about. We competed against other firms when they were going through perhaps analogous reputational cycles, and now others are working their hardest to do the same with us, and we have to control a bit harder.","John McDonald","Okay. And one more follow-up on the regulatory side, you are doing the work to satisfy the Fed's Consent Order, is there any opportunity to be interactive with the regulator, can you get a sense along the way whether you are doing the things they want you to be doing, or do you have to kind of wait till the end to find out whether you are kind of on track with what their expectations are and yours are aligned?","Timothy J. Sloan","John, it's a good question. I would say that we have a very active engagement model with all of our regulators. I think that's very important. And so, specifically if you're referring to the Consent Order with the Fed, we handed in our two plans. As they ask us to do [indiscernible] we would do. And we are having a lot of discussion about those plans, which is really good. It's good to be interactive because we both have the same goals. We want to improve compliance and we want to improve operational risk at the Company. So it's not a situation where we hand a new work and then you wait patiently at your desk for somebody to come back with the results.","And here is another example of bringing on high-quality leaders. Sarah Dahlgren, who had been in charge of supervision at the New York Fed, joined us this quarter and she is responsible for our engagement with our regulators and is doing a terrific job.","John McDonald","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Erika Najarian","Just wanted to follow up on Ken's question on your net interest income outlook, so as I think about, John, what you mentioned about the 59% efficiency ratio by year-end 2018 being pushed to 2019, does that mean that net interest income will not grow for the rest of the year?","John R. Shrewsberry","It depends on the drivers that I mentioned. When we had previously been asked the question and responded to, could we see a 59 handle in 2018, it was before that last $300 million or $400 million worth of net interest income that we would attribute to actions that we expect that we would have to take to comply with the asset cap. And absent that $300 million to $400 million, that's a [indiscernible] number, not a revenue number, but it's interest income, it's easy to do the math. That would be the driver.","So, as I said to Ken, a variety of things could happen in loan growth, deposit growth, deposit pricing, shape of the curve, Fed moves, et cetera, they are all going to have an impact on where net interest income is. But based on the forecast that we have been operating with, that $300 million to $400 million was a difference maker between a calculated estimate of an efficiency ratio with a 59 handle at the end of the year versus one that's above that.","Erika Najarian","Okay. My follow up question is, in terms of \u2013 I heard you loud and clear in terms of your commitment to return more capital to shareholders, and the question I get a lot from your shareholders is, with the overhang of the outstanding signs, does that at all impact how you are thinking about your near-term buyback plans or dividends?","Timothy J. Sloan","No, it doesn't, no. And I'm glad you're hearing the same things that we are, which is good. I mean, Erika, our plans, and John and I have reiterated this on a number of occasions over the last few months, is that we have an excess amount of capital to run and grow Wells Fargo and our plan is to reduce that excess over the next two to three years, and that's where we're going.","John R. Shrewsberry","Yes, and the magnitude of the operating losses that we recently have been experiencing, while it's very different than what we had been experiencing previously, is provided for even in a base case capital plan because of industry results over the year. So, while we would rather not be experiencing it, it's not outsized.","Erika Najarian","And just to follow up on all this, and clearly this also comes into your conversations with your shareholders, but can you give us a little bit more insight on and as much as you can on the qualitative process? So clearly there has been some debate about whether or not your Consent Order will impact a non-objection or objection on a qualitative basis and I'm wondering if the qualitative process is really as broad as the market fears it is, or is the qualitative process really more grading Wells Fargo's process and grading your data? Any insight here would be helpful.","Timothy J. Sloan","The qualitative process is far-reaching. It always has been. Everybody gets a little bit of feedback every year on how they can be better. We are no different and every year we strive to be better in the following year, and this year is no different. So, it's a horizontal process, there is every measure of the inputs into a capital plan that is subject to review, consideration, comparison, and grading, and that's the basis on which we have always been compared and we expect to be compared this year. And the question, explicit or implicit, as to what that means this year given other things that are going on is one that makes us work that much harder to make sure that we have submitted a very sound plan based on a very sound process, and that's where we think we are.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","John Pancari","I want to just ask a couple of things on the expense side. For 2019, are you still confident that you could see a decline in overall operating expenses in 2019 versus 2018? And then also on the efficiency ratio side, do you expect that you could see a decline in the efficiency ratio over the full-year 2019 versus 2018?","John R. Shrewsberry","Yes.","Timothy J. Sloan","Double yes. And John, again, we'll provide a hard dollar number or a range like we did for this year at Investor Day, but assume that that's what you're going to hear.","John R. Shrewsberry","That's a great question. Do you have any more like that?","John Pancari","No, it was kind of [indiscernible]. But I guess what I'm getting at is the 55% to 59% range that you had provided previously and before some of these issues, how long do you think it takes you to get towards that midpoint again, barring new issues on the regulatory front coming up?","John R. Shrewsberry","To get to the midpoint is a little bit more complicated. I mean, we'll set out our target at Investor Day for the next couple of years. Unambiguously, that's the direction that we are heading. What we're doing on dollars of expense front, which we have been explicit about for this year, we'll be explicit about for next year and we'll talk about all of the drivers that are in place to cause that happen. And then separately, there is what's happening with revenue, which is going to reflect all the things that we just talked about in terms of net interest income and then a range of drivers in noninterest income, more of which we'll talk about in Investor Day.","But I sort of think about it as a distribution of potential outcomes based on what's happening with rates and interest income drivers, what's happening in all of our various businesses around noninterest income, and then what we're doing about total expense to deliver it. So, we'll try and be as transparent and helpful as we can at Investor Day, but overall, this notion of getting back to where we have historically operated or at some point through that given all the possibilities for automation, et cetera, that exist today that weren't as available a few years ago, that's our goal.","Timothy J. Sloan","And let me just re-emphasize a point that John just made, and that's getting through that range. Our goal here is not to achieve the $4 billion in run rate savings that you will see in 2020 and then stop. Our goal is to have Wells Fargo be the most [efficient] [ph] company that we can be and I think that \u2013 I don't think, I know that means continuing investments but also continuing to improve the efficiency of the Company to get through that range over the next few years.","John Pancari","Got it. Okay, thanks Tim. And then on the capital side, regarding this TLAC proposal from the Fed, it looks like it creates I guess ballpark $25 billion to $30 billion in additional debt that can ultimately roll off, which could be a nice positive for you. So, could you just give us your thoughts on that and how you look at that?","John R. Shrewsberry","I don't know that I would sign up for $25 billion-plus that could roll off. I mean we have got excess TLAC today just based on what's happened to our RWA and we will continue to optimize our debt stack to meet the minimum requirement, at least the minimum requirement, based on where we are and where we are going with RWA. But I didn't process a big step change positive into that. We were just probably even more focused on the stress capital buffer feedback this week and what that means for the right side of our balance sheet as it relates to proposed rulemakings.","John Pancari","Okay, all right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matt O'Connor","Where do you guys stand in terms of derisking the loan book and some of the business pruning that you have done? You talked about auto growing next year and that you are largely done there. But just in aggregate, are you kind of through the process of reviewing the businesses on loan portfolios for [indiscernible]?","Timothy J. Sloan","Matt, good question. In terms of the loan portfolio, I don't think there is any other significant derisking that we need to do. The auto portfolio continues to decline not because there is really derisking going on, it's just we just have more transformation that is going on in the business and we think that loan portfolio or that business will probably start growing again. First part of next year seems reasonable based upon what we are seeing. In fact we saw other than the reclassification of the Reliable portfolio, we saw a slight improvement in the decline.","But across the rest of the portfolio, I think you will continue to see a runoff of the legacy home equity book, which is performing quite well but it's pre-2009 type originations. But I wouldn't describe that as kind of running off riskier parts of that business. That's just a normal amortization.","And similarly, in the legacy mortgage book, the Pick-a-Pay portfolio, the sale that we did this quarter, I wouldn't describe it as a derisking sale, I would describe it more as an [indiscernible] sale because of the dearth of those types of assets in the market and there was a really attractive bid for it and so we moved on.","As it relates to the other businesses, and John may want to chime in too, but as it relates to other businesses, we are continuing to look through the entire Company to make sure that all the businesses that we've got are performing as well as they can. And if it means over time that we need to look at other businesses like insurance or Shareowner Service that could be worth more to others than they are worth to our shareholders, we'll go ahead and move forward. But I think that's going to be more of a continuing process that will take place over the next few years as opposed to one we complete by June or July or the end of the year.","Matt O'Connor","Okay, it's helpful. And then just separately, your stock price continues to be under pressure and obviously some of it is going to be the Consent Order and the regulatory concern, some of it is fundamental. Just from your perspective, like is there kind of an increase in urgency in terms of whether it's trying to get more cost saves sooner or plus a little bit more on the revenue side, plus a little bit more on the buybacks? And again, I realize like market movements, they are hard to control and influence, and some of the stuff you can't control like on the regulatory side, but at the same time it has a lot of our attention, I'm sure it has your attention, and I'm just wondering if there's a little bit more that you can do a little bit faster?","Timothy J. Sloan","A fair question. I mean we are clearly focused on return to our shareholders and current stock price is one measure of that. One way to think about our focus is that our focus is on the long term. As you point out, it's not on the day to day movement of the price. But clearly we have work to do. We have been very clear about the fact that we have work to do.","I don't know and I don't believe we can increase the sense of urgency at the Company. Folks have been sprinting now for about last year and a half and we are going to continue to sprint for probably the next 10 years. So, I don't know if we could move a whole lot faster. But Matt, we certainly appreciate the sense of urgency, and not only from our shareholders but all of our stake holders, which is why we are transforming the Company.","John R. Shrewsberry","I'd like to point out that we are already focused on continuing to deliver the type of returns on the equity that we have. By doing that, we created the powder to return capital to shareholders. We are doing that through stock buybacks. We are doing that now in a low 50s context. So, if we continue to deliver ROEs north of 12%, ROTCEs in the close to 15% range, eventually the market is going to catch up with that.","Matt O'Connor","Yes, I would agree on that last point. And if I could just squeeze in, I would suggest it seems like this year could be more of a transition year, maybe even into bleeding into next year as you deal with all these issues. And I just wonder, as you provide expense guidance for next year, there still could be some lumpiness I would think in the cost, you're not going to have all the cost saves. So, I realize 2020 is far out, but giving us a little visibility into what the cost might look like on a clean basis with the capital when you bleed it down might be helpful as well.","Timothy J. Sloan","Matt, do you think if we gave you an indication of 2020, you'd want 2021?","Matt O'Connor","No, but I think it seems like the legacy related costs could be elevated this year, the Consent Order is going to be a drag to earnings into next year. So, my guess is, next year on a full-year basis won't be 100% clean and we'll all be wondering how much cost will further abate as these issues are resolved. So, I'm not trying to be [indiscernible] lookout for five years, but\u2026","Timothy J. Sloan","No, Matt, I was just giving you a hard time. Listen, I absolutely appreciate your question. What you want to see from us, what our shareholders want to see from us, is better efficiency and better expense discipline. It's harder to see that this year because of the pace of the investments we are making with the [indiscernible] dollars that we are saving this year. I think it will be more apparent next year and it will be even more apparent in 2020 and 2021 and so on. But I understand your point, and candidly, it was your advice among others that led us to conclude that we needed to be more specific about this [indiscernible]. We listen to you.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. Thank you for the time.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.","Timothy J. Sloan","Marty, you did a good job on CNBC this morning. I was watching you.","Marty Mosby","Thanks, appreciate it. We had [Phil] [ph] appear, so got to do it twice. But wanted to know as you look at net interest margin, you've had a hard time getting the actual margin to start improving. This quarter we actually saw a nice pop in [indiscernible] plus no loss, a little bit [indiscernible] impact also a little bit and they count, but is this the first time that we're going to see those asset yields move up enough to offset and even pace faster than deposit rates and maybe start to see margin expansion from here?","John R. Shrewsberry","Surely hope so. It depends what else is happening. So this quarter is the first time that you have seen the residual hedge ineffectiveness accounting item go through margin. That used to be entirely through noninterest income until the adoption of the new standard. So, that was another one of the things that contributed to the margin not reflecting the benefit of the increase at the short end of curve, and that is a result mostly of a big move up in long rates during the quarter, which gave rise to that accounting outcome.","So, if we end up in a flatter long rate environment, so you don't have that noise running through. And as you say, they count for every quarter, then certainly it's a possibility. But the big driver again is what happens to deposit cost as Fed funds or LIBOR or other market rates move up and our assets are pricing up. We have done as an industry or at least as a company done a good job at maintaining lower cost deposits while those other items, those other benchmarks have moved up. And if that continues to be true, then you should see that.","Marty Mosby","What was the basis point impact of that ineffectiveness?","John R. Shrewsberry","It was $48 million. I'll do the math for you and we'll send you a note in terms of basis points.","Marty Mosby","That's fine, I can do it from there. That's perfect. I can calculate that. And then, Tim, I wanted to ask you, as you are doing all these transformations and you are moving to what's going to be the new Wells Fargo, what is the kind of overriding change? I mean, is it the change of getting out of maybe some riskier businesses that you are going to actually be now kind of looking at minimizing and now having much more just the core relationships? How would you kind of bring that so we can kind of [indiscernible] into this transformation, what you eventually want to see Wells Fargo look like once you come out of it?","Timothy J. Sloan","Marty, I would really center yourself on our six goals. We have been very clear in each one of those six goals that we want to be the leader in the financial services industry and we have got work to do in all of them. But that's where I would focus. What the Company looks like as we achieve those goals is really going to be a function of who our customers are, what they want, and what the competition looks like. But I would really focus on those six goals.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Betsy Graseck","I just had a couple of questions on the reserve release. I know you mentioned earlier that a lot of that was driven by the improvement in the [indiscernible] for hurricane related losses. Just wanted to see if that cleans that issue up or is there still more reserve release that could happen based on loan performance from the hurricane side? And then I had a follow up.","John R. Shrewsberry","So, on the hurricane side, just for everyone's benefit, at the end of the third quarter, right after the hurricanes impacted Texas and Louisiana and then Puerto Rico had hit, we granted 90 day payment holidays to our consumer customers in those geographies so they could focus on getting their live together and not worrying about making a payment on their loans and becoming or become [indiscernible]. So, there was a ton of uncertainty because we couldn't measure delinquency or default because we had this payment holiday.","That came and went and our customers got back on their schedule, their plans, and so now we have real performance and a real understanding of home loss, auto loss, insurance claims, current versus delinquent, et cetera, which gave rise to an understanding that the loss has been negligible as a result of the hurricanes, and that's why now is the right time to take down that portion of the reserve.","I think that that's probably the last time you will hear us say that a reserve release or build has anything to do with hurricanes. I think it's pretty much cleared up. It's much more driven now by the size of loan book, the quality of the loan book, and what might be happening in other loan categories. And of course the most consistent, other than energy over the last couple of years, which has kind of run its course, it really has been the improvement in real estate secured related portfolios. It's been sort of the big driver at the margin I think of improvement in loan quality and the related appropriate amount of allowance.","Betsy Graseck","Right. And then you mentioned that \u2013 did I hear you say correctly that all of your loan categories are in a net recovery position?","John R. Shrewsberry","All of our real estate secured loan categories. So, commercial real estate, consumer real estate including second lien consumer real estate, are all in that recovery right now.","Betsy Graseck","So does that drive more reserve release going forward?","John R. Shrewsberry","Yes, at the margin. I mean it probably \u2013 it looks more to the path of loan price appreciation as a driver. I mean that's going to run its course because we haven't had losses in consumer real estate in a long time. So I don't think that's a big driver but it has been the driver.","Betsy Graseck","Got it. And then just lastly, the outlook with, I know it's in a couple of years, but [indiscernible], and I know there's different folks that are running parallel starting this year on how reserve is likely to traject over [indiscernible] with implementation beginning in I know 2020, but next year CCAR, and I know it's a long way away from now, but next year CCAR includes [indiscernible]. So if you could just give us your sense as to how you're thinking about dealing with that?","John R. Shrewsberry","So, right now we are focused first and foremost on the modelling necessary to understand what [indiscernible] looks like in business as usual. And there will be an impact, like there will be for everybody, that the required allowance for the loan portfolio will be somewhat bigger than it is today. I don't think it's a boxcar change and there is still refinement to do.","There is a reasonable question in terms of what it means in stress and our own version of stress and what it means to CCAR, and we are hoping that we have a lot of productive dialog with the regulatory community before next year's CCAR to understand how they are going to be thinking about its pro cyclicality and other things as we roll into CCAR 2019. But right now, the gap, business as usual, adjustment is something that's becoming better understood. We'll begin to talk more about it with the passage of quarters as it's really, really understood and refined, and it's not going to make for a gigantic change.","Betsy Graseck","Right. And it's not impacting your decisioning today on reserve?","John R. Shrewsberry","No, not reserving. And importantly, we have begun to think about it in terms of our thoughts about loan structure, loan price, the credit availability, that type of reserving because it can influence how we feel about certain types of specifically longer-term loans, and those are discussions that we are having, but it hasn't driven a big change in our approach to either pricing or availability yet.","Betsy Graseck","Okay, all right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research. Please go ahead.","Nancy Bush","John, a question for you, just about the whole interest rate yield curve environment right now, because I'm trying to fit us all in with what you said about your sensitivity to long rates, et cetera, I mean how do you look at the flat yield curve, what do you do if it persists, can you just sort of address this whole weird rate environment that we seem to be in right now and the panic that seems to be building up around it?","John R. Shrewsberry","So, if the curve gets flatter from here because the short end comes up and the long end remains anchored, then we actually do better, we make more and more asset sensitive to front end of the curve and we'll make more money as a result of it. We would make even more money if it was a parallel shift in the long and move up also. And I guess one nuance to that is, businesses like mortgage will do better on the origin nation front if longer rates remain at about where they are today versus be in the move about 3%, there is some question about affordability in some markets and so originations come down. But the reinvestment activity that we have in our investment portfolio at higher rates is something that we would miss if long and doesn't move up from where it is today. But very specifically, if it stays put and the short end keeps coming up, we are still improving in terms of our earnings profile as a result of that.","Nancy Bush","Are you building or thinking anything? I mean there has been apparently a slight inversion at the short end of the curve that's sending everybody into panic and it seemed money market related issue. Can you just give us a little bit more understanding around that?","John R. Shrewsberry","Sure. So there is a lot more issuance going on at the front end, both by the government because they are issuing at the short end and they have got a lot to do because they are going to have even more financing as a result of depending on what happens with the tax related impact of tax reform, but therein as a big issuer you've got others in as big CP issuers and that's a result of money market reform. There are fewer takeouts for that to convert it into cash equivalents for retail and others. And so, investors at that point in the curve have a little bit more power. So, yields are up. Incidentally, that feels like the driver of a piece of the LIBOR-OIS disconnect that I think you are referring to. It's technical, it's supply driven from issuers in the short end.","Nancy Bush","Okay. But you are not concerned about the environment right now and don't see the flat yield curve as necessarily indicative of anything?","John R. Shrewsberry","No, I mean I think if we didn't have some of the trade-related and other political dynamics that can allow people to imagine that there could be economic problems as a result of that, it's probably the longer end of the curve would have adjusted up even more than where it is today. But that's speculative, but that's my take.","Nancy Bush","All right, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead.","Saul Martinez","First, I just wanted to clarify a point on your expense guidance rate, so the 53.5 to 54.5. That includes I guess $600 million of typical operating losses and this quarter you had $668 million. So, effectively any incremental operating losses from here when I [indiscernible] to your guidance, we should basically exclude that. I just want to make sure I'm understanding puts and takes around the guidance.","John R. Shrewsberry","That's right. Our sort of ambient run rate of operating losses for fraud and bank robberies and things like that is $150 million a quarter. And so, what we have in giving that guidance we have basically accounted for that. As you pointed out, we have achieved that in the first quarter as a result of litigation related costs.","Saul Martinez","Got it, okay. I guess a broader question, John, you mentioned your stock will take care of itself if you can continue to do 15% ROTCEs and 12% [indiscernible] 120 basis points ROAs, and I suspect we will hear more about this at your Investor Day, but this quarter also did have a lot of noise in it, maybe net-net been more positive than negative, but when we compare you to your peers, you are no longer sort of at the top of your peer group in number of performance metrics, and I guess the question is, how important is it to be in the top of your peer group and is it still something that is feasible and is it still something that is important or do you really need to get past your issues, all the issues that have risen that becomes a primary goal or should be a primary goal of the Company?","John R. Shrewsberry","Yes, it's one of the six primary goals in terms of shareholder value in particular, and we absolutely expect, especially among G-SIB peers because of the capital structure that we all have that we would be at the high end of the performance range. So the north of 12.375% ROE this quarter and 14.75% of ROTCE with a 64% of business [indiscernible] ratio, and like we are as clear as we can be that our expenses should be substantially lower, will drive us to appreciably higher returns. Also, we are carrying 200 basis points of capital above what we think is appropriate for a company with our risk profile. So, both of those things as rectified should return us to the very high end of the range and we think that's appropriate given the scope of our business, the risk profile of our business, the scale we have in the business that we are in, and those are crystal-clear goals.","Saul Martinez","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.","Gerard Cassidy","Tim, can you give us maybe some color? Clearly we know about the sales practices and the problems that you guys are wrestling with, with these issues. Subsequent to the discovery of your sales practice issues, you discovered some other issues in different lines of businesses. And if I recall, Wealth Management is now under some sort of investigation. Are you comfortable, are you confident enough to be able to say that you guys have looked in every corner, nook and cranny that you are now \u2013 there shouldn't be any more incremental discoveries of issues that may bring regulators to look harder or is that just [indiscernible]?","Timothy J. Sloan","We certainly had a thorough look in every nook and cranny in the Company and we are continuing on that process. And I think, Gerard, one of the lessons learnt for us candidly over the last few years is that we should have been doing a better job of that when we were performing quite well in the prior years, and we are not going to make that mistake again, so that we are going to continue to raise the bar on ourselves over time.","But in terms of declaring victory and walking ahead, we are not at that spot right now. I think we are going to know that when we [indiscernible] in 6 to 12 months after it happens. And we are making a lot of progress, but as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we have got some challenges that we are dealing with right now, including the reason that we described our results today as preliminary, and we take those issues very seriously.","But having said all that, we have made a tremendous amount of progress in terms of transforming the Company. And so, I think we are very far along in the journey, to answer your question specifically. But in terms of declaring victory and walking ahead, we are not quite there yet.","Gerard Cassidy","Okay, thank you. And I apologize if you addressed this, I jumped on the call a bit late. On your Slide 5 where you guys talk about the noninterest income being down in the quarter, you talk about the impact, the full quarter impact of the customer-friendly changes, including the Overdraft Rewind product. Can you give us some more color about what's going-on on the consumer deposit fees? And then second, you also talked about the higher earnings credit rate for commercial customers. Was that just interest-rate related as rates go higher, they get a higher credit, or was there something else in there?","John R. Shrewsberry","In terms of the second part of your question, that's exactly right, that's just the way to pay commercial customers for their deposits by charging them less for treasury management services. And the first part of your question is really, it's a very big one. Part of the reason that our retail deposit franchise is as large as it is and as low-cost as it is, is because customers have a great experience with the whole range of capabilities and the whole experience. Part of that is what they pay for monthly checking, if anything, and most of them don't pay anything, and part of it is what happens if things go wrong. And so, we have made great strides.","Overdraft Rewind, for those of you who don't remember, is the capability where if somebody has direct deposit with us and they would overdraft on any given night, but on the next day their direct deposit hits and it covers it, then we don't charge them, we don't process what happened the night before as an overdraft.","Similarly, we have been sending out tens of millions of alerts to people to help to remind them before they would overdraft that they have got little balance so they can handle their affairs appropriately and not get charged. So, we lose revenue as a result of that. We lose overdraft fees. It costs us hundreds of millions of dollars. But as a result, [indiscernible] are happy with their relationship with Wells Fargo, we end up with a large and low-cost deposit base. I think of it as inseparable in terms of the value of deposits versus what we are missing in overdraft fees.","We are not going to grow our [indiscernible] greatness as the company that we are by charging people more for overdrafts, and if we can maintain and grow those relationships by helping them avoid them when they can, then that's probably better for us both in the long-term.","Timothy J. Sloan","And that's a really important point that we are listening to our customers, and one of the themes that we hear from them is, and that is help us manage our finances better by helping us give them better information about how to manage their finances. And that's just fundamental to the long-term investments we have made in terms of specifically the two improvements that John mentioned for our consumer deposit customers. And in short run, it has an impact on revenues. On the long run, what we are seeing is we are seeing a growth in deposits, a growth in primary checking accounts and better customer service and loyalty scores, and I think that's a real indication of the progress that we're making across the entire platform. And again, it just reinforces how we are thinking about the long-term sustainability and the progress of the Company.","So, I want to thank you all for your questions. Again, I know it was a very busy day. I thought the questions were very good and we are going to continue to listen to all the advice that you provide to us, and for our team members that are mentioning today, I want to thank you for all of your hard work and effort as you continue to transform Wells Fargo. Have a good rest of your day.","Operator","And this concludes today's conference. Thank you all for participating.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions).","I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Rowe, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Rowe, you may begin your conference.","Jim Rowe","Great. Thank you, Regina and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf and our CFO, Tim Sloan will discuss first quarter results and answer your questions.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our first quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I would also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement.","Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our website.","I will now turn our call over to our John Stumpf, Chairman and CEO.","John Stumpf","Thank you, Jim and thanks to everyone for joining us today. We earned a record earnings per share of $1.05 in the first quarter, which was our 17th consecutive quarter of EPS growth. Wells Fargo's ability to grow consistently across a variety of economic and interest rate environments demonstrates the benefit of our diversified business model and our unwavering focus on our vision of meeting all of our customers' financial needs and helping them succeed financially.","Our financial results have strong capital generation and returning more capital to our shareholders has remained a priority. We are extremely pleased that our 2014 capital plan allows us to increase our common stock dividend by 17% subject to Board approval, of course and also increase our common stock repurchases in 2014. We are proud of the fact that we have been able to increase our dividend and share repurchases every year since 2011, while we have continued to grow our capital levels.","Let me now highlight our growth during the quarter, compared with a year ago. We generated earnings of $5.9 billion and EPS of the $1.05, both up 14% from a year ago. We had strong and broad-based loan growth, up $28 billion or 4%. Our credit performance continued to improve with total net charge-offs down $594 million or 42% from a year ago and net charge-offs were only 41 basis points of average loans this quarter.","Our outstanding deposit franchise continued to generate strong growth with total deposits up $83.8 billion or 8%. We deepened relationships across our company, achieving record retail banking cross sell of 6.17 products per household. Wholesale banking increased cross sell to 7.2 products and wealth brokerage and retirement cross sell was 10.42 products.","We remain focused on reducing expenses with our efficiency ratio declining to 57.9%, down 40 basis points from a year ago. We increased our returns, growing return on assets by eight basis points to 1.57% and return on equity by 76 basis points to 14.35%. We continued to generate strong capital growth with our estimated common equity Tier 1 under Basel III advance approach which was over 10%.","Our results not only demonstrate the strength of our diversified business model but also the benefit of an improving economy. While economic growth during the first quarter was uneven, economic activity improved later in the quarter, including national auto sales, which reached a seven-year high in March. Employment also increased in March for the 42nd consecutive month, one of the longest periods of sustained growth ever and consumer confidence hit a six year high. The housing recovery remained on track and should benefit from the spring buying season.","I am optimistic about future economic growth, because consumers and businesses have continued to improve their financial conditions. Households have reduced their leverage to the lowest level since 2001 and the burden of their financial obligations is lower than at any time since the mid-1980s. Also businesses are well-positioned to hire and invest with ample supplies of cash. As always, Wells Fargo is ready to help all of our customers to meet their financial needs through our diversified product line and financial advice.","I want to conclude by highlighting the management changes we announced last week. Dave Hoyt who has been with Wells Fargo for over 32 years is retiring in June. Dave and his exceptional team of leaders have built a wholesale banking business, which is well-positioned for continued growth. Tim Sloan, who you all know has been an excellent d financial and strategic leader for Wells Fargo and had previously spent 22 years in the wholesale banking group and is perfectly suited to continue wholesale banking's commitment to serving customers as he becomes the head of wholesale banking.","John Shrewsberry will join me as CFO on our earnings call next quarter, who has deep understanding of our financial and business operations as well as our shareholder expectations through his 20 years of proven leadership including heading Wells Fargo securities, with responsibility for investment banking, capital markets trading and investment research businesses. John will be supported in his new role by a strong and talented finance team. These changes demonstrate the deep bench of high caliber leaders at Wells Fargo, which I believe is the best team in banking.","Tim will now provide more details on our first quarter. Tim?","Tim Sloan","Thanks, John and good morning, everyone. My comments will follow the presentation included in the quarterly supplement, starting on page two. John and I will then answer your questions.","Wells Fargo earned a record $5.9 billion in the first quarter, up 5% from the fourth quarter. Our record earnings per share of $1.05 was also up 5% from last quarter. This was our 17th consecutive quarter of earnings per share growth and our 12th consecutive quarter of record EPS, reflecting the benefit of our diversified business model.","As John highlighted and as you can see on page three, we had strong year-over-year growth in the fundamental drivers of our business in commercial and consumer loans, deposits, cross sell, credit, expense management, which resulted in growth in net income, capital and earnings per share and produce higher returns on assets and equity. I will highlight the drivers of our growth which create long-term value for our shareholders throughout the call.","Page four highlights our revenue diversification, which is once again evenly split between net interest income and non-interest income. The drivers of our fee income, however, can differ depending on the interest rate and economic environment. For example, mortgage originations were 6% of our fee income this quarter, down from 23% a year ago, when the refinance market was strong. Other businesses such as equity investments, brokerage and mortgage servicing contributed more to fee income this quarter demonstrating the benefit of our diversified business model.","Let me start by highlighting some of the key drivers of our first quarter results from a balance sheet and income statement perspective, starting on page five. We had strong linked quarter growth in both loans and deposits. We are especially pleased with this performance since first quarter is generally a seasonally weaker quarter for growth. Loans increased $4.1 billion from the fourth quarter after increasing only $392 million on a linked quarter basis a year ago.","Deposits grew by $15.4 billion compared with $7.9 billion on a linked quarter basis a year ago. The improving economy and high quality loan originations continued to benefit credit quality with net charge-offs declining to 41 basis points.","Turning to the income statement on page six. Net interest income declined as we expected, reflecting the two fewer days in the quarter and lower income from variable sources. Non-interest income increased in the quarter, reflecting higher retail brokerage asset-based fees, mortgage servicing income and market sensitive revenue. This growth was partially offset by seasonally lower deposit service charges and card fees and lower mortgage production revenue.","Our expenses declined from the fourth quarter. While we had seasonally higher personnel expenses, we had lower deferred compensation expense, salary expense and revenue-based incentive compensation. Equipment, professional services and advertising expenses, all declined from elevated levels in the fourth quarter.","Our results this quarter included a $423 million discreet tax benefit primarily from a reduction in the reserve for uncertain tax positions due to the resolution of prior period matters with state taxing authorities. This lowered our income tax expense by $227 million compared with last quarter and reduced our effective income tax rate to 27.9%.","Let me now cover our business drivers in more detail. As shown on page seven, we continued to have strong loan growth in the first quarter, our 12th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Period end loans were up $28 billion or 4% from a year ago. Our liquidating portfolio continued to decline, down $12.8 billion from a year ago and down $2.9 billion from the fourth quarter. Excluding our liquidating portfolio, our core portfolio grew by $40.8 billion or 6% from a year ago and was up $7 billion from the fourth quarter.","On page eight, we highlight how broad-based our loan growth continued to be. C&I loans were up $12.7 billion or 7% from a year ago as we successfully grew loans in asset-backed finance, corporate banking and government and institutional banking. Foreign loans grew $7.2 billion or 18% from a year ago, reflecting growth in trade finance and the U.K. CRE acquisition we completed in the third quarter.","Real estate 1-4 family first mortgage loans grew $7.2 billion or 3% with growth in high quality nonconforming mortgages. Auto loans were up $5.3 billion or 11%, reflecting increased auto sales and record originations. Credit card balances were up $1.9 billion or 8%, with record new account growth.","Deposit growth also remained strong in the first quarter with average deposits growing $91.1 billion or 9% from a year ago and up $16.9 billion from the fourth quarter. This increase reflected solid growth across our businesses, particularly our consumer businesses and an increase in liquidity related term deposits.","Primary consumer checking customers were up 5.1% from a year ago, up from 4.7% in the fourth quarter. We have steadily increased the growth rate of this higher cross sell more profitable customer base over the past four quarters through product enhancements and consistent focus.","As shown on page 10, tax-equivalent net interest income increased $157 million from a year ago, even though our net interest margin declined 29 basis points, reflecting the benefit of lower funding costs. Net interest income declined from the fourth quarter as expected, primarily from two fewer days in the quarter and lower variable income.","Our net interest margin declined by seven basis points from the fourth quarter to 3.2% driven by three primary factors. Lower income from variable sources reflecting lower PCI resolutions reduced the NIM by four basis points, customer driven deposit growth reduced the NIM by two basis points and the liquidity actions that we took in the fourth quarter in response to increased regulatory liquidity expectations reduced the margin by one basis point.","While our deposit growth and liquidity actions reduced our NIM, they had minimal impact on net interest income. Like last quarter balance sheet repricing and growth did not impact the net interest margin this quarter. Growing net interest income remains our focus and we believe we should be able to grow net interest income throughout the remainder of the year.","Non-interest income increased $148 million from the fourth quarter with lower mortgage origination revenue offset by stronger equity gains, mortgage servicing revenue and brokerage fees. Compared with a year ago, non-interest income declined $750 million primarily reflecting lower mortgage banking results. Non-interest income excluding mortgage banking was up $534 million from a year ago with growth across many of our businesses, including brokerage, trust and investment management, credit and debit card, commercial real estate brokerage and equity investments.","Our equity gains have steadily increased over the past year, reflecting good operating performance in our portfolio and the benefit of strong public and private equity markets. We have been in equity related businesses for over 50 years. Like the other businesses at Wells Fargo, these businesses which are permitted under the Volcker Rule have experienced management teams that have produced strong results for decades. Our equity gains this quarter reflected roughly the same number of transactions as last quarter but our gains per investment were higher benefiting from positive market conditions.","Our mortgage results in the first quarter reflected the expected decline in origination volume. We originated $36 billion of mortgages down $14 billion from the fourth quarter. Our unclosed pipeline increased to $27 billion at the end of the quarter and we expect a normal seasonal benefit of a stronger purchase market in the second quarter to drive origination growth.","Our gain on sale margin was 1.61% in the first quarter within the range of the margins we saw in the second half of 2013. We also continue to see improvement in our net servicing results where servicing revenue up $229 million from the fourth quarter.","As shown on page 12, expenses were down $137 million from the fourth quarter and down $452 million or 4% from a year ago. We also improved our efficiency ratio to 57.9%. Our first quarter expenses included $440 million of seasonally higher employee benefit expenses from higher payroll taxes and 401(k) matching as well as $221 million in annual equity rewards for retirement eligible team members.","While we will not have the seasonally higher personnel expenses in the second quarter, there are certain expenses that will increase, including salary expense reflecting day count and the impact of our annual merit increases and certain expenses that are typically lower in the first quarter, such as outside professional services and advertising expenses are expected to increase in the second quarter. We also plan to continue to invest in our businesses and revenue-based incentive compensation expense could increase as businesses grow. However, we expect our efficiency ratio to remain within our target range of 55% to 59% in the second quarter.","Turning to our business segments, starting on page 13. Community banking earned $3.8 billion in the first quarter, up 31% from a year ago and up 19% from the fourth quarter. Retail banking continued to grow cross sell, achieving a record of 6.17 products per household, up from 6.1 products a year ago, while mobile banking continued to be our fastest-growing channel with 12.5 million active mobile customers up 23% from a year ago. Store traffic has remained strong with teller transaction stable from a year ago, despite decreases in geographies that experienced severe winter weather during the quarter.","Our credit card business grew balances and fee income compared with a year ago, reflecting record new account growth up 6% from the first quarter of 2013. Purchase volume grew 14% from a year ago and household penetration increased to 38%, up from 34% a year ago. We continue to be the number one auto lender in the country, with record originations in the first quarter of $7.8 billion, up 15% from a year ago.","Wholesale banking earned $1.7 billion in the first quarter, down 15% from a year ago and down 17% from the fourth quarter. This decline was primarily driven by lower PCI resolutions and investment banking revenue and seasonally higher expenses. Wholesale banking continued to generate strong loan growth, up 7% from a year ago and up 2% from the fourth quarter.","The linked quarter growth was broad-based with corporate banking growing $2 billion from new loan growth and higher utilization rates from our energy and large corporate and institutional customers. The asset-backed finance portfolio increased $2 billion from the fourth quarter, primarily due to higher utilization rates on warehouse lines and the commercial real estate portfolio grew $1.8 billion from the fourth quarter driven by higher utilization rates on construction loans and new loan originations.","Credit quality remained exceptional with $59 million in net recoveries for the quarter. Wholesale banking has had net recoveries for five consecutive quarters, reflecting our conservative risk discipline and improving market conditions. Cross sell increased to a record 7.2 products per relationship, up from 6.8 a year ago. Treasury management continued to be a key relationship building product with revenue up 4% from a year ago, driven by strong sales growth, growth in commercial card volume and pricing increases.","Wealth, brokerage and retirement earned $475 million in the first quarter, up 41% from a year ago and down 3% from the fourth quarter. We understand the importance of investing and saving for the future, which is why we are focused on offering our customers sound guidance and advice. Our brokerage advisory assets have grown to $388 billion, up $63 billion or 19% from a year ago. Revenues from advisory assets increased 25% from a year ago and recurring revenues are now 80% of WBR revenues up from 74% a year ago. Wealth brokerage retirement also had strong loan growth with average loans up 14% from a year ago, primarily driven by high quality nonconforming mortgage loans.","Turning to page 16. Credit quality continued to improve with first quarter losses down $138 million from the fourth quarter and net charge-offs declining to 41 basis points of average loans. Losses in our commercial portfolio were only one basis point of average loans and consumer losses declined to 75 basis points. Nonperforming assets have declined for seven consecutive quarters and were down $840 million from the fourth quarter. We had a $500 million reserve release in the quarter and we continue to expect future reserve releases absent the significant deterioration in the economy.","We also continue to focus on strong capital generation and believe the most important measure of our capital strength is the estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III using the advanced approach, fully phased in, our ratio grew to 10.04%, up 28 basis points from last quarter. Although we repurchased 33.5 million common shares in the first quarter, the amount of shares outstanding at the end of the quarter was up due to annual employee benefit plan issuances.","As John mentioned at the beginning of our call, our 2014 capital plan included an increase in share repurchase activity compared with 2013 activity and we expect our share count to decline in the second quarter and throughout 2014 as a result of our anticipated share repurchases. Also during the first quarter, our Board approved an additional 350 million shares in our repurchase authority. Our 2014 capital plan also included a proposed dividend of $0.35 per share for the second quarter, subject to Board approval, an increase of 17% over the $0.30 per share we paid in the first quarter.","At our last Investor Day in 2012, we provided a target payout ratio of 50% to 65%. We look forward to revisiting this target at our next Investor Day on May 20 in San Francisco.","In summary, our consistent EPS growth reflects the advantages of our diversified model. Our results in the first quarter benefited from good loan growth and good deposit growth, improved credit quality and lower expenses. Our capital levels continued to grow, while we returned to $2.6 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We are optimistic that the continued improvement in the economy and the focus of our team members on meeting the financial needs of our customers will continue to produce strong results.","We will now open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Our first question will come from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I had a couple of questions. One, just on the LCR, I know you mentioned, that the LCR related bills hit the NIM by one basis point in the quarter. So just wanted to get a sense as to how far along you think you are and how much more you need to do to get to either 100% or whatever cushion you are going to run over 100%?","Tim Sloan","Sure. Betsy. That's a really good question. You saw us in the third and fourth quarter in particular make a number of decisions where we raised the liquidity in a number of ways to try to anticipate where the domestic LCR would ultimately land. I think the problem that I have got in terms of or a challenge we have in terms of giving a specific answer to the question is we don't know what the final rules look like yet. But rest assured that we think we have adequate liquidity to operate the company and we don't anticipate whatever the final rules are, that it's going to have a material impact on the company.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay, so don't be surprised if we have a couple of more basis points coming out but it's not going to be much more than that. Is that a fair way of thinking about it?","Tim Sloan","I wouldn't necessarily equate it to net interest margin. Clearly the impact of our liquidity build this quarter was much less than in the fourth quarter in particular but again it's going to be a function of what the final rules look like and those are in flux right now. But again, I don't believe it's going to have a material impact on the net income of the operations in the company.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Got it, okay and then just secondly on mortgage. The basic question is, how are you thinking about the go-forward from here? You did indicate that weather related was tough in 1Q and we do have a seasonal pick up with purchase activity in 2Q but going in to the year, I think you know the industry was thinking that mortgage originations would be somewhere between the 1.1 and 1.3 in terms of the (inaudible) dollars origination and you have some capacity in your mortgage origination business to potentially take some share in that environment. Do you see that we are going to be a materially lower levels origination for the full-year? Have you adjusted your expenses for that? At this stage I saw you cut back in headcount a little bit in the quarter and maybe if you could speak to what the plans are for that over the next quarter or two?","Tim Sloan","Sure. I will jump in and then John may want to follow-up. The first thing is that when you look at our mortgage business, it was it was profitable, both on an origination and the servicing side which we are very pleased with. Mortgage is an important business for Wells Fargo. We have been in it for decades. We have been through cycles.","Our mortgage team is poised and ready to take advantage of a stronger selling season. You can see that we entered the quarter with a slightly increased portfolio and pipeline, which we are very excited about but again, when you look at the fundamental drivers of the mortgage business and that is, rate still historically are very low, the affordability index is very attractive and consumer debt is coming down as well as employment continues to increase. So we are optimistic. I don't know what the size of the market will be but I know that our mortgage team is poised and ready to take advantage of opportunities.","John, I don't know if you are going to --","John Stumpf","Sure. Yes. I would just add a couple of things to that. We are optimistic. Housing continues to improve. I don't think we will see the percentage increases in values this year that we saw last year but we believe it to be positive. I don't know if this is going to be in the 4% or 5%, which is kind of the consensus but as I travel around the country, there is a lot of enthusiasm about housing. And just because of the mortgage, you know, who knows where the mortgage market will be, there is frankly a lot more cash buyers today, to be honest about it. So housing is better and a bigger share of our origination, say, are purchase money, which is actually a healthy place to be and when you think of the sales force, the team that we have and all referrals coming out of our store channels and other places, this really plays to our wheelhouse. So we are excited about it and weather did have some impact but we are excited about the selling season.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","I guess I am just interested to see how some job cuts in mortgage this first quarter --","John Stumpf","Well, we are all interested in seeing that.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","All right. That's not an indication that you are too optimistic going into year?","Tim Sloan","No. We are adjusting. It's a big business and we are always looking at how to get more efficient, of course and making sure that we have the right number of team members but we are ready for whatever comes and if its not as good, we will make adjustments. If its better, we will make adjustments that way. We have been nimble on our feet for decades in that business.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Yes. Okay, thanks.","Tim Sloan","Thank you.","John Stumpf","Thanks, Betsy.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America","Good morning.","Tim Sloan","Hi, Erika.","John Stumpf","Hi, Erika.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America","Thanks much for the clarity on the share count outlook. I do want to pose a question though on the 350 million share repurchase authority that I have been getting from investors. How should we think about the catalyst that will drive the pace at which you use up this authority over the next few years?","John Stumpf","So Erika, the way that I would describe it is that and think about it and step back for a second, we returned $11.4 billion to our shareholders last year. We are going to return more than that this year. In terms of the specifics of how that's going to play out on any given day, in a month or within a quarter, we don't have a specific plan in place that we are going to execute but we would tell you that we think our shares are on sale every day and we are going to repurchase more shares this year than we did last year and you are going to see that share count go down in the second quarter, in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America","Great.","John Stumpf","And the reason we can do that is because the earnings of the company. So just think about it. And that's the fundamental driver here.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America","And so, as a follow-up to that, you are clearly an earnings machine and you have plenty of excess capital anyway you measure it. I am wondering, John, could you update us on how you are thinking about what potential acquisition opportunities there could be in terms helping enhance particularly some of your fee businesses?","John Stumpf","Sure. We don't need to do anything. That's the beauty here but we are always looking at things in an opportunistic way. The biggest capital required acquisitions or the ones that use the most capital are deposit businesses. We are, of course, at a level now where we are ready at the capital overhead. So the things that we look at are, is there a way to enhance wealth brokerage retirement possibly and that would be interesting to us. Portfolio purchases. We announced something with Dillard's recently. So these are the kind of things that we like doing. We like the card business. What were doing, if there can be an add here or there. So I would think of it as bolt-on businesses and not think of it in the way of transformational but again, if we don't do anything that's also fine.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America","Great. Thank you for answering my questions.","John Stumpf","Thank you, Erika.","Tim Sloan","Thank you, Erika.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Hi. Good morning, guys. Couple of quick questions, Tim. One or two nitpicks on net interest income. How much did the day count hurt NII dollars in the first quarter? And then when you say that you think you can grow net interest income for the rest of the year, I assume you mean starting from the 1Q starting point? Is that a good way to read what your comment was there?","John Stumpf","John, that's correct. So from the first quarter starting point, we believe that we are going to grow net interest income throughout the year, similar to what we did last year. The impact of a couple of days was somewhere in the $120 million to $130 million range for the quarter.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Okay and then in terms of investing cash, with rates coming down this quarter, it doesn't look like you did too much deployment this quarter. Could you just comment on that? There was some movement in held-to-maturity investments. It looked like they went up but can you just comment on what happened this quarter on cash deployment?","Tim Sloan","Sure. The good news is that the first call in cash department is always for loan growth and you saw good loan growth year-over-year and on a sequential quarter basis. So we were very excited about that. But you are right. Rates have been pretty volatile this quarter. There have been times during the quarter, when they were more attractive from our perspective and we did accelerate some of investments. Most of the purchases that we made in the quarter, which were about $13 billion on a gross basis, were in the held-to-maturity category and we have specifically purchased some more treasuries. Every quarter has a little bit different complexion. You have seen us be more aggressive and you saw us be more aggressive, for example, in the third and fourth quarters of last year. We will continue to invest our excess liquidity in a very appropriate way but you are right, rates are little bit lower than that we find attractive today.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Okay and then on the volatile sources, where are we on that this quarter? Is there a multi-quarter average or normalish that you could compare whether those volatile sources below average this quarter? Is there any way to contextualize that?","Tim Sloan","Well, the variable income, particularly related to PCI resolutions was, I would say, above average in the fourth quarter. This quarter, if there is such an average for a volatile item, which is hard to work, to be honest, is a little bit of a challenge but I would say this quarter is a little bit more typical than what we have seen in other items in the variable category like loan fees and resolutions and things like that. But the fourth quarter was just a little bit higher and this feels a little bit more typical.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Okay and then can you have any comment on where you are in preparations for the OLA? I know the rules aren't finished yet but is there any quantification of available bail-in resources or what level of potential requirement you might be preparing for to help us think how far along you are?","Tim Sloan","Sure. Again, it's similar to the LCR question and that is, we don't know what the final rules look like yet. We are hearing the same things that you probably are, that its going to be based on the required level of Tier 1 common equity here in the U.S. and then some sort of metric that is going to be reflective of risk in the underlying companies. I mean, the good news is that our business model is a little bit less risky than others and that I think should benefit us. Based upon what we are hearing, we don't anticipate any significant changes in the level of our long-term debt but having said that, I don't know what the final rules are going to be. My understanding is that they could be released sometime this quarter, could be next quarter. We will adjust. I wouldn't anticipate it having a material impact on the operations of the company.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Okay and then last thing for me. Just on reserve releases, can you give us underneath the service, what's driving the reserve release in terms of categories? I assume there is not much that you are releasing out of the commercial book anymore. Is it really, to the extent you see further reserve releases, is it coming out of mortgage and home equity?","John Stumpf","I would say, John, it's predominantly but not completely consumer driven. You have seen and its just a reflection of the fact that the underlying credit quality of the company continues to improve. When you think about the quality of the loans that we have originated post-crisis, the loan losses, credit quality are very, very good. And so our expectation is that while our loan loss reserve release was down this quarter from the prior quarter and from the prior quarter before that, we do anticipate future releases but its primarily consumer driven.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Okay, great. Thank you.","John Stumpf","Thanks, John.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse","Great, thanks. You had alluded to, Tim, before the idea of bolt-on type acquisitions. Is there like a maximum size that you would think about in portfolio acquisitions and if its what used to be thought of as a specialty finance business but has perhaps like internet based deposits, does that qualify as a bank? Does that restrict you? How do you think about those two questions, as it relates to the acquisition possibilities?","Tim Sloan","Moshe, I don't think there would be any difference in how we review internet-based deposits versus more traditional deposits. Deposits are going to be viewed as deposits. And as John mentioned, it's not a business that we can buy. Clearly we have adequate capital to run our business and excess capital, which we primarily want to return to our shareholders. So we have the capacity to do a relatively large acquisition.","However, our focus is going to continue to be on running the business. As John said, we don't really need to do an acquisition to continue to grow. If you look at some of the sizes of the acquisitions that we have done over the last few years, the largest have been portfolio acquisitions. I think the largest was $4 billion, $4.5 billion. So we can clearly do something of that size and really not miss a beat.","Could we do something a little bit larger than that? Sure we could but as you know, we are pretty discriminating in terms of what we want to acquire. So I wouldn't anticipate us making any big splash in the near future.","John Stumpf","Yes, let me just make sure we are all on the same page here. Tim's absolutely right. Our best opportunity to increase shareholder value is run our existing businesses even better. We have huge opportunity. We have this diversified business model, this culture. 97% of revenues are here in the U.S. It's still a very fragmented market. This is where the opportunity is and we don't need to do anything. If we do, it would be clearly accretive and it would look opportunistic to you and to us but our focus on running the business.","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse","Great and one of the things on the mortgage side that trade press has said a lot about, is that basically a lot of the origination growth has come in the non-banks. Could you talk a little about your strategies just from a market share standpoint given that there has been this growth coming from outside of the traditional banking industry?","Tim Sloan","I think it's a fair point. We are not overly concerned about, though obviously we have got to be cognitive of our competition and the reason for that is, we have the best distribution in the entire market. We have number one market share. We have a very experienced team. We have got over 6,200 stores, retail locations plus additional mortgage offices and I don't think anybody is better positioned to take advantage of business and we view it as a core business. We are growing this business. We want to continue to grow the business. We are not concerned about that. So we are going to have competition. We have non-bank competition in every one of our businesses.","John, I don't know if you want to --","John Stumpf","Sure half of the U.S. population and half of the businesses in America reside within two miles one of our stores. Just think of that. And while people, a lot of times join us online, they pick the location, they pick the provider that they are familiar with or that's close by them because they still use the store even for the millennials who are very technologically advanced and savvy. So this is really a very important part of what we are doing.","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse","Okay.","John Stumpf","So we don't know focus necessary just on share for share's sake. We focus on adding value and meeting the needs of our customers.","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse","Great, just one last nitpicky question. If you look at the yield on the loan portfolio, commercial and commercial mortgage loans, just about $300 billion. It's a pretty sizable drops in the yield. Was that part of the restatement? Was that a PCI thing? Or was there something else going on there?","Tim Sloan","Those are mostly related to the decline in the PCI resolution.","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse","Got it, okay. Thank you.","John Stumpf","Thank you, Moshe.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","John Stumpf","Hi, Joe.","Tim Sloan","Hi, Joe.","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets","I just wondered if perhaps you could give us any more clarity on the relative change in the mortgage related production expenses, quarter-to-quarter or sequentially, just based on the cutbacks you announced in the back half of last year?","Tim Sloan","Well, they were down. The way that I would think about it, Joe, is that we have been responding to the decline in the refinance activity and we started to do that in the summer and throughout the fall and through the winter. We think we are appropriately staffed right now to take advantage of the spring selling season. And so there will be a little bit of a reduction in terms of the base level of expense because of the changes or the decisions that we made in the first quarter in terms of the number of people, when you think about the second quarter. But we are hopeful, candidly, that the expenses rise in the mortgage business in the second quarter because that's going to be reflective of the fact that originations are up and there will be more incentive-based compensation.","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. That makes sense. I guess beyond that, the other question would be just beyond mortgage. Do you see weather having any factor in your loan growth trends this quarter? And I guess, maybe another way of looking at is, how did the pipeline look at quarter-end relative to three months ago? Or how do you see loan growth progressing through the year?","Tim Sloan","Loan growth in general or in mortgage, Joe?","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets","No, beyond mortgage, other categories.","Tim Sloan","The pipelines look good. I think we were really pleased. In the first quarter, $1 billion plus growth on a net basis and $7 billion in the first quarter, that's a really good first quarter, number one, just on an absolute number. The other thing that was exciting from our perspective is how broad-based it was. It wasn't just in any one specific business. It was in our commercial and wholesale businesses. It was in many of our consumer lending businesses and it was in the relationships we have in the wealth, brokerage and retirement business. So it was very broad-based. So we are optimistic about continued loan growth. I don't know what the number is going to be but none of our businesses are saying that they don't think they can grow loans for the rest of the year.","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Thanks for the update.","Tim Sloan","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Chris Mutascio with KBW. Please go ahead.","Chris Mutascio - KBW","Good morning, John and Tim. Good morning. How are you guy doing?","John Stumpf","Good.","Tim Sloan","Good, Chris.","Chris Mutascio - KBW","First, Tim, good luck in your role and if Dave is listening, congratulations on his pending retirement. I am pretty jealous of that. Tim, I wanted to ask you a quick question, actually two quick questions. On the gross servicing, on the mortgage side, on page39 of the release. Before hedging and before any fair value adjustments, you had a pretty good increase, about a 15% increase in the gross servicing income from fourth quarter to first quarter. What would drive such a big increase despite the fact that the portfolio is roughly the same size? Does the lower expenses on foreclosures impact that gross servicing income?","Tim Sloan","Yes, it\u2019s a fair point. When you look at that page, you see that our servicing fees were over $1 billion, which was terrific. Now you can look back and see that phenomena in the second quarter of last year too but it's primarily driven by the point you just made Chris and that is that the quality of the portfolios is better and that's a good thing but it's primarily a lack of late charges and special servicing fees and the like.","Chris Mutascio - KBW","Okay and just an unrelated question. I am just kind of backing in on the reserve. You have been releasing about 10, well, I don't see releasing but the reserve ratio has been going down about 10 basis points plus or minus for the last couple of quarters per quarter. At that rate, if that were to continue, you would be at a reserve ratio to loans of 1.30%, 1.35% range by end of the year. Is that something that you are comfortable going to in an environment that we are in right now in terms of the regulatory environment?","Tim Sloan","Chris, candidly, I didn't appreciate the math that you just described that it's been about 10 basis points a quarter but it has been. It's been accidental more than anything. It's really a function of the underlying improvement in the portfolio. I think that that ratio will continue to improve. I don\u2019t know where, we don't know where it's going to land. It's going to be a function of the performance of the portfolio but it's definitely going to go down.","Chris Mutascio - KBW","Okay. Thank you.","Tim Sloan","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous. Please go ahead.","Brian Foran - Autonomous","Good morning. I was wondering if I could ask about the Basel III capital and over the past couple of quarters, it's just grown faster than a simple model of earnings less dividend less buybacks and linking RWA growth with asset growth would imply. What's been the main drivers of that? And as we look forward, do you think the Basel III ratio continues to grow faster than that kind of simplistic view would imply? Or is it going to converge with the normal earnings growth rate?","Tim Sloan","Well, Brian, it\u2019s a good question. The whole topic is a little bit complicated, primarily because we have had a number of rule changes and rule interpretations by the entire industry, number one. If you recall in the third quarter, we did reduce our RWA and we called out some specific items in the third quarter to reduce our risk-weighted assets but I think the trend in terms of being different than just a basic math that you just described, it's more likely that it's going to closer to the basic math than you just described than not. Candidly it will continue to be a function of the underlying risk within the portfolio. That is the primary driver. If we can continue to improve credit quality, continue to improve market risk, continue to improve operational risk, those will be the big drivers because that's what the new methodology is based upon.","Brian Foran - Autonomous","I appreciate that and on the LCR, I know the rules aren't finalized, so all this is kind of prospective as opposed to anything you would be doing now but I guess in a very simplistic level, it seems to raise the value of retail deposits and lower the value of commercial deposits relative to each other just because the retail deposit runoff assumptions are so much lower. How big a deal is that? Is that something that just hit the margin, maybe it fits with the mix of commercial deposits or something or as currently written, is that a bigger deal that actually shifts the focus of industry deposit gathering?","Tim Sloan","I don't think it is going to fundamentally shift how we think about gathering deposits. And John, you may have a different view but I mean, anytime we can bring in and broaden a relationship with one of our retail or commercial customers, we want to do that. We want their deposits. What we don't like is our wholesale deposits in the more traditional defined sense or hot money, things like that. We are looking for long-term relationships but even in the most extreme interpretation of the new rules, we still want to grow our commercial deposits. And again that's because we have such a large deposit base. We are not overly concerned about the impact in terms of how it affects the LCR but we will know what the rules look like and the impact, I am sure, later this year.","John Stumpf","Brian, Tim is absolutely right. We just love deposits when they are part of a primary relationship and we like them. At times when some were asking us why you are growing deposits because you can't utilize them. And we said, it's good for long-term shareholder value. We have a fixed infrastructure and the more customers we can serve with that fixed infrastructure, magic happens. Not always every quarter and sure we are all looking for earning assets but I will take all the deposits we can get that are part of a primary relationship and we cross-sell off that and it's a major driver in customer loyalty. So it's a big emphasis here for us.","Brian Foran - Autonomous","Thank you for taking my questions.","John Stumpf","Thank you.","Tim Sloan","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","John Stumpf","Hi Ken.","Tim Sloan","Hi Ken.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","I just wanted to follow-up on the deposit side question. So with you guys sounding pretty confident about the loan pipeline, we are also continuing to see a very strong amount of deposit growth from you guys as well as in the industry and I am just wondering, are there any undercurrents where you are at least starting to see customers use deposits to fund their businesses? Or do you think we are just into a new regime where it's all just about building the relationship and continuing to see deposits grow well as well as grow better. I guess the question is what's different, if anything, as far as how you are seeing loan pipelines grow versus deposit growth continuing?","John Stumpf","Let me take a shot at that. You are right. What you typically see, Ken, is when loan start to grow the customers tend to use their own cash first. So there is some of that going on but there's a lot of liquidity in the system. People are saving more. Americans save more now than they did in the last decade or two. And frankly, our the health of our retail delivery system, when I say the health, I mean the online and the stores and the ATMs and the mobile and phone, all of those working together as an omni-channel, is a very compelling value proposition for businesses and consumers and we are getting a disproportionate share. And we just love that.","And I will also say this. Our deposit franchise is probably undervalued today given where absolute rates are and that will change over time. The other thing that's happened is we probably have a better set of competitors today than we have had. More rational competitors as in the past. So it's a combination of a lot of things and we are expecting to continue to see strong growth. When I look back at five years ago, when we merged with Wachovia, if you would exclude CDs, we had about $650 billion of deposits. Today if you exclude CDs, we are about at $1.50 trillion. We grew $400 billion dollars in five years.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Yes, great. My second question, just, IB was soft as it was for the industry on a quarter-to-quarter basis and some of that is seasonal but I just wanted to get your comments and your thoughts about market share opportunities and where you think the IB pipeline looks from here?","Tim Sloan","We continue to be optimistic about the growth in our investment banking business and the reason for that is that most of the business that we are doing in investment banking is with existing Wells Fargo customers who already have a relationship across the board. So because we haven't penetrated those customers as much as we would like, we still think that there is a lot of opportunity there. The market share is a result of focusing on customers and clients as opposed to trying to get to a specific market share number but you are right. We understand that that business can be a little bit volatile. We were down a bit this quarter. I am hopeful we will be up in the second quarter and the third quarter but as long as we focus on our clients and on the overall relationship, particularly those that are already, we have got a good chance to continue to grow the business.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Okay and then my last real quick one is just, you mentioned the discrete tax benefit in the first quarter. Can you just to clarify what your expectation is for the tax rate for the rest of the year?","Tim Sloan","Sure. The expectation is, it's likely the tax rate is going to go up. I would love to be able to tell you that we could have that kind of tax benefit every quarter but I sure wouldn't plan on it. I think it's more likely that the tax rate for the rest of the quarter, which obviously is going to be very dependent on how much money we earn and we are looking forward to growing revenues and growing income over time but I think it's more likely that that tax rate is going to be in the low 30s.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Okay. Thanks. So kind of back to historical. Okay, got it. Thanks, guys.","John Stumpf","Thank you.","Tim Sloan","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Good morning.","John Stumpf","Good morning, Mike.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","So, Tim, I am looking at this and thinking what are you leaving your successor, 17 quarters in a row of higher EPS and that's tough to continue. I know I have been asking this several quarters but if you take out I estimate $0.07 benefit due to the lower tax rate, that's a trend that's going to maybe be tough to continue. I don't what's your thought about that.","Tim Sloan","Well, Mike, I would love to take credit for 17 quarters of consecutive earnings growth but there's another 264,999 people around here that really get the credit for it. It's not about what we do every quarter. Obviously, we are very proud of not only the last 17 quarters but the last five years where we have grown our earnings on a compounded rate of 16%. So the trend has gone on for a long period of time but every quarter is a little bit different and the second quarter is going to have a different complexion than the first and the fourth and the third of last year but we continue to be optimistic, Mike.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Well, I would ask it a little bit differently. Revenues are down 3% year-over-year and it's good. Now expenses are down 4% and that's helped the efficiency improve from close to 59% down to 58% but that's still on the high end of your target of 55% to 59%. So did you guys not get as much in savings as you would have liked or is that a future opportunity?","Tim Sloan","We continue our goal of improving the efficiency of the company. We provided a range of 55% to 59% a couple of years ago and we haven't gotten to the 55% level. That's clearly a goal that we would like to achieve sometime. We think the improvement that we have made year-over-year and on a sequential quarter basis to get back to 57.9% has been very good. But I am hopeful that the primary reason that the dollar expenses could continue to grow in the company is because revenue is going to grow. That's a good thing and that's why we focus on efficiency. So there's still a lot of opportunity in terms of becoming more efficient at Wells Fargo. We are not done yet.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","On the expense side, can you just elaborate on a few of the key initiatives that might move that efficiency ratio to the lower end of the range?","Tim Sloan","Sure. There's not really any one key efficiency project, Mike. We are a large company. We have lots of different businesses and each business is focused on improving efficiency but for example, we are focused on the amount of space that we have. We have done a great job in terms of reducing the amount of square footage we have in the company but the fact of the matter is our people, our team members are working differently than they did 10 years ago and five years ago. They are spending more time with customers and less time in the office. So we have an opportunity to reduce occupancy cost and reduce our square footage over time. That would be an example.","John Stumpf","Mike, something else you could think about is that we still have a number of loss mitigation folks as we are still working with elevated foreclosure and those kinds of issues but on the other hand then we are investing more in operational risk and compliance and those sort of things. So you are right. We are at the higher-end of that range but on the other hand as you know that's a ratio. It's a numerator expenses divided by revenue and we have seen revenue because of interest rates on the margin revenues while we have been able to grow NII. The margin is not at an all-time high. So as that improves that will also give you some lift but whatever we do here we will be very careful about what we spend money on but never at the expense of the long-term but we are focused on it. That's a good point you bring up.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","That's why I brought up, revenues are down year-over-year and you are still at the high-end of the efficiency range but I guess we will hear more about that at the investor conference?","John Stumpf","Actually, that's actually a good thing. Think of revenues down and we actually improve the efficiency ratio but there is opportunity and yes, you are right, we will talk more about that.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","And then if you can just elaborate on the management changes, John. I guess you are gearing for the next generation. How much longer do you plan to stay around and who would be in the pool of potential successors?","John Stumpf","Well, I am glad you asked and I was going to give you that information. I am 60. I know you think I look a lot younger but I plan to stay here as the Board is okay with that and they want me through my 65th birthday and we have got great people here. We have a terrific team of leaders and you know some of them. I wish you could know more. For those of you who come to our investor conference next month you will get to meet more of them. Please come. That's one of the reasons we love to show you more of them. But this is a great team and I couldn't be more confident. In fact I think it's the best team in the industry. And one thing, even though, and Dave has been such a great leader, even with his leaving, the average tenure of my tenure is still around 28 years with this company.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Thank you.","John Stumpf","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","Hi, guys.","Tim Sloan","Hi, Matt.","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","I am sorry if I missed it but did you provide the estimated leverage ratio under the new rules that came out last week or this week?","Tim Sloan","Matt, we didn't and we are still working through that calculation but just assume that at the parent company level, we are comfortably above 7%. So it's really not an issue for us.","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","Okay and that leads me to my next question. If we look at the three banks that are bigger than you, I think when you kind of put together all the new requirements out there for capital liquidity, it's a bit more onerous for them than it is for you. I am just wondering like are you actually seeing them pullback in certain areas that you now feel like you can compete in and has that changed since last year when we first got the current proposals for the SLR?","Tim Sloan","Matt, I wish that was the case. The business is very competitive across the board today. We expected that all of our competitors are going to adjust to whatever the new rules are. We have candidly been doing that since 2009 but it's a competitive market out there and hopefully for whatever reason, we can continue to grow.","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","Okay, and then just lastly, a number of lumpy either revenue items or the tax gain, anything on the expense side besides a seasonal increase in cost that you would want to point out like litigation costs or anything else lumpy that we should be thinking about?","Tim Sloan","No. Not beyond the seasonal items in the first quarter but again I want to emphasize that you should expect some increases in other line items within expenses in the second quarter that I called out but nothing in the quarter that was lumpy from an expense standpoint other than the seasonal compensation related items.","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","Okay, on that expense outlook, when you piece together the decline in some of the seasonal benefits and increases elsewhere, if we just kind of hold revenue flat quarter-to-quarter, do expenses stay flat or go up or down or what's the net of all those items?","Tim Sloan","Yes, Matt, we will know for sure in about 90 days and I just don't know what the exact dollar expenses will be but one of the reasons why I called out some of the categories is reducing some of those categories are going to rise relative to their first quarter numbers. But again a lot of our expenses are driven off revenue. If revenues are higher in the second quarter and that's the reason that expenses are up, I think, we will all be very, very happy.","John Stumpf","Yes, I don't think any of us look to the future and say let's hold revenues flat. We think we are a growth company.","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thank you.","Tim Sloan","Thank you, Matt.","John Stumpf","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Marty Mosby with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim","Thanks. I wanted to talk a little bit about the macro hedge on the mortgage side. The servicing profitability has actually tripled since last year, going from $300 million to about $900 million per quarter. That represents more than half of the mortgage banking income. So I just wanted to talk about and get your feelings on further improvements in that as we move forward and just have few precise questions about maybe some items that could help there as well.","Tim Sloan","Well, Marty, you are absolutely correct. Our servicing income is up significantly over the past few years or the past few quarters as you can see. The drivers are primarily the fact that the underlying quality of the portfolio continues to improve. So there is less adjustments that we need to take to the value for things like foreclosure cost to make any changes related to the consent order or servicing settlement and so on and so forth.","In terms of the hedge, I wouldn't think about it as kind of a macro hedge. It's a very complicated set of hedging activities that we need to do. We have got a large group of people that does it. They are very experienced but as we have talked about in the past, we are not trying to make any sort of macro bets from an interest rate standpoint or in terms of a market standpoint.","We are just trying to generate a predictable set of earnings from an underlying business that we like a lot. It was very beneficial when we went through the refinancing boom and we believe can continue to provide good earnings. You are absolutely correct that it's a larger portion of earnings than maybe the origination side but my guess is that's going to change from quarter-to-quarter depending upon origination volume.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim","When I meant macro-hedge, I meant more originations versus servicing, not the hedging and the servicing portfolio.","Tim Sloan","Well, I am sorry. Yes, you are right. But again, I think sometimes folks think that somehow the servicing business is a natural hedge to origination volume and given what we have seen over the last year or so, given the size of the refinance opportunity, we can see that really wasn't the case.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim","To some point but not completely?","Tim Sloan","Correct.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim","When you look at the prepayment speeds, not really accelerating with refinance, not really coming off the floor, you still wrote down the MSRs about $400 million this quarter. I know rates came back in but really cash flow is what matter more than just a rate. So rates are proxy. But if don't get a significant increase in prepayment fees there really shouldn't be further write-downs in the portfolio at this point. So I was just curious what you thought or what was driving that write down this quarter?","Tim Sloan","Well, you are absolutely correct that rates are a driver. We have seen a lot of volatility in rates for certain but again rates are the primary driver, also just underlying prepayment fees that we are seeing for other reasons in terms of how quickly folks are selling their homes and moving elsewhere but our best guess is that we could continue to see some benefit from the servicing portfolio.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim","And then lastly, the provision for unfunded commitments jumped up this quarter about $250 million. Is that something we should see at the same level? Or is that something you made a little adjustment on this quarter that might fall back as you move forward?","Tim Sloan","Well, it's a reflection of the fact that our loan commitments grew which is a good thing but also we just adjusted some of our estimates and I wouldn't anticipate that that would repeat itself on a quarterly basis.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim","All right. Thanks.","Tim Sloan","Thank you.","John Stumpf","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research, LLC. Please go ahead.","Nancy Bush - NAB Research, LLC","Good morning, guys. How are you?","John Stumpf","Hi Nancy.","Nancy Bush - NAB Research, LLC","A question for you that, I think John McDonald asked the question about the release in loan loss reserves and I would sort of ask for an additional detail on that. How much of this release was enabled by the reserves you built after the Wachovia deal? In other words how much or how many of these reserves are related to better credit quality at Wachovia than you had anticipated?","Tim Sloan","You know what, I don't have the percentage off the top of my head, Nancy. I think what you saw is that we continued to build reserves throughout 2009 and I am trying to remember what quarter we stopped building reserves. I thought it was through most of 2009 but I would say it's a reflection of clearly improved credit quality in the underlying portfolio that we inherited from Wachovia as well as the Wells portfolio but I don't know what the percentage is just related to that because today it's really all mixed. We don't really think about it that way.","John Stumpf","But Nancy, you are right to this extent. The Wachovia portfolio turned out to be better than we had thought and if you just look at how much we have moved from, on the PCI side into the accretable from the non-accretable, and we especially did a lot better on the Pick-a-Pay. We just had a terrific team that attacked that early on but credit turned out, I think partly because of things that we did. It turned out to be quite a lot better.","Tim Sloan","But Nancy, again, just to reinforce John's last comment and I should have mentioned it, most of the improvement that we saw in the Wachovia portfolio, was really in what you see in PCI and the detail we provide there as opposed to in the loan loss reserve.","Nancy Bush - NAB Research, LLC","Okay. Secondly, this is sort of a tangential credit quality question and has to do with Dave Hoyt's decision to retire. Number one, Tim, congratulations but with the admonition that timing is everything in life. Secondly, Dave Hoyt was the best in the industry at two things, number one, not answering a question. He was expert at that. But number two, just foreseeing credit quality trends way in advance and I have had the question from others and I am a little bit concerned that Dave is sort of looking out into the future here and seeing that commercial credit quality is about as good as it's going to get. Could you just comment on that?","Tim Sloan","Well, Nancy I worked for Dave for about 20 years and he absolutely was a terrific judge of credit quality. I think if Dave was on the phone, he would also say that there were hundreds if not thousands of people that there were behind him in wholesale banking that helped in that. So there's no question that Dave's retirement is something that we weren't looking forward to. But we have a great team here and I would not read into his retirement as him saying from here on in credit quality is going to significantly deteriorate at Wells Fargo.","In fact, I think it's more likely that it's going to continue to improve. Now the likelihood in the commercial portfolio that we are going to continue to have quarters of recovery as opposed to loan losses, that's not going to happen forever. But the fact of the matter is that culture really matters and the culture that we have in the wholesale banking group in terms of making good credit decisions is going to continue on, because that's what Dave was very good at instilling in thousands of people within the wholesale banking group.","John Stumpf","And I can tell you my perspective and while I have not had that much time with Dave, I have only had 16 years with him. He is retiring. He has a fabulous family including grandchildren. He has a lot of other interests and he just felt it was right for him and while we are sad to see him go, we celebrate with him his next stage and as Tim mentioned, his legacy are the thousands of people that he has led that are in leadership roles right now that continue to propel this business forward.","Nancy Bush - NAB Research, LLC","Well, please let him know that I am sure I am not the only analyst who is going to miss sparring with him. One other thing. On private equity, just the gains you had, you guys has long had an expertise in technology, private equity investments and is that still or is that sort of the primary source of a lot of the gains this quarter?","Tim Sloan","It was a source of some of the gains, Nancy, but it was really across the board. We had, as I mentioned, about the same resolutions, I would say about half were in technology-related, the other half weren't. And we are very pleased with the gains that we had this quarter but as you can appreciate that you can't count on those at the same level every quarter. I wish we could but this is a very buoyant time in the equity markets, both public and private, notwithstanding some of the market volatility over the last couple of days and we have got good management teams. As you said, we have been in the business for a long time. So we continue to be optimistic about the long-term success of those businesses but quarter-to-quarter, it's going to be what's it's going to be.","Nancy Bush - NAB Research, LLC","All right. Thank you very much.","John Stumpf","Thank you, Nancy.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Tim Sloan","Hi Paul.","Jessica Ribner - FBR Capital Markets","Hi. This is actually Jessica Ribner for Paul. How are you?","John Stumpf","Well, we have upgraded. How are you, Jessica?","Tim Sloan","Good.","Jessica Ribner - FBR Capital Markets","You have upgraded. It's true. Then who is going to read the transcripts. You guys have actually shrunk your market share almost in half to about 16% over the last couple quarters or the last few quarters I should say but you are also talking about growing it. Where do you see that going?","Tim Sloan","Yes, sure. It's a good question. Again if you step back and think about the time at which, in the cycle that our market share was so high, arguably two times, maybe a little bit less than that, it was because the primary source of mortgage origination volume depending upon the quarter could have been two-thirds of volume or three quarters of volume or even more in some quarters was refinance volume.","So that's reflective of the fact that we are the largest servicer. We had the highest-quality servicing portfolio and generally those customers gave us the first call and we were able to meet their needs by refinancing that mortgage. We had indicated that we thought that as the refinancing volume declined and as the mix changed to more of a purchase money market, our market share would go down.","So that was absolutely anticipated but we don't think of the business as a market share business. We think about it as how do we solve the needs of our customers. Do we have the right number of people in the right places? As John mentioned, we got the best distribution system in the market and so we are optimistic about being able to grow. Whether that means we will grow market share? I don't know but we are optimistic about growth in the business.","John Stumpf","Jessica, the other thing you should think about is that the 16% or whatever that number is 16% or 17%, part of it is in aggregation business where we do correspondent banking business and which we love that business but it's a lower margin business and part of it is a retail business where we actually originate the loan through one of our home mortgage consultants. Some of the correspondent business is going directly to Fannie and Freddie. So that business is actually changing a bit. So when you look even at the time when we had maybe double that share, you have to look at both sides of that and while I focus on all of it, it's also important to make that distinguishment.","Jessica Ribner - FBR Capital Markets","Okay, well. Thank you. And then kind of a related question. You guys said earlier on the call that you added about $7.2 billion, it sounds like jumbo mortgages on the balance sheet. Is that correct?","Tim Sloan","No. Our loan growth was primarily, on a gross basis for the quarter was about $7 billion point-to-point. The growth in non-conforming mortgages on a gross basis, which would be the jumbo category, was about $5.8 billion.","Jessica Ribner - FBR Capital Markets","Okay, and where do you see that trend going?","Tim Sloan","Hopefully it will continue to go up. I think that one of the areas that we indicated a couple of years ago at our Investor Day was a real effort on the part of our team in the wealth area as well as in our retail banking area to coordinate more on those opportunities and they have done just a terrific job. So we are hopeful with the improvement in the weather and the spring selling season that we will continue to see that grow over time.","John Stumpf","The one's we put on portfolio are very small part of the originations. It's less than 5% or so. So there's opportunity there.","Jessica Ribner - FBR Capital Markets","Okay, great. Well, thank you very much.","Tim Sloan","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Keith Murray with ISI. Please go ahead.","John Stumpf","Hi Keith.","Keith Murray - Keith Murray","It's actually Keith Murray for Keith Murray. So it\u2019s a bit of a downgrade for your guys. Sorry.","John Stumpf","We still think that\u2019s an upgrade.","Keith Murray - Keith Murray","Thank you very much. Just on all the new rules, you have got Basel III, you have got SLR, you have got LCR. When you think about loan pricing and pricing for commitments, has that all been factored in yet and are you still kind of working through the changes that will have to be made?","Tim Sloan","Really good question. I don't believe that the industry, set us aside for a minute, the industry has necessarily adjusted yet because their capital rules have just been finalized. The leverage rules, for example, are relatively new and we haven't seen the final liquidity rules. I am sure there will be some adjustments, just like there's been adjustments to all the other new rules and regulations that we have post-crisis. So I think it's more in the future than in the past.","Keith Murray - Keith Murray","Okay, and then are you seeing much impact from non-bank lenders out there? Every private equity firm, non-banks are seeing a lot of them try to do more loans to the middle market firms. So are you seeing much impact at all?","Tim Sloan","Well, there's no question that post-crisis, given a lot of the regulatory changes created opportunities for unregulated or differently regulated institutions and that's been the case for as long as I have been in the lending business and been with the bank. I think the important point to make is that generally though those firms frequently are very good are monoline firms and that is they have one product they can provide credit. How we differentiate ourselves is that we have relationships and that we can provide tens of products or more and broaden that relationship. So we don't find ourselves losing a lot of business to non-banks. I also think that generally the competitive environment is a little bit more rational than it would be today. But again, we have a real advantage when we compete against a monoline product provider versus our relationship-focused and cross-sell orientation.","Keith Murray - Keith Murray","Thanks, and then just finally, on fee based businesses that you have, if you look out for the rest of this year and through 2015, which of those businesses do you think has the most potential upside for revenue growth.","John Stumpf","We really all of our businesses. In fact, we think there's growth opportunity but a couple of them jump out wealth, brokerage, retirement. You saw that we are at 41% and I don't think we can do 41% every quarter or every year but that's a huge growth opportunity for us. The card business. We think we have got some exciting things happening there but that doesn't diminish anything else.","We have opportunities with what we are doing international because we have more of our U.S. customers doing business there. We have opportunity in our capital markets businesses and even mortgage where you think where people would say, well, geez, you have the number one share. There is huge opportunity there. Half of our customers who call us at our bank who have a mortgage don't do it with us. So there is all kinds of opportunity here.","Keith Murray - Keith Murray","Okay. Thank you.","John Stumpf","Thank you.","Tim Sloan","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Suntrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead.","Eric Wasserstrom - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey","Thanks very much. Hello. Just a couple of follow-up questions. One is, I know that your card fees declined by about the same amount as they did in the first quarter of last year but in terms of your actual charge volumes was there any decline that was more than what is typically seasonal in this first quarter?","Tim Sloan","No. Not at all.","Eric Wasserstrom - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey","No. So in other words, no disruption from weather or any other exogenous temporary employment or any other exogenous factor?","Tim Sloan","No. Not at all.","Eric Wasserstrom - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay, and just turning to the gain on sale trend for a moment. I recognize that the changes weren't big but most of the proxies that we use suggested flat and so I am just wondering if there was anything in mix or otherwise that would have explained the decline?","Tim Sloan","No. There wasn't necessarily a big change in mix. That's one of the reasons why we have provided a range beginning in the third quarter of last year. I think there was a concern in the market that as volume went down that gain on sale margins would go down significantly. We think that the range that we have provided plus or minus 1.5% is a reasonable range to operate in but comparing any quarter, 5 to 10 to even 15 basis point level of volatility is not uncommon at all.","Eric Wasserstrom - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey","Great, and then lastly, just getting back to Brian's question about the accretion of Basel III capital versus the growth in earnings, recognizing that there should be convergence, it also seems that the quality of the portfolio that you have originated over the past few years has lower embedded risk. So wouldn't that suggest that as the risk component becomes an increasingly important determinant of your Tier 1 under the Basel III, wouldn't that suggest that Basel III capital continues to grow ahead of what the earnings math would otherwise suggest?","Tim Sloan","It could, but again, because it's a more complicated calculation right now because you have got the impact of market risk, you have got the impact of operational risk and candidly, the operational risk calculations for the regulators as well as the entire industry continues to be a work in progress and influx. I wouldn't want to jump to a conclusion that just underlying credit quality only would be the sole driver of improvement in RWA.","Eric Wasserstrom - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey","Great, and then just last one for me and I hate to come back to this topic because it's already been addressed many times, reserve releases. The nonperforming assets continue to come down but many of the forward-looking credit quality indicators are starting to flatten in terms of their sequential improvement. So all was equal and, of course, your portfolio of loans continues to grow, so all was equal, wouldn't that indicate that the pace of reserve release should start to decline also?","Tim Sloan","Well, it could and, to your point, that's what you have seen over the last three quarters. We went from a $900 million release in the third quarter to $600 million last quarter to $500 million this quarter. I don't know what the release is going to be in the second quarter. We do believe we are going to have a release but it's a fair point. I mean, this is not going to go on forever but the fact of the matter is the portfolio continues to improve.","Eric Wasserstrom - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay, all right. Thanks very much.","Tim Sloan.","Thank you.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Derek De Vries with UBS. Please go ahead.","John Stumpf","Derek?","Operator","Derek, your line maybe on mute. If you are on a speaker phone, please pick up your handset. And there is no response from that line.","John Stumpf","All right. Why don't we then conclude. Let me make a couple of comments. First of all, I would like to thank Tim Sloan for the great work he's done as our CFO. As you all know, he's going to take over the Wholesale Bank but Tim, thank you for the great leadership and the work you have done here. You have just been terrific.","For those of you who don't know John Shrewsbury, many of you do, you will get to see him, if not before but you will surely see him when you come to our investor conference, remember that was May 20 in San Francisco. We look forward to seeing you. It's always an exciting time for us to talk about our business and share with you the enthusiasm and some of the great people that we have. So thank you very much for your interest in Wells Fargo and we will talk to you next quarter and the investor conference earlier than that.

Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today during which our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf; and CFO, Tim Sloan will discuss second quarter results and answer your questions.","Before we get started, I\u2019d like to remind you that our second quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I\u2019d also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today\u2019s call that are subject to risks and uncertainties.

Stumpf","Thank you, Jim. Thanks to everyone for joining us today. Wells Fargo had a terrific quarter and has now generated 14 consecutive quarters of earnings per share growth, with record earnings in the second quarter. This consistent strong performance during our dynamic economic and interest rate environment again demonstrates the benefit of our diversified business model.","We are not dependent on any one business to generate growth. We have over 90 businesses that are all focused on just one thing, meeting our customer\u2019s financial needs. Our results this quarter demonstrate the momentum we have throughout for all of our businesses.","Our strong performance is broad based compared to a year-ago we earned a record $5.5 billion, up 19% and grew earnings per share of 20%. We grew pre-tax pre-provision profit by 3%. We reduced our expenses and improved our efficiency ratio by 90 basis points to 57.3%. Our core loan portfolio grew by $42.3 billion, up 6%. Our credit performance was outstanding, benefiting from our conservative underwriting in improving economic conditions, especially of housing with net charge-offs down to 58 basis points and our total net charge-off down 48% from just a year-ago.","Our strong deposit franchise, which becomes even more valuable in a rising great environment continue to grow, with total deposits up 10% from a year-ago, while we reduced total deposit cost by 5 basis points to 14 basis points.","We achieved record retail cross-sell of 6.14 products per household. Wholesale Banking grew their cross-sell to 6.9 products and Wealth Brokerage Retirement cross-sell increased to over 10 products \u2013 10.35 to be exact. We grew return on assets by 14 basis points to 1.55% and return on equity increased by 116 basis points to 14.02%.","Our capital levels continue to grow with our estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio under Basel III increasing to 8.54% and based on our initial review of the leverage ratio proposed \u2013 proposal issued this week; we believe our current leverage levels would exceed the well capitalized requirements at both the bank and the holding company.","Our strong earnings growth has enabled us to grow our capital levels, while returning more capital to our shareholders. In the second quarter, we increased our dividends to $0.30 a share, up 36% from a year-ago and we continue to buyback stock.","Before turning the call over to Tim, let me conclude with some comments about my views on how the current economic and rate environment impacts Wells Fargo. We continue to be optimistic about the improvements we\u2019re seeing throughout the economy. While commercial loan demand is still modest, jobs are been created, consumer confidence is increasing and the housing market continue to demonstrate strong momentum.","In fact, in the second quarter, the housing market improvement was stronger and more broad-based than it has been since before 2008. Sales were up and residential property prices increased in by 13% across the country. Yet, affordability still remains attractive, even with the increased prices and higher interest rates. The strength in the housing market was a positive catalyst to our results in the second quarter in a number of ways including higher originations performed purchases, lower environmental costs, reduced repurchase reserves and improved credit quality.","Assuming the housing market state remains strong, and we currently believe it will, our overall results will continue to reflect these benefits. While the economy continues it\u2019s slow, but steady improvement, the current rate environment is obviously very different than it was just 90 days ago when we last announced our earnings.","We knew rates would eventually rise as we\u2019ve been planning for a rising rate environment for sometime. The benefit of our diversified business models is that it provides opportunities to generate earnings growth over a variety of rate environment. Some of our businesses can actually do better in a lower rate environment and others benefit from the rising rates.","Tim will highlight the growth we\u2019ve achieved across a number of our businesses on our call today. We do not manage Wells Fargo based on a specific rate environment. We manage Wells Fargo as we have for decades to satisfy our customer\u2019s financial needs. Rates rising for the right reason and improving economy is beneficial for our customers, which then in turn benefits Wells Fargo.","Tim will now provide more details on our second quarter results. Tim?","Timothy J. Sloan","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. My comments would follow the presentation included in the first half of our quarterly supplement starting on Page 2. John and I will then take your questions.","As John mentioned, Wells Fargo had another outstanding quarter with record earnings of $5.5 billion, up 19% from a year-ago and up 7% from the first quarter. Earnings per share grew to $0.98, up 20% from last year and up 7% from the first quarter. We\u2019ve now achieved 14 consecutive quarters of EPS and nine consecutive quarters of record earnings per share.","As John just mentioned, the rate environment this quarter was very different from last quarter. In fact, the economic housing rate environment has differed significantly over the past 14 quarters of our earnings growth. While the drivers of our growth have varied, our consistent risk discipline and diversified business model have remained the same.","Our results this quarter compared to the first quarter, clearly show the advantage of our diversity with our bottom line results benefiting from strong broad based trends including net interest income growth as we drew loans and invested in securities, fee growth across a variety of our businesses, reduced expenses generating positive operating leverage and improved credit and capital levels.","As you can see on page 3, our year-over-year results were also strong with growth in pre-tax, pre-provision profit, net income, EPS, both total and core loans, core deposits, ROA and ROE.","Our revenue diversification is highlighted on slide 4. A 50-50 split between spread revenue and fee revenue from our diversified businesses and cross-sell activities. Trust and investment fees were once again our largest fee category and it has been for the past five quarters. We achieved positive momentum across many of our businesses which I'll highlight throughout the call.","Let me start by highlighting some of the key drivers of our second quarter results from the balance sheet and income statement perspective. On page 5, you can see we had good balance sheet growth this quarter growing loans, deposits and securities. I'll provide more detail on the securities we purchased later on the call. The decline in our provision expense this quarter reflected improvement in home prices and our overall credit performance.","Turning to the income statement on page 6, mortgage revenue was stable in the quarter and revenue growth was driven by stronger trust and investment fees and higher net interest income. Our expenses declined as we expected primarily reflecting seasonally lower employee benefit costs.","Let me now cover our business drivers in more detail. As shown on page 7, we continued to have solid loan growth with period end loans up $26.8 billion or 3% from the year ago and up $2 billion from the first quarter. Loans grew even after the continued run off of our liquidating portfolio. This portfolio has declined by over 50% since 2008 and the headwind to overall loan growth caused by this run-off has continued to slow. ","In the second quarter, the liquidating portfolio declined $15.5 billion from a year ago and $3.2 billion from the first quarter. Excluding these liquidating loans, our core loan portfolio grew by $42.3 billion or 6% from a year ago and was up $5.2 billion from the first quarter.","Commercial loans grew $1.8 billion in the quarter with board-based growth in C&I and foreign loans. Consumer loans grew $250 million with growth in nonconforming first mortgage loans, auto and credit card, partially offset by the expected run-off from liquidating and core home equity portfolios.","Deposit growth remained strong with period end deposits up $10.9 billion from the first quarter. Average deposits were up $23.6 billion from the first quarter and up $85.8 billion or 9% from the year ago. Average core checking and savings deposits were up 8% from a year ago. We grew our primary consumer checking customers by a net 3.5% from a year ago, up 2.1% from last quarter. These are active checking account customers who transact with Wells Fargo regularly.","The growth we've achieved with these relationship-based customers demonstrate the strength of our deposit franchise and should generate future growth as we focus on remaining their primary bank and meeting more of their financial needs. We continued to lower our deposit costs with average deposit costs of 14 basis points in the second quarter, down 1 basis point from the first quarter and down 5 basis points from the year ago. We've successfully grown deposits while reducing our deposit costs for 10 consecutive quarters.","As shown on page 9, we grew tax-equivalent net interest income by 3% from the first quarter. The growth in NII was driven by securities purchases, lower funding costs, loan growth, higher variable income as well as the benefit from an extra day in the quarter. Average earning assets grew $31.1 billion from the first quarter, reflecting increases in short-term investments, loans and AFS securities. We purchased $21 billion of AFS securities during the second quarter, primarily agency MBS, and we purchased an additional $6 billion of securities in the first two weeks of the third quarter.","We remained disciplined during periods of lower rates and we were prepared to deploy liquidity as rates rose. We benefitted from this disciplined approach in the second quarter by investing in higher yield and securities. While higher rates driven by an improving economy will be positive to our results over the long term, including higher yielding earning asset growth and improving credit quality, there are also some short-term effects such as lower mortgage refi volume and reduced OCI that I'll highlight throughout the call.","Higher rates impact our businesses in different ways and in different times, which reinforces the benefit of our diversified model. Our net interest margin declined by 2 basis points from the first quarter to 3.46%. This decline was driven by three primary factors. First, our continued deposit growth caused cash and short-term investments to increase reducing the margin by 6 basis points.","As I've highlighted in the past our deposit growth has little impact on net interest income but it is dilutive to the net interest margin. Offsetting this decline by 2 basis points was higher variable income including higher PCI loan resolutions and periodic dividends. This variable income is obviously lumpy and can increase or decrease in any quarter.","Finally, the net impact of re-pricing and balance sheet growth improved the margin by 2 basis points largely due to the benefit of the growth in the AFS portfolio and reduced funding costs. While margin was relatively stable this quarter, it is still reasonable to expect continued net interest margin pressure.","Despite a decline in total fee income in the quarter, many of our businesses demonstrated strong momentum including deposit service charges up $34 million from the first quarter benefitting from seasonality and account growth. Trust and investment fees up $292 million on strong investment banking fees and higher retail brokerage asset based fees. Card fees grew 75 million on credit and debit card account growth and higher purchase volume. Commercial real estate brokerage commissions grew $28 million with strong activity for both private and public deals.","Overall, noninterest income was down slightly from the first quarter on lower gains from deferred compensation plan investment income which is P&L neutral, weaker customer accommodation trading and lower fees including the lower gain on the sale of the PCI loans.","Our mortgage business continued to generate strong results in the second quarter with revenue up modestly from the first quarter as highlighted on page 11. Mortgage originations were $112 billion, our seventh consecutive quarter of more than a $100 billion in originations reflecting the benefit of the housing market improvement and low interest rates. As rates rose late in the quarter, applications for home purchases remained strong but refi application volumes declined as expected.","We still had a relatively large unclosed pipeline at the end of the quarter but refi volume is obviously very sensitive to rates. Refis were 56% of originations in the second quarter, down from 69% in the first quarter. We managed through many refi cycles in the past and we will adjust the size of our business based on production volumes through this cycle. Gain on sales margins declined to 2.21% and with the increase in mortgage rates, we would expect further declines in our margins and originations.","Expenses declined from seasonally high first quarter levels as shown on page 12. This decline was driven by a 4% reduction in personnel expenses reflecting lower employee benefit expenses due to the first quarter seasonally high payroll taxes and 401(k) matching. These declines were partially offset by higher salaries reflecting annual merit increases and higher revenue-based incentive compensation expense from strong results in capital markets, WBR and mortgage.","We also had increases in other expense categories primarily driven by our continued investment in our business to drive future growth, including project spending for product improvement and system enhancements, higher advertising and promotion expense driven by seasonality and a new campaign launched in the second quarter.","Operating losses increased $131 million in the second quarter, primarily from litigation accruals related to various legal matters and we also experienced increased costs associated with regulatory and compliance requirements. Our focus on reducing expenses while investing in our businesses to generate revenue growth is reflected in our efficiency ratio declining to 57.3% in the second quarter. We expect our efficiency ratio to remain within our target range of 55% to 59%.","As John mentioned at the start of the call, the recovery in the housing market is driving significant improvement in a number of areas, including some of our environmentally elevated costs. As highlighted on page 13, in the second quarter, most of these costs were significantly below what they had been over the past few years.","We got a nominal amount of cost associated with the independent foreclosure review this quarter of customer call volumes following the distribution of remediation checks. The improvement in real estate values helped to reduce foreclosed asset expenses by $49 million compared to the first quarter and by $143 million from a year ago. Mortgage revenue this quarter was reduced by $25 million for additions to our repurchase reserve not related to card originations which is the lowest build we\u2019ve had since prior to 2008.","Outstanding and purchase demands were relatively stable compared with the first quarter and new demands emerged consistent with our expectations. However not all elevated costs are behind us. Mortgage revenue is reduced by $82 million to reflect higher servicing and foreclosure costs as foreclosure timelines continue to extend especially in judicial foreclosure states.","Turning to our segment results starting at page 14, community banking earned $3.2 billion in the second quarter up 28% from a year ago and up 11% from the first quarter. Retail banking achieved a record cross-sell of 6.14 products per household up from 6 products a year ago. To support sales and household growth we grew platform bank or FTE by approximately 1,900 from a year ago.","Our credit card business continued to have strong account growth with the record 594,000 new accounts in the second quarter, up 16% from a year ago. Our household penetration increased to 35%, up from 31% a year ago. Credit card balances were up 3% from the first quarter and up 9% from a year ago due to strong transaction volumes and account growth.","We also had momentum in our auto business with record originations in the second quarter of $7.1 billion up 4% from the first quarter and up 9% from a year ago. Our continued focus on serving our small business customers generated a 2.7% growth in business checking accounts from a year ago and we extended $9.3 billion of new loan commitments to small business customers during the first half of the year up 25% from a year ago.","Wholesale banking earned $2 billion in the second quarter up 7% from a year ago and down $41 million from the first quarter. Wholesale banking generated record revenue of $6.1 billion. Investment banking fee growth was strong driven by higher equity underwriting, credit originations and loan syndication fees. Investment banking results included a 34% increase in the year-to-date revenue from commercial and corporate customers. This relationship focus also benefited treasury management as revenue grew 12% from a year ago benefiting from better penetration of our existing customers.","Wholesale banking\u2019s cross-sell reached 6.9 products per relationship up from 6.8 a year ago. Wholesale banking results continue to benefit from steady loan growth with loans having grown for a 11 consecutive quarters. The average loans increased 6% from a year ago with growth nearly all portfolios including asset back finance, capital finance, commercial banking, commercial real estate, corporate banking and government and institutional banking. Credit quality remained strong with net recoveries in the second quarter reflecting the improvement in our economy and our risk in underwriting discipline.","Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement earned a record $434 million, up 27% from a year ago and up 29% from the first quarter reflecting the success of our core business strategy of growing asset based relationships and the benefit from the improvement in the markets. Revenue grew 10% from a year ago reflecting strong growth in asset based fees and higher brokerage transaction revenue.","Retail, brokerage, managed account assets reached the record $331 billion, up 19% from a year ago driven by strong net flows and market performance. WBR had strong loan growth with average loans up 4% from the first quarter driven by non-conforming mortgages. WBR continued to effectively partner with retail banking to meet the financial needs of our customers, increasing cross-sell to 10.3 products per household. Assets referred from community banking to WBR grew over 25% from a year ago based on first quarter results. This partnership is a great example of how our businesses work together to meet the financial needs of our customers.","Turning to credit quality on Page 17, we had continued improvement across our commercial and consumer portfolios. Second quarter net charge-offs declined to 58 basis points of average loans. Losses in our commercial portfolio were only $44 million or 5 basis points of average loans. Consumer losses declined to 101 basis points. We had especially strong improvement in our commercial and residential real estate portfolios. These portfolios are now providing a tailwind for our credit performance compared to the headwind they provided when the real estate market was weaker.","Reflecting these improvements our provision expense declined $567 million from the first quarter and included $500 million in reserve releases, compared with the release of $200 million in the first quarter and $400 million from a year ago. We continue to expect further reserve releases absent a significant deterioration in the economic environment and while we don\u2019t know what our release will be in the third quarter the favorable condition to grow this release for this quarter have not dissipated.","The recovery in the housing market also benefited our expected losses in the PCI portfolio. This quarter the accretable yield balance increased by a net $2.1 billion which included $1.6 billion increase in expected cash flows and $876 million reclassification primarily from our pick-pay portfolio. This re-class did not impact second quarter results but will be accreted into income over the remaining life of these loans.","In addition to lower charge-offs and provision expense non-performing asset also improved with MPAs down $1.8 million from the first quarter and down $3.8 billion or 15% from a year ago. Loans 90 days or more passed due decreased $206 million from the first quarter and were down 15% from a year ago with improvement in both commercial and consumer loans. Early stage consumer loan delinquency balances and rates also declined from the first quarter and from a year ago.","Earnings are the primary driver of capital growth for Wells Fargo. As shown on Page 19, our Tier 1 common equity ratio included 10.73%, up 34 basis points from last quarter. Our estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio under Basel 3 which reflects our interpretation over Basel 3 capital rules adopted July 2, increased to 8.54% in the second quarter. OCI negatively impacted the ratio by 24 basis points in the quarter due to the increase in interest rates. Because of our strong earnings growth we grew capital even with the impact on the increasing rates. We expect reductions to unrealized securities gains when rates rise and this is one reason why as we discussed over a year-ago we're targeting a capital buffer of approximately 100 basis points.","And just this week, as John mentioned the U.S. regulatory agencies issued a supplemental leverage ratio of proposal. Based on our initial review we believe our current levels -- leverage levels would exceed the well capitalized requirements at both the bank and holding company. We increased our second quarter dividend to $0.30 per share a 20% increase over the first quarter dividend and purchased 26.7 million shares in the second quarter and executed a $500 million forward contract that is expected to settle in the third quarter for approximately 13 million shares.","Including the shares under the forward contract, our share count would have been relatively flat for the quarter offsetting 40 million shares issued during the quarter primarily related to profit sharing and match contributions to 401(NYSE:K) plans and team members exercising option. With many opportunities to generate growth at Wells Fargo on Slide 20 we summarized the demonstrative momentum we have throughout our businesses that I\u2019ve highlighted on the call. In each of our businesses we have opportunities for growth reflecting the expanding needs of our customers. This customer account and balance growth along with increased cross-sell with help drive our future results and reflects the benefits of our diversified model.","In summary we had a very good quarter with strong broad based improvement and demonstrative momentum across many of our businesses. This included growth in loans, deposits, net interest income and fee growth across many of our businesses. We reduced expenses and benefited from a continued improvement in credit quality that reflected our conservative underwriting and the strengthening economy especially the rebound in housing. Our ROA and ROE continue to grow and we grew capital levels while returning more capital to shareholders.","We will now open up the call for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator instructions). Our first question will come from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Hi, good morning.","John G. Stumpf","Good morning, John.","Timothy J. Sloan","Morning.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Tim, just a question on liquidity. Could you tell us where you are on the liquidity coverage ratio relative to your understanding of what will be required of you in the new regulatory rules?","Timothy J. Sloan","Yeah. John, it's a good question. One of the challenges is that the rules haven't been finalized and similar to the Basel III capital rules from the point that which they were originally proposed to where they were finalized, there was a fair amount of discussion in change. I would tell you that we have adequate capital to operate Wells Fargo. Having said that, we are going to continue to work with the regulators in terms of those interpretations. There may be some incremental amount of liquidities that we need to raise, but we certainly \u2013 it's certainly that we are focused on because liquidity risk is a key risk for the company. But given over $1 trillion of deposits we have and given the experience we have in terms of operating in different environments, again we think we've got adequate liquidity. We may need to raise a little bit more but it shouldn't be material for the company.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. So it's a factor in \u2013 as you think about the pace at which you look for your cash, you mentioned buying some securities here today. Is that a factor in how you think about deploying your liquidity?","Timothy J. Sloan","No, it's not a big factor at all, John. Again, to me it's much more important to think about the liquidity needs for operating the business as it relates to how much we want to invest in securities because the first call for any of our liquidity has always got to be to our customers in terms of loan demand. But it's not a primary driver in terms of the pace of activity. The primary driver in terms of the pace of our investment activity has been there over the last year. We've been in this very low rate environment and turned the clock back a year ago, we had a lot of excess liquidity, there was a lot of concern that we were going to be in low rates for a while and there was a view that we weren't investing fast enough. We wanted to stay disciplined then. That was the primary driver. Just like today, one of the primary drivers for why we're investing more in our securities portfolio is because we think given the rate back up, the returns are much more attractive.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Yeah. And we did see a benefit there in the degree of net interest margin compression, but you still have an expectation for some continued margin compression. What are the drivers there, Tim? And then in terms of NII dollars, do you still expect to grow the NII dollars from the current level?","Timothy J. Sloan","Okay. So on the net interest margin, I don't think the drivers have really changed that much. As you recall, if you look at our net interest margin decline, which we've had one over the last year 14 quarters, the primary driver for the decline has been the fact that we've been growing deposits which long-term \u2013 for the company, financing that. Within a quarter, we can have some variability based upon the variable income which was positive this quarter but last quarter was negative. The balance sheet continues to re-price a bit. So the factors really haven't changed because we haven't gotten to a point that the balance sheet has completely re-priced. So we could continue to see some continued compression in the net interest margin. The underlying factors really haven't changed. In terms of net interest income and our goal is to grow net interest income over time. What happens in a quarter-by-quarter basis I just don't know for sure because there's a lot of factors. We had a lot of positive factors that drove our net interest income this quarter which I think was absolutely terrific. Again, I don't know if that means we're going to grow net interest income in the third quarter, but over time I believe that we can grow net interest income and this quarter I think we've demonstrated our ability to do that.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. And switching gears over to the mortgage revenues, the gain on sale margin of the 221 you mentioned hold up better than expected. What were the factors there? And is there any framing you can do for us on how much pressure that market could experience as you move to the next several quarters?","Timothy J. Sloan","Yeah, John, I think that's a very fair observation and candidly I think the mortgage sale margin has held up better not just for the last quarter but for the last year than I think anybody in the business or in industry would have expected. That said, it has come down and it came down over 30 basis points in the quarter. And our best guess is that we are seeing pressure in the gain on sale margin and the gain on sale margin has significantly declined. Recall that last quarter we framed the gain on sale margin variability over last few years if you annualize it, the low end was 160 and the high end again on an annualized basis was 220. We've been at the high end. We think we're going to start to move down from there. So I think there is going to be pressure. I do not believe you're going to see a 2.21% gain on sale margin, I think it's more likely to be lower. But again, it's really a function of the competitive environment which we think has been very rational as we've gone through this cycle as well as the rate environment. Recall that our best guess in the second quarter was that originations were going to be a little bit lower than the first quarter but in fact originations were up in the second quarter because rates stayed low for a longer period of time. Rates are now up and that's going to affect originations for sure. So there's a lot of variability but to put it very bluntly we think that the gain on sale margin is going to decline and it will decline somewhere in the range of what we've seen over the last few years, but it is going to decline.","John G. Stumpf","But John as you know and Tim's absolutely right, it will decline and margins will be under some pressure but we have this wonderfully balanced business within the business. In other words when rates increase, refis drop, margins come in because there's more competition but then you have a servicing portfolio and that does better. So there's balance within this business and there's also a flush down in the broad distribution and diversity within the company. So some businesses do better, some do not as well when rates rise.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. Thanks, John. Tim, one follow-up on that. Could you remind us of the mechanics by which the higher servicing income can work its way through the income statement and why didn't \u2013 it didn't seem like we saw any of that start this quarter with the big move into 10-year. What will trigger kind of offsetting balance on the servicing side where the income then will see that start to rise?","Timothy J. Sloan","Yeah, John points out over time I think that there is some balance in the business on the revenue side because of the fact that servicing income tends to be a little bit less volatile. We should see some benefit in terms of servicing income increasing as the housing industry continues to improve. As we pointed out, we did reduce the value of this servicing for some elongation of some foreclosure timelines. Over time that will dissipate. And then we'll continue to get the carry in the underlying servicing income. Our hedge ratio is pretty high, so it's not like we're vetting the farm on or the stagecoach on an increase in rates in the servicing portfolio. We'll see some benefit there, but I think it's also really important to remember that there will also be some expense trade-offs in the mortgage business itself. If it turns out that originations are down, then it's immediately in the quarter if you get a benefit from the revenue-based compensation, the commissions coming down and then to the extent that that volume continues, then you also make adjustments that tend to be on a lag basis, on a quarterly basis in terms of some of your other expenses.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Are you starting to make those adjustments based on what you're seeing in the pipeline and the outlook given rates?","Timothy J. Sloan","John, we're making adjustments all the time. The fact of the matter is we entered the quarter with actually a pretty strong pipeline of $63 billion which was only down 10%, 15% from the end of the quarter. But there's no question that to the extent that we continue to see a decline in the pipeline that we will make adjustments. And so you can assume that we will begin to make some of those adjustments this quarter.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Got it, okay. Thanks.","Timothy J. Sloan","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Erika Penala with Bank of America.","Erika Penala - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning.","John G. Stumpf","Good morning, Erika.","Erika Penala - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","My first question is a follow-up to John's last. We heard another mega bank today say that if loan rates stay where they are that the mortgage market could shrink to 30% or 40% in the second half of the year. Do you agree with that statement for your company, given what you\u2019re seeing in purchase trends? And additionally, could you quantify if that number is correct? How much of the expenses can come up proportionate to that 30% to 40% decline?","Timothy J. Sloan","Yeah, it\u2019s a fair question. I don\u2019t think anybody really knows what the volumes in the mortgage business are going to be. I think one of the challenges for anybody in making that estimate today is that the complexion of the originations is really changing. When you look at the percentage of refi volume versus purchase money volume that we had in the first quarter of this year for example, it was about 1\/3 purchase money and about 2\/3s refi volume.","As the housing industry continues to improve and as we\u2019ve got it \u2013 went into the spring selling season, you saw that mix shift in sales was more like 55, 44, 45 or whatever and what that means is that a larger portion of your originations are coming from the purchase portion of the business. So, I think it is a fact that refinance volume is certainly very much impacted by rates, but also we\u2019re seeing now rates at the long end start to come down 10 basis points just in the last few days and so we don\u2019t think \u2013 we don\u2019t know for sure where volume is going to be. We believe it's going to be lower in this quarter and one of the things that we\u2019ve learned in the mortgage business is, it's probably not a good thing to think, six months out or nine months out because there can be so much variability.","We think volumes going to be down, but whether it\u2019s going to be 30% to 40%, I just don\u2019t know. As it relates to expenses, again, the timeline generally is that the revenue based compensation declined immediately and then to the extent we have a continued origination reduction, then you bring \u2013 you start to reduce some of your expenses that tends to occur on a lag quarter basis. But at the end of the day we still believe that we can continue to have good margins in the business and to keep the efficiency ratio above where it is, because also remember that one of the other important things that\u2019s going out into business, if you got an improvement in the underlying housing industry so that your environmental related costs hopefully will coming down including foreclosures at the same time.","John G. Stumpf","One of the thing that \u2013 I know that we should not forget now we went through this a lot \u2013 many times, but we have 6,200 stores, 30,000 or 40,000 personal bankers that refer business in, so when rates rise and its more of a purchase money business we have all folks on deck helping serve customers. And we still have tons of our customers who are interested in buying homes and moving and so forth who are our customers, but do their mortgage business in other places. So we have still lot of opportunity to capture purchase money business, which is still not at the levels it was, pre-prices. So, there is lots of activity going on there. Surely, the refinance volume is going to come down significantly, if rates continue to stay at high. But as Tim mentioned, I don\u2019t know what rates will be. 90 days ago we wouldn\u2019t have talked about what we\u2019re talking about today. Things change very quickly in this business.","Timothy J. Sloan","Yes, Erika, let me reinforce again. As you think about the third quarter, and you think about the volume that we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years, we\u2019ve been very fortunate to see quarters in which volume is been above the $100 billion. We just don\u2019t think that we\u2019re going to see $100 billion in mortgage volume, given the current rates today in the third quarter.","Erika Penala - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Speaking of how Wells benefit as housing recovers, I know that you\u2019re frustrated by the obsession on your margin. But as I think about slide 26 in your deck, it seems like you have $876 million of reclassification to accretable yield and $1.6 billion of additional expected cash flows that could be helpful to your margin over time. Should we think of the pick-a-pay portfolio similar to how we think about reserve relief for the entire company in that as housing gets better, you could release some of the markets into net interest income which would benefit or alleviate some of the concerns on margin.","Timothy J. Sloan","There is no question that, that the key drivers for the improvement in the \u2013 or the reclassification or housing prices as well as the underlying credit performance within that portfolio and those are very similar to the drivers for the improvement that we\u2019ve seen in our first mortgage portfolio and our home equity portfolios.","In terms of the impact, I\u2019d love to tell you that when \u2013 if you re-class the 876, we get an immediate impact, that\u2019s not the way it works. It occurs over the life of the loan. There will be some positive impact and you\u2019ve seen that and I\u2019m hopeful if the current trends continue, and this isn\u2019t the last time that we seen a reclassification, I can\u2019t promise you that it's going to be the case. But it will provide some positive benefit over time. But again, we\u2019ve got to make sure that we put it in the right context because our best estimate is the weighted life of that portfolio is still about 14 years.","Erika Penala - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Got it. And just, if I could sneak one more in, just a clarification follow-up to John\u2019s question on the LCR. Your cash balances keep growing, but in other calls you\u2019ve mentioned that you have \u2013 something like $50 billion of excess cash. Is that true still, relative to how we should think about Basel III LCR compliance? And I guess, if the main message is potentially the cash back until continue to build from here?","Timothy J. Sloan","Yeah, I think that the challenge we all have including where we\u2019re in terms of the liquidity coverage ratio is the rules haven\u2019t been finalized. If you would tell me what the final rules are, then I could tell you whether or not we\u2019re too much or not enough for the write or whatever. What I do know is that we believe that we have additional ability based on how we\u2019re running Wells Fargo based on our interpretations of the LCR to invest some of our liquidity in securities, but more importantly we have it ready for our customers when they want to borrow money. That doesn\u2019t mean that we made \u2013 now that raise liquidity, when some of the rules are finalized. But we don\u2019t believe and we believe that, that\u2019s possible to do without a significant impact or material impact in terms of running the company. But again, I think it will be premature to conclude what the final rules like \u2013 look like because they haven\u2019t been finalized.","Erika Penala - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.","Timothy J. Sloan","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","Good morning.","John G. Stumpf","Good morning, Matt.","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","Hopefully just a couple of quick ones here. You mentioned the trust investment fees, good strength in both the brokerage and investment banking, which of course you now split out. On the broker side, is that just the higher market levels or are you seeing some inflows there as well? I did notice that the deposits in that segment were down a couple of billion, so I\u2019m just wondering if there is some flows coming into the brokerage area?","Timothy J. Sloan","Well I think it\u2019s all the above, Matt. There is no question that we\u2019ve been benefited as everybody in the industry has been benefited by the improving market, the improving equity markets and the fact that retail investors want to be part of that business. We did see some movement from deposits to investing in the market. We think that\u2019s a good thing. We\u2019ve been waiting for that for a while, but we also grew our customer levels too.","John G. Stumpf","And Matt the other thing, this is a big emphasis for the Company. David Carroll and his great team are working with Carrie Tolstedt and her team and Dave Hoyt and within the company this is a one Wells Fargo working together. So not only the markets help us, we\u2019re also putting a big emphasis on this. We think it\u2019s a big growth opportunity for this Company.","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","And then, just separately on the mortgage servicing rights, I know you\u2019ve talked about potentially testing the waters to sell and sorry if I missed it, but did you sell any this quarter and thoughts going forward in terms of potentially selling them. I would think they\u2019re worth a little bit more now than two months ago?","Timothy J. Sloan","We hope that\u2019s the case Matt. I think that as you know we entered into a transaction to sell our \u2013 a portion of our reversed mortgage portfolio in the first quarter. We didn\u2019t have any sales of MSRs this quarter. But we will continue to look at selling MSRs, we think that\u2019s prudent risk management that the primary driver for doing that is not because we feel like there is pressure as it relates to capital. But I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we moved forward and executed a sale of MSRs this quarter and next.","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","Okay. That's it for me. Thank you.","John G. Stumpf","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of R. Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill.","John G. Stumpf","Hi, Scott.","Timothy J. Sloan","Hi, Scott.","R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill","Good morning. John, I guess I was just hoping you could expand kind of generally on the comments you made in your prep remarks early on about the housing market. I guess what I'm thinking about is high rates impact affordability but you certainly seem pretty optimistic about the prospects for the housing market and continued improvement. So what trends are you seeing generally, particularly I guess most recently just since you guys see so much of the mortgage and customarily the housing market that makes you keep this sustained optimism?","John G. Stumpf","Sure. So first of all, I think I had mentioned before that we look at 400 or so MSAs, Metropolitan Statistical Areas, and we have a unique and pretty grounded way of seeing real estate across the country. And the deal, it's better everywhere or going on \u2013 in some cases two years surely in the past year and it's been stronger in some places than even probably we had expected. Some of the states that were hardest hit, Nevada, Florida, Arizona, California, are showing huge or very large price appreciation kinds of numbers. Also if you look at \u2013 and yes, rates have gone up but if you were in the mortgage market before 2000, you know that these are unbelievably good rates. My first mortgage was at 8.5%, my second one was 11.5% and I thought those were great rates at the time. So affordability still is there, household formation continued to happen in the last four or five years where people weren't buying, so there's a lot of pent-up demand. The three important issues to a home purchase what you make, what the house costs and what's the financing costs? One of those is still close to 40, 50-year record lows compared to rental. Owning a home makes economic sense. It surely depends on where you want to live and how long you want to live there and so forth. So there is just strength there. And it improves customer confidence. The thing I hear most about when I'm out in the marketplace is the lack of inventory. So we are expecting that prices will continue to improve, probably not at the level they have in the past but housing sure has strength to it. So I don't know what's going to happen to rates all the time but when housing improves, it's good for Americans, it's good for competence and which in turn is good for the financial services industry and Wells Fargo.","R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill","All right, I appreciate the color. And then I guess, Tim, sort of along the same lines. You're consumer credit improvement, I guess we kind of knew would improve. I think the magnitude was probably a little better than I would have anticipated. If we were to say stay at this sort of level of housing, I mean is there a point where you need continued improvement to impact the sustainability of such strong consumer trends or are we there yet or how are you thinking about that dynamic?","Timothy J. Sloan","Yeah, I think it's a fair question, Scott. The underlying trends that in fact John referred to are still improved. And so it's hard to imagine improvement not continuing. Whether it continues to improve at the same rate, I don't know. I think we've continued to be surprised by how housing has positively impacted our results. I think also it's important to remember that particularly when you think about the reserve release that there were some overwriting factors that impacted the reserve release over the last few quarters including the fact that we had the OCC guidance that impacted the third and fourth quarters of last year and also the potential for the impact from the damage of Hurricane Sandy that's been working its way through the system. But again, I think the fundamentals for housing are strong. We have a large first mortgage and second mortgage portfolio that tends to be the portfolio where we have the disproportionate share of our losses even though they improved, the consumer losses improved just a touch over 1% this quarter. So we're feeling pretty good about the improvement.","John G. Stumpf","Scott, I'll just add one more thing. Housing is uniquely different than any other consumer asset class. When housing improves, people feel better. I mean two-thirds of Americans or so own a home. When housing improves, it improves the confidence. People spend more. The multiplier effect on buying washers and dryers and other consumer goods is just \u2013 it's just very special around housing. So when housing gets better, it really lifts all [bolts] on the consumer side.","R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill","Okay. Well, guys, I definitely appreciate the help. Thank you.","Timothy J. Sloan","Thank you, Scott.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","John G. Stumpf","Hi. Good morning.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company","First question, Tim, that other income line that you talk about the equity method and less PCI loan sale gains, that lines up into 450 million to 500 million for the last several years. Is there anything particular that happened this quarter and is there anything that would prevent it from kind of going back to that more normal run rate?","Timothy J. Sloan","Yeah, good question. It's really not what happened, it's what didn't happen this quarter. The comparison in the first quarter and the primary drivers for the decline were \u2013 we had an equity investment that we accounted for under the equity method and as you know, when those appreciate in value as opposed to the cost method you have to go ahead and write up the value, which we did in the first quarter. Just so you know, we actually sold that equity investment so we got the cash in the second quarter. Then secondarily we had $151 million gain which we had called out in the first quarter from the sale of some PCI loans that again were in the first quarter that we just didn't have in the second quarter. So I think it's more of what was missing in the second quarter than what occurred. So I don't know what's going to happen in the third quarter but I think if you look over a long period of time, the income from that line item being as low as it has been is not typical.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company","Right, okay. And then secondly, the share count again was up and you guys had talked about that we might be getting towards the point where we finally start to see it reduce and I'm just wondering, are we at that point and what needs to happen just with the [mix] to finally start getting the share count down?","Timothy J. Sloan","We were almost at that point this quarter. That's one of the reasons why I called out the fact that the timing of the settlement from a structured sale had that occurred in the second quarter and it's going to occur relatively early in the third quarter, we would have been about flat. Notwithstanding the second quarter tends to be a quarter in which there's more share issuance as we called out. I don't know exactly what's going to happen but my guess is that we're very close to the point at which we will start to see share reductions.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company","Okay. And then on the mortgage business, the pipeline was down but you guys had mentioned last quarter that your closing times had gone down from 90 to 60. I'm just wondering how much of a market share opportunity is this, because it doesn't sound like you've really cut capacity yet. So could you just walk us through originations versus pipeline and how much more you're actually just pumping through the channel regardless of what's happening with the overall origination volumes in the marketplace?","Timothy J. Sloan","Yeah. Well, one of the reasons why we haven't made a lot of changes in terms of underlying business is that the increase in the rates only happened a few weeks ago and we had a large pipeline that we were working through. As you saw originations in the second quarter were a lot stronger than I think anyone would have imagined. So I think that's going to naturally begin to change because even through $64 billion is a great place to start, it's definite $63 million, it's definitely less than $79 million. And so our guess is that volume and originations will be under the $100 billion mark and we\u2019ll need to go ahead and make some adjustments, but again I think the competitive atmosphere is really fierce, but it's very rational.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company","Okay and my last question Tim, with regard to your favorite slide. Your big delta in provision this quarter and you\u2019re talking about the mortgage banking revenue now is starting to turn from here. So, I know it's hard to say in any given quarter if you could actually be able to grow EPS a quarter ahead, but can you just talk us through again it's hard to see the provision much more and we know that mortgage is kind of tailing. So what do you expect to be the biggest drivers out of the net maybe the other income reverting back up to kind of continue to get that net income moving the right way.","Timothy J. Sloan","Yeah, it's a very fair quarter given the potential decline in mortgage revenues but again let\u2019s make sure we put that in perspective. Mortgage revenues are a little over 10% of our total revenues for the company, that\u2019s number one. Number two, when you look at the breadth of the growth in the company in terms of net interest income growth you saw loan growth, you saw us take advantage of the fact that given the right back up we will invest it more in securities. We haven't invested this much in securities in a long time right even when that we say the backup in the first quarter. When you look at the non-interest or the fee revenues really across the board we saw growth with the exception of some of those areas that were affected by the back up in rates so there\u2019s a good story there. I don\u2019t necessarily think this is the end of the improvement in credit because the factors continue to -- that are driving the improvement in credit haven't bottomed down. And then I think it's likely that we\u2019ll continue to see some improvement in expenses. So when you put it all together, I don\u2019t think it's just one time if it was I\u2019d tell you and you could decide whether or not it would make sense, but the good news for us because of our diversified model we don\u2019t have to rely upon one or two specific areas to be able to make up because make up or decline in any business we\u2019ve seen declines in some of our businesses each quarter now for the last 14 quarters and we still have been able to grow whether or not we can do it in the third quarter I can\u2019t promise you that, but I sure do like our chances to continue to grow earnings over time.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company","Got it.","John G. Stumpf","Tim is absolutely right in that, I mean we are actually focused around here on growth, and it comes from our basic operating philosophy around helping customers succeed financially. And when you\u2019re in 90 different businesses as Tim mentioned not every quarter would be a complete offset to one other one, but over time we believe we have the right business model, the right leaders, the right markets to continue to grow this company and we sure like our chances on that.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company","Thank you very much guys.","Timothy J. Sloan","Thank you.","John G. Stumpf","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Paul Miller with FBR.","John G. Stumpf","Hi, Paul.","Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets","Thank you very much. How you guys doing? Just one follow-up question on the MSRs, you talked about you could see some sales; would these be material sales in MSRs I mean what level of MSRs would you like to hold?","Timothy J. Sloan","We\u2019re very comfortable with the level of MSR that we have today. Having said that from a risk management standpoint it's prudent to investigate the sale of any of the assets that you have on the books, whether it's MSRs or otherwise. I think to the extent that we would move forward to sell MSRs we would focus on those MSRs that tend to be to a customer that only has one product that mortgage that we service with the company; that would be where the primary focus would be. I don\u2019t necessarily think it would material because we don\u2019t think we have to do it, but it sure does make sense given the volatility in interest rates to look at all your assets and make sure that you know how to and can execute on sales before you\u2019d ever get to a position that you would have to do it.","John G. Stumpf","Yeah Paul think of it this way, I wouldn\u2019t make more of this than it is, I mean we have a very large and important servicing business. We love that business from time-to-time opportunistically we\u2019ll sell something and reposition, but we like the bounce and we like that business a whole lot.","Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets","And then on the credit side, I believe your reserve ratio is down around 2%. What do you think you can take that down to with your improvement in credit and improvement in HPI?","Timothy J. Sloan","We don\u2019t have a target, it's a fair question but we don\u2019t have a target, it was 2.01% at the end of the quarter. It's going to be what it's going to be based upon the improvement in the underlying credit trends. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it was below 2% the next quarter I mean that\u2019s a possibility. It could be a little bit higher, it could be a little bit lower, but there\u2019s not a specific target that we have because it's really just the results of their underlying credit performance.","Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets","Okay. Hey, guys thank you very much.","John G. Stumpf","Thank you.","Timothy J. Sloan","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets.","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks, good morning guys and congrats on a solid quarter.","John G. Stumpf","Thank you, Joe.","Timothy J. Sloan","Thanks, Joe.","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets","I guess as you mentioned that the economic data continues to improve with last weeks employment report and the strengthening housing recovery and while you talked about a multiplayer effect, are you seeing much of a pick-up in activity yet at the customer level as well and when might we see this translate into stronger loan growth particularly on the commercial side.","Timothy J. Sloan","Yeah, the primary area\u2019s that we\u2019re seeing and take a hold is on the consumer side. You saw our consumer loans, again we need to back out the impact of the liquidating portfolio but we saw auto growth, we saw credit card growth which was very nice. We\u2019re continuing to see growth in terms of this household formation that\u2019s out there and that allows us to continue to grow deposits, so all those are good trends. There\u2019s no question there\u2019s going to be a bit of a lag effect as it relates to stronger commercial loan growth. Our commercial loan growth again has been pretty strong, which is now the I think the 10th consecutive quarter that we -- wholesale in total has grown and certainly in certain segments and industries within the wholesale portfolio we\u2019re seeing some good growth, but my guess again it will be a quarter or so before we start to see a big pick-up.","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets","So you\u2019re not really seeing customers draw down cash at or really make more investments.","Timothy J. Sloan","No. I wish they were but unfortunately not. When you look at line usage in the commercial side it's been pretty stagnant for that.","John G. Stumpf","And you\u2019re right Joe, that happens first. Yes \u2013 that\u2019s typically the first thing that happens.","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets","And then just on investment banking revenue is up strong from the first quarter. Can you just talk a little bit more about the drivers there and maybe if you could just give an update on the business in general and how it's progressing in market share gains and things like that?","Timothy J. Sloan","Yeah overall the business is performing very well, the primary drivers for the growth wasn\u2019t necessarily in any one specific product type within the business and it was very, very much focused on our existing customer base. The fees were up 40% year-over-year, most of that again was with our existing commercial and corporate customers. I think our market share at the end of the quarter ended up at about 5.8% which was fine. We\u2019re not running that business for any sort of market share, we\u2019re running that business to be able to be there for our customers when they need us and when you look at the growth in the business and the fact that it's primarily focused on those customers it's performing quite well.","John G. Stumpf","Yeah, Joe to add something to that, I make a lot of calls in that area on behalf of our team, and these are existing customers for the most part. They appreciate the skill set and the abilities we have in that business especially if we partner with our retail distribution platform. So we make a compelling offer and our long-term customers appreciate that added service that we have for them.","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Thanks very much.","Timothy J. Sloan","Thanks, Joe.","John G. Stumpf","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Michael Mayo - CLSA","Hi.","John G. Stumpf","Hi, Mike.","Timothy J. Sloan","Good morning, Mike.","Michael Mayo - CLSA","I am trying to get just a real simple answer and that is, I heard what you said John about the improving housing market and that was helpful, but the question is; are the benefits in the improving housing market already in the numbers of Wells Fargo and my Column A based on what you said are some headwinds the origination pipeline down 10% to 15% repurchase reserves are all pretty low gain on sale going down and the Column B or perhaps in tailwinds, expenses perhaps going down from the workout costs, in the mortgage platform, the MSRs and the credit. So which is greater; Column A or Column B? And John, in your opening remarks, you said, well, benefits \u2013 your grammatical tense was the present tense and I think Tim at one point said Well Fargo benefitted the past tense. So does Wells Fargo still benefit in their bottom line results from the improving housing market or is it all in the numbers?","John G. Stumpf","Yeah, here's the way I look at that, Mike. When housing gets better, it's better for Americans, it's better for the country and that accrues \u2013 we had a commitment to residential real estate and commercial real estate for that matter in those companies, because that's what our customers want us to buy. I can't tell you if it's \u2013 what's going to happen in the next quarter, but I can tell you this. An improving housing market will benefit customers and us because we're at the end of the day a reflection of our customers. So the benefits are yet to come. It might come in different line items. You're right, if rates rise there will be less refinances. We've been there before, but it also means improved credits, it means improved confidence. Customers start small businesses. We're a big\/small business bank. Environmental costs go away. So I would take that trade all day long in improving housing market even if it means less refinances because rates are rising at the same time, that's fine.","Timothy J. Sloan","Mike, the only other thing I would add is I don't think you have enough columns on your sheet of paper. We have 90 different businesses, right? We are not just a \u2013 if we were just a mortgage company, then I think the columns and the items that you pointed out would have been absolutely spot on, right? But this is a portion of our business, it's a great business, terrific people, we're helping customers succeed all the time in that business, but we have 90 other \u2013 or 89 other businesses in this company that are continuing to grow and you can see not only this quarter but over the last year that many of the businesses have been growing not only as it relates to net interest income but also to noninterest income. So, again, who knows what's going to happen in the third quarter but over time this diversified model is very helpful when you have one business where revenues might be coming down.","Michael Mayo - CLSA","And if I can speak to our language, so I guess you'd say there's 90 horses pulling the stagecoach and as the mortgage horse is slowing down, potentially slows down although it's certainly been stronger for longer, which of those other 89 businesses do you think are most able to pick up the slack?","John G. Stumpf","All of them. It's not just one, Mike.","Timothy J. Sloan","That's what exciting, right? If there was just one, actually we'd be worried about it. But whether \u2013 it's a nice analogy. That would be quite a stagecoach that we would have but the mortgage horse has been a big strong horse, right? We've got 89 other horses that are going to be to grow. And again, just look at the numbers this quarter to get a feeling for \u2013 we called 10 to 12, there's even more as you pour through the numbers in terms of performance.","John G. Stumpf","We talked in last couple of quarters about how we think we have an opportunity in credit card. I mean we are seeing great increases there. Look at the Wealth, Brokerage and retirement business, now these are not all one horse offset the other horse but when you have a whole team out there, the key is keep the coach running and we like that diversity.","Michael Mayo - CLSA","And last follow-up, just in case the other [NII] businesses don't pick up the slack right away as JPMorgan said on its call earlier that you can't slow down a mortgage but a lag in the expense takeout. Can you just remind us of the expense flexibility that you have outside of mortgage?","John G. Stumpf","We still think there is opportunity on expenses here and I think Tim mentioned that earlier in the call. So as you mentioned on the mortgage side, first of all there is the commission base, so that happens immediately. And then we are very good at sizing the business based on what's going on. We've done that many times. But in other businesses we \u2013 for example, we started something called the neighborhood store with 6,200 stores. We opened that first one in Washington D.C. and that operates at 40% less costs of the same functionality. There are tons of opportunities like that; paperless ATM receipts and nickels and dimes in the corners that all add up at the end of the day in addition to the environmental costs.","Michael Mayo - CLSA","All right. Thank you.","John G. Stumpf","Thank you.","Timothy J. Sloan","Thank you, Mike.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research, LLC.","Nancy Bush - NAB Research","Good morning, guys.","John G. Stumpf","Good morning, Nancy.","Nancy Bush - NAB Research","I promise I'm not going to ask mortgage banking questions. First, there's been a lot of press around this issue of the kiosk branch that you're introducing, I think, in New York City. Could you talk about that a little bit and whether this signals some sort of broader experimentation with branch types throughout the network or is this something specific to New York?","John G. Stumpf","Well, eventually is Washington D.C. but \u2013 so let me tell you first of all, we have about 6,200 stores and the stores have been relatively flat in numbers. And there is a lot of discussion today about in our industry whether stores are still relevant. We think they're enormously relevant even to our millennial customers. And store usage and channel usage frankly is based on many times age, affluence and activity. And when we talk with our customers, even the millennial visit our stores once every year or six months or sometime and places where they go to open their first account, it's where people go. If they can't, they'll go probably any place else and it's a place they take good money in if they come into a trust fund that runs out of whatever the case may be. But here's the key. As long as our customers tell us that destination distribution like a store is important, we're going to built it for them and we're going to have stores. Will they need them? Will they want them? And that's important to growing deposits, to selling products and services to them. If we ever get a time where they say it's not important, then we'll jump that way also. So since stores are important, how do you make them more efficient and how do you build them in a way that allows for the convenience they want, the availability they want but also under the cost structure that makes sense. The neighborhood store we had, it's about 1,000 square feet. During the daytime, it's a full functioning store. It happens to be paperless, it happens to have the cash there is contained within machines that can check down to the dollar. And after hours the [walls] fold in and it's an ATM vestibule. So you can get the best of both. This is a test and learn. We've done a lot of testing and learning around here and in many of those densely populated marketplaces, you can't rent a facility of 5,000 square feet. A 1,000 all you can get, so that makes it available to you. So if this works, we'll do more. It doesn't work, we've got nothing. This is only one test. We have lots of tests going on.","Nancy Bush - NAB Research","But at this point, it's an additive strategy. It wouldn't be where you would take existing branches that are sort of \"more normal branches\" and change them to traditional additive strategy at this point?","John G. Stumpf","Yeah, it's additive but it might be a replacement strategy for certain stores. In fact, some of what we're doing today is taking two stores and building a new one and consolidating into two depending on customer flows, depending on customer needs. We are a retailer, so most retailers that I respect are always looking at their distribution footprint and model but the long and the short of it is we believe in the store concept but \u2013 I mean when I first got in the industry, we had the operations in the second floor and the boardroom on the bottom floor, in the basement. We had to change since that time and still continue to change.","Nancy Bush - NAB Research","Am I right in assuming that the breakeven on these things is like weeks or a few months?","John G. Stumpf","Well it depends on the activity in the store and the activity with customers. Five years ago the breaking was very different than it's today, customers borrowed more.","Nancy Bush - NAB Research","All right.","John G. Stumpf","It's a different margin on borrowing versus depositing. But I wouldn\u2019t say in weeks or months but it's about 40% reduction in cost is the same functionality, that\u2019s a big deal.","Nancy Bush - NAB Research","All right. Second question is this, your improvement in cross-sell from 6 to 6.14 and your ongoing improvements in cross-sell, is this primarily one product, two products, I mean is there sort of still a quote, lead product you guys have that sort of lead the cross-sell?","John G. Stumpf","Yes, it's checking accounts. That\u2019s why when I wake up in the morning I get here, the first thing I look at is the checking account report from the day before. I love checking accounts, I dream about them. I just -- because \u2026","Nancy Bush - NAB Research","John, you\u2019ve been in the business too long, I am sorry.","John G. Stumpf","It's because it's the formational account for a consumer. And the second probably most important is mortgage, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re almost -- we\u2019re obsessive about that, about serving customers.","Nancy Bush - NAB Research","Yeah, and just finally one quick thing and I probably already know what the answer is but I have got to ask it anyway, given that there has been yet one more attempt at Glass Steagall, break them up, you obviously big, you\u2019re bigger now than you were before the financial crisis blah, blah, blah I mean are you -- I would assume that you would be in this group of break them up banks, and I guess my question is, what could you be broken up into?","John G. Stumpf","Well, Nancy this is America, people are free to express their opinion, and that\u2019s one of the beauties of this country. And yeah from my perspective we're thoroughly in the real economy. I mean what we do is to serve customers. Small business, large business, commercial real estate customers, consumers and virtually everything we do has a customer on the other side of it. We take a deposit in, we don\u2019t put it into a vault and (indiscernible) we put it to work. We make consumer loans, commercial loans, small business loans, loans to ranchers and farmers and energy companies and that\u2019s what we do, and that\u2019s proprietary. I mean that\u2019s putting, because we have to manage those kinds of risks, I understand that. I don\u2019t understand how serving customers broadly and deeply including helping them with a public offering whether it be debt or equity, somehow it makes us riskier or weaker or puts depositors at risk more so than making a loan. But I understand that the dialogue, you got to realize the capital that\u2019s been raised, the discipline around risk of all kind is far different than it was just a few years ago. I am proud of this company and proud of what we do and I know that we are helping this economy to recover, to heal and we\u2019ll do all we can do that.","Nancy Bush - NAB Research","Thank you.","John G. Stumpf","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Marquardt with Evercore.","John G. Stumpf","Hi, Andrew.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners","Good morning, guys.","John G. Stumpf","Good morning.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners","Just a couple of [tiki-tak] questions, first on expenses, environmental costs have come down significantly the last couple of quarters. Is there a lot more room to go from there, I know you had mentioned that, they were not at all behind us, but I seem that we won't go to zero on a lot of these, some of this will be ongoing costs when I\u2019m looking at your Page 13 on your slide deck, how much room should we really think about is left to go?","John G. Stumpf","I don\u2019t know the exact answer to your question Andrew. I think it's a fair question because as you point out we\u2019ve made a tremendous amount of progress over the last few quarters. I don\u2019t think, so if you just pick two items for example, foreclosed asset expenses which were $146 million in the second quarter, that doesn\u2019t feel to me to be the run rate that we would settle in. Could it go up, it could go up or could go down, but I think over time there still is some room for that to decline. And then also I think the contra revenue item that we had which was the MSR servicing and foreclosure cost impact. Again the primary driver there is continued foreclosure timelines in certain judicial foreclosure states, primarily New York and New Jersey and over time that will I think begin \u2013 we will continue to moderate. So, I think those in particularly probably little bit more room to run. But you\u2019re correct, the rate of increase is going to slow down.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners","Okay, okay. That\u2019s helpful, thanks. And then secondly, back to liquidity, just want a clarification, because you had mentioned in an earlier comment about how you may need to raise some additional liquidity. Is that related to the LCR or is that related to the consideration of other things in terms of the OLA additional bailing debt considerations that are out there? Because when we look at LCR, we have you guys in a pretty healthy range of 120 to 140 depending on how you calculate it. So I was just a little surprised by that comment.","Timothy J. Sloan","Well, I think that\u2019s \u2013 you hit the nail on the head with your last comment and that it's hard to calculate the answer when you don\u2019t really know what \u2013 that all the variables are going to be. We think that we have more than sufficient amount of liquidity be able to operate Wells Fargo, we\u2019ve been able to demonstrate that through some pretty significant downturn. The rules might change a little bit. If that\u2019s the case we have to make some adjustments to the balance sheet, if we do that. That\u2019s fine. We will adjust to that. But it's not that the onset of finalizing the Basel III LCR and any of the interpretation that might occur from our domestic regulators is not impacting the way that we\u2019re running the business today. Meaning that we\u2019re not \u2013 we don\u2019t have some money to satisfy that we can\u2019t lend to our customers or we can\u2019t invest in securities because we\u2019re too concerned about that and there is a lot of moving parts. And again, we\u2019re going to we are \u2013 we will comply with whatever the final rules are, we will do that in an appropriate timeframe. But it\u2019s not a limiting factor for the Company today.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners","Got it. And what is the constraining factor when we should think about excess liquidity and the ability to deploy more into securities or loans or what have you? What is the sense that\u2019s \u2026?","Timothy J. Sloan","It is economic growth and the rate of loan growth and when we think about the recovery, as we talked about, we continue to be in a recovery that had to adjust to a tremendous amount of headwinds and it's been from our perspective remarkably resilient, but our loan growth would be a lot stronger as we were at 3% GDP level or 4% GDP level, which is about what I think everybody expected a few years ago when we started to come out of the downturn it\u2019s primarily loan growth, less today in terms of investment, less today rates. That was a big limiting factor for us a year-ago and nine months ago and three months ago for that matter, less today for sure rates, because rates are more attractive today.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks.","John G. Stumpf","And the beauty of it, borrowing does start, I mean that \u2013 those costs are already embedded. We already have those approved. I mean that\u2019s just all revenue then.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners","All right. Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks.","Timothy J. Sloan","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Timothy J. Sloan","Hey, Betsy.","John G. Stumpf","Hey, Betsy.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Hey, good morning. Couple of questions. One on page 26, you got the PCI accretable yield slide and you indicated the weighted average life is 14.5 years there. So that\u2019s up from last quarter where I think it was like 12.3 or something like that. And I am just wondering what is behind driving that up?","Timothy J. Sloan","A couple of things. One is just that we have a general improvement in the underlying portfolio and the delinquency in the portfolio has come down little bit. So the expectation according to the model is that customers are going to stay in their homes longer. We could be \u2013 I mean it could be though that you could reach a point whereas you continue to see home values increasing, that it could reach a point where those customers maybe more comfortable and able to sell their homes or even to refinance and that would begin to bring the average life down. But I wouldn\u2019t read into that change any big change in our assumption during \u2013 like that is very variable on a quarter-to-quarter basis.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay. But you are basically saying credit quality is improving and that\u2019s why the weighted average life is extending? ","Timothy J. Sloan","Yes.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Do you have anything at all in there for prepays, or it\u2019s not rate related at all?","Timothy J. Sloan","No, we definitely do. I mean that's part of the \u2013 it's one of the important variables within the model. But again, personally I think that prepaid are going to accelerate over time as values continue to go up, but we haven't seen that yet in the performance level but I think logically it could.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And which would shorten duration and pull in the PCI a little bit faster?","Timothy J. Sloan","Correct.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then secondly, HPI going up significantly in the most recent quarter, it's this level of housing value hold for the rest of the year. How much is that going to be impacting your loan growth? And I know the question's been asked a couple of different times but I guess the real question is, do you feel that the current value of housing price is in Q2's numbers or is there more to come from the HPI improvements that we've seen this quarter?","Timothy J. Sloan","We tend to use a lagged function and we tend to be a little bit more conservative. I mean we're not going to take for example the housing price, the 13% that John mentioned what we've seen year-over-year and assume that's going to continue forever, right? And so you got to be very careful with that. I think we've been and I think the entire industry and the market's been positively surprised at the level at which housing prices have \u2013 how resilient they've been, how much they've grown and the percentage that they've grown. So again, I think that we've seen some nice improvement and our expectation is that we're very positively leveraged to home prices. And so we could see some improvement from the results that you see here in the second quarter.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","I'm just thinking in particular about home equity, because that to me seems like the area where you should have some of the sharpest swings as HPI has gone up so much recently over the next couple of quarters. But I don't know if that's a fair assessment given\u2026?","Timothy J. Sloan","Betsy, I think you're absolutely right and maybe using the word leverage is maybe even more appropriate there when you think about the impact to a home equity portfolio which the majority of our home equity portfolios are junior leans. To the extent that you got a portion of that that's above 100% home \u2013 increasing home values really, really impacts that portfolio.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","So are you seeing much in the demand and the origination pipeline for that product yet, or is it too early?","Timothy J. Sloan","I think our home equity originations were up year-over-year but I don't think they were necessarily up significantly from the first quarter. It's a good product. It's underwritten very well today. It's one of the many products we provide. It's a slight uptick but it wasn't one of the drivers for the home equity \u2013 or our loan growth we would have called it out.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mutascio with KBW.","John G. Stumpf","Hi, Chris.","Chris Mutascio - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Good morning, John. How are you?","John G. Stumpf","Hi, Chris.","Chris Mutascio - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Tim, I had a quick question for you. I'm going to go all the way back to the first question today and I can't promise what Nancy promised. It will be a mortgage question. When you look at the servicing side of the business and how it flows through the income statement, the servicing asset has \u2013 the MSR has been written up about $3 billion in the last couple quarters and yet the servicing income is still kind of stuck in that $300 million to $400 million range per quarter. So in order for that natural hedge to fully take hold, if indeed we see a material, and that's my assumption, but a material decrease in refinance activity, do you have to start lessening up on the hedge on the MSR for that to flow through to the income statement and more so than it has?","Timothy J. Sloan","If you wanted to create a natural hedge, you would have to reduce your hedge percentages and then when you're doing that, you would potentially create a lot more interest rate risks \u2013 not potentially, you would create a lot more interest rate risks for the company. And we just don't think that that's a prudent thing to do. So I think historically when the business was smaller than it is today, it might have been a little bit more \u2013 we might have more flexibility to do that. That doesn't really make sense to us today. So, our hedge ratios are relatively high, which is one of the reasons why you're not seeing one-for-one offset. There will be some benefit there's no question about that. And I think one of the key benefits of the servicing portfolio over time is that the quality of what you're servicing continues to increase because you continue to originate better quality mortgages that are going to pay for a longer period of time and you don't have as much foreclosure impact. I think that in terms of comparing our servicing results over the next few quarters with what we've experienced in the last few quarters, most of the reduction that you've seen has been related to foreclosure elongation and things like that and we're hopeful that that's going to dissipate. But I would not look for the MSR dollar-for-dollar offset and any reduction in revenues from the origination side of the business. There's some natural relation but it's not one-for-one.","Chris Mutascio - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","And just one quick follow-up. I think John had mentioned or I think both of you mentioned potential MSR sales going forward. And I think, John, you had mentioned \u2013 I don't want to put words in your mouth, but maybe there would be kind of one-off type portfolio similar to the reverse mortgage sale recently. Would the pickup paid portfolio be included as a one-off potential sale, in terms of MSRs?","John G. Stumpf","Well, that one we own. I mean we own the asset there. So I wouldn't look for that area per se. I don' want to give guidance here, but I think what you should take away from this is that we like the MSR business. We think it's critical to \u2013 well, we not only like it because of the business itself but because of the cross-sell we do out of it. And that we will sell from time to time opportunistically. I think Tim mentioned that we might look at something that has a single product household kind of dynamic here, but we're always looking in all of our businesses is an opportunity here to monetize something that might be more valuable someone else to us, sure, we'll look at that. I won't go for a big change here.","Chris Mutascio - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Right, thank you very much.","Operator","Your final question will come from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.","Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer","My question was asked.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Rowe, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Rowe, you may begin your conference.","Jim Rowe","Thank you, Regina, and good morning, everyone.  Thank you for joining our call today during which our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf; and our CFO, Tim Sloan, will review second quarter results and answer your questions.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our second quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website.","I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplements. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on wellsfargo.com.","I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf.","John G. Stumpf","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Before I discuss our results this quarter, I want to take a moment to recognize that 160 years ago today, on July 13 in 1852, Wells Fargo first opened its doors for business right here in San Francisco. So it's our birthday today. It's been quite a remarkable ride for the stagecoach for the last 160 years. And during that period of time, we've been through many economic cycles.","While the current economic recovery remains uneven, our strong performance in the second quarter reflects the strength of our franchise, the benefit of our diversified business model and the advantage of an outstanding team working together to serve our customers. Our focus on meeting our customers\u2019 financial needs resulted in continued strong deposit growth, growth in consumer and commercial loans and record cross-sell.","Let me quickly review some of the highlights of the quarter. We generated record net income, up 17% from a year ago, and EPS was also up 17%. Pretax pre-provision profits increased 12%, and revenue grew 4% from a year ago. We had positive operating leverage and our expense efficiency ratio improved by 300 basis points from a year ago. Retail banking cross-sell reached a new record of 6 products per household for the entire community bank consumer base. Credit quality continued to improve with our charge-off ratio declining to 1.15%, the lowest level since 2007 and down 37 basis points from a year ago. Our profitability ratios reflect these strong results with our ROA growing to 1.41%, up 14 basis points from a year ago, the highest it's been in 4 years. Our return on equity increased to 12.86%, up 94 basis points from a year ago.  We purchased 53 million shares of common stock during the second quarter while we continued to grow capital.","Our performance reflects growth throughout our businesses. Our mortgage business generated record applications in the second quarter of $208 billion, up over 90% from a year ago and up 11% from last quarter. Obviously, the low-rate environment is driving strong refi application volume. But purchase volume was up over $19 billion or 43% from the first quarter, indicating increased strength in the overall housing market where we've seen increases in sales and pricing in markets throughout the country, even in some of the hardest hit areas during the downturn.","We remain focused on our commitment to helping homeowners stay in their homes with over 770,000 active trial or completed mortgage modifications since the beginning of 2009. We've also helped nearly 6.2 million customers secure new low-rate loans for home purchases or refinancing since the beginning of 2009.","The strength of our mortgage business is just one example of how we've been able to generate new customer relationships and better serve our existing customers. We grew commercial loans through portfolio acquisitions and organically, increased credit card penetration of the retail banking households to 31%, grew retail brokerage managed account assets by 7% from a year ago and small business checking accounts were up nearly 4% from a year ago.","This is just the beginning of the many opportunities we have to capitalize on the strength of our franchise and achieve the financial goals we shared with you at Investor Day.","Tim Sloan, our CFO, will now provide more details on our financial results. Tim?","Timothy J. Sloan","Thanks, John and good morning, everyone. My remarks will follow the presentation included in the first half of our quarterly supplement that starts on Page 2, and then John and I will take your questions.","As John highlighted, we had a very strong quarter, with record earnings of $4.6 billion, up 9% from the first quarter and 17% from a year ago. Earnings per share were a record $0.82, also up 9% from last quarter and 17% from a year ago. This was our 10th consecutive quarter of earnings per share growth.","Our ability to consistently grow earnings per share over the past 2.5 years when the economy has faced many challenges reflects the benefit of our diversified business model.","I'm going to start by highlighting some of the key drivers of our results this quarter, beginning on Page 4, and I'll add more detail later in my remarks.","We grew both our total and our core loan portfolios. The loan growth was broad-based and benefited from acquisitions and organic growth in both commercial and consumer portfolios. Our securities portfolio declined $3.4 billion as new investments were more than offset by called lower-yield securities and runoff. We remain cautious in how we invest in this interest rate and credit environment.","Turning to the income statement. Revenue declined $347 million from the first quarter as growth in net interest income and fee growth across many of our businesses was offset by declines in trading, driven by lower deferred compensation plan investment income and lower gains on equity investments. Our expense efficiency ratio improved to 58.2% as expenses declined $596 million from the first quarter, consistent with our expectations. Expenses related to the settlement with the Department of Justice, which we announced yesterday, have been fully accrued for as of the end of the second quarter.","Let me now cover our results in a little bit more detail. As shown on Page 6, period-end loans were up $8.7 billion from the first quarter with growth across a number of commercial and consumer portfolios. The liquidating portfolio declined by $5.1 billion and our core loan portfolio grew by $13.8 billion. Commercial loans increased $8.3 billion, including $6.9 billion of loans acquired in the purchase of BNP Paribas' North American energy lending business and the purchase of WestLB subscription finance portfolio. Our strong balance sheet has enabled us to take advantage of these opportunities in this economic environment.","Our portfolio of purchases are in businesses we understand and include both new customers and customers we already serve, providing us the opportunity to deepen these relationships.","Consumer loans increased $375 million from the first quarter as growth in first mortgages, auto and credit card was partially offset by declines in junior lien mortgages. Average loan balances were down $359 million from the first quarter, which didn't benefit from the late quarter close of the WestLB portfolio. However, many commercial and consumer loan portfolios increased average balances on a link quarter basis.","We had strong core deposit growth with average core deposits up $10.1 billion from the first quarter, up $73.2 billion or 9% from a year ago. Core deposits were 115% of average loans. Average core checking and savings deposits were up 12% from a year ago and were 93% of average core deposits. We have successfully grown deposits while reducing our deposit costs for 7 consecutive quarters. Deposit costs in the second quarter were 19 basis points, down 1 basis point from the first quarter and down 9 basis points from a year ago.","Tax equivalent net interest income increased $155 million from the first quarter, driven by growth in earning assets, up $16 billion, while our net interest margin was unchanged at 3.91%. The NIM included a 7 basis point benefit from higher variable items, including PCI loan resolutions in the second quarter. These variable sources of income can be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, and we would expect continued pressure on our NIM as the balance sheet reprices in the current low-rate environment. But as we've said and stated many times in the past, we remain focused on growing net interest income.","Noninterest income declined $496 million from the first quarter, down 5%. The decline was partially due to $377 million of lower trading gains on $218 million of lower deferred compensation plan investment results, which is offset in employee benefit expense. Equity gains were also lower this quarter, down $122 million. However, we continue to benefit from our diverse businesses with growth in deposit service charges, trust and investment fees, card fees, processing fees, insurance and mortgage banking.","Mortgage banking revenue increased $23 million from the first quarter with continued strong originations and margins. Results included a $669 million provision for mortgage repurchase losses, which was $239 million higher than the first quarter, and I'll discuss this more later. Mortgage originations were $131 billion in the second quarter, up $2 billion from the strong first quarter volumes and were more than double what they were a year ago. 16% of our origination volume this quarter was from HARP, similar to last quarter. The unclosed mortgage pipeline at quarter end was a very strong $102 billion, up 29% from the first quarter, and the second highest pipeline in our history.","Turning to expenses. Noninterest expenses were down $596 million from the first quarter, driven by lower personnel expenses. Commission and incentive compensation expense decreased $63 million as declines in seasonally high first quarter expenses were partially offset by higher revenue-driven compensation. Employee benefit expense was down $559 million from seasonally high first quarter and reflects lower deferred compensation expense. Second quarter expenses also included $524 million of operating losses, $47 million higher than the first quarter. Operating losses this quarter included an accrual for the settlement with the Department of Justice.","We first highlighted our expense reduction program during our earnings call a year ago. One year later, we've made solid progress at reducing expenses, and we remain committed to improving our efficiency. However, a lot has changed over the past 12 months, particularly in terms of revenue opportunities.","As shown on Slide 11, we achieved positive operating leverage with revenue growing $903 million while noninterest expense declined $78 million over the past year. As we\u2019ve said all along, we will not pass up revenue opportunities in order to meet a specific expense target number. Mortgage volumes have been much stronger than anyone expected a year ago or even 3 months ago for that matter with originations more than double what they were a year ago and our mortgage pipeline, which should lead to future revenue and expense growth, has also doubled. So while we have reduced total FTEs for Wells Fargo by 1% over the past year, we have increased FTEs in consumer real estate by 19% to capture the revenue opportunities from strong mortgage volumes. In fact, we added over 2,000 FTEs in mortgage in the second quarter.","It is also important to note that revenue and expenses reflect the success we've had in completing several business and loan portfolio acquisitions over the past year, and we've continued to invest in our growing businesses. Also, litigation accruals have been high and our mortgage servicing costs have been elevated due to the mortgage servicing settlement and foreclosure consent orders.","As shown on Page 12, even with all of this business and expense growth, we have achieved efficiency improvements with our efficiency ratio in the second quarter improving to 58.2%, the lowest level in 9 quarters. This improvement in our efficiency ratio demonstrates the success we've had at expense reduction even as we've grown revenue.","Let me mention just a few examples. We've reduced FTEs in high-cost geographies by 10% since the beginning of 2011. We've reduced occupancy expense by 7%, including real estate reductions of 3 million square feet. And we have reduced third-party spend, reflecting renegotiated contracts and changes in demand. As we highlighted in Investor Day, we've established an efficiency ratio target of 55% to 59%, and we were in that range this quarter. We currently expect to be within our target range for the rest of 2012. We believe that focusing on our efficiency ratio is the best way to demonstrate expense management as we continue to focus on revenue opportunities for both this year and in the future.","Due to our strong revenue opportunities, particularly in mortgage, we now expect our fourth quarter expenses to be higher than our previous target of $11.25 billion. However, current expenses are still too high and we expect them to trend down over the remainder of the year from second quarter levels.","Let me now briefly highlight on our segment results starting on Page 13. Community Banking earned $2.5 billion in the second quarter, up 8% from the first quarter. Retail banking reached a record cross-sell of 6 products per household, up from 5.82 a year ago. Cross-sell growth occurred throughout our franchise with the West increasing to 6.37 and the East increasing to 5.52, up 27 basis points from a year ago. The momentum in the East is also demonstrated by core product sales growing by 5% from a year ago. Credit card penetration in our retail banking households continue to increase to 31%, up from 27% a year ago. We generated a record -- we generated record consumer auto originations in the second quarter of $6.6 billion, up 6% from the first quarter and up 18% from a year ago.","Wholesale Banking earned $1.9 billion in the second quarter, with record revenue of $6.1 billion, which was broad-based across our diversified commercial businesses. Revenue also benefited from increased PCI loan resolution income. Wholesale Banking had solid loan growth, up 1% from the first quarter and 11% from a year ago. The growth was broad-based, reflecting new and existing customer growth and our ability to capitalize on acquisition opportunities in this environment. During the second quarter, $3.7 billion of loans that were acquired in the purchase of BNP Paribas' North American energy lending business with nearly $9.4 billion in loan commitments. We also completed the acquisition of $3.2 billion of subscription finance loans from WestLB with nearly $6 billion of commitments. We've also had strong organic growth with 8 consecutive quarters of average loan growth in our Commercial Banking portfolio from new originations and increased line utilization from our middle market customers.","Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement earned $343 million, up 16% from the first quarter. Revenue declined $91 million from the first quarter, excluding $122 million of lower deferred compensation plan investment results. Revenue increased 1%, driven by higher retail brokerage asset-based fees.  Cross-sell continued to increase with our focus on meeting all of our customers' financial needs growing to 10.22, up from 9.94 a year ago.","Credit quality continued to improve this quarter as shown on Page 16 with better performance across portfolios and credit metrics. Net charge-offs were down $195 million from the first quarter and were 1.15% of average loans, down 10 basis points from the last quarter. From the peak in the fourth quarter of 2009, charge-offs are down $3.2 billion or 59%. Provision expense was $1.8 billion, including a $400 million reserve release. Absent significant deterioration in the economy, we continue to expect future reserve releases in 2012.","Nonperforming assets were down $1.8 billion from the first quarter, down 11% from a year ago. The linked quarter decline reflects a $1.4 billion reduction in NPLs and a $310 million decline in foreclosed assets. NPAs were 3.21% of total loans in the second quarter, the lowest level since 2009. Loans 90 days or more past due were down $276 million or 17% from the first quarter with declines in both commercial and consumer portfolios. Early-stage consumer loan delinquency balances and rates also improved from the first quarter and were also significantly better than a year ago.","We service $1.9 trillion of residential mortgages. This is a great business because of the new customer growth and cross-sell opportunities it provides, and our servicing portfolio positions us well to benefit from refinance waves like the one we're experiencing now since existing customers usually give us the first chance when they refinance.","As we've been highlighting for several quarters, the delinquency and foreclosure rate on our servicing portfolio was over 400 basis points lower than the industry average, excluding Wells Fargo, based on the most recently publicly available data demonstrating the quality of our portfolio. Our total delinquency and foreclosure rate was 7.14% in the first quarter, seasonally higher than -- excuse me, in the second quarter, seasonally higher than the first quarter, but down from 7.44% a year ago and a peak of 8.96% in the fourth quarter of 2009.","As I mentioned earlier, we added $669 million to our repurchase reserve this quarter, up $239 million from the first quarter. While outstanding repurchase demands were down this quarter, we added to our repurchase reserve primarily due to an increase in expected demands from the GSEs regarding 2006 to 2008 vintages. As we have mentioned in prior quarters, we continue to see behavioral changes from the agencies as they seem to be conforming their practices and this addition to the reserve was a result of our ongoing dialogue with them, including some communication very late in the quarter. We believe the additional reserve we added this quarter is appropriate to cover losses associated with these higher expected demands.","As shown on Page 20, our capital position continued to grow with our Tier 1 common equity ratio increasing to 10.0%, up 10 basis points from the last quarter. Our estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio under the latest Basel III proposals included in notices of proposed rule-making issued by the regulators in June were 7.78% for the second quarter. The proposed rules were largely consistent with our expectations, but changes in a few areas reduced our estimated ratio by approximately 30 basis points this quarter. Even after factoring in these changes, we are still in a strong capital position as reflected in our estimated ratio. And we expect to achieve Basel minimums well in advance of any published guidelines.","We purchased 53 million shares in the second quarter and entered into a forward repurchase transaction for an estimated 11 million shares that is expected to settle in the third quarter. We redeemed $1.8 billion of trust preferred securities with an average coupon of 6.31% in the quarter. We\u2019ve redeemed a total of $11.9 billion of TruPS since the beginning of 2011.","In summary, our strong results again this quarter continued to demonstrate the benefit of our diversified business model. By following our consistent vision, we once again achieved record earnings, higher pretax pre-provision profit, positive operating leverage with reduced expenses and improved credit quality. Our return on assets was 1.41%, the highest in 16 quarters and within our target range of 1.3% to 1.6% that we provided on Investor Day. Our ROE grew to 12.86%, also within our target range of 12% to 15%. And while we had great results this quarter, we have plenty of opportunity ahead for future growth, including a strong mortgage pipeline, recently completed acquisitions, improving cross-sell, increasing market share and improving efficiency all while remaining very focused on risk.","I will now open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Erika Penala with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My first question is I guess I'm just trying to figure out the movement in terms of core loan yield trends. So if I take out the $113 million of -- it seemed like outsized resolution that accreted back to your margin on the PCI book, it still seems as if your core loan yield would only be down less than 5%. So could you give us a sense of: A, was there some enhancement from the BNP transaction in your commercial loan yield this quarter? Or if not, what are you doing differently to keep your pricing relatively resilient?","Timothy J. Sloan","No, that's a fair question and I think your estimate of the impact of the special items is correct. Neither the acquisitions, either the BNP acquisition or WestLB, really impacted the core loan yields. They were very similar to similar loans that we had in similar portfolios we already had on the sheet. And so there's really nothing in particular that's going on from a loan yield standpoint. It's competitive out there. We continue to compete as best we can. We tend not to be -- to over compete on price. We focus on competing on relationship and growing cross-sell. But there's nothing special there at all.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And on the bond portfolio, you mentioned in the presentation that some lower-yielding securities were called. What was sort of the impact of that in terms of -- the AFS yields were up quarter-over-quarter. Was that primarily due to that, the lower-yielding bond getting called? And also, if you could give us a sense in terms of what you were reinvesting in from a duration and yield perspective this quarter.","Timothy J. Sloan","Yes, that was a driver for the increase in the yield. And really what happened is we had some very high-quality short-term government or government agency securities that were called that we had invested in, in the end of the third, early fourth quarter of last year when we had all that excess liquidity that occurred. And what we did is we looked across the spectrum and saw the best -- some of the best risk return being in very high-quality municipal securities and so that was the exchange.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And just one more on capital, thank you so much for giving us an updated Basel III number. I was wondering as you looked through the how to interpret the risk weighting by LTV on the resi portfolio, did you give yourselves credit for the purchase accounting marks on the Wachovia book?","Timothy J. Sloan","Yes, we did, we did. And again, I think that the important thing to think about when you -- as we look through the NPRs is that while it did have about a 30 basis point impact, we don't -- and there's a lot of give-and-takes that we're going to have with the regulators and the whole industry will have with the regulators on the various items, in terms of our ability to meet any sort of capital requirements on any reasonable set of time, we're going to meet them well in advance. So we've got a lot of discussion to have with the regulators, but we're fine from a capital standpoint.","John G. Stumpf","Yes, let me just emphasize that. We're in that unique position of not having to do anything uneconomic or different to somehow hoard capital or to meet something. We are -- we have such strong capital, such strong cash flows and earnings here. It puts us in a position where we can grow organically, do strategic and value-adding portfolio acquisitions or whatever. So it really puts us in a great position. Capital simply is a not an issue here. Nothing I'd worry about.","Operator","The next question will come from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","A couple of nitty-gritty questions for Tim. Tim, on the share count, the average diluted shares were up but despite the buyback and even though the end of period is down, is that just timing of when the buybacks were done or something else there?","Timothy J. Sloan","John, it's a function of timing. It's a good question. It's a function of the timing and also the fact that we tend to have more share issuance in the first part of the year. If you look over last year, you saw something relatively similar in that the share count drifted down a little bit toward the end of the year. But it's nothing special other than just timing.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then on the variable source items contributing to NIM this quarter and assuming 7 basis points, besides loan resolutions, can you just give us a feel for what other types of variable sources are affecting the NIM?","Timothy J. Sloan","It was mostly loan resolutions, John, and that's why we called it out. The NIM's been flat quarter-over-quarter and we wanted to make sure that you all appreciated that 7 basis points was something that was relatively special.","John G. Stumpf","And John, as we have mentioned in the past and we'll say it again, NIM will be under pressure as -- in this low-rate environment. And while we don't manage to it, we surely talk about it. But what's important here is we're able to grow net interest income and that's really the driver.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, and do you see more opportunity to buy loan books from other banks? What is the market like for that kind of opportunity?","Timothy J. Sloan","I think the market continues to provide opportunities for firms that have the liquidity and the capital to be able to take advantage of it. Whether or not we'll be successful, I certainly can't promise you because we turn down more than we pursue. But we're just very, very pleased over the past year to have been in position to make the acquisitions that we've done.  To date, they've all worked out well and we look forward to looking at more acquisitions in the future.","John G. Stumpf","John, we -- like I said lots and we kick a lot of tires. We say no to more stuff than we say yes to. But we don't do another deal that's -- we'll do other things, but we're still looking at a lot of things.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And last thing for me, understanding that it's not a big deal as it's only one quarter of capital build for you, but what in the Basel III NPRs drove that 30 basis point revision to your pro forma outlook, Tim?","Timothy J. Sloan","Yes, there were a couple of things in the numerator, John. First, in terms of how the OCI related to our pension would be handled. And then second was the MSR floor. And then on the denominator side, it was primarily an RWA adjustment for the removal of the credit rating for AFS securities. But again, it wasn't significant.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Chris Mutascio with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Christopher M. Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Tim, I got a couple quick questions, one I'm not sure I heard you correctly. But the sequential quarter build in the loan repurchase reserves, roughly $240 million above first quarter levels, would you consider it more of a onetime true of from what you're seeing from the GSEs recently?","Timothy J. Sloan","I wouldn't say it's a onetime true up, Chris. I'd love to be able to tell you that, that's the case. It may be; it may not be in terms of what we see in the future. I think we're just continuing to be -- to want to make sure that we've got that reserve absolutely accrued for appropriately. And we saw the agencies continuing to adjust their requests. Again, these are not specific demands. This is in advance of demands, but it's at our best expectations that what the demands are going to look like in the future.","John G. Stumpf","But Chris, let me say this. Just because there's demands, I mean we're going to push back. We have a team and we look through this stuff. And this is -- we have -- and we've been successful in the past in that, but we just wanted to give you a heads-up about what's -- what we expect in the future. But there's a whole team here that takes this very seriously.","Timothy J. Sloan","Yes, there's a lot of give-and-take in this relationship and you can see that we're good at making progress in terms of those discussions because of the fact that demands were actually down. When we get something, we work through it. Sometimes we agree; sometimes we don't. But it's a pretty healthy conversation.","Christopher M. Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I appreciate that. The TruPS were paid off late in the quarter, if I did my math right. That saves you maybe $115 million or so a year. What about the sub-debt? What was the yield on the sub-debt, the $2.2 billion that saves you in interest expense going forward?","Timothy J. Sloan","You know what, Chris, I'd -- to be honest with you, I don't have it handy. We'll get back to you on that. But it was lower than -- much lower than the TruPS. I want to say 200, 300 basis points, but we'll get back to you on that.","Christopher M. Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. But again, they both happened late in the quarter, so that's a bit of an offset going forward in terms of lower expense.","Timothy J. Sloan","Correct. I mean I think just overall, the TruPS repurchase and the fact that we did it as early as we did has been a real benefit for us and will continue to be a benefit.","Christopher M. Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And can I have one final question? The securities yields were actually up 13 basis points sequentially. Are you taking more duration risk in the current environment to get that type of yields increased sequentially?","Timothy J. Sloan","No, we're not. We're not taking any significant duration risk or any significant credit risk. This is still a very high-quality portfolio and the duration is relatively short.","Christopher M. Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Then how does the yield go up sequentially with the rates going down?","Timothy J. Sloan","Yes, fair question. Similar to where Erika was coming out. And that is that it was really an exchange of some very low-yield, short-term, very high-quality government or government agency securities in exchange for some municipals and some MBS.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I want to ask you -- first question just on expenses and I think everyone understands that better revenue outlook for the better expense outlook for the fourth quarter. But can you, at this point, help us to understand how much more of an impact the Project Compass will be as we look forward into next year? There'll be seasonality obviously early next year, but just from a run rate as you expect things broader picture, do you guys -- can give us a sense of the magnitude of incremental saves that can still come out of the run rate?","Timothy J. Sloan","Yes, fair question. We have not begun our detailed planning for next year. Having said that, I think that we continue to see pretty significant changes that we can make as it relates to any sort of the run rate, which will be Project Compass. We also have some environmental items like higher operating losses due to litigation accruals and the like that hopefully will come out over time. So we think we can make some progress. And that's what one of the reasons why we've provided the range of 55% to 59% at Investor Day. If we thought that we were at the end and we were going to be at 58%, 59%, we wouldn't have provided that range to 55%.","John G. Stumpf","Yes, and let me state we still have opportunity. Expenses are still too high around here given the operating environment. So we -- all hands are on deck. We've lost none of our enthusiasm or opportunity or passion to do that. And this is not a destination; this is a journey. And it will continue next quarter, the quarter after into next year. But also what's important is not only Compass expenses, but expenses in businesses that move up and down. How quickly we can take mortgage costs out when mortgage -- when the refi boom ends. And those are also critically important. But we get this in spades and that's why we've been so public about the fact that we have opportunity here.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Great. And my second question just relates to -- 2 questions on the loan book. First of all, I was just wondering if you guys can comment on just commercial activity, your just general sense from customers out there just given the uncertainty in the environment and outlook there. And then the second question is looked like the pace of runoff was a little bigger this quarter in that part of the portfolio. Just what you generally expect from a pace of runoff going forward.","Timothy J. Sloan","Yes, let me take the last question first. The pace of runoff in the commercial portfolio was impacted in some of our commercial real estate loans, which drove the PCI resolution. That was a primary diver there. I wish I could tell you that was going to happen every quarter, but I can't. In terms of overall commercial loan demand, it still seems good. I wouldn't call it great. I mean I think we're in the midst of a recovery. It's a slow recovery. But what was good from our perspective was to see a more broad-based level of loan growth in our commercial portfolio in addition to the acquisitions. And we also saw, and I mentioned it in my remarks, a continued increase in line usage. It's not significant, but we bottomed in terms of line usage about a year or so ago and it's been slowly but steadily going up. But I would call it good, and it's a very competitive market.","John G. Stumpf","And I should also mention that we actually had -- we saw some opportunities or some performance on the consumer side, which is really healthy. We're doing very well in auto; we did very well in small business; we did very well in card this quarter. So that's very positive. Because we have -- home equity is coming down. So to show some improvement there was very encouraging.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Marty Mosby with Guggenheim.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to ask you about the pipeline and the impact that, that can have on originations. If you look at the last couple of quarters, your pipeline kind of converted into originations at about a 1.7 kind of ratio. So in other words, whatever you had in the pipeline, you originated 70% more in the next quarter. With a $102 billion pipeline, would that equate to north of -- it puts you around $170 billion in originations in the next quarter. Is that anywhere close to where you think you could see the numbers?","Timothy J. Sloan","Marty, I hope that's the case. But when you think about the conversion, it's just as much as what's going to happen in terms of business this month and the beginning of August. We've ramped up our team members in mortgage to be able to move the pipeline through as quickly as we can. But again -- and I -- so I hope $170 billion is the right number, but it could be a little bit different.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","The third quarter typically is a good seasonal quarter for home purchase as well. So you at least have that kind of coming back in if we're seeing any strength there, which is a positive.","Timothy J. Sloan","Yes.","John G. Stumpf","Yes.","Timothy J. Sloan","No, that's right.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","The other thing I was going to ask is if I calculated it right, it looks like the gain on sale went from about $240 million down to around $210 million this quarter. Is it starting to stabilize or should there -- any more return to more normal, which would be just a little bit below 2%?","Timothy J. Sloan","Yes, our numbers -- your numbers are actually pretty close, Marty. Our number was closer to about $220 million, $225 million or so but in that zip code. And it's remaining pretty stable.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then when we go back, one more try on the mortgage repurchase activity, you said you had some discussions with agencies. We had a couple other companies that took special kind of hits in the sense of reserving for future losses given better information they were getting from the agencies, which really reflects an acceleration of future losses that they expect to see. Would you kind of couch this $669 million number in that kind of range or in that kind of aspect?","Timothy J. Sloan","Marty, I wouldn't want to speculate on what's going to happen in the future. What we wanted to do was make sure that we were appropriately reserved for this quarter. As John said, there's going to be a lot of healthy conversation with the agencies on whatever future demands are going to provide. Again, these were based on conversations in which we expected future demands as opposed to specific demands.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, and the last question is the 7 basis points impact from PCI on the margin, is that an incremental benefit or how would that compare to last quarter?","Timothy J. Sloan","That's the incremental benefit, Marty, and that's why we wanted to call it out.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Paul Miller with FBR.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And just to follow-up on the mortgage banking side. I can't get this out, on the HARP stuff and back in your Investor Day, you said HARP wasn't playing as big as a role as a lot of the media people were talking about. Are you seeing an increase in HARP? Are you still in that category that you're not seeing a lot of HARP loans coming through the pipeline?","Timothy J. Sloan","Yes, Paul, good question. What we were referring to at Investor Day was the media reports at the time that indicated that the HARP margins were outsized relative to the rest of the originations, which wasn't the case then and isn't the case now. The fundings have actually been pretty stable in terms of -- I think we, at Investor Day, we might have said 15%.","John G. Stumpf","16%.","Timothy J. Sloan","Now, it's 16% now. And that's about -- it just seems pretty stable in that percentage. I mean it could go up or down a few percentage, but 16% is a pretty good number.","John G. Stumpf","Now, for others that might be higher as a percentage because they do less other things. The denominator is different. But for us, it's been pretty flat.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay, and then I don't know because I've been running around all day this morning with JPMorgan, but did you guys talk about -- a little bit about have you seen any decline at all? Because a lot of people have been talking about the refi index as being down. But we're hearing mixed reviews out there that if the flow or the demand is really going down out there in the month of July.","Timothy J. Sloan","We haven't published any of the July information. But as of just a couple of weeks ago with the pipeline that we have, things -- the business is good and we're optimistic about it.","John G. Stumpf","Very optimistic.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I understand the long-term: you had your whole Investor Day; and I understand the short-term mortgage: you're very optimistic. It's the medium term: if and when mortgage slows, what fills that bucket? What replaces that? Could there be kind of an oh no! quarter where mortgage slows and you haven't cut the expenses yet?","Timothy J. Sloan","Well, Mike, we could always an oh no! quarter. This is a volatile business that we're in, for sure. I think that when you\u2019re looking at the history of the company, we've had a profitable mortgage business for decades. But within that profitability, we've had a lot of cycles. We understand that the mortgage business is a very cyclical business, particularly when you look at the refi cycles that we've had over the past few years. And I would just point to the fact that while I can't promise this is going to be the case, while we've printed 10 consecutive quarters of earnings growth, we've had ups and downs in the mortgage business. And I think what that reflects is the benefit of the fact that we've got a very diversified business model, all right? The mortgage business is important to us. But when you look at the percentage of mortgage revenues for last year and the year before, it goes down because we're growing the rest of the business quite nicely. So I can't tell you specifically what would take the place of the decline in mortgage revenues, which will occur. We know that's going to happen because it's unlikely that we'll continue at this pace for the medium term as you point out. But we do believe that because we saw loan growth in many of our portfolios, we saw fee growth in many of the businesses that we can continue to grow even in the medium term.","John G. Stumpf","Yes, and Mike, I've -- and Tim's absolutely right in that. But even within the mortgage business, think about it. We are already seeing more purchase volume activity and the business is balanced pretty nicely between the servicing side and the origination side. So when originations tend to ebb, the servicing tends to do better. So I mean -- so there's a whole bunch of stuff. And there's -- we always say there's lots of different horses pulling this coach and one pulls harder when the other one doesn't pull as hard. So that's the beauty of this balanced business model.  But, Mike, we will not stretch for something. If -- I mean, that we -- it's just not in our culture to do that. So if we happen to have something that goes down one quarter, that's life.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And what if -- if you're not pulling as much in the coach, what about you eliminating a couple of horses to stretch the analogy?","John G. Stumpf","We're trimming manes all the time.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","But you're -- within range of your efficiency target, how quickly would you be able to take out the mortgage expenses if you see mortgage slowing? Is that one quarter, is it 5 quarters?","John G. Stumpf","That's a very fair question. And we\u2019ve become, I think, really, really good at how to deal with -- how to make what would traditionally been more permanent expenses variable in that business. So we do -- we have lots of skill in that area. But it can\u2019t happen in one week, I mean, but we're always looking for improvements in how to become much more variable in expenses that used to be more fixed.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Greg with UBS.","Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","One on the mortgage production outlook, at least as best as you can tell at this point, when you think about the sources in a HARP 2.0, you had mentioned 15% to 16% of production. Then there's also the other refi volume. As you look at those opportunities going forward, is there a percent of eligible refinance that you feel like you've worked through and there's a percent remaining that we'll see over the next couple of quarters?","Timothy J. Sloan","We talk about that, right, all the time. We talk to our mortgage folks about that all the time. But it's -- that's a really, really hard number to come up with, with any specificity. So I wouldn't want to throw out something and then you guys take our market share of that and then assume that we're going to get that over the next few quarters. I hope we do, but I'm not confident enough on that.","Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Is there a sense there with this refi opportunity between HARP 2.0 and the sensitivity around rate changes where there could be additional refinancing that the cycle has at least a couple of quarters\u2019 legs left in it and we should see production levels stay relatively strong?","Timothy J. Sloan","Well, I hope that's the case. And given that we start this quarter with a pretty strong pipeline, we think that will be the case for the near term. I do think that one of the differences about this refinancing cycle, which I think is where you're going and it's right on point is that because of some of these other programs, it's going to create a little bit more of a foundation in terms of demand for a longer period of time.","Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, great. And then on share repurchases with the 53 million done and 11 million forward, is there any view that you can provide in terms of additional share repurchase activity for the rest of this year?","Timothy J. Sloan","Yes, fair question. I want to point out that we were not able to purchase shares in the first quarter of this year just like we weren't able in the first quarter of last year just because of the timing of the CCAR process. So when you look at the share repurchase that we did in the second quarter, I wouldn't necessarily multiply that by 2 to get what we're going to do in the third and the fourth quarter. But what -- we are going to continue to repurchase shares. We've got the ability to do it. We continue to believe our shares are undervalued. And we're going to continue to be in the market.","Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Then last question, was there any debt valuation adjustment that was significant in the quarter?","Timothy J. Sloan","No.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Fred Cannon with KBW.","Frederick Cannon - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Just really a follow -- one follow-up question on the, Tim, your comment concerning the securities yields. You mentioned that the reason for the security yield increase was on the agent -- was because of the prepayment on agency securities. But it was in the residence -- it was in the non-agency securities on the mortgage-backed that we saw the linked quarter increase in the yield and I was wondering if -- what might be going on there.","Timothy J. Sloan","Well, it's a function of -- you're talking about the line item that says securities of U.S. states and political subdivisions, is that the one?","Frederick Cannon - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","No, under mortgage-backed securities, you've got the line item federal agencies and then you've got residential and commercial, which I'm assuming is non-agency MBS and that's the line item where you saw the yield increase.","Timothy J. Sloan","Yes, I would just describe that as just more of a mix in terms of individual securities. There's nothing special that's going on there.","Frederick Cannon - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","But over time that 6.97% yield should -- we should expect that to decline if you're taking less risk; is that fair?","Timothy J. Sloan","Oh, I think, Fred, as we talked about, I think where we have the biggest impact in terms of yields is in our AFS book and it's under pressure, and that's one of the drivers of our concern about the NIM.","Frederick Cannon - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Right. I was just -- I think we had a linked quarter increase of 17 basis points there, but -- so that's just more of a one quarter blip we should think of rather than a trend?","Timothy J. Sloan","I wish I could tell you that's going to continue, but I don't think that's going to be the case.","Frederick Cannon - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","One other question on the mortgage business. In the DOJ announcement yesterday, it said that you would discontinue funding mortgages at originated price and sold by independent mortgage brokers through your wholesale channel. I was wondering how much of the wholesale channel that is that you're shutting that down and kind of any reasons behind that.","Timothy J. Sloan","Well, in terms of the percentage, it was about 5% of our originations. So that the...","Frederick Cannon - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","And you're shutting down that entire 5%.","Timothy J. Sloan","That's correct. We're going to take applications through today and then there's a time period by which we need to get that information they need to close by. But that's correct; we're exiting that portion of the business.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Following up actually on the mortgage business. So you are shutting the wholesale channel, like you said about 5%. At the Investor Day, you talked a little bit about having picked up all the market share in correspondent, but wondering whether you were going to kind of keep it there. Can you talk a little bit about what your thoughts are; if they've changed any? And also, whether the industry as a whole has been quick or slow to add capacity and whether you think that is good for kind of pricing going forward?","Timothy J. Sloan","I think in terms of our view on the correspondent business, it really hasn't changed. We think it's a good business. As we've had -- as we mentioned on Investor Day, I think Mike Heid did a really good job of kind walking through the opportunities that we've had over the past year, in particular in terms of adding correspondents and we've been very careful to make sure that we add the right correspondents. We have long, strong relationships with a number of correspondents and again we like the business. In terms of adding staff to be able to process the volume we've had, I mean these have been unprecedented times in terms of how quickly volume has changed. And we've been adding folks to be able to underwrite and process these as quickly as we can and we'll continue to do that. But like -- at the same time, when volume starts to decline, we need to be ready to reduce, too. But there's nothing different going on here. You just need to make sure that you've got sustained volume before you add a lot of people.","John G. Stumpf","And just maybe -- just so we're all on the same wavelength here. The wholesale that we're turning down is different from correspondent. Correspondent is where you know the actual date when they close on. This is where the loan is priced and originated, but we close it and that's the part -- the wholesale piece that, that we couldn't be sure of what price is.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So risk management, it's a risk management decision.","John G. Stumpf","Exactly. It's many different things so -- and...","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Right, okay. But it just feels like the industry has been a little slower to add costs and capacity this cycle, would you agree with that or...","John G. Stumpf","No, I wouldn't say that at all. I think it's a...","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Ed Najarian with ISI Group.","Edward R. Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So just 2 quick questions, just to sort of help us with sort of the forecasting outlook a little bit. When I'm thinking about operating costs and I'm looking at that $524 million of operating losses and I understand why it was high in each of the last 2 quarters, but is there any particular reason that, that should stay at this level, or is it reasonable to expect that number to come down fairly significantly in subsequent quarters?","Timothy J. Sloan","I think one way to think about it, Ed, is if you look back on how that's gone up and down over the last year, for example, you've seen quarters where it's been $200 million, $300 million lower. And we're hoping, right, that those operating losses will go down as we continue to put any sort of, particularly legal -- open legal issue behind us. So I hope that's the case.","Edward R. Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","But the vast, vast majority of that number is litigation accrual, correct?","Timothy J. Sloan","A good portion of it is, but we're generally not specific in terms of exactly how much of it is related to litigation accruals.","Edward R. Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, secondarily, when I'm thinking about net interest margin and you talked about the extra 7 basis points primarily from the extra PCI loan resolution income, it seems like you're sort of alluding to the idea that you could get additional margin pressure off of sort of a 3 84 starting point as opposed to a 3 91 starting point. First question, I guess is, is that the right way to think about it? And second question is as you look at the PCI portfolio, should we think it's reasonably likely to expect future quarters where we\u2019ll see some meaningful resolution income?","Timothy J. Sloan","Well, in answer to your last question, we're hopeful that we get meaningful resolution income every quarter. But -- and there's still more to get, right? We're not done with the PCI loan portfolio. Having said that, you hit the nail on the head. That's why we called out the 7 basis points, right, that without that, we would have been in the mid-3 80s. And we know where yields are today on securities, in particular. But again, I think you got to put it in the context of the fact that the majority of our earning assets, 70%, 75% plus, our loans and the yields are within a reasonable range. While we're having the biggest -- we have the biggest impact is on our securities portfolio. But you're right. I think thinking about this in kind of a mid 3 80 number and having some downside from there is a fair way to look at it.","Operator","At this time there are no further questions.","John G. Stumpf","Okay, well, thank you very much for joining us for our second quarter call, and we'll talk to you 90 days from now. Thank you very much. Bye-bye.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you, all, for participating, and you may now disconnect."],"21680":["Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC) Q1 2016 Earnings Conference Call April 14, 2016 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Jim Rowe - Director, IR","John Stumpf - Chairman & CEO","John Shrewsberry - CFO","Analysts","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","John McDonald - Bernstein","Paul Miller - FBR","Erika Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities","Kevin Barker - Piper Jaffray","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets","John Pancari - Evercore ISI","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities","Nancy Bush - NAB Research","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks","Operator","Good morning.

I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Rowe, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Rowe, you may begin your conference.","Jim Rowe","Thank you, Regina and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf; and our CFO, John Shrewsberry, will discuss first quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our first quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website at Wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement.","Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our website.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf.","John Stumpf","Thank you, Jim. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Our performance in the first quarter once again benefited from our diversified business model and our continued focus on meeting our customers\u2019 financial needs. While the persistent low rate environment, market volatility and continued weakness in the oil and gas industry provided some near term headwinds, our long-term results continued to be driven by our focus on the real economy. For example, we are the largest lender in the U.S. and our loan and deposit balances are at an all-time high. ","We continued to grow our customer base both organically and through acquisitions and February was the strongest month for retail bank household growth in five years. We worked to make every relationship, new and existing, a lasting one and our focus on providing outstanding customer service was recognized with Wells Fargo ranking number one in customer loyalty among large banks in the 2016 Customer Loyalty Engagement Index conducted by the firm Brand Keys. ","Let me now highlight our results in the first quarter. We generated earnings of $5.5 billion and EPS of $0.99. We grew revenue compared with a year ago by 4% with growth in both the net interest income and non-interest income and our pre-tax pre-provision profit grew 5%. ","Average loans grew $64 billion or 7% from a year ago. Our deposit franchise once again generated strong customer and balanced growth with average deposits up $44.6 billion or 4% from a year ago, and we grew the number of primary consumer checking customers by 5%. ","While deterioration in the oil and gas portfolio drove a $200 million reserve build, the rest of our loan portfolio continued to have strong credit results with our total net charge-off rate remaining near historical lows at 38 basis points annualized, reflecting the benefit of our diversified loan portfolio. Our strong capital position enabled us to acquire assets from GE Capital and we returned $3 billion to our shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases in the first quarter. ","As you know, yesterday the Federal Reserve and FDIC announced their response to the 2015 resolution plan submitted by eight banks, including Wells Fargo. While we were disappointed to learn that our submission was determined to have deficiencies in certain areas, we are focused on fully addressing these issues as part of our 2016 submission. ","Turning to the economic environment. While signs of economic uncertainty remain in the global economy as well as volatility in the capital markets, the U.S. economy, which is the primary driver of Wells Fargo's results, continues to be resilient. For example, while low energy prices have negatively impacted the oil and gas industry, the U.S. is still a net energy importer and the benefits of falling prices have outweighed the costs for consumers and most businesses. ","Job creation in the U.S. remains robust with 2.7 million jobs added over the past year alone. Consumers have also benefited from low interest rates and modest borrowings. In fact, servicing financial obligations require just 15% of household income at the start of the year, more than a percentage point lower than the long term average and several percentage points lower than what the recession level was in late 2007. ","The housing market continues to do well with steady gains in sales, construction and prices. This improvement has continued to benefit our consumer real estate portfolio where net charge-offs were down 41% from a year ago. Commercial real estate also remained strong with vacancy rates low in apartment, industrial and retail sectors and our CRE portfolio continued to generate net recoveries. ","So while the start of 2016 has shown that the economic recovery remains slow and uneven, we remain focused on the long term drivers of our success, namely: increasing customers, loans, deposits and building capital. This unwavering focus on our diversified business model positions us well to benefit from future growth opportunities. ","John Shrewsberry, our Chief Financial Officer will now provide more details on our first quarter results. John? ","John Shrewsberry","Thanks, John and good morning everyone. My comments will follow the presentation included in the quarterly supplement starting on Page 2. John and I will then answer your questions. ","We had another quarter of solid results. We have now generated quarterly earnings of more than $5 billion for 14 consecutive quarters, one of only two companies in the country to do so, demonstrating the strength of our diversified business model and our consistent risk discipline. ","While earnings declined from a year ago, our results in the first quarter last year included a discrete tax benefit of $359 million or $0.07 per share and a $100 million dollar reserve release. Our results this quarter included a number of noteworthy items. Our revenue benefited from the previously announced sale of our crop insurance business resulting in a $381 million gain recorded in all other non-interest income. ","All other income also included $379 million of hedge ineffectiveness primarily on our own long-term debt hedges reflecting the impact of lower rates and foreign exchange rate fluctuations during the quarter. We would expect the hedge ineffectiveness to be neutral to our results over the life of the hedge relationship but the impact in every quarter will vary. ","We had a $124 million of other-than-temporary-impairment, OTTI, in our debt and equity securities related to oil and gas in the first quarter. The deterioration in the oil and gas portfolio drove the $200 million credit reserve build in the quarter also. I will get into more detail on oil and gas later in the call. ","Expenses included $752 million of seasonally higher employee benefit expenses from higher payroll taxes and 401(k) matching as well as annual equity awards to retirement-eligible team members. Our first quarter results also included the GE Capital acquisitions we completed during the quarter.","On Page 4, we show the strong year-over-year growth John highlighted, including increases in revenue, pretax pre-provision profit, loans and deposits.","Turning to Page 5. Let me highlight a few balance sheet trends. Investment securities declined $12.7 billion from fourth quarter as we paused most of our purchase activity due to the volatility in the bond market. We had $5 billion of gross purchases during the first quarter compared with last year's average of $26 billion per quarter. ","Long-term debt increased $28.4 billion with $23.8 billion of issuances, including $11 billion raised in advance of closing the GE Capital acquisitions. We also assumed $3.6 billion of debt from previous GE Capital securitizations. Short-term investments and Fed funds sold increased $30.4 billion reflecting growth in deposits, long term debt and our disciplined approach in managing liquidity and investment securities during the quarter.","Turning to the income statement overview on Page 6. Revenue increased $609 million from the fourth quarter with growth in both net interest and non-interest income. I will highlight the drivers of this growth throughout the call.","As shown on Page 7, we had continued strong loan growth in the first quarter, up 10% from a year ago and 3% from the fourth quarter. Commercial loans grew $31.6 billion from the fourth quarter, including $24.9 billion from the GE Capital acquisitions and broad-based organic growth. ","Consumer loans declined $923 million from the fourth quarter as growth in first mortgage loans, auto and securities-based lending and student lending was more than offset by reductions in junior lien mortgage and seasonal declines in credit card. ","Our total average loan yield increased 8 basis points from the fourth quarter, reflecting the GE Capital acquisitions as well as the benefit of floating rate loan repricing. ","We added a total of $30.8 billion of loans and leases from the GE capital acquisitions. The benefit of our strong balance sheet and industry expertise enabled us to add these high quality businesses, including talented new team members and valuable customer relationships. This is our largest acquisition since 2008. The integration is on track and we continue to expect it will be modestly accretive in 2016. ","We completed the GE Railcar Services acquisition on January 1, which included $918 million of loans and interest earning leases and $3.2 billion of operating leases reported in other assets. Most of the revenue from this business is reflected in non-interest income as lease income. ","On March 1, we acquired the North American-based portion of GE Capital C&I loans and leases which included $24 billion of loans and interest earning leases and $2.7 billion of operating leases. The remaining $2 billion of assets is expected to close in the second half of the year. The loans and leases we acquired were marked to fair value under the purchase method of accounting so that there was no associated allowance added as a result of these transactions. ","Slide 9 highlights our broad-based loan growth. C&I loans were up $50.5 billion or 19% from a year ago driven by the GE Capital acquisitions and broad-based organic growth. Core one-to-four family first mortgage loans grew $17.3 billion or 8% from a year ago and reflected continued growth in high quality non-conforming mortgage loans. ","Commercial real estate loans grew $15.8 billion or 12% from a year ago, benefiting from the second quarter GE Capital acquisition and organic growth. Auto loans were up $4.3 billion or 8% from last year. We've consistently grown this portfolio in the upper single digits over the past year, reflecting the strong auto market while we have remained disciplined in our approach to credit and pricing. ","Credit card balances were up $3.1 billion or 10% from a year ago, reflecting new accounts and increases in active accounts. Other revolving credit and installment loans were up $2.7 billion or 8% from a year ago with growth in securities based lending, personal lines and loans and student loans.","As highlighted on Page 10, we had $1.2 trillion of average deposits in the first quarter, up $44.6 billion or 4% from a year ago. Our average deposit cost was 10 basis points, up 1 basis point from a year ago and up 2 basis points from the fourth quarter. The slight increase in deposit cost reflected an increase in deposit pricing for some wholesale banking customers. We continue to believe that deposit betas will be lower during this rate cycle than they have been in past periods of rising rates, especially if the outlook for future rate increases remains uncertain.","Page 11 highlights our revenue diversification. Our revenue continued to be relatively balanced between net interest and non-interest income. We grew net interest income $79 million from the fourth quarter, reflecting growth in earning assets, including the partial quarter impact from the assets acquired from GE Capital, the benefit from higher short-term rates and disciplined deposit pricing. These increases were partially offset by reduced income from variable sources, including periodic dividends and loan fees and one less day in the quarter. ","The net interest margin declined 2 basis points from the fourth quarter with lower variable income. All other growth and repricing were essentially neutral to the NIM. We grew net interest income in the first quarter by 6% from a year ago and continue to believe that we can grow net interest income on a full-year basis in 2016 compared with 2015 even if there are no additional rate increases.","Total non-interest income increased $530 million from fourth quarter driven by the increase in all other non-interest income that I highlighted at the start of the call. The non-interest income also benefited from the increase in lease income related to the GE Capital acquisitions we completed in the quarter, which also included related lease depreciation expense. The linked quarter increase in trading gains was due to higher customer accommodation trading results across our markets businesses. The volatile markets we experienced in the first quarter impacted our trust and investment fees which declined $126 million from the fourth quarter. We also had lower debt and equity investment gains down $281 million from the fourth quarter. ","While linked-quarter trends in deposit service charges and card fees were negatively impacted by seasonality, both of these fees grew 8% from a year ago driven by account growth. Mortgage banking revenue declined $62 million from the fourth quarter. Origination volume was $44 billion, down 6% from the fourth quarter due to seasonality but purchase originations were up 13% from a year ago, reflecting a stronger housing market. ","Applications were up 20% from the fourth quarter and we ended the quarter with a $39 billion application pipeline, up 34% from the fourth quarter. We expect origination volume to increase in the second quarter reflecting normal seasonality and strength in the housing market. ","Our production margin on residential held-for-sale mortgage originations was 168 basis points in the first quarter, down 15 basis points from the fourth quarter due to a higher mix of correspondent originations in the first quarter. Releases of our mortgage loan repurchase liability declined $107 million from fourth quarter, which also contributed to lower production revenue. Servicing income increased $120 million from fourth quarter, from higher net MSR servicing hedge results and lower unreimbursed servicing costs. ","As shown on Page 14, expenses increased $429 million from fourth quarter. As I highlighted at the start of the call, the increase was primarily driven by $752 million of seasonally higher personnel expenses in the first quarter. While we will not have the seasonally higher personnel expenses in the second quarter, there are certain expenses that will increase, including salary expense reflecting annual merit increases which became effective late in the first quarter, and certain expenses that are typically lower in the first quarter, such as outside professional services and advertising costs which are also expected to increase. We had $454 million of operating losses primarily driven by litigation expense in the first quarter. ","Now that the FDIC has issued their final rule, I want to update you on the expected impact of the FDIC surcharge that I mentioned on our call last quarter, which is lower than we previously expected. We currently estimate that the surcharge along with a previously approved base rate reduction will increase our total FDIC assessment by approximately $100 million per quarter starting in the third quarter of 2016. Our efficiency ratio was 58.7% in the first quarter and we currently expect to operate at the higher end of our efficiency ratio range of 55% to 59% for the full year 2016. ","Turning to our business segments, starting on Page 15. Community banking earned $3.3 billion in the first quarter, down 7% from a year ago due to the discrete tax benefit we had in the first quarter of 2015 and up 4% from the fourth quarter. We continued to successfully grow retail bank households and increased our primary consumer checking customers which were up 5% from a year ago. This growth along with increased usage and new product offerings benefited our debit and credit card businesses. ","Debit card purchase volume was $72.4 billion in the first quarter, up 9% from a year ago, and credit card purchase volume was $17.5 billion, up 13% from a year ago. Customers are increasingly using our award winning digital offerings with digital active customers up 6% from a year ago, including 17.7 million mobile active users with continued double-digit growth in mobile adoption.","Wholesale banking earned $1.9 billion in the first quarter, down 3% from a year ago and down 9% from the fourth quarter. The decline was driven by the higher provision expense in our oil and gas portfolio. Revenue grew 6% from the fourth quarter with growth in both net interest and non-interest income. This growth was driven by the gain on the sale of our crop insurance business and the benefit of the GE Capital acquisitions. ","Investment banking declined on overall market weakness and some of our commercial real estate related businesses had weaker results coming off a very strong fourth quarter performance. Loan growth remained strong driven by acquisitions and broad-based organic growth with average loans up $49.8 billion or 13% from a year ago, the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth. Average deposit balances declined $3.7 billion from a year ago, reflecting lower international deposits from market volatility and the competitive rate environment. ","Wealth and investment management earned $512 million in the first quarter, down 3% from a year ago, down 14% from the fourth quarter. The year-over-year results reflect a strong balance sheet growth with net interest income up 14% offset by the impact of weak equity market conditions on fee income. The decline in linked quarter results was primarily driven by seasonally higher personnel costs. ","Balance sheet growth remained strong with average deposits up 8% from a year ago and loans up 13%, the 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year loan growth with continued growth in non-conforming mortgage loans and securities based lending. ","We successfully completed our recruiting of financial advisors pursuant to our agreement with Credit Suisse. We were able to recruit substantially all of the advisors that we targeted. We are pleased with the success we've had recruiting these financial advisors and look forward to their contributions to our continued growth in wealth management.","Turning to Page 18. Credit results continued to benefit from our diversified portfolio with only 38 basis points of annualized net charge-offs. Net charge-offs increased $55 million from the fourth quarter, including an increase of $87 million from our oil and gas portfolio. ","While our oil and gas portfolio remains under stress due to low prices and excess leverage in the industry, the rest of our loan portfolios have performed well. Non-performing assets increased $706 million from the fourth quarter, we had $1.1 billion in higher oil and gas non-accruals and $343 million in nonaccrual loan from the GE Capital acquisitions which was within our acquisition underwriting assumptions. These increases were partially offset by lower residential and commercial real estate non-accruals and lower foreclosed assets. ","As I mentioned earlier, we had a $200 million reserve build during the quarter as continued improvements in our residential real estate portfolio were more than offset by higher oil and gas reserves. Since first quarter 2015 we have released $1.8 billion of allowance that was allocated to our residential real estate portfolios while providing $1.4 billion of additional allowance allocated to our oil and gas portfolio, demonstrating the advantage of our diversified loan portfolio. The total allowance now stands at $12.7 billion. ","Slide 19 highlights the characteristics of our oil and gas portfolio, which is less than 2% of total loans outstanding. We had $17.8 billion of oil and gas loans outstanding at the end of the first quarter, up $474 million from the fourth quarter, including $236 million in loans acquired from GE Capital. The remaining increase was driven by utilization of existing lines primarily in the E&P sector. The composition of our portfolio has remained relatively stable with 55% of our outstandings to the E&P sector, 21% to midstream and 24% to service companies. ","Approximately 7% or $1.2 billion of our outstandings to investment grade companies based on public ratings. However there are other factors that are important to consider when assessing the quality of these loans. Our loans are primarily to middle market companies that we know well and have worked closely with across cycles. Of the approximately 100 bankruptcies that have occurred in the industry since the start of 2015, only eleven of our borrowers have filed during that time. ","Our outstandings also included $819 million of second lien and $374 million of mezzanine loans. Our total oil and gas loan exposure which includes unfunded commitments and loans outstanding was down $1.3 billion or 3% from the fourth quarter with declines across all three sectors. This decline reflected reductions to existing credit facilities in part from spring redeterminations and net charge-offs. Approximately 34% of our unfunded commitments were to investment grade companies as their line utilization is generally lower. In addition to our exposure to oil and gas in our loan portfolio, we also had a total of $2.4 billion in our securities portfolio.","Slide 20 highlights the credit performance of our oil and gas portfolio as we work through this cycle. The sector's performance has been driven by a number of factors that cumulatively have impacted loan quality. In addition to low oil and gas prices, cash flows and collateral values have been impacted by reduced production, run-off of hedges and limited additional cost levers. Reduced access to capital markets has also impacted borrowers\u2019 financial condition. As a result of these factors we had $204 million of net charge-offs in the first quarter. There were no losses from the midstream sector during the quarter.","Non-accrual loans were $1.9 billion. We reviewed our loan portfolio on a loan-by-loan basis and placed loans on non-accrual status when the full and timely collection of contractual interest or principal becomes uncertain, and loans are written down to net realizable value when appropriate.","Approximately 90% of the non-accrual is recurrent on interest and principal. Payments received on these loans are applied to reducing principal which decreases future losses. Substantially all of our non-accrual loans are senior secured. ","Given the conditions in the industry, criticized loans which include non-accrual loans increased 57% of the portfolio reflecting continued downward credit migration. This migration reflects changes in the borrower's financial condition. Reflecting the downward credit migration, our allocated allowance for the oil and gas portfolio increased $504 million to $1.7 billion. This portion of the allowance was 9.3% of total oil and gas loans outstanding. But as I've noted before, the entire $12.7 billion allowance is available to absorb credit losses inherent in the total loan portfolio. ","Turning to Slide 21. In addition to building allowance for our oil and gas portfolio, we continue to focus on other areas where the trends in the oil and gas industry may impact performance as we manage through the cycle. For example, we have assessed regions of the country and have been monitoring 15 regions in eight states where greater than 3% of employment is directly tied to oil production and are also monitoring performance in Houston and Alaska, neither of which have 3% of employment directly tied to oil production. ","We're tracking changes in outstandings, utilization, delinquency rates, FICO scores and LTV migration across our consumer portfolios in these regions and having outperformed the rest of our portfolio for the past several years consumer delinquencies in oil dependent regions have increased and are roughly in line with the performance in non oil concentrated communities. We currently anticipate further deterioration and while we remain committed to serving our customers, we\u2019ve tightened our underwriting standards across our consumer portfolios in oil dependent regions. ","We're also actively monitoring commercial real estate exposure on a loan-by-loan basis in geographies highly correlated to the oil and gas industry. Our CRE and energy management teams are working closely together and coordinating monitoring activities. Our total exposure is manageable and these loans are generally structured with significant cash equity and various other credit enhancements. ","In summary, we are actively monitoring the impact from the disruption in the oil and gas industry in all areas of our business and we're working closely with all impacted customers. We've increased the size of our workout team and the senior members of our credit team are devoting significant time to monitoring our exposures. We've started the spring redeterminations and are decreasing borrowing bases. We\u2019re proactively reviewing credit agreements and modifying credit terms and commitment amounts accordingly. ","While the level of losses we have in our oil and gas portfolio will continue to be impacted by the volatility and stress in the industry and it will take time to move through this part of the cycle, the experience of managing through many cycles will continue to be beneficial to our overall performance. ","Turning to Page 22. Our capital levels remained strong with our estimated common equity tier one ratio fully phased in at 10.6% in the first quarter, well above the regulatory minimum buffers and our internal buffer. Our strong capital generation positioned us to deploy capital for the assets acquired from GE while continuing to return capital to our shareholders. We issued 35.5 million common shares in the first quarter reflecting seasonally higher employee benefit plan activity. But we still reduced our common shares outstanding by 16.2 million shares through share repurchases of 51.7 million. Our net payout ratio was 60% in the first quarter.","In summary, our first quarter results demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model as we continued to produce strong financial results in an environment that included some near-term headwinds. Our consistent focus on executing on our vision continued to benefit our fundamental drivers of long term growth, including adding customers, loans and deposits while maintaining our strong capital position. We look forward to providing you more details on the strength of our business model while highlighting the quality of our team at our investor day on May 24. John and I will now answer your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin ","Just on the reserving and energy question -- thanks for the color John. So it seems like you've had a little bit more of the acceleration we've seen so far of those who have reported as far as the actual losses and the reserve build as well. How do we just get the understanding from here of the kind of pace of potential reserve additions? And then underneath that, are we effectively at the point where many benefits from lingering consumer reserve have kind of moved past? Thanks. ","John Shrewsberry","Well, on the second part of your question, it\u2019s tough to say. Now we\u2019re analyzing the reserve every quarter and to the extent that there's continued improvement in consumer real estate in particular, it\u2019s certainly possible that that produces incremental benefit that absorbs some of what's happening on the oil and gas side, that's been true for a while and it may continue to be true for a while. Housing -- housing has been strong and that doesn't feel likely to reverse course right now. But again we only know at the end of the quarter. ","With respect to the pace or the trend of incremental reserving throughout the year. We're constantly reassessing borrower quality, we're doing a semi-annual borrowing base redetermination on E&P loans where we are in the middle of the spring redetermination period right now, call it 20%, 25% have been completed, so we'll have the rest of that information, that's name by name, capital structure by capital structure. So that will continue to inform things and we've definitely taken steps or -- for example, categorize loans as non-performing even if we haven't completed their spring redetermination. But my sense is there's more information there. So this is going to go on for a while. We\u2019re in the $40 context today, we were in the 30\u2019s for a while. Some of these capital structures just need to be restructured. That will take some time. And my assumption is that we're going to be talking about this all year. I don't know that we'll continue to reserve at this pace all year. Because we feel great about a reserve at the end of the first quarter and it reflects everything that we know. But I'd be hesitant to tell you that this was the big quarter, or this was the quarter, things will unfold as they're going to unfold depending on what happens with what prices, both spot and forward and the pace of restructurings of services and E&P companies. ","John Stumpf","Ken, to remind you that, I mentioned that residential real estate losses were down 41% year over year. And I think that sometimes goes a bit unnoticed. When we went into the downturn, we had over $100 billion of pick-a-pay loans and over $100 billion of home equity loans and those were the two toughest residential portfolios. Today those portfolios are less than half of what we started with and the performance is really really good. So there is a lot of momentum on that side that has been \u2013 that\u2019s happened over the last few years, but especially in the last year or two. ","Ken Usdin ","That's a fair point, John. Thanks for that. And just one follow up, on the redeterminations and the structuring, John, how far ahead can you get a redetermination? I get your point that we're only 25% through the spring. But have you already been able to get ahead of that just in terms of anticipation or you can only make those adjustments when we get there? And then also with the price back up, do we go into spring redetermination using a $40 plus starting point or do you still end up being much more punitive in terms of how you discount and how you redetermine? ","John Stumpf","Yes, I think that the price tag for this cycle is -- the front month is more in the mid 30s context. And it's a curve that you're using not just the spot price but we\u2019re probably 20% lower across our price deck curve in the spring versus where we were six months ago. And believe me that's not the only item that impacts the outcome. It's what's been going on with incremental exploration -- what are the reserves in terms of quantity and a variety of other things. But in terms of getting in front of it, as I said we're categorizing loans as non-performing. We're recognizing loss \u2013 these loss determinations, the $200 million that we've taken, that's our own credit folks determining that there is -- that there's something to be done, it\u2019s not as a result of a final resolution or a workout or the completion of a bankruptcy plan. And we can do that even before we've completed redetermination. So from an impact to Wells Fargo point of view, we're always trying to stay out in front of it. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein.","John McDonald ","Hi, I'll switch it up. In terms of net interest income, John, how much have you benefited from the December hike in the first quarter? Have all the variable loans repriced and will there be additional pull through benefit from that December hike into the second quarter? ","John Shrewsberry","So our estimation is that we've gotten the full benefit of the December rate hike. The benefit on the asset side, the cost on the liability side, we talked about the impact on deposits which has been negligible. And so I think that's in the run rate at this point. ","John McDonald ","And then question for John Stumpf. What's the market like John for additional portfolio purchases? That's part one, and then part two is in terms of broader M&A, because of your size and favored nation status you're the kind of preferred name for news reporters and others that speculate on M&A for big financial companies, and since a lot's changed around the environment the last few years, can you just remind us your strategy around M&A, maybe how it's different than when you were smaller and how Dodd-Frank and Too Big To Fail might affect your view on acquisitions going forward? ","John Stumpf","Sure. As you probably know and those who know us well, 97% of the revenue we produce is from U.S. based customers, consumers, small business men and women, middle market large customers. And while we love our international business, it\u2019s mostly in support of our U.S. based businesses. And we have leadership positions in most of the businesses in which we do. And we don't set out to be number one, just to be number one. We work really hard and if we do really -- we provide great products and services and great value we grow because of that. ","There's a couple of areas where we are sub-optimized that we are working hard to grow. One of those, I think the most attractive area would be the area that David Carroll runs in wealth investment management. You heard me say a number of times where we have 11% of the deposits or so in the country and just a fraction of that in terms of wealth assets here, even though we have a powerful wonderful group of leaders and advisors across the geography, we could still do a lot more business. There\u2019s a lot of our customers who call us their bank who have their wealth away. So we're working hard organically. That business has been growing double digits. If there was an opportunity to add something in that area that would make sense terrific. If there's not, that's also terrific. ","On the consumer side, we have leadership in terms of distribution of our online activity, of our checking activity, or debit activity but not a credit card activity even though we've grown that significantly internally, about over 43% of our customers who have their primary account here have a credit card. But that's an area that, that would be opportunistic. We've been doing a great job organically, if there\u2019d be some opportunities along the line that would make sense we would surely consider that. But I would think of it this way, John. I would think of it that we have all that we need right now. And if something became available that we thought would be a bolt on, that would help us in those areas specifically but other areas generally, sure we\u2019d look at that. But that's our focus right now, our best opportunity to grow long term shareholder values here, value creation is doing more or just doing it better. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR & Company.","Paul Miller ","A lot of clients, a lot of questions that I have been getting is that yeah, energy, a lot of people might be reserved good for energy, but the second or third derivative of energy was a lot of the growth of this economy over the last year or two, and since energy is starting to struggle, that the economy's got in a recession, I know you've heard of it. But what are you seeing on the second and third derivatives on the credit book? Are you seeing any real deterioration in CRE markets in some of these areas like Texas where probably energy is hitting the hardest? ","John Shrewsberry","Sure. Well, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks in the consumer portfolios, all of them were growing, MSA by MSA and comparing the performance of our borrowers in the areas that are highly levered to energy. That the greater than 3% employment is one measure that we use but we've also included Houston for example to your point about Texas being hard hit even though it doesn't qualify with the 3% employment trigger. And what we've discovered is those areas have been performing better than average for a long time, no surprise, because that's where all the growth has been coming from and they're starting to look more average. So whether it's measures of delinquency, in some cases measures of LTV based on what's changing in asset values, they look a little bit more average. So it doesn't feel like it\u2019s a at least at this point that it's another shoe to drop in the short term. But as you expect less employment, people will \u2013 loans will perform differently. ","In commercial real estate, which is where we have a big presence, we've recently done a deep dive in Texas in particular. And office vacancies are somewhat higher in the Houston area, no surprise, I think about 20% including sublease space. Multifamily is a little bit weaker. And so we're looking at that first and foremost frankly with respect to what it means to our risk, to our own portfolio and we feel fine about what our exposures are there. But those are things that those regions are going to have to grapple with. So when it comes to growth rates or people who have more concentrated exposures than that, that probably is the first second order what people are going to have to look out for. More broadly speaking, I think we still feel we're in a 2% environment. There are obvious pockets of strength around the country but when you move out of oil and gas, we're in the same low growth, better consumer, strong employment environment that we've been operating in for a couple of years, not enough to make it feel like rates are going to move as a result of it but not enough to feel like we're stalling either. ","John Stumpf ","Paul, if I can just give you an anecdotal. I lived in Texas for six years in the mid to late 90\u2019s, so 20 years ago and there was a period of time there -- there was volatility in the oil and gas space. And there was some challenges. And I've been back, I was just in Houston last week. And I've been back a number of times in the last year and things do feel different 20 years later. It's a much more diverse economy. And if you take Texas generally but Houston specifically and it feels different this time around. Downturns are always heard. Volatile markets always have an impact. But this feels different this time because of what the state has done to diversify their economy.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. ","Erika Najarian ","So my first question is actually a follow-up to John\u2019s question. My conversations with investors have often paired well just to be frank with either large credit card companies or there is clearly the rumor for Wells potentially buying a large investment bank which you formally denied. As we think about what you were saying, John, about looking at bolt-on opportunities, should we think about the deal size as sizes that are manageable enough that maybe sort of \u2013 the real stop here is Wells Fargo not moving up the SIFI surcharge? As we think about the opportunity for non-organic growth, should we think about sort of the hard stop in terms of size being that, you would like to keep your SIFI surcharge where it is today?","John Stumpf ","Erika, here's how I think about it. I think about Wells Fargo as an organic growth company. We have -- I've been here almost 35 years and I have probably been involved in \u2013 if there\u2019s 250 acquisitions we've done with all different companies, as we come to the modern Wells Fargo, I\u2019ve probably been involved in half of those, just because it happened during my career time. And they're hard to do. There is a lot of work in those things and we now have a company that is the best company I have ever worked for, the strongest brand, the best people, the furthest reach, the deepest relationship, the long enduring customer, thing so. So \u2013 and we are very very careful buyers. And I see us as has a lot of opportunity to grow, as I said organically. If something -- and what we've done in the last four or five years have been largely bolt on, I would say GE was a bigger, a little bigger bolt-on. But those are the kind of opportunistic things that make sense for our team, for our customers and ultimately for our shareholders. After all this is your money, our investors' money that we are the stewards of. ","So it would be out of character for us to do something that would be -- have a high degree of risk and a low degree of shareholder reward on it. That's just not who we are. ","Erika Najarian ","Thank you, John, that was very clear. My second question is just looking to capital return, since you have been CCAR participant, it seems like your GAAP earnings volatility is the least among your large peers. As we look forward -- obviously you can't tell us about this year\u2019s CCAR submission -- but as you look forward, how are you feeling about potentially continuing to push on that 30% dividend \u2013 implicit dividend ceiling?","John Stumpf ","It's hard to comment on that during the middle of the CCAR cycle. But I admire you for asking. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matt O'Connor ","I just want to delve into a couple of potential earnings levers going forward. I guess the first one would be, as we think about the liquidity that you've built, since you chose not to reinvest as much in the securities book, how are you thinking about that pool of funds going forward and there's not really any signs that rates are going to rise materially as we think about market rates, we\u2019re obviously off the bottom. But what's your approach to managing that liquidity from here?","John Shrewsberry","So it will be informed week by week, quarter by quarter as we assess the likelihood of increases in both short and consequently long term rates. We won\u2019t sit idly on continuous increases in cash forever. We're going to have to put some of it to work, we\u2019re very cautious about what it means entering at these levels in terms of capital impact in the future, if a subsequent rate rise does occur that's obviously a big issue for us. And we'd like to be smart about our entry points. But if we're going to hover in the 170s, just to pick a number on the ten year and with mortgage rates where they are, then there will be some amount of redeployment. We\u2019ll probably talk about it a little bit more at investor day. But it was really the abrupt market volatility that happened after the first of the year that caused us to say, let's take a pause here and figure out where this is going to settle out. It's happened to have settled out not much above the low points, at least again on a ten-year from January, early February. But that is an earnings lever when and if we redeploy.","Matt O'Connor ","And then just separately on the expenses, maybe just talk about \u2013 is there any kind of change or even tweak on the approach to expense management given maybe weaker revenues and some of the ongoing pressures in energy likely lingering? ","John Stumpf","There is a continuous drumbeat and a high level of vigilance around how we spend all of our business as usual types of dollars, we\u2019re constantly trying to find levers and ways to be more efficient to streamline to make things consistent. We've provided some examples of that in the past in certain areas there. At the same time we've talked about the investment that we're making in technology, the investments that we\u2019re making in product capability, the investments that we\u2019re making in risk management compliance and being a better firm. Those are going to be elevated for some time and they have been for some time. We're still comfortable in our 55% to 59% range which is where we've guided that, I don't need to remind you but that is a very attractive level for a firm of our size. We think we're pretty lean overall. But it's because we take this seriously day in and day out looking for ways to be efficient. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura. ","Bill Carcache ","Thank you. Good morning. Of your borrowers who drew on their oil and gas lines this quarter, was there any notable deterioration in their credit profile? I was just trying to understand the extent to which heightened degrees of financial stress is a factor, leading your borrowers to draw down their lines. And although you mentioned that your current reserve reflects everything that you currently know today. I was wondering how you're thinking about the probability that more and more of your unfunded exposure will eventually become funded as we move deeper into the credit cycle? ","John Shrewsberry","Sure, that's a good question, and of course we absolutely have to make estimates about what we think the exposure at default would be for any borrower who's got a remaining unfunded commitment, that's how the process works. In the quarter there were some of these, what you might characterize as defensive draws that we've observed, not that many of them. You can see the increase in the total outstandings in oil and gas rose by about $400 million and about half of that was from frankly leases that we picked up from GE that have a credit mark in them incidentally. So it really didn't amount to that much. But it is a phenomenon that we've seen, that we've read about. It isn't having that big of an impact today but we do think that we're capturing that risk as we assess what the appropriate size is of our allowance for both funded and unfunded commitments in the space. ","Bill Carcache ","So when I guess a previously unfunded energy loan commitment becomes funded, how does that transition from unfunded -- funded impact your allowance, I guess I think generally the reserve rate on unfunded commitment is lower than it is on funded commitments but just trying to understand the reserving dynamics there of shifting from one bucket to the other? ","John Shrewsberry","So in the calculation of the allowance and the migration of credit that leads up to our \u2013 whether we consider a borrower relationship to be non-performing or what status we're marking at, we're imagining on a credit by credit basis what the exposure at default would be if it is meaning that it could be greater than the currently outstanding amount. That's part of the loan by loan process, analysis by analysis that we do when building it -- when rewriting loans every quarter and building up for the allowance. So there's some estimation of what today is currently unfunded will become funded in the future.","Bill Carcache ","Thank you, and if I can just ask a final follow up. Can you discuss the methodology underlying your energy reserve, is it based more on the ability of borrowers to repay their loans through cash flow generation or is it more a kind of reliant on collateral coverage based on reserves in the ground? There are some reports suggesting that regulators are less happy with collateral coverage and I was wondering if you could kind of speak specifically to the approach that Wells Fargo has taken? ","John Stumpf","Well, it's a combination of both. And they're highly correlated for E&P companies in particular. But if their sources of repayment both principal and interest in full and on time and we\u2019re taking into account our projections of their cash flows, and we're taking into account our projections of the value of collateral that we might have to liquidate in order to get paid back or that they might have to liquidate in order to pay us back. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray.","Kevin Barker ","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I just want to switch gears here and look at your auto exposure. You're obviously one of the largest auto lenders in the country and you\u2019re growing that portfolio by roughly 30% over the last three years. Given what we've seen in the industry and some deterioration in the subprime portfolios, could you help us get an understanding of what your expectations are through the rest of this year and into 2017 given the state of the auto industry and how hot it\u2019s been over the last couple of years?","John Stumpf","Sure. Well, we\u2019ve \u2013 I think we've been pretty public with the fact that we're going to hold our ground with respect to what we think our quality loan terms and borrower profile, and we've actually seen our share slip a little bit as the overall size of the auto finance market has kept pace with the sale of autos, new cars in particular that has been at a record level now for a few years. And we were number one, I think we're number two right now and we\u2019re bidding on buying the loans that we like at terms that we think are good risk reward and we're passing on those that we don\u2019t. Some of the things that feel a little bit different right now, I mean seasonally obviously we're in a better place in Q1 than Q4 just because those loans behave that way, collections and losses are lower in the first quarter than they are in the fourth quarter. It's a little bit -- things are a little bit elevated first quarter to first quarter but we're still from a risk adjusted basis well within the bands to which we underwrite each level of credit risk in autos that we buy. Where we've always had our eye on the elevated level of used car auction prices, the Manheim Index in particular is evidence that we point to get a sense for whether loss given default is going to be worse in the future than it is today or in the recent past and that index has been down I think 3% linked quarter, 2% year over year. So all things being equal we'd expect severity to be a little bit worse when repossessions occur. ","But having said that we're still not in a bad place. We've allowed our market leading position to slip a little bit, let other people buy the loans that don't make sense for us, it\u2019s still a great business for us and has been for a long time. We work very closely with dealers, have a big floor plan business, we have a big commercial banking business with the dealership community. And we're in this for the long haul. One more thing I guess, we've observed is because the ABS market has been under pressure, some of the probably most aggressive players in the subprime space have a little bit of a funding challenge I think in this environment that may soften things up a little bit. Those are my current observations. ","Kevin Barker ","So just to follow up on that, I mean, are you seeing better risk adjusted returns in sub prime auto versus prime auto right now and are you growing the subprime auto portfolio at effective rate?","John Stumpf","We've sort of held the line. Using our own approach to what a subprime borrower and sub-prime dealer is we've limited ourselves to at about 10% of our originations which is amounted to about 10% of our outstandings that we\u2019d consider to be -- we consider to be subprime. There's often an opportunity to grow that if we wanted to, we've chosen not to. And we like the risk return that we get in where we choose to participate in that space. It's performed very well. It's priced for the risk and it frankly doesn't compete directly with some of the specialty finance companies that are in that space, they tend to be a little bit deeper and they're running a different business. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital. ","Joe Morford ","I guess, first, just a quick follow up on Ken\u2019s question at the outset. Just I was curious how much the increased oil and gas reserving a provision this quarter can be attributed to the shared national credit exam. ","John Stumpf","I\u2019d say very little. And the exam came and went and it worked out fine, there weren\u2019t a lot of disagreements on how we rate loans and also the guidance around leverage levels et cetera was introduced and that didn't have much of an impact on it. This is just \u2013 these are our folks using consistent methodology making determinations on when loans should be non-performing, when we should take loss et cetera. ","Joe Morford ","That's very helpful, thanks. I guess the other question was just, wondering if you could talk a bit more about the \u2013 how the GE Capital business integrations are going and how are you feeling currently about the potential for cross selling or revenue synergies. And also just wondering if you can quantify the impact we may see in the second quarter from a full run rate of expenses? ","John Stumpf","I like the first part of the question better. But it is a big opportunity. So this is early stages, this is an important and big integration. So It'll take a full year or two to get where we need to go into transition all of the services away from GE and over to Wells Fargo and get things running. I'm happy to say that the early reports are that we're doing great with customers and team members. I think we imagine that there's a real opportunity with these customers. These are businesses where GE has been an absolute leader and they've done that with credit. So now we've got that credit capability and that credit willingness and the perfect business model for that but we also have all of the other. wholesale banking products and services, wealth management services et cetera to bring to bear on this client group. So it will take a while to work with each relationship and find out what they're doing that might be done at Wells Fargo in addition to their credit but my sense is it will be a great adoption over time and that's part of what makes it such a high value opportunity for Wells Fargo.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI.","John Pancari ","Just a couple more questions on energy and then on expenses. On energy, what percentage of that 1.2 billion in second lien exposure that you provided is nonperforming; do you have that? ","John Shrewsberry","Yeah. Let's see. $113 million of the combined second lien and mezzanine, it today is categorized as non-accrual.","John Pancari ","And what is your energy criticized ratio as of March 31? I know last quarter it was 38% approximately. ","John Shrewsberry","Yeah. It's 57% now. And that reflects the environment that we\u2019re in, that reflects what's going on with the stress of the borrowers, that's what -- that migration is what leads us to provide more reserve. ","John Pancari ","And then through the 25% of the spring redeterminations that you completed, what's been the average reduction in borrowing base that you have seen?","John Shrewsberry","Well, so I guess I'd start by saying that 50%, 60% have actually had a reduction in the borrowing base. A quarter had no change in the borrowing base. And the balance actually had an increase in the borrowing base because of more reserves that were included in the borrowing base. But without getting too specific on the amount of the reserve for people who had a reduction, it was relatively significant and frankly reflected the curve that we're using today versus where we would have been a quarter ago. ","John Pancari ","And then lastly on the expense side, could you just give us a little more color on, why the incentive comp increases much as it did this quarter particularly on the backdrop of some of the revenue hedging? ","John Shrewsberry","Yeah, it's not really incentive comp so much. It\u2019s -- think about FICA resetting in the first quarter, contributions to our 401(k) happened in the first quarter. And then for people who are retirement eligible -- there's lots of people at Wells Fargo who get an annual equity incentive as part of their pay, for most people it vests over a few years and the impact bleeds in over the vesting period. If you're already retirement eligible it all hits in the quarter that is granted because it's immediately vested. And that's why the first quarter has that extra impact. It's not so much about -- commissions and incentives are piece of it but it's just -- it reflects the actual business activity that's happening.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck ","Couple questions, one and I'll get the energy one out of the way first. So I think you mentioned 25% of your loans went through the redeterminations process in the quarter; is that right? ","John Shrewsberry","That\u2019s just where we happen to be to date for the spring redetermination, the rest of them are underway. It's a borrower by borrower analysis. ","Betsy Graseck ","So as of the ones that were finished during the quarter, how much incremental reserve was required? Is that what drove the reserve up? ","John Shrewsberry","What drives the reserve up is our categorization of the loan as -- generally speaking as non-accrual or non-performing, meaning that we think there's a chance that we won't get full and timely repayment of every dollar of principal and interest. That can certainly come about in connection with the redetermination but it can come about for other reasons as well just in terms of our review of the company's overall performance, the value of their collateral, what their prospects are. So it's not really a linear \u2013 but you can't really draw a line between the redetermination specifically and the change in reserves. ","Betsy Graseck ","It could have some impact but \u2013 ","John Shrewsberry","It would definitely have an impact, if we reduce somebody\u2019s availability and if they were drawn above their availability and we actually had a moment of reckoning where they had to write a check, that will accelerate that analysis, because they will have something that they have to do right then and there. There aren't that many instances of that. ","Betsy Graseck ","It's just that as we go through the rest of the 75% of redetermination for the spring, that could drive some more expense reserve requirements. ","John Shrewsberry","It could. I mean it could. We capture a lot of that in our general assessment in our risk rating before having the actual results of the redetermination. But it certainly could. ","Betsy Graseck ","And then just a question on recent balance sheet. So you brought down Fed funds a bit, is that right? ","John Shrewsberry","We\u2019re up. We were $30 billion higher in cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter because we were less active in the bond market. ","Betsy Graseck ","And that was mostly because of your view on rates and where you wanted to reinvest? ","John Shrewsberry","Yes. ","Betsy Graseck ","So a 25 bp increase in rates today, are you in a more asset sensitive position now because of that? ","John Shrewsberry","I think that's right. ","Betsy Graseck ","Any sizing or \u2013 ","John Shrewsberry","No, we are more asset sensitive as a result. We also have more long term debt that came under in the quarter. So there's a handful of things going on at the same time. But at the margin we're probably a little bit more asset sensitive. ","Betsy Graseck ","And then on the redeployment into securities, I know, you might want to have a higher rate to redeploy into, but is there a point where you say you know what, I wanted to but it's been 17 for five, six, seven, eight months whatever it is, I am going to start to redeploy some of my cash into longer duration paper. I mean, can you just give us a sense as to how you think about? ","John Shrewsberry","Well, that is the discussion that we're having it regularly in our ALCO meetings with the board et cetera. My sense is that in this low rate environment we\u2019d probably not go as far out in terms of duration so that we were taking less capital risk even though the dollar for dollar return would be a little bit lower. But it's the tradeoff between foregone earnings, capital sensitivity and a handful of other things that we're having to assess and we're doing it with our best estimate of where we think rates are going and what happens if they don't go there. And so the long and the short of it is I don't think that we're going to continue to build cash balances like we did in the first quarter. But we know we're reassessing every day to make a determination on at what entry point and at what point in the curve we\u2019re interested in putting on more duration risk.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Mike Mayo ","Hi, how much did the GE acquisitions add to EPS this quarter and what do you expect it to add for the rest of the year? ","John Shrewsberry","So we're not breaking out what it added during the quarter. And what we're saying is we think it will be modestly accretive for the rest of the year. And it really is about what it costs to transition people, technology, premises etc. throughout the remainder of the year. We'll update that as we move along and we've got more information about how those costs are actually coming in and being spent. But I\u2019ll tell you that the average asset yield for those assets reflects the same kind of loan mix that we have in wholesale banking in general and the expectation once it's -- once they're fully integrated and we've finished our process is that they will carry the same type of efficiency ratio as the average wholesale lending business. ","John Stumpf","Actually Mike, in the first quarter it was a little bit of -- couple moving parts here, we actually, if you will, pre-funded the liability side, meaning that we've raised the debt to fund this and that was on the books at the start of the quarter and most of the loans only came on March 1. So there's a lot of stuff going on in the first quarter. But there's one month worth of really revenue if you will.","Mike Mayo ","So three months of funding, one month of revenues, so you'll see the full benefit in the second quarter. I was just wondering if you could size that a little bit more. ","John Shrewsberry","Well, we're talking about $30-ish billion worth of assets and the same type of loan yields that we have on average in wholesale, which gets you to a revenue number. What we're not specifically breaking out is what the expense impact is until we understand what the full integration expenses are. But you'll see $350 million per quarter of NII from the loans and leases themselves. ","Mike Mayo ","And how much of that did you have in the first quarter, the $350 million? ","John Shrewsberry","Well, so as John said we had one month of the revenue side of it. We had not quite three months worth of the funding cost because we weren\u2019t fully funded for those three months. But more than one month's worth of funding costs about that. ","Mike Mayo ","And then separately, John, did I hear you correctly, you said benefits of falling oil prices offset the costs. I think you said that at the start of the call. ","John Stumpf","Yeah, I said -- since we're still a net importer of energy and what's interesting, Mike, is that much of that savings at the consumer level have been saved, if you will, and have not yet been spent. So not all the savings at the pump. What consumers have done and that not exclusively but they're saving more of that what's happening at the pump as opposed to spending it.","Mike Mayo ","And how do you see that? In other words, when oil prices go down, the stock market declines, bank stocks sell off. And you're saying the market's wrong with that. What do you see in your business that you think maybe the market has wrong in how they think about oil prices? ","John Stumpf","I don't \u2013 I have long stopped trying to figure out the market and why bank stocks or stocks seem to move in concert with commodity prices especially oil prices but be that as it may, the consumer, much of this economy, 60%, 70% is consumer based and in retail and the consumers have never been in better shape. I mentioned in my comments just the debt service requirements is 15% of their earnings and wage is certain of up a little that and we're seeing savings rates go up. These are some of the strongest savings rates we've seen in some time. I don't know if that\u2019s a statement about confidence or whatever but there is -- consumers are benefiting from filling your tank at the dollar something a gallon or two dollars a gallon versus three or four and not all of it has been spent.","Mike Mayo ","And then the last question, just give us a sneak preview of the investor conference. What do you hope to achieve at the investor conference and do you think you will have a director show up again at?","John Stumpf","Well, thank you Mike for reminding everybody that Steve Sanger, our lead director showed up last time. Obviously we invite our directors and just give me a chance to invite all of you. It's on the 24th of next month, it\u2019s a Tuesday. We have an exciting day to share with you. We will get very granular about how we think about distribution, how we think about our businesses. It will give us a chance to showcase next generation leaders in the company. So we're looking forward to it. We also will think about Guardrails around our three big metrics, we talk about ROA, ROE, and efficiency ratio, if I talk about that, so it's a bunch of things. And also everybody talks about FIN Tax and clearly there's a good reason for that. I think our company specifically and our industry generally have been innovators for a whole long time. So if we weren't we'd have stagecoaches on the freeway right now. So we\u2019ll talk a little bit about that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities.","Eric Wasserstrom ","There's been some recent media attention to the buildout you've been doing in some of your advisory and capital markets capacities. And I'm wondering what your -- how you view that now in light of course the broader marketplace for those services which may be under some pressure and then also the fact that your exposure specifically to the energy industry within those business lines is a bit higher than peers. Is that changing your interest in investment in those areas? ","John Stumpf","Not really. The pattern has been the same since the merger of Wells and Wachovia to make sure that we've got the right level of capability for capital raising and advisory activity and hedging and risk management activity for our corporate and commercial customers and other customers of Well Fargo who need it. We think our risks are well sized, we think our capabilities are well sized. As always, as you point out there are things to add here and there but from a return point of view, from an ability to service our customers point of view, we like the trajectory we've taken. That's why it's so easy to respond pretty quickly when people speculate that we might be thinking about adding an investment bank to our mix or something. That's not what we need. What we need is what we have today and more great people like it to serve more customers but we're not thinking much differently about it. Our results frankly were -- we think they're pretty good in the first quarter. As you say we have been a leader in capital raising and advisory work for the energy industry for a while. There will be plenty more need for that as the industry repairs itself and being in a position to provide that is actually it's good for us. ","We've got industry leading positions in a handful of other industries as well, energy is just one of them. But like others it's a cyclical business and while there is less capital raising going on there right now there's more going on in other spaces and a lot of advisory work to do. So it fits together very nicely with our wholesale bank. ","Eric Wasserstrom ","And is your intent to continue to add personnel into those business lines? ","John Stumpf","Yes I think so. We're always -- we're always \u2013 as I say industries come and go with respect to their capital needs and advisory needs and so we want to make sure that we've got the right people in positions to do the right thing, where we become an employer of choice for a lots of those activities. Wells Fargo is a very nice place to work. We've got a great customer franchise who wouldn't want to work here in those businesses compared to some of the places that they might be coming from and we're always adding good people. ","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research. ","Nancy Bush ","And John, it kind of got lost in the hoopla yesterday about the living wills. But there was a Reuters news item that says Wells Fargo has become significantly more important to the health of the global financial system in the past few years, says a report by the office of financial research. And it strikes me with what came out in the resolution letters yesterday that maybe being too important to the global financial system may not be an entirely good thing. And I'm wondering if you feel at this point that your growth or lines of business your plans for those might be impacted by these findings. ","John Shrewsberry","So Nancy, we went and looked at that report after that wacky headline hit the cave and. And it reported the same thing it reported a year ago which is that we're number seventeen among GSIBs in the lowest risk category among globally systemically important banks. So there's no basis for that story. We are a big bank, we are globally systemically important and we're used to being measured. But we ended up toward the bottom of that list. So that was a funny conclusion that was drawn. ","With respect to the feedback that we got in the living wills. There are some actionable things that we're going to get right on. But there's nothing about size, about complexity, about the nature of our business model, about our capital, about our liquidity. And really it was much more around proper governance and maturation of the process et cetera which are things that are addressable. So frankly I don't think we're being criticized by our regulators for the types of things that work their way into the financial press. ","John Stumpf","But surely we're disappointed in the resolve and all hands on deck here and we value the feedback we got from the Fed and FDIC and we are committed to have a great submission later this year. Nancy, one thing I would like just to share for a few minutes, even though our company has grown and grown significantly organically, principally organically over the last seven or eight years, we have continued to simplify our business and we're \u2013 and we've shed businesses quietly that either didn't have scale for us or provided or had a risk reward relationship that was not consistent. So just let me just check off a few, I was just thinking while John was talking. We're no longer in the wholesale mortgage business. We're not in the joint venture business. We're not in the reverse mortgage business. We're not in the mortgage consolidation business. We have FHA overlays. So we're not as deep in that business as we had been in the past. We just sold our RCIS insurance business. The direct deposit advance business is no longer here. We're not in the government student lending business. We use it at our Wells Fargo financial business, that it's very different today. ","So yes we've grown in deposits. And we've grown in our corporate loans and all and wealth management and all other kind of things that we're involved in but a much simpler company, say, in many respects. ","Nancy Bush ","Now that you've \u2013 if I may ask, you've sort of opened up the living will issue and if I may ask if there are any of this feedback that you got yesterday that you feel is related to residual issues that are left over from the Wachovia deal. And I think I will just say that as an analyst it was no great secret in the industry that they were not the best on the reporting side. Are there any tasks left undone that were related to that merger that may have played into your feedback yesterday? ","John Stumpf","No, we own this and we're going to get this right.","Nancy Bush ","If I could ask a totally unrelated question, home equity lines of credit seem to be coming back into favor both at the banks and among consumers. Can you just speak to that business? You've always been important in it. Is it growing now and how do you feel about it?","John Shrewsberry","Because of the starting point that Wells Fargo has had the numbers have really only been going in one direction, which is down, down, down. The product that we have today where we do sell it is an amortizing product right out of the gate, so it's very different than it was in the old days where it was more just incremental leverage, that frankly didn't come down until it might hit some amortization point in the future. So we certainly offer that amortizing product to our customers. But I don't think you'll see it make a difference in our reported consumer real estate assets. Really on our balance sheet it\u2019s more about prime jumbo and non-conforming by balance types of loans to prime borrowers. ","Operator","Your final question will come from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.","Marty Mosby ","Thanks. John, I've done a little bit of the math when you look at the cost of the liabilities on the GE and then the delay in the assets. It looks like from a net NII standpoint you pick up close to $200 million as you move into next quarter just from the balance sheet side. Just trying to piece it together best I could. Was there any timing effect on the expenses? So as you came in and brought the operations on board, did you have a pretty full run rate on the expense side versus next quarter? That is my real question, is there any also leverage in a sense that the expenses were already kind of in place for this quarter going into next quarter? ","John Shrewsberry","The big expenses it\u2019s related are people expenses. The people join -- the bulk of the people joined on March 1, so in the last month of the quarter, there are some people in the rail business that joined at the beginning of the year. Another meaningful expense will be depreciation expense on the lease assets that we're picking up and they come out of that -- that begins when the assets are in place. But importantly one of the reasons that we're describing this as modestly accretive in the year, is there's a whole lot of integration expense that needs to occur, including what we're paying for transition services that we're still getting from GE that will shift over to Wells Fargo at some point in the future \u2013 or very different points in the future. And then there's technology work to do. There's some loan file work to do, some paperwork to do, there's a lot of things that it takes to make all of those assets Wells Fargo assets in a regulated environment that we\u2019re operating in and we will pay incremental dollars in the near term to do that. So I\u2019d be hesitant to offer you up a run rate from March that reflects what Q2 or the rest of the year is going to look like. ","Marty Mosby ","Would you be, on the expense side, isolating those as integration costs so we can know, not the total, but just as integration like you would do with any other kind of merger? And when we look at the seasonal uptick that we have in those employee-related expenses, typically you don't see a net benefit as it goes down because there's other expenses that offset that. But would you expect in the core expenses to see somewhat of a roll-down, given how high the seasonal expenses were this first quarter? Just two things on that side. ","John Shrewsberry","Yeah. Well, I expect that it will be between 55% and 59% in our efficiency ratio for the rest of the year on the high side of that. And that would capture the change in seasonal expenses, it's a good point that not all of that seasonal comp expense disappears and the whole net benefit doesn't come back, we call out in our deck. But there are some other things that are seasonally depressed in the first quarter that pick up in the second quarter. Not as big but that are seasonal in that way. And we'll see how material it is but if it becomes appropriate to provide clarity on the GE transition related expenses you might consider calling that out. But we haven't begun to yet because we're still developing those expenses, we\u2019re still coming into -- we're the early stage of execution on some of the technology oriented things that I mentioned and some other chunky early expenses that will start to run off after a bit. ","Marty Mosby ","John, lastly trying to climb into your head a little bit, as you were looking at the first quarter and you had the gain from selling the crop insurance business and rates were going down and you had so much market disruption, were you kind of thinking, since I have this gain over here, I don't really feel comfortable putting my liquidity to work because of what\u2019s going on in the market. That gives me some breathing room to see where things fall and then start reinvesting in the second quarter, recreating the income that you gave up in the first quarter. ","John Shrewsberry","Investing in risk \u2013 in relatively risk free assets doesn't produce that much P&L in the quarter that we invest. So there really wasn't much of a trade off in the first quarter between the gain that reflects this business that we agreed to sell a few quarters ago, that closed this quarter. It's really -- the threshold issues on reinvestment are more around our capital sensitivity because we're going to be living with the valuation consequences of buying duration at a low yield entry point. And then that really is more where the trade off occurred. So thinking about the whole year impact maybe on interest income but also our OCI sensitivity if rates ultimately back up. ","End of Q&A","John Stumpf","Okay, thank you all for joining us and also I want to say thank you to our 268,000 team members for serving our customers and producing a $5.5 billion of quarterly earnings that it\u2019s just a wonderful result on their behalf.

[Operator Instructions] ","I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Rowe, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Rowe, you may begin your conference.","Jim Rowe ","Thank you, Regina, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf, and our CFO, John Shrewsberry will discuss second quarter result and answer your questions. This call will be recorded.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our second quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I\u2019d also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today\u2019s call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings; including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement.","Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our website.","I will now turn our call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf.","John Stumpf ","Thank you, Jim. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. We earned $5.7 billion in the second quarter, as our diversified business model continued to generate strong loan and deposit growth. Our financial strength and competitive position have allowed us to capture opportunities for growth both organically and through acquisitions.","In addition, our commitment to managing risk and a benefit of an improving housing market continue to improve our credit results. ","Let me highlight our growth this quarter compared with one year ago. We earned $1.03 in earnings per share, up 2% from a year ago. We generated $21.3 billion of revenue, up 1% from a year ago with 4% growth in net interest income. We had broad based loan growth with total loans reaching a record $888.5 billion and our core loan portfolio increased by $68.5 billion or 9%.","Our growth benefited from the $11.5 billion GE Capital loan purchasing and financing transaction in the second quarter. Our deposit franchise continue to generate strong customer and balance growth with average deposits up $83.8 billion or 8% while we reduced deposit costs. ","We also grew the number of primary consumer checking customers by 5.6%. Our credit performance continued to improve and our net charge-off rate declined to 30 basis points of average loans, the lowest level in 20 years. ","Our financial performance resulted in strong capital generation and returning capital to our shareholders remains a priority. We increased our quarterly dividend rate by 7% to 37.5 cents per common share and we repurchased 36 million shares of common stock.","We\u2019ve reduced our common shares outstanding for five consecutive quarters with shares down 105 million from one year ago. While recent developments in Europe and Asia have implications for the US economy, the ongoing US economic expansion has remained on track and has entered its seventh year, a feat accomplished only four other times in the US history.","The labor market continued to recover with a record 57 consecutive months of payroll gains and housing activity has been especially encouraging with second quarter position to be the best quarter performance sales since 2007. These factors, along with an increase in consumer confidence makes me optimistic that the economic expansion will sustain momentum into the second half of the year and Wells Fargo should benefit from the increase in economic activity as we remain focused on meeting our customers\u2019 financial needs.","John Shrewsberry, our Chief Financial Officer will now provide more details on our second quarter results. John?","John Shrewsberry","Thank you, John and good morning everyone. My comments will follow the presentation included in the quarterly supplement, starting on Page 2. John and I will then answer your questions.","Our results this quarter is straightforward and demonstrate momentum across a variety of key business drivers. We continue to have strong loan and deposit growth across our diversified businesses. We grew net interest income with earning asset growth and our net interest margin improved. Many of our customer-facing businesses generated strong fee growth. Credit quality improved and we had lower net charge-offs and a higher reserve release and we continued to operate within our targeted ranges for ROA, ROE and efficiency.","Let me now highlight these key drivers in more detail. On Page 3, we highlight the year-over-year growth John emphasized in his remarks including revenue, loans, deposits and EPS as well as improving credit.","Turning to Page 4, we continued to benefit from the strength of our balance sheet which has positioned us well to take advantage of growth opportunities and to prudently deploy liquidity. Short-term investments and FED funds sold were down $59.1 billion from the first quarter reflecting loan growth, security purchases and lower deposit balances driven by seasonality in our consumer businesses and repricing in certain wholesale businesses. ","Our securities portfolio grew $16 billion from the first quarter. We purchased approximately $36 billion in securities primarily agency MBS, US treasuries and municipal securities which were partially offset by maturities, amortization and sales.","Turning to the income statement on Page 5, it\u2019s important to note that the linked quarter decline in earnings was driven by the $359 million discrete tax benefit recognized in the first quarter. Our pre-tax earnings increased $386 million or 5% from the first quarter, demonstrating the underlying momentum we had across our businesses. ","Revenue increased $40 million from first quarter with strong growth in net interest income, up $284 million reflecting growth in earning assets. We had linked quarter growth and fee income in most of our customer-facing businesses including deposit service charges, trust and investment fees, card fees, merchant processing, commercial real estate brokerage, mortgage and insurance. ","However, non-interest income declined $244 million from first quarter due to lower market-sensitive revenue and lower other income driven by the accounting impact related to our debt hedges. ","Expenses declined, despite an increase in operating losses related to litigation accruals and we generated positive operating leverage. As shown on Page 6, we continued to have strong loan growth in the second quarter, our 16th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Our core loan portfolio grew by $68.5 billion, or 9% from a year ago and was up $29.5 billion from first quarter.","Our growth was broad based which I\u2019ll highlight on the next slide and included $11.5 billion from the GE Capital loan purchase and financing transaction. This transaction is an excellent example of how the combination of our balance sheet strengths, the expertise of our team members and our relationship focus positions us to capture opportunities for growth. 67% of this portfolio is US-based with the remainder of the portfolio predominantly in the United Kingdom and Canada, which are active lending markets for us.","The loans we purchased were to over 145 different customers while we had existing relationships with many of these customers, the transaction has provided us with a meaningful number of new relationships which we believe will lead to additional opportunities for new business. It\u2019s also important to note that we didn\u2019t acquire these loans until late in the quarter, so while it increased ending loan balances, most of the benefit to average loans and to net interest income will be reflected in the third quarter.","On Page 7, we highlight the diversity of our loan growth. C&I loans were up $36.6 billion or 15% from a year ago, the GE Capital transaction drove $4.2 billion of this growth primarily from the financing to Blackstone Mortgage Trust. The rest of the growth was diversified across our wholesale businesses with double-digit year-over-year growth in asset-backed finance, equipment finance, corporate banking and government and institutional banking. ","Commercial real estate loans grew $10.2 billion or 8% from a year ago and included $7.3 billion from the GE Capital transaction. Core one-to-four family first mortgage loans grew $15 billion or 7% from a year ago and reflected continued growth in high-quality non-conforming mortgages.","Credit card balances were up $3.9 billion or 14% from a year ago, benefiting from strong new account growth and the Dillard\u2019s portfolio acquisition in the fourth quarter of last year. ","Auto loans were up $3.7 billion or 7% from last year. New originations reflected the strong auto market and were up 5% from a year ago and up 15% from first quarter benefiting from seasonality. ","As highlighted on Page 8, we had $1.2 trillion of average deposits in the second quarter, up $83.8 billion from a year ago and up $10.5 billion from first quarter. Our average deposit cost declined 8 basis points, down 2 basis points from a year ago. The decline in ending balances reflected the seasonal impact to consumer balances due to income tax payments and repricing in certain wholesale businesses primarily global financial institutions. ","We continued to successfully grow our primary consumer checking customers which were up 5.6% from a year ago and our primary small business and business banking checking customers increased 5.3%. Our primary customers have more products with us and are more than twice as profitable as non-primary customers. ","Page 9 highlights our revenue diversification in the balance between spread and fee income which has shifted slightly to more net-interest income as we benefited from strong earning asset growth. Our earning asset mix results and diversified \u2013 results and diversified sources of interest income, the drivers of our fee generation are also diverse and vary based on interest rate and economic conditions, for example, market-sensitive revenue which includes trading gains from our \u2013 trading and gains from our debt and equity investments declined 21% from first quarter, market-sensitive revenue was 8% of our fee income in the second quarter, down from 11% in the first quarter, however, many of our other customer-facing businesses generated higher fee income. ","We grew net interest income on a tax equivalent basis by %524 million or 5% from a year ago, reflecting strong growth in average earning assets, up 11% from a year ago. The $312 million increase in net interest income from first quarter reflected growth in earning assets and one extra day in the quarter. ","Net interest income also benefited from increased income from variable sources, lower deposit cost and higher income from interest rate swaps used to convert a portion of our floating rate commercial loans to fixed rate as we continue to add duration to our balance sheet. ","The net interest margin increased 2 basis points from the first quarter. This is the first linked quarter increase in the NIM since the first quarter of 2012. The increase this quarter was driven by balance sheet repricing and growth including growth in investments and loans and lower deposit cost which benefited the margin by 4 basis points. ","Higher variable income from increased loan fees, semi-annual preferred dividends and PCR recoveries contributed 1 basis point to the margin, customer-driven deposit growth reduced the margin by 3 basis points but had minimal impact to net interest income. Our balance sheet remains asset-sensitive and we are positioned to benefit from higher rates.","However, we believe we can grow net interest income in 2015, compared with 2014 even if rates remain low. ","Total non-interest income declined $244 million from first quarter, driven by lower market-sensitive revenue and lower other non-interest income. The other non-interest income category was down $426 million in the second quarter driven by the accounting impact of interest rate and currency hedges associated with our long-term debt. ","We are required to measure the hedge effectiveness quarterly and while the net impact is expected to be zero over the term, quarterly interest rate and currency volatility can cause this line item to vary from quarter-to-quarter. It\u2019s important to note that while total non-interest income declined, if you exclude market-sensitive revenue and other income, we had strong diversified fee growth across our other fee categories demonstrating growth from doing more business with our customers. ","In fact, second quarter was the strongest quarter over the past five quarters for brokerage, trust and investment management, card, merchant processing, insurance and mortgage origination. Mortgage banking revenue increased up $158 million from the first quarter on higher origination volume, up $13 billion or 27%. ","Second quarter had the highest level of mortgage production since the third quarter of 2013, 54% of originations before purchases up 45% in the first quarter. We ended the quarter with a $38 billion application pipeline, up $8 billion from a year ago and down $6 billion from first quarter. ","Based on the current rate environment, the level of our pipeline and the seasonal slowdown in the purchase market, we currently expect originations in the third quarter to be lower than the second quarter. Our gain on sale ratio was 188 basis points in the second quarter and we currently expect the third quarter ratio to remain within the range of the past five quarters between 140 and 210 basis points. ","As shown on Page 12, expenses were down $38 million from the first quarter, the decline was primarily due to lower employee benefits expense which was seasonally elevated in the first quarter. Operating losses were $521 million in the second quarter, up $226 million from the first quarter reflecting higher litigation accruals for various legal matters.","While we continue to invest in our businesses reflected in higher professional services and advertising expenses in the second quarter, we remained focused on operating efficiently as indicated by our efficiency ratio improving to 58.5%. We expect the efficiency ratio for the full year 2015 to remain within our targeted range of 55% to 59%.","Turning to our business segment, starting on Page 13, community banking earned $3.4 billion in the second quarter, down 8% from first quarter which included the discrete tax benefit. One of the drivers of our long-term growth is our ability to grow retail bank households. Year-to-date through May, we\u2019ve had the strongest household growth in four years. This strong growth reflects our success in attracting new customers to Wells Fargo as well as the benefit of better retention of our existing households as we remain focused on meeting their financial needs.","This focus has also resulted in an increase in total products held by our customers. For example, we\u2019ve been successfully growing the penetration rate of credit cards to our retail bank households which has grown to 42.6% in the second quarter, up from 39% a year ago and 34.9% two years ago.","Credit card purchase volume was up 15% from a year ago reflecting an increase in new accounts; debit card purchase volume was up 8% from a year ago benefiting from the strong growth in primary checking account customers and increased usage among existing customers. ","Wholesale banking earned $2 billion in the second quarter, up 3% from a year ago and 12% from first quarter. Wholesale banking continued to have strong loan and deposit growth. Average loans grew 12% from a year ago with broad based growth across most wholesale businesses. ","This growth in average loans did not fully reflect the benefit of the GE Capital transaction reported late in the quarter. Average core deposits grew 14% from a year ago and flat linked quarter reflecting pricing actions we took in the second quarter to reduce deposit costs. ","The strong loan and deposit growth helps grow revenue by 2% from a year ago. Treasury and management revenue grew 10% reflecting new product sales and repricing. Second quarter revenue also benefited from higher equity gains from the sale of certain equity fund investments driven by the Volcker Rule. ","Wells Brokerage and Retirement had another record quarter earning $602 million in the second quarter, up 11% from a year ago and up 7% from first quarter. WBR\u2019s pre-tax margin was 26% in the second quarter exceeding its long-term target of 25%.","Revenue grew 5% from a year ago, driven by higher recurring sources of revenue. Net interest income increased 12% and asset-based fees were up 7%. Brokerage advisory assets grew $434 billion, up $25 billion or 6% from a year ago, primarily driven by net flows. ","WBR\u2019s strong loan growth continued with eight consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth. Loan growth accelerated this quarter up 16% from a year ago, the strongest growth rate in over six years. Growth was broad based with strong client demand across a number of product offerings. ","Turning to Page 16, credit quality in the second quarter improved. Our net charge-off rate declined to 30 basis points of average loans. Non-performing assets have declined for 11 consecutive quarters and were down $438 million from first quarter. Non-accrual loans declined $67 million from first quarter as higher energy non-accrual loans were offset by improvement in residential real estate as well as other categories. ","The reserve release was $350 million in the second quarter. The increase from first quarter was driven by continued credit quality improvement, most notably, significant improvement in residential real estate. Our credit losses in our residential real estate portfolios declined 22% and non-accrual loans declined $388 million or 4% from first quarter.","It\u2019s important to note that even small changes in the performance of our residential real estate portfolios tend to out way changes in other portfolios, given the size of our residential real estate portfolio was 36% of total loans. ","We had an increase in non-performing loans in our energy portfolio. Oil and gas loans are only 2% of our total loan portfolio and balances in this portfolio declined by approximately $700 million from first quarter reflecting pay downs. ","Our energy team completed their spring re-determination process during the second quarter and as expected, the drop in energy prices did impact the cash flow and collateral values of a number of our borrowers leading to downward portfolio migration. The deterioration in this portfolio is reflected in our allowance for credit losses and we will continue to monitor the energy portfolio.","Finally when considering our allowance, it\u2019s important to note that the loans we acquired from GE Capital were accounted for under purchase accounting under GAAP and reflected a lifetime credit loss adjustment and therefore did not require additional loan loss reserves typically associated with commercial loan growth. ","Turning to Page 17, our capital levels remains strong with our estimated common equity tier-1 ratio under Basel-3 fully phased in at 10.5% in the second quarter. We returned $2.9 billion to shareholders in the second quarter through dividends and net share repurchases. Our common shares outstanding declined by 17.7 million shares in the second quarter reflecting 36.3 million shares repurchased and 18.6 million shares issued. ","We expect to reduce our common shares outstanding through share repurchases throughout the remainder of the year. Our dividend payout ratio increased to 36% in the second quarter, as we increased the quarterly dividend rate on our common stock by 7%. ","Our net payout ratio in the second quarter was 54%. The decline in our net payout ratio reflected our strong asset and RWA growth as our first call for capital is for providing credit to our customers. However we remained committed to returning capital to our shareholders and we expect our net payout ratio to be within our targeted range of 55% to 75% for the full year.","In summary, our second quarter results demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model with strong loan and deposit growth and momentum in non-interest income across many of our customer-facing businesses. Our strong liquidity position and capital levels position us well to serve our existing customers while growing our customer base organically and through acquisition. ","The improvement in credit quality demonstrated our continued focus on risk management. While the current interest rate environment remains uncertain, we are actively managing our expenses while focusing on meeting our customers\u2019 financial needs to generate growth. ","We will now be happy to answer your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ken Usdin ","Thanks, good morning. ","John Stumpf","Good morning. ","Ken Usdin ","John, I was wondering if you could just give us a little bit more on your confidence about the economic environment versus the commentary about the competition out there. So we know you guys are going to get a great benefit looking ahead from the averaging of the GE. So on one, could you just kind of flush out the pockets of loan growth that you continue to expect and then also, do you anticipate being able to at least be in a pole position to get some more of those GE assets? Thanks.","John Stumpf","So, there are variety of loan categories that deserves to be mentioned individually, but you know we are aggressively growing the card business with our existing deposit customers and percentage gains there will probably continue to be very strong. Autos in spite of the heat in that market and our public posture of wanting to maintain our credit discipline still are providing a big opportunity because so many cars are being sold. So and that\u2019s a continued opportunity. Still a lot going on in commercial real estate and as you mentioned the GE Capital loans helped us late in the third quarter there. Jumbo loans on the residential side have been growing on the balance sheet at the same strong pace for a long time and we continue to \u2013 we expect to see that there. Across the C&I range, we mentioned several of the businesses that have slightly independent but all attractive growth prospects. The utilization of lines across the variety of corporate and commercial loan categories is still in the, call it mid to low 30s. So there is room for that improvement and we keep gathering new customers in those businesses as well. So, it\u2019s really is coming from everywhere at attractive basis. ","John Shrewsberry","Yes, Ken, there is a fair amount of capacity to carry more debt by medium size companies, small companies and consumers. Rates are very favorable and most Americans businesses and consumers have de-risked and deleveraged their balance sheet. So there are opportunities and we are very active on main street and on the back 40 working with the customers. So, we love this opportunity to do the GE thing, but organic relative still the main part the way we grow. ","John Stumpf","And with respect what there still might be to do with GE, there have been some portfolio sales that have been announced there since the one that we worked on. We are working as closely as we can with them. They are a great relationship of ours. There are our businesses that they are trying to dispose of that fit neatly with our expertise. Some things were going to be very competitive with and some because we are not expert in them will be less so. But we are working hard. We hope that that turns incremental opportunity to do more of what we\u2019ve done on the commercial real estate side and we\u2019ll be hearing about that in the coming months as their processes unfold. ","Ken Usdin ","Okay, great. And I have \u2013 just to follow-up on the energy portfolio shrinkage, you spoke about the $700 million decline, I am sure that we\u2019ll have the questions about the NPA growth. Could you talk about just what you are seeing in the energy side? Is that active? Like push outs by you guys, is it the equitization coming in and taking out credits? Can you just talk about like how that portfolio behavior is acting and how that influences your provisioning decisions? ","John Stumpf","Sure, so, I would describe the reduction in the principal balance as borrowers taking their balances down and just to conform with their borrowing base reductions and as I mentioned that was about $700 million of reduction in the second quarter. There was a lot of capital being raised in the first quarter; capital markets activity was very brisk in the first quarter. A little bit slower in the second quarter and a lot of that was equity coming in to stabilize balance sheets. It feels like that slow down just a little bit as people process what happened in the first quarter. So we don\u2019t anticipate loan balances or new loan activity to be terribly brisk in terms of leading to higher outstandings at Wells Fargo in the second half of the year. But the market is acting very rationally. The market is acting very quickly. The opportunists are arriving at the door and trying to work things out, create business combinations and take advantage of the situation to resolve it. So, things are happening frankly a little bit faster than we might have anticipated sitting here six or eight months ago. ","Ken Usdin ","Thanks, John. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Joe Morford ","Good morning everyone. ","John Stumpf","Hello, Joe. ","John Shrewsberry","Hey, Joe.","Joe Morford ","I guess just a follow-up on the credit trends within the energy portfolio. With the borrowing base re-determinations finalized, I mean, you touched on this, but how is performance tracked relative to initial expectations and how much of the increase in the related non-performing loans stems from that as opposed to the shared national credit exam? ","John Stumpf","Well, it\u2019s a combination of both and it\u2019s tough to call out specifically what the regulators might have independently wanted that we wouldn\u2019t have agreed to or gotten to on our own. I mean, the outcome is what it is and if we had about a $400 million increase to non-performing assets in energy for the quarter, which feels like it makes sense. And to the extent that some of those were very conservative estimations of NPA status I think and that will be recaptured in the back-end of the process when those loans get worked out which is fine. We had very nominal losses in the quarter and we\u2019ll go into a fall re-determination for E&P companies as well and we\u2019ll measure the performance of the midstream and services companies at the same time. We feel great about where our allowance is right now as you may recall they had an impact on our first quarter number even though that was pre re-determination and has an impact again on the second quarter number and who knows as the third and fourth quarter roll through, I am sure that there will be more loans that are at issue. The whole portfolio amounts to 2% of our loan portfolio, we feel very well reserved for where we are. We\u2019ve got the best team in energy banking and our credit folks working through the portfolio. So, it\u2019s - the impact here is relatively immaterial to Wells Fargo. And we as we called out in our comment, especially in a quarter like Q2, minor changes in our residential real estate portfolio have a tendency to dwarf whatever is going on in energy because 36% of the loan portfolio is in single-family real estate and 2% is in energy. ","John Shrewsberry","Joe, I would offer this, since I\u2019ve been on a long time, I think this is my third or fourth cycle I remember doing workouts in this business in the early 80s. This one is different in that \u2013 the energy participants whether they be on the E&P side or midstream, whatever it is, I am more conservative. They tend to be better capitalized, be rapid, more quickly through reducing their CapEx budgets, some case reducing dividends and some of the real stretchy stuff was done outside of our industry if you will. So, that mean that all situations are going to workout, but, they wouldn\u2019t \u2013 and reacted much more quickly than I have seen in the past cycles. ","Joe Morford ","That\u2019s very helpful. Big color. I guess, have you quantified what you have in terms of dedicated reserves against the energy portfolio and as you point out, given that, things like single-family is such a bigger part of the overall loan portfolio and what\u2019s your broader outlook for the provision and the possibility of any future reserve releases?","John Stumpf","So, we are bumping along here at 30 basis points of annualized net losses on the total loan portfolio and as we called out in the past, we shouldn\u2019t expect releases in any given quarter because it\u2019s going to \u2013 the calculation heats quarter of the allowance is going to include the observed portfolio of the portfolio is going to include general economic conditions is going to include where the growth is coming from in the mix in the portfolio. So, I would not model in release of this magnitude going forward and of course, as we\u2019ve said, we keep building our loan portfolio, you\u2019d expect to see builds often \u2013 things being equal. Separately, we also called out in the case of GE, if we are growing our loan portfolio by acquiring loans, and we invoke purchase accounting, then that\u2019s a complicating factor and whether the allowance is growing or not because the mark on the loans reflects the lifetime credit adjustment. So that\u2019s a little complicated. But \u2013 so, and for our own internal purposes, of course there is an allocable component of the allowance that reflects what we think a loss \u2013 the inherent loss content is in the energy portfolio and that will grow or shrink depending on how the portfolio performs. And as I said, I would assume that the next couple of quarters how much better than the last quarter in terms of we are still resolving these issues, some of them are just coming to life for certain borrowers but it\u2019s a very contained portion of our loan portfolio and the aggregate impact should not be material for Wells Fargo. ","Joe Morford ","Understand. Thanks so much. ","John Stumpf","You bet. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Erika Najarian ","Hi, good morning. ","John Shrewsberry","Good morning, Erika.","Erika Najarian ","Just wanted to take a step back, as we enter potentially a rising rate environment in the second half of the year fingers crossed, one of your peers they meant, mentioned, anticipating a significantly more competitive environment for retail deposits given the regulators have essentially said, there are good deposits and bad deposits this time around. And secondarily, they also mentioned entering new markets for the first time and de novoing. I guess, the first question is, how should we expect Wells Fargo\u2019s repricing to progress actually rise on the short-end, secondarily, given the impressive footprint that you\u2019ve built, how would you defend that market sharing footprint against those that are aggressively trying to grow retail deposits, particularly for regulatory purposes? ","John Shrewsberry","Erika, let me start with that. It\u2019s a great question and not all retail deposits are credit equal. You know our focus here has been on relationships and we think relationships on the consumer side start with a consumer checking account. In fact, I don\u2019t have this exactly but I think it\u2019s 86% of our retail customers have a checking account with us it\u2019s their primary account they live out of that. And if you look at certificates and deposit, it\u2019s less than $35 billion here. So it\u2019s a couple percent of ours. So that\u2019s a very different deposit make up and like other companies in our industry, we had a lot of experience in rates backing up. And the speed of the backup matters where it starts from, a move from 300% to 400% is different from a move from nothing to 1%. And also where you employ those more expensive deposits, will you find offsetting earning assets to employ those. And, I recall the last time we went through this, we had very aggressive deposit competitors who are using those deposits to fund businesses acquired to sell models in the real estate business for example. So it was used. So, we\u2019ve been through a lot of different things. We\u2019ve modeled this. If I were a bettering person, I would bet that we\u2019ll probably be favorable to our model suggest early in the backup, but I think one of the great under valued parts of our business today is the quality of our deposit franchise and you\u2019ll see that in the backup. ","John Stumpf","And to the point of entering new markets, well, we adjust our store footprint meaningfully every year by opening and closing stores where we see fit, I think as Carrie Tolstedt has described in our last Investor Day, we believe that we need a certain amount of scale in any urban market before we can really make a difference and we are in most of the markets that we like to be in, and of course we are not going to get there through acquisitions. So, it would seem unusual for us to commit to building, for example, hundreds and hundreds of stores in a new major urban center that we are not already a part of. So, I wouldn\u2019t think about that as part of our next stage plan. ","Erika Najarian ","Got it and just a follow-up on some of the comments, John, thank you for telling us how you accounted for the GE purchase. How should we think about your capital progress relative to further, or incremental loan purchases? As I think about the past three quarters your CET1 ratio has been fairly stable at about 10.5%. If you are using purchase accounting for larger loan purchases, of course that would impact CET1 and I guess I'm wondering sort of what your thoughts on the \u2013 you know whether you may account for purchases differently going forward, as you consider the CET1 progress particularly in light - in terms of some commentary, you've heard from regulators recently about including CET1 surcharges in the CCAR test? ","John Stumpf","Sure, well, so the first call on our capital is for our customers, including prospective customers if we were going to add either an originator or acquirer portfolios of loans. I don\u2019t think there is any accounting theory out there that would allow us to add loans without impacting common equity tier-1. I mean, it\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s risk-weighted assets are what is for. So if we had a bigger opportunity to grow RWA faster and the way that we thought was very attractive for shareholders, then we would probably do that and if we need to do, for example, curtail distributions and for some period of time in order to retain the capital to create that outcome, then we would probably do that. As we\u2019ve told people in our capital planning process and describing it, we want to keep as much capital as it\u2019s appropriate and necessary to grow the business and that\u2019s primarily by growing RWA and we want to distribute everything beyond that and which is about where we\u2019ve been operating. So if there were a bigger RWA opportunity, we would measure where we were starting from, we would understand what sort of capital generation was going on at that time and it\u2019s possible, we would end up retaining a little bit more in order to maintain satisfactory levels while growing assets. ","Erika Najarian ","Got it. So I am clear on the takeaway. Any portfolio purchases from has to be life of loan accounting in terms of the losses?","John Stumpf","Yes.","Erika Najarian ","Okay. And just a quick follow-up to the GE portfolio, you did add this quarter you mentioned that we need to consider the average balance impact. Are there any considerations on the average yield impact, as we think about the third quarter?","John Stumpf","For average yield of the loan portfolio?","Erika Najarian ","Yes, in terms of\u2026 ","John Stumpf","Yes, the GE loans fit right into the averages that we already had. So it\u2019s really more balanced.","Erika Najarian ","Got it. Thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura. Please go ahead. ","Bill Carcache ","Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to ask a question on margins. Part of the NIM compression that we have been seeing for so long has obviously been in part due to all the excess liquidity that's been getting parked at the FED as deposit growth has significantly outpaced loan growth really at a system-wide level. But today, we saw one of your competitors reported a decrease in deposits both sequentially and year-over-year while still putting up pretty solid loan growth, and you guys also saw your loan growth outpaced your deposit growth this quarter. So, I guess the question is, do you think we're at an inflection point where we'll no longer see deposit growth continue to exceed loan growth and if so, does that suggest that that we should begin to see some continued improvement in NIMs going forward?","John Stumpf","Let me take the deposit side first and then John can do that. If you \u2013 one quarter does not make summer as one sparrow if you will, if you look at the last year, we grew average deposits b y almost $84 billion and our core loan portfolio grew $60 some billion, if you take our overall loan portfolio, it was in the $40 billion to $50 billion. So we actually outgrew deposits by some $20 billion or $30 billion on an annual basis. The first quarter is always kind of a funny quarter when you compare to the second quarter or second quarter to the first quarter because of the tax impact, because we have such a large retail deposit base. So, we look back, I think to 1945, I think all but one year, we grew deposit. So, whether we can outgrow or not outgrow, we sure like our opportunities continuing on the deposit side, because after all we are growing net new consumer checking accounts primary by 5.6% and on small business we are growing by 5.3% or 4%. These are the strongest numbers I\u2019ve seen in the last couple of years in my history at the company. So these are very, very strong acquisition numbers.","John Shrewsberry","So, one thing I have to mention about the industry and I am sure you are thinking about this. But, we are in a slightly different position but there are some other larger banks that are discouraging deposits because of the adverse impact on leverage ratio, the adverse impact on the GSIB buffer calculations, et cetera and people have been vocal about getting out there and trying to move those deposits out of their banks to take their numbers down and those are in the same deposit numbers that you are referring to. So, it\u2019s a little bit complicated I think, bank-by-bank as you are looking at it. Ours is as John described. And we are also not shrinking our store count and we have found that, in our omni channel distribution, where you have stores or locations ATMs, phones, online and mobile, it\u2019s the magic of all those working together. And that\u2019s a very strong compelling value proposition for our customers. ","John Stumpf","At both attracting retaining deposits and then back to Erika\u2019s question about what happens in a backup, people who want to move away from Wells Fargo are moving away from that value proposition that\u2019s provided to them basically for free in exchange for having their relationship at Wells Fargo.","Bill Carcache ","Thank you. If I may, as a follow-up, the amount of liquidity that you are holding at the said FED, you mentioned fell this quarter from an all-time high of $291 billion, I believe last quarter. Is it reasonable to expect that to continue to fall from here as you redeploy more of that into higher-yielding loans and securities? And taking LCR into consideration and the constraints there, can you give us a sense for where we could see those balances go?","John Shrewsberry","Well, it depends on what\u2019s happening on other fronts including ongoing deposit growth. But, I wouldn\u2019t forecast it as coming down, but as we\u2019ve described before, there is probably tens of billions of dollars of room from where we are today to where that balance might go before we started to having any difficult discussions about LCR. So there is plenty of room from where we are today.","Bill Carcache ","Okay, thank you for taking my questions. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Paul Miller ","Yes, thank you very much. Talking a bit about the mortgage side, when we saw rates go up, but I think a lot of \u2013 when the volumes have held in very strong, some of that I think is the \u2013 as the refi pipeline coming out of first quarter, but - can you talk a little bit about what you are seeing in the purchase market world? Is it really starting to make a comeback?","John Shrewsberry","So, yes, it was a strong quarter and I mean, strongest in a while, it doesn\u2019t reflect the pre-crisis types of activity at this point. It\u2019s strong in a handful of individual markets, California, New York, Southern Florida, Denver or particular markets where we\u2019ve seen a lot of strength. First time home buyers are a little bit stronger at about 30% of home purchases. We saw that our purchases as a percentage of originations were 54% this quarter versus 45 the prior quarter as you mentioned, the second quarter had a lot of refis closing in it that were locked in the first quarter when rates were very low. So, when we think about new application volume in the second quarter, my guess is, as that flows through in Q3 that number will be even higher. All things being equal, because rates did backup meaningfully in the quarter. So, the business is good. There is plenty of credit available. We are obviously as enthusiastic and committed to it as we\u2019ve ever been. Margins have been holding in there nicely and the pipeline looks quite good actually.","Paul Miller ","And then, go ahead.","John Shrewsberry","One last thing I\u2019d add is that, all of that is a reflection of continued affordability while home prices have moved, there is still affordable, while rates have moved they are still affordable. So, that\u2019s helping a lot and we\u2019ve had an improving jobs market which brings more people into eligibility for a purchase or a refinancing.","Paul Miller ","And then you saw the \u2013 I mean, everybody saw the [Indiscernible] has been pushed back another three months. Do you see any impact on the mortgage market or on how you view the mortgage market with the new regulations with [Indiscernible]","John Shrewsberry","No, except - one thing I would say is we were ready to go with the original deadline. But, no impact.","Paul Miller ","Okay. Thank you very much gentlemen. ","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","John McDonald ","Hi, thank you. Just a question, John, on the efficiency ratio. You\u2019re at the high end of your range last couple of quarters. Do you see opportunities to drive down the efficiency ratio prior to rates going up or is it more likely to stay still at the upper-end of the range until we see interest rates move higher?","John Shrewsberry","I think it's going to stay in the upper part of the range until revenue moves higher, which will probably happen as a result of - or at least most meaningfully over a short period of time because of rates moving higher. We are spending the money that we think we need to spend to run a great business today and manage risk, as well as invest in the future around things that customers want, things that we need to be a well run, resilient, compliant, risk managed, technologically savvy firm, and that gets us to 58 plus or minus percent, which I would remind you is a very good number for a bank of our size. But, yes, there is no near-term path or project to try and drive ourselves down in the range. We are trying to operate where we have been, accomplish all the things that we need to accomplish and deal with the reality that we are in a below 3% GDP growth environment, in a zero rate environment, neither of which is as hospitable as some other environments might be for revenue growth in banking.","John Stumpf ","And, John the \u2013 but we're always, as you know us and you know us well, we continue to look for opportunities to simplify the business, streamline the work we do so we can repurpose those dollars into things that are important to customers, important to risk management, other things here. So the development that we are doing and image capture in our branches or our stores, the different things that we invest in payments, cyber and all the other things that we do, we are self-funding through being very thoughtful about where we spend our money.","John McDonald ","Thank you. And one other question, guys, could you comment on the market and what it's like for additional portfolio purchases? I assume it's very competitive, obviously, GE has got some other assets out for sale. And just in general, nothing specific but more general, what are the pros and cons when you look at portfolios to purchase and kind of how do you feel like the markets like for that?","John Shrewsberry","So, it's very competitive, and I think that this current set of assets that's being offered for sale is being viewed by some people as the biggest opportunity in a long time. Some of the assets or platforms are suitable for non-depository institutions and I would say that non-banks interested in creating a lending platform would appear to be willing to pay a bigger premium than people who have an existing platform and are looking to add customers and assets to it. All of these do require financing in one form or another. So that can be either a limiting factor or for the easier to finance assets, I guess, that can be a benefit for people who don't have deposit bases in order to bid. But very competitive, it\u2019s how I would describe it.","John McDonald ","Okay. Thank you.","John Shrewsberry","Yes.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ","Betsy Graseck ","Questions, one on other income and one on the wealth business. You called out on other income that you had a $426 million impact from the debt hedges. I just wanted to make sure I understood what that was driven by - I know you indicated rate moves. Just want to make sure I understand is that the long-end of the curve. And does it have any relation to the fair value hedges that you put in the 10-Q, the $173 million. So, wanted to make sure understand how that works.","John Shrewsberry","Sure, so for some of the debt that we issue, we swap it back to dollars and swap it back to LIBOR and so we've got perfect cash flow hedges on where we choose to do that. The accounting for that requires the liability on the one hand and the hedge on the other to be discounted using different discount rates and so over the life of both instruments, there can be some noise in the P&L. We've had a benefit in the past and this time we had a negative and it was driven by a few things, but mostly by the major movements in longer-term swap rates in dollar, Sterling and LIBOR during the quarter. And the net impact from the quarter is, as it was described in the materials. So I\u2019d just point out, this is sort of a \u2013 call that\u2019s a timing difference, an accounting difference, it nets back to zero over the life of the liability. So we don't think of it as a real economic issue, but it creates noise in the other non-interest income line item. ","Betsy Graseck ","Okay. So the net was $426 million, not the $426 million plus the $173 million from the fair value hedges in the 10-Q?","John Shrewsberry","Correct.","Betsy Graseck ","Okay. Okay, separately on wealth. I've been just reading some articles recently that talked about how - and you can tell me this is correct or not, but how the focus is not really on increasing the number of FAs and obviously we see flat FAs in the release you put out today, but more on the technology and the investment spend there. Is that accurate, number one and number two, could you explain how you are looking to advance the technology platforms that you got in this business?","John Shrewsberry","Sure. So, I wouldn't say that it's an express strategy to not increase the number of FAs. I don't think that that's necessarily the primary driver of value creation in the long-term for David Carroll's business. You may see that differently, John. The point on technology is a good one. There are a number of initiatives underway in that business to modernize and to create service capability to attract new investors and to better serve the investors that we have. And that turns up in the \u2013 sort of primary systems that our financial advisors use to interact with our customers. It will turn up in our mobile and online offerings that allow people to do more for themselves and at some point, it could even include service or capability that competes with some of the sort of the robo advisory people out there today who rely primarily on technology to construct portfolios and make offerings to customers. All of those things are opportunities for us to make the business even stronger and more relevant going forward on top of what we feel is very good performance over the last few years.","John Stumpf","Yes, and Betsy we see this really is one of the most attractive growth opportunities in the company. If you think of how we are positioned as a broadly diversified company serving customers, one in three Americans, one way or another, Americans are living longer. They are probably convinced you have to be more reliant on their own resources for the retirement. And we have 10% to 11% of the deposits in the country and yet, only a fraction of that as far as where we manage well. So this is a big opportunity and investments in people and systems and capabilities, but that should in no way, the growth -- we've already done great work. David Carroll and his team have done incredible. I mean, think how many companies out there would love to have the way we monetize and the way everybody else does $602 million of after-tax earnings for a quarter, 26% margins, these are very, very good numbers.","Betsy Graseck ","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","The next question will come from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Mike Mayo ","Hi, a factual question. What was the amount of your debt hedge loss in the second quarter? You mentioned that other income is down $426 million, was that the amount of the debt hedge loss or is it different?","John Shrewsberry","It was - we had a $127 million gain in the first quarter and $193 million loss in the second quarter. And again, I just want to describe that as the accounting treatment for the hedging program that we have there. But, so, think of this \u2013 that the delta between Q1 and Q2 as what creates the more outsized numbers.","Mike Mayo ","So normal would just be zero?","John Stumpf ","No, normal would be around zero. You\u2019d expect it to be zero over its life. Sometimes it's a little positive sometimes it's a little negative. And it's driven by swap rates and currency movements in the currencies where we issue.","Mike Mayo ","All right. The more important question from me, you mentioned repricing in wholesale businesses and at \u2013 what are you doing there as it relates to your market-sensitive revenues?","John Stumpf ","What we repriced in wholesale is deposits and for a variety of customers, the ones who seem to have acted most strongly in the deposit area were FIs, which for all the reasons you could imagine how relatively low value liquidity deposits and so, we have \u2013 we\u2019ve been paying less for those deposits or in some cases, and in some jurisdictions, have been charging a little bit for those deposits and that's what we were referring to.","Mike Mayo ","What are you seeing in pricing in your market-sensitive businesses more generally? And is that one reason why your \u2013 this is the lowest trading quarter you've had since the third quarter of 2011 and we'll certainly take the other revenues in lieu of trading. But, are you pricing some of those activities away? Is it simply the markets weaker? What's going on there? But especially as it relates to potential repricing or the competitive environment?","John Stumpf ","Yes, you know, it's not as a result of Wells Fargo specific pricing strategies. It's just the chips falling where they did in terms of flows, volumes and other activity in the business. And as you know, in our trading business, we have what you are thinking of which is market-making and customer accommodation activity but we also have the impact of our own deferred comp program, et cetera, which makes that line a little bit noisy. But it's not as a result of any conscious business decision to price things differently to do any more of this or less of that it's just where the quarter fell.","Mike Mayo ","And then lastly, and so is pricing getting better, worse and if so, what areas within the market-sensitive areas?","John Shrewsberry","I wouldn't say that pricing is getting any better. You would think that pricing might be getting better in areas where other banks are pulling back from providing financing or liquidity to customers, which is part of the discussion around how some of the bigger trading-oriented banks have been providing repo, providing securities finance, et cetera, and have limited their appetites. But prices haven't gone up that much. I think capacity has come out and people have had to figure out how to deal with that. So, at the moment, it's still very - it's as competitive as it ever was and the pricing reflects that, but not because of conscious strategies.","Mike Mayo ","All right, thank you.","John Shrewsberry","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","Eric Wasserstrom ","Thanks very much. I just had one question to clarify the loan growth expectations. And if I look at the core loan growth, it's growing about excluding the GE transaction and run-off, it's growing at about almost four times nominal GDP, which would be at the higher end of the historical norm. So, I just want to make sure I understand, John, your comments about expectations of maybe some incremental leverage across both commercial and consumer. But I wonder to what extent it may in fact that may already be occurring and the GDP number will move to reflect that rather than an acceleration in loan growth?","John Shrewsberry","That's good question. We don't model loan growth necessarily as a reflection of prior quarter GDP. But it's an interesting relationship. I think our point is that the areas where we've been experiencing organic loan growth all are still very active. We are still very competitive. We are getting more than our fair share in most of those categories. We've got further to run in car and I\u2019d say than other people because we are starting from a smaller base. And then in some of our material businesses, we've got customers who have been holding back on their borrowing capacity. So in the corporate - but in the commercial space in particular where we are a very big player, our customers are still very cash-heavy, which is reflected in our deposits and have maintained very low leverage profile. So that if they got a little bit more enthusiasm around M&A, around organic growth or building a new plant, et cetera, expanding their businesses, they have lots of debt capacity to do that, and we\u2019d expect to see some of that in line utilization or demand for funded assets. But, the real takeaway is that we're very well positioned in all of our key lending markets and competing well today. And in those areas where there might be incremental drivers of demand and we hope to benefit from it when it happens. And then, of course, we are working on a few strategic or inorganic activities as well.","Eric Wasserstrom ","Sure. Thank you for that, and just one clarification question. Did you indicate how much your legal accrual was for the period?","John Shrewsberry","We didn't. We\u2019ve indicated the size of operating losses in total. The amount of the change and the amount of the changes reflected \u2013 reflects increased litigation accruals, but we don't split that out from our other operating losses.","Eric Wasserstrom ","And are those legal accruals for issues related disclosed in the 10-K or for new ones?","John Shrewsberry","It's for a variety of matters, most of which you would already be familiar with.","Eric Wasserstrom ","Okay, all right. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matt O'Connor ","Good morning. ","John Shrewsberry","Hey, Matt. Good morning..","Matt O'Connor ","I know there's been some talk about working on becoming more efficient, just kind of continuous improvement. But do you have some formal initiative underway? I guess there was an article in a regional paper a couple months ago and it mentioned something called E&E, or something along the lines of that?","John Shrewsberry","Yes, that's \u2013 as John was mentioning earlier, we are trying to repurpose our expense dollars to their highest value area. And so there is a collection of programs and ways of doing business, of thinking about how we spend our resources that are designed to do just that. So it's an internal, it's a relatively formal program. It's around some operational improvements. It's around some of our staff functional alignment. Some of our technology spend, et cetera, and it really is designed to make sure that where we are spending money and of course we spend a lot of it that we are putting it in the most impactful places.","Matt O'Connor ","Is it the kind of program where, if we don't get rates increasing and a stronger economy, then you can kind of redirect some of the savings more to the bottom-line versus investing in other areas?","John Shrewsberry","Well, dollars are fungible, but as the way we are thinking about it is, we are directing those dollars toward places they are going to make a difference for customers which would drive revenue. And they could see bottom-line improvement as a result of that. But as I mentioned in response to an earlier question, it's not really designed to drive us down in the efficiency ratio or to drive total dollars of expense down. All things being equal, it's designed to make sure that we are spending the money that we are spending in the most impactful place.","Matt O'Connor ","Okay. And then just separately on the net interest margin, as we think about the trajectory from here, assuming rates don't increase, what should the path of the NIM be?","John Shrewsberry","Well, it's going to depend on what happens with deposits versus loan and other earning asset growth primarily. So, if we continue along the path that we are on right now, then you would think that it would probably stay in or about this range. There is not much else, deposit pricing is quite efficient here at 8 basis points. So, as we get more invested, as we add more loans and if we convert cash to higher yielding assets then that should be an improvement. Over the course, if you fast forward it to few years, we'll probably be layering in more senior unsecured in connection with TLAC. That will probably have a negative impact, although relatively modest in the overall scheme of things. We still expect net interest income in 2015 to be higher than 2014, which is frankly, the most important thing, all things being equal and that's what we are driving toward.","John Stumpf","Let me just go back to the expensing just one more time so we are all on the same page. There is talk on this call, and of course, we listen to what the Chairwoman of the FED has to say about rates. But when we plan internally here, we don't consider rate increases as part of the ongoing justification for an investment in anything. So in other words, we don't \u2013 you would not hear a language like, I want to make this investment because when rates turnaround and go back up, then this justifies, this investment will be justified. We don't know what's going to happen to rates and if rates do increase, either long-term or the short-end or both that's a benefit to us. But, for the last five six years, you could have said the same thing and it didn't happen. So that's why there is a continual consideration here and pushing ourselves and our thinking to eliminate work that's no longer beneficial, taking out processes that don't add values and investing in places and things that do add value and make us more competitive, more nimble, more relative to the constituents that we serve.","Matt O'Connor ","Great. Thank you.","John Stumpf","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","John Pancari ","Good morning. ","John Stumpf","Good morning.","John Pancari ","Just a couple quick areas I want to ask about. On the commercial loan yields, it looks like they were up pretty solidly 7% to 8%, or 7 to 8 bps or so for the quarter. Just want to see if we can get a little bit of color on what drove that?","John Shrewsberry","Sure, so there is a handful of things. I mean it's the mix of the assets that we are adding to that portfolio from one period to the next, which reflects customer activity, customer demand, both in terms of what's rolling on and what's rolling off. Also, you are seeing in that calculation, the impact of having swapped portions of that portfolio from floating to fixed, because that impacts the yield. We've done that partially as the recognition that we think we are going to be in a lower long-term rate environment for a longer period of time than we might have previously thought. So, that impact is \u2013 runs through there as well, still asset-sensitive, but not waiting forever for rates to begin to move in that portfolio.","John Pancari ","Okay, all right. That's helpful. And then on the credit front, back to the energy thing, just real quick, any clarity on how much of that increase in the energy-related non-accruals were E&P versus oil service, and then separately, it sounds like some of this movement may have been related to the shared national credit exam. Was there anything non-energy that may have been - any takeaways out of the shared national credit exam that may have impacted your non-energy portfolio?","John Shrewsberry","So on the first question, like - remind me the first question again.","John Pancari ","Yes, just of the\u2026 ","John Shrewsberry","E&P, it was predominantly all E&P. The services credits have \u2013 first of all, they don't go through the exact same, there is no borrowing base re-determination to occur in services companies; it's more like any other corporate in terms of how they are reviewed. But the impact has not been felt there in quite the same way as it has with E&P companies. And then back to the shared national credit review, in terms of the negative outcomes or the suggested downgrades, it really was primarily an energy set of conclusions this time around.","John Pancari ","Okay, all right. And then lastly, the home equity portfolio, just one of you can give us an update there. As you are seeing some of the lines exit their draw periods, want to see how those credits have been performing and you're seeing any migration there.","John Shrewsberry","Well, we've been \u2013 as we've talked about, ahead of this end of draw expectation for sometime now, because it was pretty easy to schedule and we are going into a couple of years when those 10-year draw periods will be coming to a close from the heaviest periods of issuance right at the \u2013 prior to the turn of the cycle and, frankly, I\u2019d say, we are experiencing a better outcome than we originally imagined in part because of our \u2013 because of our - the focus that we've had, the team that we've had facing, the proactive work that we're emphasizing trying to get people refied into something that is suitable or more tolerable for them to repay. So, things are going well.","John Stumpf","And losses in that portfolio this quarter are in the 56 or 57 basis point range. ","John Shrewsberry","Yes, very tolerable.","John Stumpf","Very tolerable.","John Pancari ","Okay, on that front, I mean, do you know how much \u2013 what percentage of your 2005 originations may have been refied already or worked down?","John Shrewsberry","I don't \u2013 right I don\u2019t at the - on this call, our real estate group certainly knows, because that's how that's been managed. So they'll know what they have left and what is gone already. But, when I'm focusing on when I say that there is a plan underway that's being executed that's working, of course for the ones that are still there and then have it refied out.","John Pancari ","Got it. All right. Thanks for taking my questions.","John Shrewsberry","Sure.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.","Marty Mosby ","Thanks. I had a question on \u2013 you talked about the duration of the balance sheet and you are doing that through swaps and through investment portfolio purchases. Can you give us a feel for, half-a-year, six months, is it nine months and how far do you want to go in the duration of the portfolio or the overall balance sheet? So, how far are we along that process?","John Shrewsberry","So, when we use the term duration, we are using it in that context, but not to define a duration of the balance sheet, but really to think about using those tools, the investment portfolio and loan portfolios to impact our overall asset or liability sensitivity. And so the net conclusion of that is that, not terribly unlike where we were at our last Investor Day. We find ourselves still asset-sensitive. We mentioned a year ago, May that we thought that we were \u2013 we had probably 10 to 30 basis points worth of net sensitivity \u2013 net benefit from a 100 basis point instantaneous parallel movement in rates. Very stylized example. And we are less asset-sensitive. If we were at the mean then, we're at the lower-end of that range today we believe. It's probably a conservative estimate. We - that's how we generally calculate things. But by adding securities, by swapping floating rates to fixed, and other actions that have occurred in the growth of the business, we've made ourselves a little bit less asset-sensitive because of the belief that we could be in a lower rate environment for a longer period of time and we are earning today rather than maintaining all of that sensitivity for the future. We still have plenty of it and we'll develop more of it as time passes, but that's how I would answer that question.","Marty Mosby ","And would you see any more lengthening in the near-term, given the steepness of the yield curve now gives you an opportunity to kind of productively use that to your advantage?","John Shrewsberry","I would expect that we\u2019d continue to be adding securities to our securities portfolio, for sure.","Marty Mosby ","And then lastly, the mortgage banking pipeline was very strong going into the second quarter. It looks like the pull through was about as low as we've seen in the last year. I was just curious if there was any operational issue or anything that happened during the quarter? Was it just refis that never got closed? What was kind of the difference in the pull through for this particular quarter?","John Shrewsberry","There is nothing that I would point to. We -- the production occurred the way we would have expected it to. We ended with a relatively long \u2013 relatively large pipeline as well. So, nothing different there.","Marty Mosby ","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker with Compass Point. Please go ahead. ","Kevin Barker ","Just a quick follow-up on the some of the mortgage banking results, you saw margins remain pretty strong compared to what you've had over historical basis and they were strong in the first quarter despite the decline in the primary\/secondary spread. Now the front-half of the quarter looked a lot stronger than the second half of the quarter. Could you just give us some detail between the differences what you saw in maybe April and early May versus what you saw in the back half of the quarter?","John Shrewsberry","Yes, it's tough to be that precise about it although I'm sure there are people in Wells Fargo Home Mortgage who are thinking about it as granularly as the question that you are asking. Certainly, in the first quarter as rates rallied hard and that pipeline really, really grew, applications came in at an increased pace. The capacity constraints to deal with that both at Wells Fargo and in the industry are supportive of higher margins as people use their scarce capacity as beneficially as they can. So you'd expect, if that's a high point for things to slip a little bit from there. In terms of where they've gotten to and where they are now, we expect them to continue to be in that range. The full range, frankly is a pretty attractive place to be operating. And as long as we can stay higher in the range like we have, we\u2019ll be thrilled to that to happen. There is also, from one quarter to the next, the mix between what's happening in retail versus what's happening through others is going to influence our gain on sale and that might look different from one originator to another. I think that's an important consideration. But, I mean, frankly, I would look at it quarter-to-quarter and then seasonally adjust it to think about what the steady-state is. But the last thing I'd say is that we are - again, we're pretty happy with where things have remained, given how competitive that market is, given how much capacity there is and we're happy to be operating here.","John Stumpf","Yes, I think, just to support John's comment, I remember when gain on sales - years ago were 40, 50, 60 basis points. So the pricing discipline, even with the capacity and the size of the market is a \u2013 I think a good thing for Americans, good thing for borrowers, good thing for the originators, because we are getting paid for the work that we're doing, the value-add.","Kevin Barker ","Okay and then just to mention - follow-up on some of the comments on the extension of the duration of the balance sheet this quarter with the use of interest rate swaps. Could you provide some more details on why you are increasing your duration at this point in the cycle? Is it a change in your view on, whether you want to be patient for higher rates or is there some other reason why you would extend the duration now?","John Shrewsberry","So, what's been happening for a while, we are talking about it a little bit more now and maybe it was a little bit starker in this quarter because deposit growth slowed also, so you saw cash balances go down while both securities and loans went up. But as you suggest, it\u2019s regardless of what's happening with short-term rates and over what period of time that normalization of policy occurs, it's our expectation that the longer-end of the curve, that we are going to be lower for longer than we would have thought six months ago, a year ago, or a couple of years ago and how we are managing the balance sheet is a reflection of that.","Kevin Barker ","Is there anything specific that you are seeing that would change your view that has changed your view in the last six months?","John Shrewsberry","Well, in the last 6 to 12 months, I would say, what's happened with rates around the world has been a big reminder that a 2.5% US tenure is a really attractive asset and could be for a really long time. So that's why I say regardless of what's happening with Fed funds, we are preparing ourselves for a long march on - at the longer end of the curve. And if we are wrong, we have to be prepared for that in terms of what it means to capital et cetera, and we certainly are and we - that drastically to make sure that we've protected our balance sheet. But in the mean time, we are getting our assets more productively deployed. I would point out, there is still $250 billion worth of cash in the bank. So there is plenty of short-term liquidity and dry powder for what happens if we are wrong and there are more attractive entry points on the way back up, if that were to occur, but it's a good question.","Kevin Barker ","Thank you for taking my questions.","Operator","Your last question will come from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research, LLC. Please go ahead.","Nancy Bush ","The best for last.","John Stumpf","Always. Hi, Nancy.","Nancy Bush ","Hi, couple questions on the mortgage front. JPMorgan Chase reported a very strong production quarter in jumbo mortgages this morning. How are you guys positioned in that market and what percentage or rough percentage of your production are jumbos?","John Shrewsberry","About 25% of our production are jumbos and that includes, of course, many of our most valuable customers in terms of the breadth of the total relationship. We carry them on our balance sheet as you know. ","Nancy Bush ","Right.","John Shrewsberry","And, I think the total category right now for jumbos on our books is about $120 billion, $125 billion of the - call it $1.7 trillion overall.","Nancy Bush ","Okay. And just a question on the mortgage business as a whole, I mean, do you consider at this point, given all the gyrations we've had in the mortgage business in the past ten years, are we at what you consider to be, a normal mortgage market right now and are you staffed appropriately for that market or where does sort of the mechanics of the mortgage business stand for you right now?","John Shrewsberry","So, in terms of staffing, I am sure it's true that we are probably a little bit heavy in some areas around loss mitigation and working NPA's and foreclosed assets through the system versus where we might be in a completely normalized point in the cycle just because they are still elevated. So there is probably opportunity there over some period of time.","From a policy normalcy point of view, there is still other things happening, whether it's agency reform, the relationship between the FHA and the industry is still not completely settled and that has to happen for people to feel good about things. We are still in those second - no meaningful secondary market for non-conforming loans and there was a good one for prime, jumbo loans that existed pre-crisis and so at some point that probably has to re-emerge and that hasn't happened yet. But, we are just as committed to the business. It's a very important part of the relationship between us and our customers, because buying and financing a home is one of the most significant things our customers will ever do. We enjoy our status as the largest mortgage servicer in the land and our status as the largest mortgage originator as well. So, we are working hard to try and shape good outcomes in those areas that are still unsettled and we are making the most of it during the period that we are in.","John Stumpf","And, Nancy, it's an insightful question because I think part of the distinguishing features of big scale players in this business where you are successful or not is how quickly you can scale up when business opportunities present themselves and how quickly you can scale down. And, we think we are pretty good at that among other things. And some are surprised that mortgage market has not come back stronger, but we went through a pretty deep downturn. This was the asset class that had the problem in 2008 and 2009 and it steadily \u2013 and it's improving and healing. But it's going to take time. And so, like John said, we really like this business for a whole host of reasons. ","Nancy Bush ","I would just ask as an add-on question, Bank of America talks about their legacy asset servicing, et cetera, which is mostly mortgages that were still on the books that they are working out. Where are you guys in - working out any problems you got through the Wachovia deal, et cetera? I mean, are you pretty much through the workout period now with most of that stuff?","John Stumpf","Well, the pick-a-pay was probably the most problematic of that portfolio and that came over - let's say in the $120 billion range - $120 billion or so; and it\u2019s $54 billion give or take now. And the average loan to value in that is in the 60s.","Nancy Bush ","All right.","John Stumpf","So, and if you look at -- if you look at the overall servicing portfolio we have, it's 94%, 95% current and so it\u2019s - we've -- still issues going through there, there is some judicial foreclosure states that we are still having to work through. But for the most part, it's performed above our expectations, especially with respect to the Wachovia part and I think we are in the later innings of working on this and as John mentioned, there is some opportunity to take some cost out. The cost of servicing a current loan versus one that's delinquent is such a big difference. So, when people look at these portfolios you like to look at the past dues, because it really \u2013 and the ones in the foreclosures because that really skews the costs on those.","John Shrewsberry","I know that this is clear in the materials, Nancy, but we are \u2013 where our non-strategic or wind down portfolio is picking down at $2 billion to $3 billion per quarter and there is $50 billion odd of it left. So, the tail of it will be here for a while.","Nancy Bush ","Okay. All right, thank you very much.","John Stumpf","Thank you. Well, this concludes our call. Thank you again for spending time with us. It's always enjoyable for us to represent our 265,000 team members and the work that they do every quarter and John and I and Jim will see you on next quarter.

My name is Regina and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions).","I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Rowe, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Rowe, you may begin your conference.","Jim Rowe","Thank you, Regina. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf; and our CFO, John Shrewsberry will discuss third quarter results and answer your questions.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our third quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I\u2019d also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today\u2019s call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement.","Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures can also be found in our SEC filings in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our website.","I will now turn our call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf.","John Stumpf","Thank you, Jim, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Our strong results in the third quarter reflect the benefit of our diversified business model and were driven by our continued focus on meeting our customers\u2019 financial needs in the real economy.","Let me highlight our growth during the third quarter compared with a year ago. We generated earnings of $5.7 billion and earnings per share of $1.02, both up 3%. We grew net interest income and non-interest income, resulting in 4% revenue growth; and our efficiency ratio improved to 57.7%.","Pretax pre-provision profit increased 7%. We had strong broad-based loan growth with our core loan portfolio up almost $51 billion or 7%. Our credit performance continued to be excellent with the net charge-off ratio declining to only 32 basis points on average loans on an annualized basis. We had a $300 million reserve release this quarter, down from $900 million a year ago. In fact in my 32 plus years with the company, I have not seen credit better.","Our deposit franchise continued to generate strong customer and balance growth with total deposits up $89 billion or 9%. We grew primary consumer checking customers by 4.9% and primary small business and business checking customers by 5.6%. This level of business performance has enabled us to maintain strong capital levels even while returning more capital to our shareholders through a higher dividends and share repurchases. We returned a net $3.6 billion to our shareholders in the third quarter, up 29% from a year ago.","Before I turn it over to John Shrewsberry, our CFO, I\u2019d like to take a minute or two and share some of my thoughts on the economy and the housing market. While the path to a full economic recovery remains uneven, including the volatility we\u2019ve seen recently and the current low rate environment provides some challenges, I am very optimistic about the future. The U.S. economy added 248,000 jobs last month, the 48 straight monthly employment gain tying the record for the longest consecutive string of job gains ever.","There are currently more job openings than at any time since early 2001. Household wealth is at an all-time high and after years of paying down debt, the consumer debt burden is at the lowest level in over 30 years. Consumers are now better positioned for increased spending and borrowing.","The U.S. economy is also benefiting from the increasing domestic oil and gas productions, which is at the highest level in almost 30 years and rising fast, up 14% over the past year. Fiscal conditions have improved at all levels of government, and government payrolls are once again on the rise for the first time this decade.","Historically, most recoveries in this country have been led by housing. While the residential real estate market has definitely gotten better, which is good for the U.S. economy, it has not fully recovered. I believe there are several factors holding the housing market back from a complete recovery.","First, household formation is slower than it has been in the past. Second, national student debt balances have increased leading less money available to pay for our mortgage. Third, in some markets, inventory is not available especially in coastal areas. Finally, credit is still not obtainable for all qualified borrowers due in part to the credit overlays that many mortgage lenders, including Wells Fargo use to help reduce repurchase risk.","Despite these challenges, a recent survey we conducted showed that home ownership is still an aspiration for 95% of respondents. Home prices are up 7% over the past year and I believe the housing market will continue its recovery driven by pent-up demand and affordability that even with the increase in home prices is still far better than the historical average. These trends are all positive for our country, our customers, our shareholders, as well as Wells Fargo and we continue our service to the real economy.","Now John Shrewsberry, CFO will provide more details on our third quarter results.","John?","John Shrewsberry","Thanks John and good morning everyone. My comments will follow the presentation included in the quarterly supplements starting on page two. John and I will then answer your questions. Wells Fargo had another strong quarter earning $5.7 billion and growing EPS to $1.02. Generating this level of consistent earnings while economic growth has been uneven and interest rates have remained low, demonstrates the benefit of our diversified business model. We grew both revenue and pre-tax, pre-provision profit from second quarter and have grown pretax pre-provision profit for four consecutive quarters.","Our results also reflected solid loan and deposit growth that was diversified across our businesses. Our capital levels remained strong even as we returned $3.6 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases.","As John highlighted and as you can see on page three, we had strong year-over-year growth across a number of important business drivers. We grew net interest income amidst the persistent low rate environment with strong earning asset growth; and our ability to grow non-interest income by $542 million or 6% from a year ago even as mortgage originations declined by 40%, demonstrates the benefit of our diversified sources of fee income.","Page four highlights our revenue diversification and the balance between spread and fee income. We have over 90 businesses and in any given quarter, some will drive more revenue growth than others. For example, the strength in the markets over the past few years has benefited our market sensitive businesses. Market sensitive revenue was 5% of our total revenue in the third quarter, up from 4% in the second quarter but lower than the 7% contribution in the first quarter.","Let me highlight some key drivers of our third quarter results from a balance sheet and income statement perspective, starting on page five. Our balance sheet has never been stronger; we\u2019ve increased our liquidity position, improved the quality of our assets and hold more capital. Furthermore, while we\u2019re positioned to benefit from rising rates, we\u2019re confident in our ability to continue to deliver strong results if rates remain low.","Investment securities increased $9.9 billion from the second quarter with $25 billion of purchases partially offset by run-off. We issue $16.3 billion of liquidity related long-term debt as well as some additional liquidity related short-term funding during the third quarter. We are now solidly over 100% for the LCR, but keep in mind that the LCR is a minimum requirement. We have a significant amount of cash available to deploy, both to meet our customers\u2019 financial needs and to opportunistically purchase high quality assets.","Turning to the income statement on page six, revenue grew $147 million during the quarter with growth in net interest income and stable non-interest income. I will highlight the drivers of revenue growth in more detail later, but let me take a moment now to highlight the growth in market sensitive revenue which increased $231 million from second quarter.","Net gains from debt securities were up $182 million as we sold securities, primarily non-agency MBS as part of our ongoing balance sheet management. Net gains from equity investments were up $263 million from second quarter, reflecting strong results in our venture capital businesses, but were down a $135 million from first quarter.","We\u2019ve been in these core businesses for decades and results are naturally cyclical and driven by market conditions. Non-controlling interest reduces the impact of the equity gains to our net income and increased $166 million from second quarter. The increase in market sensitive revenue from debt and equity gains was partially offset by $214 million of lower trading gains, the decline in trading reflected $163 million of lower deferred compensation plan investment results which was offset in employee benefits expense and lower customer accommodation trading.","Our results this quarter also reflected $227 million of lower income tax expense from the second quarter, reflecting tax benefits primarily due to charitable donations of appreciated securities.","As shown on page seven, we continued to have strong broad-based loan growth in the third quarter, our 13th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Our core portfolio grew by $50.8 billion or 7% from a year ago and was up $12.2 billion or 6% annualized from the second quarter. Our liquidating portfolio was down $21 billion from a year ago and is now only 8% of our total loans, down from 10% a year ago. Average loan yields have remained relatively stable over the past year and were up one basis point from second quarter.","On page eight, we highlighted a number of our loan portfolios that had strong year-over-year growth. C&I loans were up $23.8 billion or 13% from a year ago with diversified growth that I\u2019ll highlight on the next page. We\u2019re the largest commercial real-estate lender in the country and we\u2019re benefiting from the growth in new construction. Our commercial real-estate portfolio grew $3.1 billion from a year ago.","Foreign loans grew $700 million or 2% from a year ago, reflecting growth in trade finance and the UK commercial real-estate acquisition we completed in the third quarter of last year. Core 1-4 family first mortgage loans grew $16.4 billion or 9% from a year ago with growth in high quality non-conforming mortgages, primarily jumbo loans. The credit quality of our core mortgage portfolio was outstanding with only seven basis points of loss in the third quarter.","We\u2019re the number one auto lender in the country. Auto loans were up $5.5 billion or 11% from last year, reflecting strong originations. Credit card balances were up $2.8 million or 11% from a year ago, benefiting from continued account growth.","Slide nine demonstrates the diversity of the businesses that contributed to the growth in C&I loans; let me highlight just a few. Asset-backed finance increased $5.3 billion with increased utilization and new originations across all asset classes. Corporate banking grew $4.4 billion, driven by new customer growth and higher utilization rates from existing customers. And commercial banking serving our middle market customers grew $3.8 billion with diversified growth across geographies and industries.","As you can see on page 10, average deposits totaled $1.1 trillion in the third quarter, up $25.6 billion from second quarter with growth in both commercial and consumer balances. Due to our outstanding deposit franchise, we\u2019ve been able to grow deposits over 5% on a year-over-year basis every quarter since the third quarter of 2011. Our primary consumer checking customers were up 4.9% from a year ago and we grew primary small business and business banking checking customers by 5.6%. Our average deposit costs were 10 basis points in the third quarter, consistent with second quarter and 2 basis points lower than a year ago.","Our NIM declined 9 basis points from the second quarter, 4 basis points of this decline was from strong customer driven deposit growth because excess deposits remain invested in cash equivalents in the current environment. Deposit growth put pressure on the NIM, but was basically neutral to net interest income. Liquidity-related actions both term deposits and long-term debt also diluted the margin by 4 basis points. The impact of all other balance sheet growth and reprising was again minimal this quarter, reducing the margin by one basis point.","Despite the decline in the net interest margin, we continue to grow net interest income on a tax equivalent basis, up $147 million from the second quarter as a result of the growth in earning assets, higher PCI accretion and one additional day in the quarter. Our balance sheet is asset-sensitive, so we\u2019re well positioned to benefit from higher rates, but we\u2019re not relying on rates to increase in order to generate growth. As we have demonstrated in this historically low rate environment, we believe we can grow net interest income overtime even if rates remain low.","While total non-interest income was unchanged from the second quarter, we had growth across a number of business drivers including deposit service charges, retail brokerage, trust and investment management, card fees, commercial real estate brokerage and the market-sensitive revenue that I highlighted earlier.","This growth was offset by lower investment banking fees, which declined 24% from second quarter consistent with the decline in the market people [ph]. Insurance was down $65 million reflecting the impact from the sale of 40 offices last quarter and also seasonality in the crop insurance business.","Other non-interest income was down $95 million from second quarter, which had included the gain from the sale of the insurance offices. Mortgage banking revenue declined $90 million from second quarter. Mortgage origination gains were up $266 million from last quarter primarily due to gain on sale margins increasing to 182 basis points and higher mortgage repurchase reserve release.","The majority of our originations were tied to purchase activity, 70% originations in the third quarter, up from 59% a year ago. We currently expect originations to be down in the fourth quarter reflecting normal seasonality in the purchase market. Servicing income declined $356 million from second quarter; approximately one-half of this decline was from higher unreimbursed direct servicing products, which reduced gross servicing fee. The rest of the decline was driven by lower net mortgage servicing rights results reflecting lower carry and hedging gains. Our gain on sale margin is expected to remain within the range we\u2019ve seen over the past four quarters.","As shown on page 13, expenses were up $54 million from second quarter, while our efficiency ratio improved to 57.7%. We\u2019ve consistently worked to improving our efficiency which has enabled us to maintain a high level of customer service, while we\u2019ve continue to appropriately invest in our businesses.","We\u2019ve been significantly increasing our investments in our already strong risk management practices. Our quarterly expenses related to risk and compliance have increased by approximately $100 million over the past year and we\u2019ve added over 1,500 team members in this area.","Additionally, operating losses in the third quarter were $417 million, primarily reflecting litigation accruals. We expect our efficiency ratio will remain within our target range of 55% to 59% in the fourth quarter.","Turning to our business segments starting on page 14, community banking earned $3.5 billion in the third quarter, up 4% from a year ago and up 1% from second quarter. By consistently providing outstanding customer service with the convenience of the most extensive store network in the country, an award winning mobile and online banking, we\u2019ve had strong net household growth.","In fact, August was our strongest month for net retail bank household growth in over three years. These additional households will help drive our future growth as we focus on offering customers the products and services they need to help them succeed financially.","Our results continued to benefit from growth in our debit and credit card business. Debit card purchase volume was up 8% from a year ago driven by primary checking customer growth and increased usage from existing customers. Credit card purchase volume grew 16% from a year ago. We\u2019ve continued to increase our credit card penetration rate growing from 36% a year ago to 39.7% and our new customers are spending more and transacting at a greater frequency.","By consistently focus on meeting the financial needs of our small business customers, Wells Fargo has been America\u2019s number one lender to small businesses for 12 consecutive years. We do business with 1 in 10 small businesses and grew primary business checking customers by 5.6% from a year ago.","Wholesale banking earned $1.9 billion in the third quarter, down 3% from a year ago and 2% from second quarter. While earnings were down, there were number of underlying trends that demonstrated business momentum. Loan growth remained strong, up $28.8 billion or 10% from a year ago with growth across many businesses as I highlighted earlier.","Credit quality remained outstanding with seven consecutive quarters of net recoveries. Deposit growth was also strong with average core deposits of $43.1 billion or 18% from a year ago with diversified growth across wholesale businesses. Wholesale banking cross-sell increased to 7.2 products per relationship, up from 7.0 a year ago. And treasury management grew revenue by 9% from a year ago, reflecting new product sales and re-pricing.","Wealth, brokerage and retirement earned $550 million in the third quarter, up 22% from a year ago and 1% from second quarter. Year-over-year results were driven by strong revenue growth up 7% with increases in both net interest income and non-interest income. Asset-based fees increased 18% from a year ago, reflecting increased market valuation and net flows. WBR results continue to benefit from strong loan growth, up 13% from a year ago driven by growth in high quality non-conforming mortgage loans and security-based lending. This was WBR\u2019s fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year loan growth.","Turning to page 17, credit quality continued to improve with charge-offs at historic lows. Our new charge-off ratio declined to just 32 basis points with average loans; consumer losses were 62 basis points and commercial loans had a net recovery of two basis points. The improvement in our asset quality reflected the benefit of the improving economy and our continued focus on originating high quality loans. For example, approximately 57% of the consumer first mortgage portfolio was originated after 2008 when new underwriting standards were implemented.","Non-performing assets have declined for eight consecutive quarters and were down $406 million from second quarter. Non-accrual loans declined $607 million while foreclosed assets increased $201 million driven by higher government ensured or guaranteed properties, primarily in judicial states.","The reserve release was $300 million in the third quarter, down $200 million from the second quarter and down $600 million from a year ago. We continue to expect future reserve releases absent a significant deterioration in the economy but expect a lower level of future releases as the rate of credit improvement slows and the loan portfolio continues to grow.","Our capital level has remained strong with our estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III using the advanced approach fully phased in at 10.46% in the third quarter. While the amount of RWA we determined under the standardized and advanced approaches has been converging, our ratio this quarter was determined under the advanced approach because RWA under the advanced approach was higher.","As shown on slide 19, our strong capital levels have allowed us to return more capital to our shareholders. We returned $3.6 billion to shareholders in the third quarter and our net payout ratio is 66% in the third quarter within our target range of 55% to 75%. Our common shares outstanding declined by 34.9 million shares in the quarter, the largest decline in over six years. We purchased 48.7 million common shares and entered into a $1 billion forward repurchase contract that\u2019s expected to settle in the fourth quarter for approximately 19.8 million shares. We reduced our common shares outstanding by 58.7 million shares from a year ago and expect further reductions in the fourth quarter.","In summary, our results in the third quarter reflect the benefit of our diversified business model which has enabled us to produce strong and consistent results over a variety of economic and interest rate environments. Our results were driven by strong loan and deposit growth, and we grew revenue and pretax pre-provision profits. We increased our capital levels and returned more capital to shareholders. We continued to execute against all of the targets we established at Investor Day operating within our stated ranges for ROA, ROE, efficiency ratio and capital return.","Our balance sheet has never been stronger reflecting higher capital liquidity levels and improved asset quality. While we\u2019re well positioned to benefit from increased economic activity and higher rates, as we\u2019ve demonstrated by our consistent financial performance in a variety of environments, we\u2019re not depending on the economy improving or rate rising to generate strong results. I\u2019m optimistic about our future opportunities as we continue to focus on serving customers and growing relationships.","I will now open up the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Our first question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, good morning.","John Stumpf","Good morning.","John Shrewsberry","Good morning.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","John, my first question is on the net interest income and net interest margin. We hear you loud and clear in terms of the message with regards to the NII trajectory. As we think about the net interest margin going forward given the stability of your loan yield over the past three quarters and your funding cost also stable over the past three quarters. Is really there is the incremental hit on the margin in this rate environment really going to come from deposit flow given that you did issued $16 billion in debt in the quarter for liquidity purposes already?","John Stumpf","So that\u2019s probably true and it also has a lot to do with what we choose to do with the access deposits or frankly access funding as it sits on our balance sheet. We\u2019re making choices between leaving that liquidity in cash equivalents setting at the Fed or deploying it in the HQLA or loans for that matter if there enough demand for it or other assets with yields. And we\u2019re making those determinations based on how we feel about entry points in the market and what we think it does to our capital sensitivity in the event of a backup subsequently and it\u2019s those types of choices that are going to drive us to increase the all-in yield on the west side of the balance sheet, whether the funding is coming from deposits or from term funding.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America, Merrill Lynch","Got it. And my second question is given Governor Tarullo\u2019s speech early in the September, there are clearly two ruling issues where the industry that may not be as relevant to Wells. Higher CET 1 buffers relative to your short-term funding base and also the interpretation of NSSR by over rules by Basel. Do you see advantage given where you are on both the business mix and capital spectrum to perhaps take advantage of players that need to have more stringent buffers mainly in terms of continuing to grow market share in wholesale banking?","John Stumpf","It\u2019s possible. On both of the measures we think we end up at the low-end of the risk-adjusted spectrum in terms of the bad outcomes that occur. And that might give us an opportunity to do a little bit more for our customers if they needed and if the risk-adjusted returns are appropriate.","I think that the -- we\u2019re all waiting to see what happens to the returns in those businesses based on the actions taken by people who are constrained by both of those -- who are more constrained by both of those new ratios. What it means for pricing, what it means for our customer behavior et cetera. But we\u2019re happy with the approach that we\u2019ve taken and we\u2019re here to serve the customers that we have. And, but you are right, we\u2019re probably at the more advantaged end of the spectrum with respect to both of those measures.","John Shrewsberry","","Yes. Erika I said, to add to that, nothing that\u2019s happening to-date and nothing that we see in the horizon will allow will get in our way or impede our way to help customers and to serve them. And I think that puts us in a very good position.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, I\u2019ll step-off. Thank you for taking my questions.","John Stumpf","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Hi, good morning.","John Stumpf","Hi.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","John I appreciate your color on reminding us about that minority interest back out on some of the trading related activities. But just wondering if you can help us understand from those portfolios that still generate a healthy amount of fee income, what\u2019s kind of left in it still there if you think across net gains from trading activities debt securities and net gains from equity investment sort of question that comes up frequently with the investment community?","John Stumpf","Sure. Well, there are variety of different businesses that contribute to those results. So the big drivers would be our -- the venture activity that we have, the Norwest Venture Partners, it would be the activity of investment banking where we\u2019ve got customer combination trading. It\u2019s the impact of the hedging that we do for our deferred comp program and then there is, at least in this quarter and probably in future quarters some amount of balance sheet management on the debt portfolio. And they all contribute.","So it\u2019s a diversified set of investments, different drivers in each case, some of them are more sensitive to where we are in the rate cycles, some of them are more sensitive to where we are in the equity valuation cycle. But they\u2019ve contributed more or less you\u2019ll call it 4%, 5% to 7% or 8% over a number of quarters. And there isn\u2019t one thing that I would hang on, I\u2019d think of them as being core to our business results in different ways, but over the long-term.","John Shrewsberry","Ken? And John mentioned that within those business decades, actually a lot of decades, 50 years, so this with respect to venture and equity partners, so these are long term businesses for us.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","","Yes. And I think that\u2019s the point which is that you don\u2019t see any growth coming as far as the ability to continue to realize either gains or benefits from those activities and there is some countercyclical pieces within it as well?","John Stumpf","They are part of what\u2019s a broader set of diversified non-interest income whatever it is. So whether they\u2019re contributing 4% or 7% as it has been in recent history and how they work in sync with all of the other things that are going on in terms of customer facing fee generating activity that is the diversified model.","And as I mentioned, some of them are more interest rate sensitive and were in a low rate environment, so there is higher unrealized gains. Some of them are levered to equity markets and exit strategies for portfolio investments. But I would think of them as part of the broader mix of diversified non-interest income sources.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","","Understood. And my next question is just on the expense side, understanding that you\u2019re going to still be living in this some 55%, 59% range, we did see kind of flattish fee side, a little bit NII growth but then a little bit of higher expenses as well. And I\u2019m just wondering as you think about that level of expenses and continue to manage forward in what\u2019s still looking to be a pretty tough rate environment and these ongoing challenges from NIM pressures, any adjustments that you\u2019re thinking about or contemplating as far as just kind of the need to continue to manage that expense base even tighter than you\u2019ve already been and where would opportunities be so?","John Stumpf","","We\u2019re always trying to be as efficient as we can to make sure that we have the resources available to deliver what customers need. And of course as we\u2019ve mentioned, we\u2019re at a time when the focus in the investment, in the risk management area is very high. So we\u2019re working constantly to try and be as efficient as we can and in areas where it won\u2019t impact customers and where it doesn\u2019t hinder us in terms of our risk management activity.","Some examples, which we\u2019ve talked about a little bit before are really in other areas, for example the space that we consume, the way we think about our purchasing, the technology that we use et cetera. We can always be a little bit more efficient. And it\u2019s a constant job here to try and make the most of that.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","But you guys haven\u2019t felt that incremental compliance burden increasing to a level where you feel the need to pull the continuous improvement cord?","John Stumpf","I think we are pulling the continuous improvement cord and in part, because we\u2019re spending more in compliance and risk management, like we\u2019re spending more in our -- in the customer experience and our customer facing activity. But in order to afford both of those things, we have to be really vigilant around the business as usual expenses; and that\u2019s continuous improvement.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Understood, thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Hi, good morning. John, question on the mortgage revenues; on the servicing side, the growth servicing revenues are down about 200 million, you mentioned the unreimbursed servicing costs. Is that for your one-timers that the pop-up and those, it seems like those were coming down from a while and then they\u2019ve kind of reversed this quarter, that just bounced around or any color you can give on that?","John Stumpf","It had come down; it bounced back up. Our sense is that trajectory is going to be reduced over the longer ark of the mortgage servicing cycle; it\u2019s going to be hard to forecast it quarter-to-quarter. So I wouldn\u2019t expect it as low as it\u2019s been for the last couple of quarters, this maybe a more average quarter. And over some period of time as the level of non-performing loans, foreclosed assets et cetera begins to abate then you\u2019d expect that to raced itself down, but this is probably a relatively normal level.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. And in terms of capital on the advanced approach, you mentioned the RWA kind of ratio to total assets seems like it got a little better on better credit quality and data refinements. Any more color on that? Is that something that also just kind of bounces around quarter-to-quarter or we still have some model improvements you can do from here?","John Stumpf","There is always more that we can do with improved and more focus on data and modeling. But you could come to a point where just because of the nature of our assets, loans and securities that attract the risk weights that they do that were constrained on the standardized side. So, and we mentioned that they are converging, they are very close together right now in terms of the RWA calculation. But the takeaway is that our capital level did increase a little bit in the quarter under the advanced approach. And in spite of that, we\u2019re still earning north of 13% as an ROA, which we\u2019re very proud of.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","And that stuff that just rolled off in terms of the better credit-quality like older assets that roll off, is that why it\u2019s getting better?","John Stumpf","It\u2019s a combination of roll off and hard work around data and modeling and continuous refinement.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","And with that ratio at 10.46 is this the kind of level that you want to run at on Tier 1 common?","John Stumpf","Tough to say. As we said in Investor Day, this is probably in excess of the buffer that we might have imagined when we originally vectored in toward our regulatory capital levels. And it\u2019s really a function of CCAR and some of the assumptions that are made in the CCAR process as it is applied. So as we go from CCAR to CCAR and we present our starting capital point, we present our expected capital generation and our capital actions and what they yield in terms of capital levels, we\u2019re trying to manage that as appropriately as we can to got the right amount of return back to shareholders, which we believe that we\u2019ve done at a 66% payout ratio. But it\u2019s an art form because of all of the inputs and the other actors in the process.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. And just a quick follow-up to Erika\u2019s question on the liquidity building, it sounds like you\u2019re now above the minimums of your calculations, but you might decide to build some buffer going forward, so we might expect a little bit more on that front from you?","John Stumpf","So I think we\u2019re in a period where big banks are trying to figure out what the right buffer is as a result of our own internal stress testing and the expectations on G-SIBs in particular. So we\u2019re in the phase. We feel great about where we are right now. Nobody has mentioned [deal lack] yet, but there is some work to do to figure out where we\u2019re going on that front and how that -- what the interplay is between liquidity we\u2019ve already built and what future requirements are going to be. So I think that heavy lifting is probably behind us for the time being. But I wouldn\u2019t say that we\u2019re stopped.","John Shrewsberry","And John, one of the strengths of the company of course is our continued ability to grow high quality, low cost core deposits, which is critical in all of this.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Okay, great. Thanks guys.","John Stumpf","Thanks John.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank","Hey guys.","John Stumpf","Hey Matt.","John Shrewsberry","Hey Matt.","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank","Just wanted to open some of the rate related questions earlier, this was not a Wells specific issue, but you are the first of kind of the original banks to come out. If the tenure does stay, right now it\u2019s sitting at 2 to 2.2, my screen shows. Is this meaningful as we think about I guess, both the NIM and then could there be some opportunities on refis if we stay down here for a little bit?","John Shrewsberry","I don\u2019t know if that gets us back in the money refi scenario, but probably still some distance away from that. I think that it is meaningful than it\u2019s more about the expectation that how long rates stay low because that will influence the decision to redeploy cash equivalents into assets with duration. And if you imagine that term rates are going to back up in the foreseeable future, just from a capital preservation perspective, you\u2019re probably less likely to redeploy out of cash and into higher earning assets. And so that\u2019s the calculus and the judgment that we make here relatively regularly and it feels frankly like the market is now discounting the idea that there is any sort of meaningful move up in rates in the 2015 timeframe.","So if we\u2019re going to be lower for longer, I think it means a lot for banks like ours and it could mean you have to be that much more vigilant on expenses. I think it means you have to think about how your assets are deployed and how much cash you think you really need to carry. And we\u2019ll be conducting that balance between the risk to capital if rates back up and the risk to earnings if rates stay low or underinvested.","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank","Okay. And then I guess a somewhat related theme spread pressure in the commercial lending business. We saw your yields down about 10 bps quarter-to-quarter. And I guess there is two phenomenon that\u2019s going on. One, the new loans that you\u2019re adding at lower spreads just generally speaking for the industry but then maybe some loans that you did a few years ago are coming up for renewal and there is some de-pricing there. Maybe just talk about like which of those two is a bigger driver at this point, how should we think about other dynamics in that book?","John Stumpf","I don\u2019t know which of those two drove the 10 basis-point drop in this quarter or who was a greater contributor to that drop in this quarter. It is a competitive environment out there. We\u2019re happy to be able to have a full toolkit when we square off with our commercial customers because we\u2019re in a position to earn more of their business and to generate more of a return on the risk capital that\u2019s associated with the loan that we\u2019re going to make. We contrast ourselves with some other firms that we compete with who are getting paid primarily from the loan yield itself enough from the broader relationship. So we like our competitive stance in that range. We have backed away from the table in some situations, not so much on price, but where we see credit or terms getting a little bit frothy, because that\u2019s another lever that people pull in order to compete for these types of assets.","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Any signs of stabilization in that spread or just still in (inaudible)?","John Stumpf","I think at some level, it\u2019s got to be stabilized by the marginal player who is only getting a return from the asset itself, because there are levels below which they can\u2019t go, because they\u2019re not going to generate a sufficient return on capital. And they have no other cards to play in terms of generating relationship returns by providing product or service. And some of the smaller banks who participate in those markets would be examples of that.","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","John Stumpf","Hello Joe.","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks. Good morning John and John.","John Shrewsberry","Hey, Joe.","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets","I guess looking at your new C&I slide on page nine, how much of your growth do you think is coming from market share gains as opposed to increased demand? And along those lines, last quarter you talked about seeing increased confidence among business owners. Is that still the case generally?","John Stumpf","Well, speaking for market share gains, it depends on which column in that slide you\u2019re talking about. We have leading market share and our increasing share in some of those businesses; and some of them, they might include examples of businesses where we\u2019ve chosen to slow down a little bit, if the competition\u2019s got racy. So it\u2019s a combination of things, of both market share growth and of the size of the market increasing.","So, Joe, if you look at more than just commercial customers broadly, there has actually been fairly good activity, now there has been volatility lately in the market, but if you look auto sales and we participate in that business of course, August was the biggest sales month, maybe in I don\u2019t know how many years. Consumers, our credit card activities are increasing. We\u2019re doing -- we had growth in our mortgage portfolio. So, it\u2019s very broad-based.","And when I\u2019m out calling customers, corporate customers, middle-market customers, there seems to be more -- at least more discussion about activity. And the marketplace is not totally ubiquitous; there is places that are stronger, and energy for example and those places are really doing well; [Agus] having a pretty good year; technology. It depends on what part the requirement is. But core I see and I hear more optimism than I heard a year ago for example.","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. That\u2019s helpful color. I guess lastly just can you share with us any thoughts on Apple Pay and how readily you see it being adopted and what sort of impact it may have on the broader payments business?","John Stumpf","Yes, as you know, we are participating in that. And there are I think 7 million to 8 million [terminals] merchants out of the marketplace and only a few hundred thousand have the NFC chip in them and that you need that the near field communication chip. So, this will take, there will be an adoption but we\u2019re pleased and excited on behalf of our customers to participate in that. And it will evolve over time.","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Thanks so much.","John Stumpf","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Hi, good morning.","John Stumpf","Good morning Betsy.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Hey couple of questions. One was on the two that you did mention, there obviously is something that you\u2019re in the review of. I think the expectation is that in the U.S. at least we\u2019ll have to have senior through common 20% to 25% of risk weighted assets. And if you\u2019re on the high-end of that range, can you give us a sense of what you might do to minimize any impact?","John Stumpf","There is still a lot to know. We\u2019re seeing similar headline numbers, maybe a little bit lower, 19.5 to 23.5. And this is all research that\u2019s been published based on information that\u2019s in the market that hasn\u2019t beneficially sanctioned. So who knows? And over what period of time it has to get phased in is unknown. What counts, what doesn\u2019t count among your existing capital structure is unknown. What -- which entities that you issue out of and whether there are going to be caps on those types of things. So there is a handful of questions that are unknown.","Our sense is that we\u2019re going to end up at the lower end of the range. We calculate that we probably have about 18% today that qualifies and for the end up having the issue we\u2019ll probably be issuing a form of senior unsecured mostly Holdco debt. And it will happen over some period of time. And it will end up being an earnings drag because we\u2019ll issue that debt and pay our corporate spread and we\u2019ll take that cash and we\u2019ll reinvest it in some more yielding either HQLA or equivalent. And it will become a new part of the cost structure and capital structure of bank.","So, my short answer is there is still a lot to know, but we\u2019ll deal with it when it comes and it doesn\u2019t seem instrumental.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Right. And there is no rush to get it done quickly, right, I mean I think it\u2019s -- you have until 01\/01\/19?","John Stumpf","Don\u2019t know yet, but I\u2019ve heard it similarly that it will be a longish raise in period.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Then two other quick questions, one is on the auto business. You highlighted that you are nation\u2019s largest bank lender of auto and wanted to understand how you\u2019re thinking about that given the risk retention rules that are out there, clearly it\u2019s just a proposal so it\u2019s not fully baked yet but this outline that you have to at sometime in the future hold 5% of any securitizations that you do in auto. Does that matter to you?","John Stumpf","It doesn\u2019t matter to us in our current business model because we don\u2019t securitize our auto loans; we own 100% of the risk on every one of them. And frankly in the auto loan securitization business for those who do use securitization that\u2019s the general business model which is that people own the bottom of the capital structure and retain their own risk which is different than mortgage, but that\u2019s how auto finance companies generally works. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to have a real impact on Wells Fargo.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Right. And obviously from the perspective of the competitive dynamic if there were a committed play?","John Stumpf","Well, to the extent that it makes harder for other people to compete and that could be there for Wells Fargo.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","And then lastly just on mortgage. John you mentioned at the beginning a lot of the headwinds that are sitting in front of us in mortgage, one of the questions we get often is what about the credit box? And is there an opportunity here as home prices improve and as consumer balance sheets improve that there is some losing of standards on the credit box; maybe you could speak to that?","John Stumpf","Well I would say, I don\u2019t know that\u2019s valued so much. I think the bigger part of the credit box right now to open up would be a better understanding of repurchase risk. And we\u2019re doing a lot of work with folks and the government about that issue. I think that influenced it more than value of homes. Although values are important, but because your credit overlays today are not related to values, they\u2019re related to in many cases repurchase risks.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Right. And apparently the FHFA is working on crystallizing that more clearly for people I assume it\u2019s what you\u2019re talking about?","John Stumpf","Yes, exactly. There has to be, I think it\u2019s helpful to America to American homeowners, perspective homeowners to the agencies and to originators that there is a understanding of when risk transfers. Now, if the originator does a poor job and doesn\u2019t underwrite properly, surly they should be held accountable. But if a default happens later and due to a technical issue unrelated to the payment ability of the customer that could have been known then risk should transfer. And whenever that period of time is, I think that would be helpful. And there are a number of Americans who want to buy home, can afford to buy home, who simply can get credit.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","So do you think you, if you had certain amount of clarity like two plus three years risk transfers assuming we did a good job as an underwriter, would that have a material impact on how you are putting on your credit overlays?","John Stumpf","Well, it would surely change. It would really the change the way we look at overlays. And I\u2019m not saying it is, could have changes to market, but those every home that gets sold that satisfies a customers need not only fulfills a dream, but a dollar spent on a home multiply through the economy like no other thing that we do, I mean a loan to a small business, we love it, do a lot, but a loan to homeowner is magical in that respect. So every time we can serve another customer, good things happen.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Hi, can you hear me?","John Stumpf","Yes, hi Mike. Good morning.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Hey, John, do you still dream about checking account? And the reason I asked -- or do you dream about them as much, because with the ten year where it is, I mean do you still go all gung ho, get as much deposits as you can get to the long-term value or do you somehow need to balance that with the need for shorter term profitability?","John Stumpf","In fact Mike I\u2019m going to bed earlier these days, so I can even dream longer about them. I still just love checking, and here is why. But it\u2019s a good question, it\u2019s a serious question.","First of all, when an account comes like we grew net primary checking accounts 4.9% on the consumer side and 5.6% on the business side, they don\u2019t come alone, they come with a relationship. And the increases you are seeing and debit card activity and credit card, we almost have 40% of our customers now carry our credit card that was 22% in 2009, and they do other things with us. And secondly, you know how expensive it is to bill liquidity for the LCR and other things; deposits are hugely important in that. So, now the love affair has not ended and we won\u2019t be in this environment forever. But if we can serve customers for a long time that feels like even we\u2019d love that.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Well you mentioned that you are trying to mitigate the impact somewhat with expenses and you are actually increasing your number of branches but I guess you are reducing the square feet. Can you give us some sense of what sort of square foot reduction you are looking for in your bank branches say over 5 or even 10 years?","John Stumpf","I\u2019ll give you -- let me give you kind of a high level and then I\u2019ll try to answer your question specifically. When we -- if you go back five, six years, we had about 116 million or 117 million square feet and that was not only for our stores but for all of our people; today that\u2019s in the 93 million, 94 million square foot range. We still think we have quite ways to go. We have 6,200 banking stores and we have another couple of thousand other advisor and mortgage stores but let\u2019s just talk about the banking stores for a second.","We try to refresh 500, 600 of those every year plus we are -- we\u2019re at pretty steady state right now. We\u2019re in that 6,200; we will replace two with the new one and relocate it. When we do refresh them, we will reduce in many case square footage or increase the density in the stores. I think you and I\u2019ve actually had discussions about which is now a three stores in the Washington area where these are, I wouldn\u2019t say stores of the future in terms of replace all of our 6,200 stores but they fit into the model where they are 1,000 to 1,200 square feet; during the day time it\u2019s a full functioning store, night time the walls folding, it\u2019s ATM best field 7X24; and so all of that matters in the mix. And the reason we are doing that is that we have found stores are still critically important to the overall distribution community and convenience we provide customers.","So we will continue to march in this way; it doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to replace every store, sometimes we are even adding space because it\u2019s kind of a hub and spoke. So, it\u2019s really a collage of store designs and activities that all fit into this. But you\u2019re right with the idea of reducing overhead, reducing space we\u2019re providing the convenience customers want.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","So over the last five years you reduced square feet by about one-fifth, over the next five years how much do you think you can reduce it by?","John Shrewsberry","I don\u2019t know that we have absolute goal, but it will continue to go down. There are lots of opportunities and that\u2019s going to be critical.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","And just one separate question, you had a comment in the American Bank I think it was and you alluded to it today that it\u2019s tougher for some individuals to get mortgage loans from Wells Fargo because of the risk of repurchase. And so is this simply, would you describe it as an unintended consequence of some of the regulatory actions over the past few years?","John Shrewsberry","I would say it\u2019s unintended consequence of activity, I don\u2019t know but so much on the regulation side, but it sure is. It can give us a cause to pause and other originators, we\u2019re not unique in this. What you have repurchase request that go back 8 and 10 years and in many cases are things unrelated to the credit quality or the credit payment ability of the borrower at the time of the borrowing. We\u2019ve put open ways on. Now we start to reduce a little of those if we start to understand more about repurchase, but it\u2019s just, it is an unintended consequence. I don\u2019t if it\u2019s so much regulation as it is the activities of the GSEs.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","So is this a permanent dampening for the mortgage market?","John Shrewsberry","No, I actually think that we\u2019re going to -- I\u2019m hopeful we\u2019re going to figure this out. We\u2019re working with actually too many groups who are saying to us, this isn\u2019t working for us. And we\u2019re working with other originators, we\u2019re working with the Mortgage Bankers\u2019 Association, we\u2019re working with the head of the FHFA, we\u2019re working with the GSEs, we\u2019re working with government agencies the Fed and others because we need to figure this out.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Alright. Thanks a lot.","John Shrewsberry","Thank you, Mike.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities","Thanks. Good morning. You guys mentioned in response to an earlier question that we\u2019re not going to be in this environment forever. Following up on that thought, I was hoping you could share your deposit growth outlook just from a high level with QE now coming to an end. Would you expect to see a slowdown and overall industry deposit growth and the corresponding excess liquidity building? And if so, does that mean that some of the excess liquidity driven NIM compression that we\u2019ve been seeing should abate?","John Shrewsberry","Let me take a shot at that. Clearly money supply and what\u2019s happening there has influence. But I can tell you our household growth; I think John mentioned in his numbers, August is the strongest we\u2019ve seen in years. And because of where our store distribution and the geography of it, we happen to be in higher growth states. We happen to get a disproportionate growth of millennials and in emerging communities.","So I can\u2019t tell you what\u2019s going to happen at the top of the house with M1 or M2 I\u2019d would like that, but I\u2019m confident about the way we run our retail franchise and the work we\u2019re doing at wealth brokerage retirement. And frankly on the corporate side in winning new customers and growing not only existing accounts, but growing new accounts. And frankly that\u2019s one of the reason stores are important. Our strongest growth is in areas where we have the best distribution of a store network not that it\u2019s the only part of the distribution, but it\u2019s a critical part for acquisition.","John Stumpf","One thing that I would add to that is that our deposits are disproportionately core deposits, operational deposits, relationship types of deposits and less so institutional deposits from people who are probably more inclined to immediately shipped out as Fed does whatever they\u2019re going to do to drain reserves in the system and to tighten monitory policy if that ever happen.","And as a result, we feel like we\u2019ve got a stickier deposit base. And all things being equal, if we were, it was a question of loosing deposits versus retaining them, we obviously have the ability to price our deposits to compete with whatever the alternative investment opportunity or savings opportunity is for our customers because we\u2019re sitting here with a full service capability and lots of levers in the relationships that we have.","So unlike some firms that probably have a higher percentage of institutional deposits that are seeking the last basis point of yield, I don\u2019t think, I think we compare favorably in terms of deposits stickiness.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities","Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful. I had a second question on the rate environment, assuming that we do start to see the Fed funds rate increase next year. How are you thinking about the potential for an environment where the Feds taking retire at the short end of the curve, but demand for treasuries remain strong at the long end since then we end up with the flatter curve. How are you guys positioned to perform in that kind of environment?","John Stumpf","That would actually be not that outcome at all because we would have less capital pressure on loan rates backing up on our bond portfolio and we\u2019d be benefiting as loans and other LIBOR linked assets re-price on at the short-end. So, at least with respect to those two drivers of accounting outcomes, those would be favorable.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities","Excellent. Thank you.","John Stumpf","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead.","Scott Siefers - Sandler O\u2019Neill","Good morning, guys.","John Stumpf","Hey, Scott.","Scott Siefers - Sandler O\u2019Neill","I was just hoping you could spend just a moment or two talking about the operating losses, just given the trajectory, they were up kind of substantially in the second quarter and then up another bit again; I mean I can imagine given some of the conversations we\u2019ve had on regulatory issues, so what might be driving that. But can you spend a second maybe discussing when or how or even why those might crest and then hopefully begin to ebb back down?","John Stumpf","Well, we\u2019ve mentioned that this month\u2019s elevated -- this quarter\u2019s elevated level reflects primarily litigation accruals and as a result, there is not much more specific color we can offer except to point you to our crystal clear disclosure in our Qs and K that describe everything that\u2019s probable and estimable and then sum. And it\u2019s like anything else; it\u2019s hard to know whether you\u2019re cresting or not until you\u2019re on the other side of it. So we feel this is a somewhat higher level than it\u2019s been recently and we think it\u2019s well disclosed.","Scott Siefers - Sandler O\u2019Neill","Okay. All right, sounds good. Thank you.","John Stumpf","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead. ","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks","Thank you. I wanted to talk about two different lines of questioning more long-term in nature. One is that as you\u2019re pulling your short-term assets higher by about $25 billion each quarter and you mentioned that in the terms of liquidity but is also adding about 2% to your asset sensitivity every quarter. So it just seems like you\u2019re looking at the level of opportunities that you have in deciding to forego the yields of today and a hope for better yields tomorrow increasing asset sensitivity. So John, I just want to get your feel for how you\u2019re kind of managing that decision you mentioned several times.","","John Stumpf","Well, it\u2019s a complex decision; it involves our asset and liability and a lot of discussion among management from time to time. And the items that you just mentioned tend to be a little bit backward looking because you don\u2019t know what a quarter\u2019s loan growth is until it\u2019s happened. Floating rate loan growth contributes to asset sensitivity.","The governing factors probably what our capital sensitivity is to a back up in rates if we deploy into duration instruments and out of cash equivalents. And getting that right is important, so that we don\u2019t find ourselves with higher rates that we\u2019ve all always been waiting for and a higher level of economic activity which would probably mean more non-interest income generation and more loan growth, a lot of exciting activity and at the same time be damaging our capital to the point that we couldn\u2019t take full advantage of it. And so that is one of those marginal drivers that probably caused us to be a little bit more in cash, a little bit more asset sensitive than -- versus being more fully invested today.","","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks","But at least looking back, funding sources of long term debt and sticky deposits growth with growth in short term liquid assets naturally I guess I just want to make sure we\u2019re both agreeing that that makes you more asset sensitive each quarter.","","John Shrewsberry","That makes us more asset-sensitive. That\u2019s right.","","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks","And then just real quickly, other line of thinking was John, how have you increased the growth in households and businesses? I mean moving that number up a 4 percentage point on the consumer side and 2, 4 percentage points on the business side long-term is a big driver. How do you see the source of those and is that sustainable at these higher levels?","John Stumpf","Well, it\u2019s hard to know whether it\u2019s sustainable because again that\u2019s forward-looking. The reason that it\u2019s happening is a result of the quality of our people, the quality of our products, the execution of our business model and just consistent application of the value proposition that we\u2019re bringing. And it\u2019s paying dividends like we thought that it would, hope that it would. If work goes in the future as a function of variety of inputs that are hard to know, but we like our competitive standing and so to the extent that we\u2019re growing faster than our large and regional bank competition, we\u2019re not surprised by and that\u2019s what we expect.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks","And would you see that in the traditional markets or more in you\u2019ve got the Wachovia markets and the franchise not pulled together. So you\u2019re really getting traction and being able to attract new customers now you got all that processed?","John Shrewsberry","I think they are all traditional markets now.","John Stumpf","Yes, exactly. We don\u2019t think\u2026","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks","Understand, I don\u2019t know if incrementally you\u2019re getting some new households in those newer let\u2019s say market?","John Stumpf","We\u2019re getting it in all of our markets.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks","Alright, thanks.","John Shrewsberry","They\u2019re all good to us.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks","I appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research, LLC. Please go ahead.","Nancy Bush - NAB Research, LLC","Good morning, guys. How are you?","John Stumpf","","Hi Nancy.","John Shrewsberry","Good morning.","Nancy Bush - NAB Research, LLC","This is sort of an overarching question John and John that goes to a lot of the stuff we\u2019re hearing not only on your call, but on the JP Morgan Chase call about these sort of continuing calls for increased capital all these other new requirements that are being put on the industry to which there is seemingly no end. And there is -- I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve read this in the press as well, this beginning characterization of the banking industry as the new electric utility. Are the regulators trying to enforce so much conformity on the industry that they are going to do away with the dynamism and the willingness of the banking industry? John could you just give us, either John, just give us some perspective on that and where you think that indeed is happening?","John Stumpf","Well, there is no question that they can stay. The regulatory, the global regulatory community keeps apparently keeps adding on to both capital and liquidity requirements that are going to have the combined effect of changing business models, increasing operating costs or financing costs and then applying that to an increased denominator of equity in the ROE calculation. To an industry that broadly speaking other than Wells Fargo and perhaps some regional banks has not been over achieving in returns over the last couple of years.","So, if you roll the tape forward, I assume that that gets mathematically worse before it gets betters unless a higher rate environment, a higher growth environment a real optimization on the part of the most impact banks in terms of changing their business model allows them to perform at a higher level. So, I think it is, it\u2019s a consequence of what you\u2019re describing, it is happening and we can\u2019t talk or anybody else is going to deal with it. But we\u2019ve, as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re proud to have to continue to generate a top of the peer group type of returns in spite of the amount of capital that we\u2019re carrying and the ample liquidity that we\u2019re carrying too.","John Shrewsberry","Nancy it\u2019s an interesting question and there is no question that there has been increases, some of them are settled and different issues be combining constraints and different ways. Of our business, 97% of our revenues come from the U.S. We love our international business, but we\u2019re dominant -- our dominant part of our business is here that makes it a bit easier for us and the challenge and I think the opportunity for leadership is to make sure that we do both we meet or exceed the requirements on the capital liquidity and those side and also we continue to invest in things that attract team members to us, attract customers to us, be dynamic in the marketplace differentiating. And we\u2019re so embedded in the real economy that the things we\u2019re doing continue to allow us to grow that business. So, we can never predict the future, but that\u2019s a challenge for us as leaders to do both.","Nancy Bush - NAB Research, LLC","John, do you see yourself, John Stumpf, do you see yourself as having to change your plans for growth either businesses that you would like to be in? Do you see that you might have to divest any of your present businesses? Should this sort of regulatory minds that continue and intensify?","John Stumpf","At this point in time the answer is no, because again virtually everything we do here starts with a customer. And we look at relationship value and pricing and different businesses have different returns and so forth. And we\u2019re always thinking about adjusting like few -- last quarter we sold smaller insurance offices, doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t like interest business, we just -- but there is always things that are going on. But there is nothing in anything I see today that would say I can\u2019t be in this business or we can\u2019t be in that business; it relates to customers.","","Nancy Bush - NAB Research, LLC","Okay, all right. Thank you.","","John Stumpf","Thank you.","","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Kevin Barker with Compass Point. Please go ahead.","","Kevin Barker - Compass Point","Good morning.","","John Stumpf","Good morning. ","","Kevin Barker - Compass Point","I noticed that you had quite a bit of increasing construction loans quarter-over-quarter and they\u2019re basically staying flat for several years. Is there something in particular that\u2019s causing the development and expansion of construction loans or is that something that you\u2019re looking at like an initiative going forward?","","John Stumpf","We\u2019re the largest commercial real estate lender in the country. And as I\u2019ve said in some place recently, you fly around; go in any city looks like a crane convention going on. I mean there is a lot of commercial activity going on and we serve that community and that sector of the economy. There is also housing is better than it has been in the past. So I think it reflects more the natural activity happening in the marketplace as opposed to us changing our strategy somehow.","","Kevin Barker - Compass Point","Alright. And then in regards to student loan business, are you still planning on selling the thought portfolio by year end or can you talk about the overall investor appetite for these loans? And then separately on the private side, I know this is a peak lending quarter for student loans but could you provide any color around the demand trend from students given the overall level of student out there?","John Stumpf","Well, with respect to the first part of your question, we still do intend to sell those loans, can\u2019t really comment on the specific to sales moving forward, progressing as expected. And what I can tell you is like any other fixed income asset category in this highly liquid environment there is plenty of interest. But in terms of whether it happens in the fourth quarter or later, I don\u2019t want to be too specific.","We remain very committed to private student lending and of course our student lending team now will be even more focused on our private business once we\u2019ve sold the self loans. And with respect to whether demand after accounting for seasonality as you mentioned has changed or not changed. We are in a point in time when a very high number of people are already student borrowers and but it\u2019s still one of the three or four most important things that are customers do, they buy a home, they buy a car, they finance their education and they save for retirement and we expect that to continue.","Kevin Barker - Compass Point","Okay. Thank you for taking my questions.","John Stumpf","Okay. I think we\u2019re done with the call now. I want to first of all thank all of you for jointing us and thank our 265,000 team members across our company for an outstanding quarter. If you look at the drivers of long-term growth, loans, deposits, the capital, the liquidity we have, the household growth, it sure makes us optimistic about the future. We operate within our ROA, ROE and efficiency ratio targets that we had provided a couple of years ago. And we\u2019re really proud that we return more capital to you our owners.

I'm pleased to be with you and I look forward to your questions and today's dialogue.","This morning, I'll outline the actions I'm taking together with our leadership team to continue to transform Wells Fargo and to get that transformation right for all our stakeholders, including our customers, our team members, our shareholders and our regulators. Since assuming my new role, I've been focused on leading our Company forward by emphasizing my top priorities, serving our customers and supporting our Wells Fargo team members, meeting and exceeding the expectations of our regulators and continuing the important transformation of the Company.","Today, we're honored to serve one out of every three U.S. households, but we know that some of our past practices harmed our customers. The team and I are committed to addressing these mistakes of the past, and over the coming weeks and months I plan to spend much of my time listening to our customers and working to understand how we can best serve them.","Our goal with respect to our customers is to develop even deeper relationships that are built on trust, accessibility and outstanding service. As part of reaching that goal, we will continue, wherever appropriate, to contact customers we have let down and compensate them for any harm. To this end, over a year ago, we created a customer remediation center of excellence, so that we could provide more consistent, timely and effective remediation to our customers. This team, which sits outside our lines of business, establishes our Companywide remediation policies, sets standards and coordinates with our lines of business in the day-to-day management of remediation efforts and provides our Board of Directors, our regulators and our senior management with comprehensive information about all customer remediation efforts that we are taking place at Wells Fargo.","And as you're aware, we have been providing updates on our remediation progress in our quarterly filings. We've also been dedicated to providing customer focused innovation. A few examples include overdraft rewind, real-time balance alerts, control tower and our online mortgage application. We remain focused on innovating for our customers, and these efforts will continue to be a top transformation priority.","The changes we\u2019re making to better serve customers are possible only because of the hard work of our over 260,000 talented and dedicated team members. Since assuming my new role, I've had the opportunity to meet with and hear from many of my Wells Fargo colleagues around the country and across our businesses. And I'm impressed every day by their commitment and their enthusiasm regarding the opportunities ahead. We continue to strengthen Wells Fargo's leadership team with both internal promotions and external hires, including our Head of Technology, Saul Van Beurden who joined Wells Fargo earlier this week as a member of our operating committee. Our new Chief Auditor, Julie Scammahorn joins us later this month as a member of the operating committee. And we've also strengthened our senior most enterprise risk and control committee, which is co-chaired by our Chief Risk Officer, Mandy Norton and me, and includes the heads of every business and enterprise function.","In addition to hiring Mandy last year, we\u2019ve strengthened our risk leadership team with both internal and external talent, and we continue to be successful in hiring externally for key roles during the first quarter. Our corporate risk management team grew by approximately 1,300 team members last year and we currently expect to add another 1,300 team members this year with the overwhelming majority of these new hires dedicated to strengthening our compliance and operational risk management efforts. In addition to these ongoing leadership changes, we're also realigning our business structure and making significant investments in key capabilities that taken together will help ensure that we meet the expectations of our regulators.","Let me give you just a few examples. First, we\u2019ve discarded our old decentralized corporate structure and centralized our enterprise control functions. As we have already seen, this important change will enhance our visibility to all aspects of our business and improve the consistency and sustainability of our results.","Second, we're transforming our approach to risk management, and we will dedicate all necessary resources to getting these risk management enhancements right. Wells Fargo has always excelled at management of credit and market risk, and our goal is to bring our operational risk and compliance capabilities to that same level of excellence.","Third, we're emphasizing operational excellence throughout the Company. And as part of that process, we've named a dedicated leader who is responsible for driving companywide business process management. We are building dedicated teams across each business group and enterprise function, and those teams will enable us to better deliver consistent, desired outcomes for our customers and manage our operations more efficiently and effectively, all while strengthening operational risk management.","Finally, we are transforming our technology platform with the goal of enhancing the customer experience by becoming more centralized, consistent and efficient, and how we deliver technology products and solutions.","While we're aggressively addressing our risk and control issues and building a better bank, I want to acknowledge clearly that we have a substantial amount of work yet to do, both to satisfy the expectations of our regulators and even more important, to create the financial institution we aspire to be.","Recent public statements on the part of our regulators have indicated their disappointment with our progress to date. We understand and appreciate their criticism, and we are now redoubling our efforts to satisfy their expectations of us, and our expectations of ourselves. We are focused on not only satisfying but also exceeding the expectation of all our regulators. I take this responsibility very seriously. And the operating committee and I have made clear that the entire Wells Fargo team must act assertively and decisively to meet our regulators\u2019 expectations as we go forward.","Specifically, we agree with Chairman Powell's recent public comments that we have more work to do under the February 2018 Federal Reserve consent order. That necessary work is at varying stages of progress, and much of the work consists of completing and implementing efforts that are substantially underway. But regardless of the status of the progress of any particular part of the necessary work, I want to make clear that the most important thing for our Company is that and our ongoing constructive engagement with the Federal Reserve. We focus on getting that work done in a first rate and sustainable way and not focus on duly on when we believe that process will be completed. Accordingly, we do not feel it's appropriate to provide guidance as to the timing of the lifting of the asset cap.","We understand the seriousness of getting our work with the Federal Reserve right, and we are therefore making and will be willing to make the investments that are necessary to complete the work that's needed to improve our compliance and operational risk capabilities. This work is fundamentally an evolution of our business model, and this evolution will both change how we manage compliance and operational risk, and by simplifying and strengthening our business processes help us serve our customers better and become more efficient, all of which will benefit our shareholders over the long term.","As you know, we\u2019re currently operating well below the asset cap, and we have had and will continue to have the ability to serve the needs of all our 700 million customers -- excuse me, 70 million customers, while we work to satisfy the requirements of the Federal Reserve consent order.","While we've been working to fulfill the commitments to our regulators, we've also continued to deliver strong financial performance, as our first quarter results demonstrate. We remained focused on reducing expenses, even as we make significant and necessary investments to meet our regulators\u2019 expectations and to help ensure that we deliver best-in-class services to our customers. We remain committed to our 2019 expense target. We continue to pursue business simplification, so we can focus our efforts on businesses where we believe we have leadership position that's required to excel long term.","This week's announced sale of our institutional retirement and trust business advances that goal. We also remain committed to returning our excess capital to our shareholders. And this quarter, we returned $6 billion to our shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases. I've met with the leaders of all our businesses over the past few weeks. And as we go forward, I will continue to work closely with them as part of the focus and my top priorities for the Company.","Bringing this all together, I'm firmly committed to doing what's right for our stakeholders. While there's a lot of work that still needs to be done, I believe the actions I've outlined this morning are the right steps to be taken by and for our Company at this time. The work we're doing in conjunction with our regulators to improve operational effectiveness will make Wells Fargo a more simple and nimble company while at the same time bringing us closer to our customers, which is the real reason we're here. This in turn fits well with our objective of becoming more efficient. I take very seriously my responsibility as a steward of our shareholders\u2019 capital, and I'm confident that these actions will create day by day a better company that will drive shareholder value over the long-term.","Simply put, we are engaged in a transformative effort with the goal of building the most customer-focused, efficient and innovative Wells Fargo ever, a premier financial institution characterized by a strong financial foundation, a leading presence in our chosen markets, focused growth within a responsible risk management framework, operational excellence and highly engaged team members. I have no doubt that we will achieve that goal. I'm confident and optimistic about the opportunities ahead to build something extraordinary, and I look forward to communicating with you regularly on our progress.","John Shrewsberry will now discuss our financial results in more detail.","John Shrewsberry","Thank you, Allen, and good morning, everyone.","We share some of the highlights of our first quarter results on page two, including earning $5.9 billion or a $1.20 per diluted common share, and an ROE of 12.71% and an ROTCE of 15.16%. As Allen mentioned, we returned $6 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases, up from $4 billion a year ago, and we increased our quarterly common stock dividend to $0.45 per share. We also had positive business momentum in many areas, including both customer loyalty and overall satisfaction with most recent visit branch survey scores reaching their highest levels in three years in March. Period-end loans grew from a year ago with C&I loans increasing 4% and credit card loans up 6%. Primary consumer checking customers increased 1.1% from a year ago. The sale of 52 branches that closed in the fourth quarter reduced this growth rate by 0.5 percentage point. Card usage increased with debit card purchase volume up 6% and consumer general purpose credit card purchase volume up 5% from a year ago. And high-quality nonconforming mortgage loan originations increased 35%, auto originations increased 24% and small business originations increased 6% compared with the year ago.","On page three, we highlight noteworthy items in the first quarter. Our earnings of $5.9 billion included $778 million of seasonally higher personnel expense. And while it didn\u2019t affect our earnings, deferred compensation, which is impacted by equity market pricing, which of course recovered in the first quarter, increased fee income by $345 million and increased expenses by $357 million in the first quarter. As you may recall, deferred comp results in the fourth quarter reduced fee income by $452 million, and reduced expenses by $429 million. So, the linked quarter change was over $780 million as equity markets recovered. We added a table to our appendix to help you better track how deferred comp can cause volatility and our revenue and expenses, even though it's P&L neutral.","We also had a $608 million gain on the sale of $1.6 billion of Pick-a-Pay PCI mortgage loans. We had a $150 million reserve build, primarily due to a higher probability of less favorable economic conditions. We had a $148 million gain from the sale of our business payroll services and our effective income tax rate was 13.1%, which included $297 million of net discrete income tax benefit in the quarter.","We highlight year-over-year results on page four. Compared with the first quarter of \u201818, revenue declined 1%, primarily driven by lower trust and investment fees, and mortgage banking fees, partially offset by 1% growth in net interest income. The decline in expenses was driven by lower operating losses, as well as a decline in a number of other expense categories which I\u2019ll highlight later on the call. While our net charge-off rate improved from a year-ago, our provision expense increased due to a $150 million reserve build in the first quarter of 2019, compared with $550 million reserve release a year-ago. And our capital levels remain strong, while we reduced common shares outstanding by 7%.","I'll be highlighting the balance sheet drivers on page five throughout the call. So, let me just mention here that we adopted the new lease accounting standard in the first quarter, which had no meaningful impact on our P&L, but requires operating leases to be recognized now on the balance sheet as the right of use asset, increasing our other assets by $4.9 billion.","Page six, revenue grew 3% from the fourth quarter as lower net interest income was more than offset by growth in non-interest income, and I'll highlight the fee income drivers later on the call. As I mentioned earlier, our effective income tax rate in the first quarter was 13.1%, and we currently expect the effective income tax rate for the remainder of 2019 to be approximately 18%, excluding the impact of any unanticipated discrete items.","Average loans increased $3.8 billion from the fourth quarter, the second consecutive linked quarter increase with growth in the commercial portfolio, partially offset by continued declines in the consumer portfolio. Period-end loans increased $941 million from a year-ago, with growth in high-quality non-conforming first mortgage loans, C&I loans and credit card loans, largely offset by $6.6 billion of Pick-a-Pay PCI mortgage and reliable consumer auto loan sales since the second quarter of 2018.","I'll highlight the driver of the linked quarter decline in period-end loans starting on page eight. Commercial loans declined $1.2 billion from the fourth quarter, driven by C&I loans. Recall that we had strong C&I loan growth in the fourth quarter, which included the benefits from the capital markets disruption, and as expected some of those loans paid down when capital markets rebounded. This market improvement drove a $4 billion decline in asset backed finance. At the same time, we had strong growth in commercial capital, reflecting seasonal strength in commercial distribution finance as well as capital finance; that growth driven by customers origination activity and working capital needs. Our credit investment portfolio also increased as we purchased CLOs in loan form rather than in debt securities, which doesn't change the risk profile of the asset. Commercial real estate loans increased $460 million from the fourth quarter, the first linked quarter increase since the first quarter of 2017. Our growth in the first quarter reflected our continued credit discipline and high-quality loan originations as well as less runoff of previously purchased loan portfolios.","As we show on page nine, consumer loans declined $3.7 billion from the fourth quarter. The first mortgage portfolio declined $520 million from the fourth quarter, driven by the sale of $1.6 billion of Pick-a-Pay PCI mortgage loans. We had $3.1 billion of Pick-a-Pay PCI mortgage loans remaining at quarter-end. Partially offsetting this decline was $4.2 billion of high-quality nonconforming loan growth, which excludes another $776 million that were designated as held for sale in anticipation of future securitizations. Junior lien mortgage loans were down $1.3 billion from the fourth quarter as originations were more than offset by pay-downs, primarily from loans originated prior to 2009. Credit card loans declined $746 million from the fourth quarter, driven by expected seasonality.","Auto loan balances were down $156 million from the fourth quarter; this was the smallest linked quarter decline since the portfolio started to shrink in the fourth quarter of 2016. We had $5.4 billion of auto originations in the first quarter, the highest since the first quarter of 2017. We increased our auto origination market share with high-quality originations, and we currently expect our auto loan -- our auto portfolio balances to grow by midyear and as early as the second quarter.","Other revolving credit and installment loans declined $961 million from the fourth quarter on lower margin loans and other securities based lending, reflecting higher short-term rates as well as market volatility. Personal loans and lines and student loans also declined.","Turning to deposits on page 10. Average deposits declined $35.1 billion from a year ago, reflecting both lower wholesale banking deposits including actions taken in the first half of last year to manage to the asset cap, and lower wealth and investment management deposits as customers allocated more cash to higher-yielding liquid alternatives. Average deposits declined $6.8 billion from the fourth quarter as lower wholesale banking deposits, driven by seasonality, were partially offset by higher consumer and small business banking deposits. On average, deposit costs increased 10 basis points from the fourth quarter and 31 basis points from a year-ago, driven primarily by increases in wholesale and WIM deposit rates.","On page 11, we've updated the deposit beta slide we included last quarter. The cumulative one-year beta has increased to 43%, up from 38% last quarter, reflecting continued pricing competition across major deposit categories. The cumulative beta since the start of the cycle was 35% as of the end of the first quarter. Recall, we provided at our investor day an estimate of through-the-cycle beta of 45% to 55% for our mix of deposits. Our ultimate through-the-cycle beta will depend on a number of factors including industry asset growth trends, which will in turn influence the supply and demand dynamics for deposits.","On page 12, we provide details on period-end deposits, which decreased $22.2 billion from the fourth quarter. Wholesale banking deposits were down $37 billion from the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting seasonality from typically higher fourth quarter levels. Consumer and small business banking deposits increased $9.4 billion from higher retail banking deposits reflecting seasonality, as well as growth in CDs and high-yield savings. Wealth and investment management deposits decreased partly by our client shifting cash back into investments during the quarter. As you may recall in the fourth quarter, the market volatility resulted in our client shifting into cash. In addition, our WIM customers continued reallocating cash in the higher higher-yielding liquid alternatives.","Net interest income decreased $333 million from the fourth quarter, primarily driven by two fewer days in the quarter, which reduced net interest income by approximately a $160 million, the balance sheet mix and repricing and including the impact of a flattening yield curve. Earlier this year, we said, we expect net interest income growth for the full-year 2019 to be in the range of minus 2% to plus 2%. Several factors have driven shifts in our view, including a lower absolute rate outlook, a flatter curve, tightening loan spreads resulting from a competitive market with ample liquidity and continued upward pressure on deposit pricing. We now expect NII will decline 2% to 5% this year compared with 2018.","Noninterest income increased $962 million from the fourth quarter, driven by higher market sensitive revenue and mortgage banking fees. The $1.3 billion increase in market sensitive revenue was driven by higher gains from equity securities, which included $797 million of higher deferred comp gains. Net gains from trading activities rebounded from a weaker fourth quarter, increasing $347 million, driven primarily by strength in credit and asset-backed products.","Mortgage banking revenue increased $241 million from the fourth quarter from higher servicing income due to negative valuation adjustments to MSRs in the fourth quarter. Mortgage originations decline $5 billion from the fourth quarter, primarily due to expected seasonality, while the production margin increased to 105 basis points, primarily due to improvement in secondary market conditions. We currently expect the production margin in the second quarter to remain in a similar range to what we've had for the past two quarters. Applications in the first quarter increased $16 billion from the fourth quarter from stronger purchase and refi activity. And we ended the quarter with a $32 billion unclosed pipeline, the highest pipeline since the second quarter of 2017, and up 78% from the fourth quarter.","As you would assume with the recent decline in mortgage interest rates, a significantly higher percentage of our customers could benefit from a refinance. We expect to see higher origination volume in the second quarter due to typical seasonality for home buying as well as some additional refinance activity resulting from the recent decrease and mortgage interest rates.","Trust and investment fees declined $147 million from the fourth quarter, primarily due to lower asset-based fees on retail brokerage advisory assets, reflecting lower market valuations on December 31st, which is when these assets were priced for first quarter revenue purposes.","Turning to expenses on page 15. Expenses increased 4% from the fourth quarter and declined 7% from a year ago.","Let me explain the drivers starting on page 16. Expenses increased $577 million from the fourth quarter, driven by higher compensation and benefits expense. This increase included $785 million of higher deferred comp expense, which is offset in revenue and $778 million of seasonally higher personnel expenses, in line with the seasonal increase last year. These seasonally higher personnel expenses should decline in the second quarter, but salary expense is expected to grow, reflecting increases which became effective late in the first quarter as well as an additional payroll day in the second quarter.","Revenue-related expenses declined $241 million from lower commission and incentive comp expense mainly in WIM and community banking, as well as lower operating lease expense. Third-party services declined $219 million from lower outside professional services and contract services expense. Running the business nondiscretionary expense declined $580 million, primarily from lower core deposit and other intangibles as the 10-year amortization period on the Wachovia-related intangibles ended, and also from lower operating losses. Finally, running the business discretionary expense declined on lower travel and entertainment expense, and lower advertising and promotion expense, which were typically higher in the fourth quarter.","As we show on page 17, expenses were down $1.1 billion from a year ago, driven by $1.2 billion of lower operating losses. Expenses also declined from lower core deposit and other intangibles and lower FDIC expense. These declines were partially offset by higher compensation and benefits expense, primarily driven by $353 million of higher deferred comp expense. We're committed to and on track to meet our 2019 expense target of $52 billion to $53 billion, which excludes annual operating losses in excess of $600 million such as litigation and remediation accruals and penalties.","As I highlighted on our call a couple of weeks ago, our strategic and financial targets beyond 2019 will be established once we have a permanent CEO in place. That being said, we're just as committed to our cost saving initiatives. And as you'll see, we found even more opportunity than previously anticipated. However, we also have the need to spend more in areas Allen described in his remarks.","While our 2019 expense target hasn't changed, as we show on page 19, the investments we're making in our business have increased from the expectations we had at our 2018 investor day. In May of 2018, we expected our high-priority enterprise investment spend to increase for full year 2018 and to decline starting in 2019. However, nothing is more important than meeting our regulatory obligations; and we've increased spending to improve operational and compliance risk management as well as for other high-priority projects. As a result, our actual and anticipated investment spend for 2018 through 2019 has increased by $1.4 billion from our expectations at our 2018 investor day.","As we show on page 20, while our expected investments in 2019 have increased, our expected savings are also exceeding our original expectations, which is why our 2019 expense target hasn't changed. We're tracking over 200 specific initiatives on a monthly basis, which drives accountability. The major categories of savings are from centralization and optimization, including staff function rationalization and advancing our contact center of the future, running the business, which includes streamlining our mortgage operations and restructuring our wholesale banking business as examples and governance and controls overspending, which is expected to further reduce third-party services spend and includes a consistent approach to manage our spans of control and hiring location guidelines for noncustomer facing team members.","Turning to our business segments, starting on page 21. Community banking earnings decreased $346 million from the fourth quarter, driven by seasonally higher personnel expense.","On page 22, we provide updated community banking metrics. We had 29.8 million digital active customers in the first quarter, up 3% from a year-ago, including 7% growth in mobile active customers, and in the first quarter, our mobile banking top box customer satisfaction score was at an all time high.","Primary consumer checking customers have grown year-over-year for six consecutive quarters. Digital continued to generate strong checking account growth with new checking customers acquired through the digital channel up more than 50% from a year-ago. And I already highlighted our strong branch survey scores, which reached three-year highs in March.","On page 23, we highlight the continued decline in teller and ATM transactions down 9% from year-ago, reflecting continued customer migration to digital channels. We completed 40 branch consolidations in the first quarter, as we continue to evolve how we serve our customers based on their preferences. For the first time, we are providing the number of consumer and small business digital payment transactions, which increased 6% from a year-ago, reflecting continued increases in usage and digital adoption.","Turning to page 24, wholesale banking earnings increased $99 million from the fourth quarter, driven by higher market sensitive revenue and lower non-interest expense. Wealth and investment management earnings declined $112 million from the fourth quarter, driven by lower asset-based fees, reflecting the lower 12\/31 market valuations, which was when retail brokerage advisory assets were priced. In the second quarter, these asset-based fees will reflect the higher March 31st market valuations. WIM earnings also reflected seasonally higher personnel expense.","As Allen highlighted, earlier this week, we announced an agreement to sell our institutional retirement and trust business, which reflects our strategy by focusing our resources on areas where we believe we can grow and maximize our opportunities within wealth brokerage and asset management. The financial details related to this transaction, as well as the associated gain will be disclosed after the transaction closes, which is expected to occur in the third quarter.","Turning to page 26. We continued to have strong credit results with a net charge-off rate of 30 basis points in the first quarter and net charge-offs down $26 million from the fourth quarter, driven by seasonally lower auto and other revolving credit and installment loan losses. Non-accrual loans increased $409 million from the fourth quarter, as a decline in consumer non-accruals was more than offset by a $609 million increase in commercial non-accrual loans, driven in part by a borrower in the utility sector, as well as increases in oil and gas.","As I highlighted earlier, we had a $150 million reserve build. And while this was our first reserve build since the second quarter of 2016, it's important to remember that our net charge-offs remained at historically low levels. We've been asked a lot about the impact of CECL. So, let me give you our current expectation. Using our loan portfolio composition at March 31, we estimate that the impact of the adoption of CECL will be in the range of zero to $1 billion reduction in reserves, which reflects the expected decrease for commercial loans, given their short contractual maturities and the current economic environment, partially offset by an expected increase for longer duration consumer loans.","As a reminder, we have a smaller credit card portfolio than our large bank peers, which reduces the impact of CECL adoption -- the impact that will have on our consumer loans. In addition, our reserves may be further reduced by as much as $1.5 billion of recoveries related to pending FASB guidance to consider increases in collateral value on previously written down residential mortgage loans. These loans were written down significantly below current recovery value during the last credit cycle. Under current rules, increases in collateral value are only recognized when selected. The ultimate effect of CECL will depend on the size and composition of our loan portfolio, the portfolio's credit quality and economic conditions at the time of adoption as well as any refinements to our models, methodology, or other key assumptions.","Perhaps more importantly, as the credit cycle turns, there will be more volatility in the periodic remeasurement under a lifetime loss estimation approach. Also of note, the expected reserve reduction due to the adoption of CECL will increase our capital levels.","Turning to page 27. Our CET1 ratio fully phased in, increased 20 basis points from the fourth quarter as continued strong returns of capital even with seasonally higher share issuance in the first quarter were more than offset by capital generation from earnings, improved cumulative OCI and lower risk-weighted assets. Returning excess capital to shareholders remains a priority. We're well above the CET1 on regulatory minimum of 9% in our current internal target of 10%.","We submitted our capital plan last week. And similar to prior years, we assessed our current and projected levels of excess capital as one of the many key considerations in the evaluation of future capital distributions. So, in summary, our first quarter results continue to reflect strong customer activity and some underlying positive business momentum, and we're on track to achieve our 2019 expense target. We also understand the seriousness of the work that needs to be done, not only to meet but to exceed the expectations of our regulators, which is one of our top priorities.","And we'll now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Good morning. I wonder if you could just flush out a little more your updated NII outlook, which I think you gave us a litany of things that we're all observing. Can you try to parse out for us, is there I guess one or the other that's a bigger delta to your initial expectations? And how do you also expect NII to traject throughout the year I guess would be another one to add on to that. Thanks.","John Shrewsberry","Thank you. So, I would -- the things that I mentioned in terms of shape of the curve, absolute low level of rates, I'd put at the front end of the explanation. What\u2019s going on in deposit prices -- or deposit costs is something that we're observing as betas catch up or attempt to catch up to historic norms. And then, this spread compression, which reflects not just competition for loans, but also the mix of loans on our balance sheet. As we\u2019ve sold some of these higher-yielding Pick-a-Pay loans for example, those have disproportionally higher spread. And when we consider on a quarter by quarter basis whether market conditions are right, we want to do that that will have an additional impact as well. And we've talked about this before. I don't really hear this much from other banks, but this reinvestment out the curve of excess cash and prepayments or repayments of our existing AFS portfolio is something that means a lot to us. And when the curve is as flat as it is and yields are as low as they are, that becomes a big driver at the margin as well. Most people think of interest rate sensitivity more on the LIBOR and what happens to floating rate loans. But for us, that reinvestment out the curve is a big piece too. So, all of those things relative to a quarter ago feel a little bit softer. And that's the combination.","Ken Usdin","Okay. And then, I\u2019ll just repeat my second part, which was from here, so can you just talk about the NIM versus the NII and just how you expect that to traject from here, given obviously that is now challenge on a year-over-year basis?","John Shrewsberry","Well, I think all of those things will play out relatively ratably. I'd say that what happens to deposit pricing is probably a little bit more. As I said before, we've tended to outperform historic expectations. And if deposit prices continue to lag and catch up to the historic beta, maybe things are a little bit stronger until later in the year, if that that catch-up takes until later in the year. That's one area where I can imagine a little bit of it not being ratable.","Ken Usdin","Is that a mix thing for you guys on what within deposits is still moving, retail versus wholesale? I'll stop there. Thanks.","John Shrewsberry","Yes, in part, I think because a lot our recent retail deposit gathering has been higher costs than historically. As we\u2019ve tried whether it's through promotional high-yield CDs or other offers market-by-market. And so, that is a little bit higher cost than it has been previously. One other thing I'd point out just in terms of you mentioned seasonality, this day count issue quarter-by-quarter obviously will have an impact. The cost is about $150 million or $160 million in the first quarter that will be added back in the second quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Allen, maybe I could ask you to give us a sense of the type of person that Wells Fargo is looking for as a permanent CEO. And I know that maybe you just got started on that. But, it would be helpful to understand in the context of a couple of questions. One is, how do you think about the priority of having either a female, a person of color, minority taking the lead? And then, the other question has to do with track record of this individual managing either a bank or a financial, somebody with the balance sheet. I would like to understand how the organization is thinking through those two things in the context of the question.","Allen Parker","Betsy, thanks very much. As you all know as well as anyone, choosing a company's leader is the most important thing a board of directors does. And I know that our Board is approaching that task with care and seriousness as they do all things. Although I'm available to the Board for any necessary consultation or any other way they need me in connection with the process, I'm not involved in the search process. So, unfortunately, I don't have any insight into the criteria that they're applying to their work or the timetable that they are thinking about in terms of completing that work. I do know that the Board's search committee has met and that they\u2019ve chosen an outside search firm to help them with their work. But, as a general matter, my understanding is that the Board's work is in its relatively early stages. And knowing the Board as well as I do, I have no doubt that they are focusing on all the questions that you've just asked. It's just not clear to me that anything in terms of their articulation of the criteria they're applying will ever be something that goes outside the Board room.","The most important thing, though, I think from my perspective is for everybody to understand that while the search is underway, the Company is going to continue to move forward assertively and decisively on the priorities that John and I have discussed this morning. Betsy, I wish I could be more helpful but I just don\u2019t have any further insight.","Betsy Graseck","Got it. I just would share that it strikes several investors who we\u2019ve spoken with as a little bit odd to be thinking about someone who is from outside of the banking system, given the credit risk and rate risk that financial institutions banks have that\u2019s unique to them. So, I would just share that. And then, I guess, secondly for both of you. We heard from others today about how tough it is to be running a mortgage business in the context of tough rules and regs on the mortgage industry for banks. And there is some players out there that have taken significant share that are benefiting from the regulatory arbitrage that exist for folks that are not banks that benefits their standing. So, I just wanted to understand how you're thinking about the mortgage business that you run and how you deal with that, especially on the sourcing component.","Allen Parker","Betsy, I\u2019ll let John speak to the mortgage aspect of your question. I will just say by way of comment that obviously our Board Chair, Betsy Duke has a tremendous amount of experience with regard to all the issues that are associated with managing, leading a financial institution, and she is involved day to day in conversation with our investors. And I know that they are going to formulate a really precise and appropriate set of criteria in that search. ","John Shrewsberry","And Betsy, with respect to your point about the mortgage business, and as you described the regulatory arbitrage, I would say that we\u2019re -- mortgage lending is core to Wells Fargo, it's very important to our customers. We\u2019re an enormous originator and servicer. We've changed the business over the last couple of years to take some of the extra contractual risks out of the origination and the servicing side of things and to try and make it as tolerable as possible in the complex environment that we're operating in. But, it\u2019s not clear to me that on the servicing that the rules are very different. I do think that when you\u2019re a G-SIB and you have lots of resources that the expectations are appropriately high, we're trying to live up to that. I do think that our non-bank competition has done a good job setting the bar for us in improving the customer experience and they\u2019re tough competitors. And we\u2019re certainly up for it. But, I think non-bank competitors, both on the origination and servicing side are here to stay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research. [Ph]","Unidentified Analyst","John, I wanted to follow up on Ken\u2019s question around NII. Maybe give a little bit of color on what scenario is it down 5 and what kind of things happened where it\u2019s down 2? And then, just a follow-up. It doesn\u2019t sound like loan growth changed in your outlook; that wasn\u2019t the driver from what I understood there. So, are you feeling better, worse or same on kind of loan growth relative to where you were a couple of months ago?","John Shrewsberry","Yes, I think we're on the loan growth front. And loan growth, given what we've been doing in running off pre-crises, noncore assets that will have an impact on our net loan growth. But, in terms of our new origination et cetera, that doesn't feel much different than it has over the last couple of months. The range of outcomes on the 2 to 5, if deposit pricing, if repricing continues to be slower than expected but it is on an upward trajectory, there\u2019s probably upside there, getting closer to 2 than 5. If the long end of the curve stays right where it is, probably -- that probably takes you into the lower end of the range. And then, loan spreads -- and loan spreads, which reflects mix as well in terms of what's going on in competition and the types of loans that we are originating, will have an impact on that as well. But we\u2019re sort of preparing you for the ideas that it could be down 5. I think if everything that I mentioned went against us, that's a reasonable outcome. But, those are the drivers.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then on CCAR, I understand you obviously can't talk details, but at a high level, as you put your capital plan together, do you factor in the regulators\u2019 disappointment in your progress or where you stand on operational excellence or is that just completely separate issues?","John Shrewsberry","Well, nothing separate. The way we approach CCAR is starting with the feedback that we get in the prior year and working all year to improve our approach, which includes our operational risk identification, control identification, our scenario designed to impact those types of things, the impact more broadly on what it means both for PPNR generation. And so, I think we fully accounted for that, and we\u2019ll see in June.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And no formal change to the CET1 target yet, do you still think that kind of an upside bias on that but modest?","John Shrewsberry","Yes. I think that's right. I think, we've mentioned before that it is 10% today knowing that how CECL gets integrated into CCAR -- into the severely adverse CCAR scenario, and then what the final rules are and application is to distress capital buffer. The combination of those things probably drives us up to 10.25 to 10.5 that sort of range but we -- until those things land, we are not going to set a new management target. But, those things are still out there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. ","Erika Najarian","So, my first question is -- it really has to do as what more you can do to deliver this Company more efficiently? We hear you loud and clear that until you have a new leader, you are not going to help us give us the sense of the expense trajectory, which is totally fair. But, as I think about the dynamics of capital return and opportunities to continue to restructure the firm, so as of year-end 2018, Wells Fargo had 2,595 more employees than JP Morgan, and your employee base declined just 3% since 2009 and you have peer banks in the United States that have 50,000 less employees than do for larger asset bases. And I'm wondering how is the Board thinking about the interplay of the fact that you have a ton of excess capital. You continue to build excess capital. Why shouldn\u2019t that be -- why shouldn\u2019t that now be an opportunity to restructure the firm in a more dramatic way than you've been telling us. I mean, in essence, with the new leadership coming in, the market is giving you sort of a pass or so to speak to really rethink a company beyond sort of taking 10% off of your headcount in three years?","John Shrewsberry","Yes. Erika, that\u2019s a fair observation. I think, the work that's happening right now, which is frankly the underpinning a lot of the regulatory related requirements around operational risk and compliance is business process by business process, end to end understanding of how everything gets done at Wells Fargo in a very encyclopedic way. That\u2019s work that\u2019s underway; there's still a ton to do, but that's the gist of the underpinning of all of this work. The outcome of that will put the Allen or the new CEO in the perfect position to make determinations about how we can continue to combine like work, how we can continue to streamline our operations, what we should be doing more of and what we should be doing less of. The headcount -- I mean headcount is a great thing to point to, to compare whether we're more or less efficient. And there are opportunities for efficiency as a result of, as I said, combining like activity where we have it disparate today. There are changes in how customers are using the bank. So, we've got, we just described 9% down year-over-year in branch and ATM transactions. Our call center activity comes down as people do more on an automated basis. There\u2019s lots of secular changes that will drive headcount down.","But in the short-term as we're adding in places like the control functions and the businesses, and Mandy's team broadly in the second line of defense for risk and compliance, those will definitely be -- those will push numbers up in the short term. We\u2019ve got some seasonal activity in the first quarter that happens in branches and elsewhere as there's more people on the payroll than there are later in the year. We've got cyclical businesses, like mortgage that dial up and dial down as the pipeline swells or abates. So, all of those things are working together, there is no question. We've had this discussion before that at the end of this process that for a company of our size relative to peers that you're mentioning, we have a lower risk mix of businesses. We've got our less complex, less global, et cetera mix of businesses and our expenses for total dollar of revenue for our asset base should be lower. That's definitely the goal.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And Allen, if you could give us a sense, clearly, there could be an air pocket in the stock until you have a new leader in place. Is there a timeframe that the search committee is aiming for? Obviously, your shareholders want you to find the right woman or man. But, is there a timeframe that you could help us in terms of whether the search committee is looking to go more urgently?","Allen Parker","Erika, I think that based on the conversations I have, the committee wants to move as urgently as they can. But, their biggest priority is making the right decision. And so, at this point, I am not really in a position to predict how long that that will be. But, I think they're going to prioritize quality decision-making over any sort of focus on speed.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And just one last follow-up question, John, on the revenues. I guess, I hate to ask NII question again. But, as we think about your peers that reported this morning, they're facing similar curve dynamics but they didn't quite pull their guidance for the full year yet. And as we think about the timing of when you put out that guidance, earlier guidance on NII at the Credit Suisse conference, obviously the yield curve flattened, but is your sensitivity to the long end that material that this magnitude of change is not just significant relative to your old guide but also significant relative to peers? And what in the liability dynamics, going back to John's earlier question, are you assuming particularly on deposit repricing more specifically?","John Shrewsberry","Yes. Good question. So, on the long end, I would say that we have got more conviction that we're going to be reinvesting at lower rates for more of the year than moving with through the big rally in connection with the disruption of the fourth quarter. Now, it feels like it\u2019s here to stay, sitting on the sidelines and waiting for higher yields is less of an option and so, we\u2019re beginning to redeploy here at these lower levels. So, that feels more locked in than it did during February, the Credit Suisse conference. And on the liability side, we are imagining even if we're done with moves up -- fed rate increases and moves up in the policy rates at the front end of the curve that there is some more catch-up this year to historic betas. And if that doesn't happen, as I mentioned to John, that\u2019s going to be upside or I should say, move us higher in the range of possible outcomes for this year.","Erika Najarian","Sorry. Just one more question on revenues if I may, and I apologies for interrupting. On the fee side, and I don\u2019t mean to be cheeky at all but excluding the idiosyncratic gains on Pick-a-Pay end and the payroll services company, John, what would you call core fees for the year -- sorry, for the quarter? I guess, I\u2019m just trying to figure out. So, I guess the frustration in investors is, I think that you've accepted that the expanse trajectory is very hard to target, given the management change. But if the revenue base keeps splitting down, I'm afraid that some of your loyal shareholders are going to start to exit before you have a new leadership in place. And helping us figure out what the sort of what the core fees are for the quarter, and what you expect for major line items would be really helpful.","John Shrewsberry","I appreciate that. So, we don\u2019t calculate something called core fees; it\u2019s non-GAAP for us to do that for ourselves. So, this is a tricky path to go down. I think mortgages are going to be stronger as we roll forward, if you're just thinking about the major line items. I think trust and investment fees will be stronger, as a result of the recovery in the market. There is a quarterly lag that\u2019s built into that. On deposit service charges, we had a couple of things happen in the first quarter that were aberrant. I think, the run rate is higher than what we posted. We had data center outage that caused us to reverse fees for people for a period of time. There was a little bit of a government shutdown that caused us to reverse some fees for others et cetera. So, those are recurring.","So, as I go line item by line item, each one of them has its own story. I guess, I\u2019d point to mortgage probably as this year rolls through and given where the pipeline sits and the fact that we're up a little bit higher in terms of gain on sale, and servicing frankly feels a little bit more stable compared to Q4. We had some valuation adjustments. But, it\u2019s very likely that we'll continue to -- we always had a collection, we\u2019ve often had a collection of different types of gains from things that happen naturally in the business and from strategic decisions like selling some of these pre-crisis loans. And so, they\u2019ll be there too throughout the course of the year depending on decisions that we make. Whether they are core or noncore, it\u2019s in the eye of the beholder. But, they contribute to capital generation and earnings in the quarters when they occur.","Allen Parker","Erika, if I could just circle back for a second on the search. Although the Board is going to be moving forward with appropriate urgency, they have made clear that they have complete confidence in the team that we currently have in place. And just to reemphasize, they have given us a mandate to move forward assertively. So, no one should have any doubt about that.","Erika Najarian","And does that mandate -- does that mandate include perhaps pulling forward some of the opportunity that John outlined earlier as an answer to my question in terms of potentially more severe restructuring than you had earlier envisioned?","Allen Parker","I think that you should understand that our current team is going to be thinking about all alternatives for the Company going forward and working very closely with the Board to think about what's best for the Company longer term.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matt O\u2019Connor","There is a lot of focus on the fundamentals here, but I want to kind of back up to what I think is the biggest issue for the Company. You said in the prepared remarks at the very beginning, you understand what the regulators are disappointed in and maybe you could shed some light what is it that they're disappointed in and what do you either doing differently now say versus six months ago or plan to do it differently to address these things?","Allen Parker","Well, let me start by saying something that's rarely said but I think it should be said, and that's the Prudential bank regulators play a really critical role in our system. They're there to ensure the safety and soundness of financial institutions like ours but they're also there to ensure the safety and security of the financial system more generally. We get their feedback constantly and we take it very seriously and we take it into account in terms of everything that we do. As you know, Matt, the recent public statements on the part of the regulators have indicated their disappointment with our progress to-date. The Fed, the OCC, the CFPB have all gone on public record in terms of saying that. We understand and accept their criticism. And as I said before, we are going to be redoubling our efforts to satisfy their expectations of us. I met with all the regulators in Washington earlier this week. And one of the things that I tried to convey to them was that we are going to try to bring to our relationship with them going forward a greater level of urgency and seriousness, understanding again that the single most important thing for us to do is to execute on our priorities and satisfy our commitments to them. And we're doing a lot of things to help us do that. We've hired a number of key leaders in new roles from outside the Company, and they've had a significant impact in terms of what we're doing. As I mentioned before, we\u2019re engaged in a thorough reshaping of our risk management framework, and that's going to fundamentally change how we manage risk within the Company.","And then, finally, we're really going to be focused intently on operational excellence in all we do. And a big part of that, as I mentioned before, is our work on business process management. I would emphasize, when you take all this as a whole, the basic answer to your question is that we are going to be working harder and smarter and we're going to be focused more on execution and we're going to do all that with an appropriate sense of urgency. We believe that we can complete all the work we need to do in a timely manner. But much more important, Matt, I believe that we can do this all to the highest standards of professionalism and long-term durability for the Company. We want to not only meet their expectations but also exceed them.","Matt O\u2019Connor","I guess, just a follow-up, like, I mean where is the disconnect, like, I would have thought a little over a year ago when the asset cap was implemented that that's when the communication would have been improved, that's when you have gotten to the same page. I mean, I don't know if it's just that the regulators don't appreciate how big, how granular, how diverse a company you are, so, how long it takes or if it's just been maybe bigger issues than you appreciated a year ago. I just think a lot of us don't understand when we look at Wells long term, you have a great track record from risk management perspective, again on all facets. And a lot of the people that execute on that strategy have been -- they're trying to kind of clean-up these issues. It\u2019s just so rare for a regulator to go public. So, again, I don't know if it's just that you\u2019re so big, you are so big granular that there's just so much to do and maybe they don't appreciate that, or was there something that you didn't appreciate as a company a little over a year ago?","Allen Parker","Yes. I mean, it's a good follow-up. I think, one of the most important things to understand is that what we're talking about, as I said earlier is essentially an evolution of our business model. We have in essence picked out with our regulators a point on the horizon in terms of creating a truly extraordinary company, not only in terms of business performance and operational excellence, but also risk management. Our engagement with the regulators -- and this goes for all of them and particular the OCC and the Fed, is an ongoing engagement. We get their feedback constantly and we therefore are called upon to respond to it constantly. And that sometimes means that we have to work hard to understand exactly what their expectations are for us.","I have really had an opportunity through my meetings earlier this week to understand exactly what their expectations are. And although our work is in various stages of progress, some of it is way down the road and is really pointed toward completion and implementation. Other parts of it are a little bit earlier in the process. I think, I have a very good handle on where we want to go with them and I think that they've been very clear with us. The single most important thing I think to note is that we have really done a good job of restructuring our balance sheet so as to be able to operate under the asset cap for over a year. And we are going to do whatever is necessary to ensure that we can continue to serve our customers for as long as the asset cap is in place.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Good morning, guys. Maybe you guys can touch, you talked a bit about the mortgage banking business and the competitors, the nonbank competitors are taking market share from everybody, not -- that's the way the business has been structured. And John, in the past, you've talked about your nonbank financial lending. I believe that portfolio\u2019s over $100 billion. How much of the mortgage warehouse lines are in that portfolio, assuming they are in that portfolio, and how are they growing?","John Shrewsberry","Yes. So, good question. I would say mortgage banker warehouse lines are a smaller portion of that total non-depository financial institution total. We'll get you the exact total. But, we do provide warehouse lines to people who deliver into Fannie and Freddie, just like we do also by correspondent loans into our own mortgage banking pool, which becomes part of our origination stats and part of our gain on sale. So, like a lot of these businesses, mortgage is one of them. The people with whom we compete who are outside of banking are customers of ours. We give them access to the capital markets. We finance them along the way. We understand the underlying loan. Sometimes, they're making loan where we are competing head to head, and sometimes they're making loans where we'd rather be in a credit-enhanced position on a pooled basis than be making the loans head to head. That's more of a commercial loan example. But, in the mortgage case in particular, we do provide warehouse lines and we do facilitate the sale of their conforming loans into agency execution.","Gerard Cassidy","I see. And what -- how would you categorize the largest component of that portfolio? What type of credits would you say are in that portfolio that constitute the majority or the biggest portion?","John Shrewsberry","Of the $100 billion or so...","Gerard Cassidy","Yes, correct.","John Shrewsberry","It's pretty balanced. There is the CLO business; there is CMBS; there is RMBS; there is card; there's other commercial assets, like leased assets et cetera where our customers are leasing companies. It's quite diverse. But, it's more corporate risk than mortgage risk.","Gerard Cassidy","Okay, good. And then, following up on your comments, if I heard it correctly that I think you said foot traffic in ATM transactions are down, I thought I heard 9% or at least they are down. Are those trends accelerating? And did Zelle have any impact on the trends, picking up in terms of the P2P payments that happened with Zelle and now that's in place, what, about a year and a half?","John Shrewsberry","No, I don't think so. I think Zelle is taking some cash out of the system, it's taking checks out of the system as well. So it hasn't been accelerating. It's been relatively linear and it's been this conversion to all forms of digital banking activity, not just P2P payments.","Gerard Cassidy","Great, I appreciate it. Yes. Go ahead. Go ahead, John.","John Shrewsberry","I was going to say, you can see the details on slide 23. That's all.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja.","Vivek Juneja","Hi. I just want to follow up on all the regulatory stuff that's been going on. The regulators\u2019 comments that things have been very slow. Given all the hiring you've been doing, it\u2019s a little bit surprising. I guess, Allen, a question for you. How much do you need to do the changing the culture? Because it seemed a tone of dismissiveness among senior management when this asset cap first came out, and is there still more you need to do on that? And as we parse through and try to understand where this quite surprising level of commentary from the regulators, which you rarely see a bank named of your size like this, is it coming more on the consumer side, the corporate side, can you give us more color as to where is more of this weakness?","Allen Parker","Yes. Vivek, thank you very much for your question. I think that it's appropriate to say that there was always a sufficient level of seriousness on the part of our senior management in terms of approaching the Fed consent order. We early on marshaled what we thought were the necessary resources to get everything done and in a manner of appropriate urgency and thoroughness. As time has gone on and there's been greater clarity about all the work that's been done and the expectations of the regulators, we've continued to focus on everything that needs to be done. I think, above all else, I would say to you that the effort that we're talking about, which is enhancing corporate governance protocols, establishing an even stronger risk management framework and achieving true operational excellence just takes a certain amount of time. And we're doing that methodically, but we're also doing it in conjunction with our regulators as they provide us with constant feedback. And the other thing that I will say is that when we're going forward with respect to the asset cap now, one of the things that we feel is critical to do is to get the input of our new Chief Technology Officer and our new Chief Auditor who are going to be -- one of whom, our Chief Technology Officer, has just arrived, and our Chief Auditor will arrive soon. We believe that their input, analysis, creativity will be a critical part of not only satisfying the requirements of the consent order but getting them done in a way that's appropriate for the Company that we want to be.","I would say that the feedback that we have heard is really not directed to any line of business. It's really our larger corporate functioning in terms of our control system and framework for risk management. And those are the things that we're going to continue to focus on. And as I said to you before, we are going to do all that work with what we believe is the appropriate level of urgency, but we are not going to prioritize urgency over getting it right. This is just simply too important for our Company going forward. It's work that's going on every day. I am confident that we get better every day and I am also confident that we'll get to the right conclusion.","John Shrewsberry","I\u2019ve got one follow-up, and it's also I think responsive to Matt's question earlier, but just playing back to last year or so and how this has evolved. There's is an initial level of high level, medium level and extraordinarily detailed planning that goes into an evolution like this, and then there's the initial hiring of the senior most change agents people with real experience to augment the folks that we have in the field doing the work. And as Allen mentioned, this covers the entirety of the Company. This isn't something that just happens in a group called risk, this happens in every line of business in every function dealing with every business process. So, you plan it at varying levels of granularity, senior hiring, next level hiring, and by hiring, it can be people who already work here moving into slightly different jobs, but it's articulation of what those jobs are, what real roles and responsibilities are to accomplish the goals. And then, you begin the execution phase. And the execution, again, it's business by business, function by function, process by process. And it's the identification of risk and associated controls for effectiveness. It's the testing of those controls and making sure that it works from end to end, and then, the development of the appropriate supporting technology, because a lot of these things initially can be done by brute force but are more appropriately and done at a higher quality level, more efficiently with technological enablement. That comes along behind it. Then, you have to understand what maturity looks like because you never get everything exactly right, completely right the first time when you want to make it -- the customer impact has to be understood, the team member impact has to be understood in addition to the capability. And then, you go into a cycle of sustainment and improvement. That's what's going on. And it takes a while to do that from one end of the business to the other from top to bottom, business by business, function by function.","Allen Parker","And Vivek, I would also just comment because I'm sure it's on your mind. I've had the opportunity to get out and speak to a very large number of the people who are on the Wells Fargo team, and also, as you would expect, had the opportunity to meet with every member of the operating committee over the last couple of weeks. These are leaders who have performed extremely well in various uncertain circumstances. They have been empowered by me and by our Board to move forward on the Company's priorities and they are highly engaged and motivated and above all else, they're really enthusiastic about what we can achieve. So, again, that's the source of my own personal optimism.","Vivek Juneja","Okay. Thanks. And yes, I mean, look, you do have a great franchise. So, it is important to protect that and grow that. I have another question completely different, if I can just shift gears and this is probably appropriate for John. John, the business payroll services business you just sold, you mentioned the gain to us. What is the impact from a revenue and a net income standpoint; any rough numbers?","Allen Parker","It's negligible, not discernible.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS.","Saul Martinez","Hi. Hate to beat the dead horse on the NII commentary, but obviously it does move the needle on numbers. John, am I -- what are you assuming for deposit betas in that guide? Are we assuming that you get to the 45% cumulative beta since the start of the cycle that you've expressed as sort of a normal run rate? Is that embedded in that guide and how quickly do you get there?","John Shrewsberry","It assumes continued -- our beta assumptions assume continued catch-up to the historic norm, which if it doesn't happen, as I mentioned earlier...","Saul Martinez","Okay.","John Shrewsberry","That is tied to that forecast.","Saul Martinez","Okay. And the historic norm is 45%. Is that correct?","John Shrewsberry","It depends on the mix, but it's the -- the range goes all the way to 55%.","Saul Martinez","Okay. Because if I -- you're through the cycle beta of 35%, which is based on I guess the 89 basis points. If the Fed funds goes -- stays where it's at, that would imply, by my calculations, you go to like 110 basis points in an environment where the Fed funds isn't moving. I mean, is that -- are those numbers right? Is that logic right?","John Shrewsberry","Well, I'm sure your math is right, but we have the -- what happens when we shift from non-interest bearing to interest bearing, we have...","Saul Martinez","Yes.","John Shrewsberry","The higher cost, as I mentioned, from things that we're doing in retail around the edges for promotional attempts, market by market to understand what high-yield savings and CDs due to the mix. Those are higher cost retail deposits.","Saul Martinez","Yes.","John Shrewsberry","The consumer beta has been really, really low since the beginning of the cycle. And so by doing these things around the edges, we're moving it relatively meaningfully -- without repricing the whole core of that portion of deposits.","Saul Martinez ","No, I get that. It just seems like a big delta in an environment where the Fed funds rate is flat. And in fact we plug that into any -- if I plug that number into any of my models for any of my companies, it's going to be hard to see any NII growth for anybody. But I'm just trying to get a sense of as to whether there is a level of conservatism built into that deposit beta.","John Shrewsberry","It may be. You might expect us to outperform them relative to what we've just talked about. But we're -- I think it's cautious to be -- we want to be frank with what the outcomes might be. We think this is what the outcomes might be. That's one area where there's -- where there's the opportunity to outperform depending on what happens in the market.","Saul Martinez","Got it. I guess if I could change gears a little bit and talk about costs, fully appreciating that the new CEO will ultimately determine what -- if and what the guides will be or the expectations will be beyond 2019. But you have outlined $2 billion of cost initiatives, I guess that are in place and you've talked about them with -- and a lot of details. But is there a way to kind of think about what's already in place that's going to happen regardless, whether it's systems modernization, digitizing processes, organizational realignment, and what's may be a little bit more discretionary that might be able to be more managed a little bit and could have some variance in terms of the outcome?","John Shrewsberry","Yes. The items that we have on slide 20 where we're showing you at least the relative expectation for cost takeout for 2018 and 2019 and the general Howard's categorizing where those are coming from will show you that the expectation is even higher now, and it includes the types of things that you mentioned, and as the prior slide shows, it's a good thing that it's higher because we're reinvesting more where we need to, et cetera. All of the types of things that you mentioned are things that we're going after hard. If there was a -- if there's a risk to it and I think we've accounted for it in our guidance, is that as we're -- as we're prioritizing, for example, capacity and technology or resources to get things done, there are some of these initiatives that have a bit -- whether it's digitization, automation or some technological solution to them that have to -- that will fight for priority along with the risk and regulatory related capabilities that are technologically dependent too. Again, I think we've captured that in our outlook, but those trade-offs are being assessed every day because as you could -- at this point in time, with all of the -- the possibilities of what technology can bring to the businesses, there are -- there's a boundless list of things that we'd all like to do.","Saul Martinez","Got it. And I guess, just the final quick one, John. I was a little surprised by the CECL estimates positively. But I guess broad-strokes, the reversals you might get in C&I because they're shorter -- shorter duration or remaining lives on them more than offset any sort of increase you'll see on your resi book or I guess your consumer book as well. Is that sort of the...","John Shrewsberry","That's exactly right.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.","Chris Kotowski","When you've had experience in -- with companies under consent orders in the past, historically it's been about things like asset quality or capital levels and you could kind of visualize what success looks like. I mean, that success would be having capital levels and up to peer standards and a world-class underwriting system and so on. And when it comes to something like operational effectiveness, it's just harder for me to understand. Like, in this process, are you being benchmarked against other companies and the regulators expect you to come to standards that can be observed in other companies that are out there? Or is it kind of an uncharted territory where there are expectations above and beyond that are not quite easy to quantify?","Allen Parker","Obviously, Chris, as you know, we're -- when you talk about consent orders, we're looking at a number of different ones and some of them are in more focused areas in terms of our businesses and our operations. With regard to the Fed consent order, there are really kind of two categories there. One is the -- the focus on corporate governance, which is really the role of the Board and the interface as between the Board and the Management of the Company and I think they're -- what we are all really looking for is what I would term as almost an ideal state, what's the appropriate role of the Board, what's are the appropriate processes the Board should apply and what are the proper levels of interface as between the Board and Management. I think in some respects, that is not necessarily a philosophical exercise, it's actually a highly structured exercise, but it's also informed by traditional notions of corporate governance and what the Fed thinks the proper role of the Board should be and we've completed a great deal of work in that regard. With regard to the other parts of what we're doing, those things really focused on operational risk and compliance and I think just going back to your question, Chris, it's a combination. It's somewhat of benchmarking, but it's also a focus by us and by the Fed on what would be the ideal state for us to be in. There is a great deal of work under the rubric of operational risk and compliance. You have to focus on things like operational issues, regulatory issues.","We're talking about customer remediation and one of the biggest aspects, as we've alluded to is the simplification of business processes. We want to all reach a place where we have fewer manual controls and fewer errors. I think it cannot be described as something that's being done on a whiteboard because there are number of reference points, but I would say, if anything, we are all trying to achieve something that maybe almost an outer boundary in terms of the quality of operational risk and compliance, something that hasn't really been achieved at this level before.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of John Pancari with Evercore.","John Pancari","Just, sorry, and we're going to go right back to the NII. Does that NII outlook -- does it assume any ongoing reinvestment of your excess liquidity position because I would assume that, if you do continue to use that to fund new loan originations, it could help temper the impact of the expectation that you're seeing on the deposit costs side? Thanks.","John Shrewsberry","Yes. It certainly does assume that we fund our expectation for risk asset generation through the available liquidity that we have. So within the bound of what's likely in terms of risk asset opportunity, I think it's captured in the forecast. If there were other interesting things for us to invest in, whether it was loans or securities we'd do it, but on the securities front, I think given where we are in terms of yield of risk free rates and spreads, we've accounted for what is within our appetite and on the loan front, as I've mentioned before, we're competing vigorously in every market that we're enthusiastic about to grow loans. So that is all in the forecast, I don't think there's a -- unless there is a shift in aggregate demand for credit across the business or consumer space. I don't imagine a real breakout there.","John Pancari","Okay. All right, thanks. And then, I'm not sure if this was explicitly asked, but based upon your commentary around the factors influencing the NII guide, how would you characterize the NIM progression from peers. I mean how much incremental compression do you see from now to the end of the year for example? Thanks.","John Shrewsberry","Yes. Well, I'm more of a dollar person than a NIM percentage person, but you could see the trajectory down somewhat. The big variable will be what happens with deposit pricing with sort of a range of outcomes depending on whether they follow this historic path or the path toward an historic beta or whether they settle in at a lower response rate, but if we're right in down 2% to down 5%, then we'll certainly be somewhat down from here.","John Pancari","Okay, thanks. And then, John\u2026","John Shrewsberry","And then dollars -- yes, they\u2019re just for everybody's benefit. It's about the dollars of net interest income and their impact on our ROE generation that we are more focused on rather than the outcome calculated NIM.","John Pancari","And then, John, one more for you. I know you have talked quite a bit about expenses and everything, but for this change specifically on your NII guide, is it fair to assume there is no cost offset just simply because on the upside there is not much of a cost to margin expansion and everything and therefore on the way down, there couldn't be or do you think -- or is there some type of cost offset to this change that may still get dialed in?","John Shrewsberry","Yes. I think of them separately. If there were, we would take it. And there is -- as we described, there is probably 200 programs going on right now that we're updating month-by-month to go after every bit of available efficiency opportunity. On the one hand, separately, we're reinvesting everywhere we need to and we'll continue to from a control risk and regulatory perspective. But if there is any low hanging fruit on the expense side, we'd be after it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.","Marty Mosby","I usually don't like hammering questions that we've been talking about so much, but there is another aspect of this I did want to bring out. So, two fronts. One, John, on the net interest margin and NII numbers, you have been derisking your balance sheet quite a bit to free up capacity for your core customers. And you mentioned that the sale of Pick-a-Pay, you've been doing that. Your margin really year-over-year is only down 2 or 3 basis points with all that derisking that's been going on. So, is this just as much of a structural shift in your balance sheet in the sense of how you've underperformed because other banks aren't really derisking like you all have been. And so in my mind that is over time and at least looking back over the last couple of quarters, that's really been more the impact?","John Shrewsberry","Absolutely. I'd say that Pick-a-Pay is a piece of that, the reliable auto business in Puerto Rico is a piece of that for sure. And then, of course the rundown of the junior lien mortgage loans are a piece of that also. We don't usually talk about the asset quality or sort of the risk adjusted NIM because it's not a risk sensitive concept, but without a doubt, our asset quality on average is as high as it's been in some time.","Now, with respect to Pick-a-Pay, because of the way they've been marked historically, you can argue about what their loss content might be. And people ask from time-to-time, why do we consider that risky given that we've carried them at such a markdown rate. And unrelated to asset quality I make the point that those are loans that we would not originate today and as we go into the next cycle, they have more operational risk associated with them because defaults and foreclosures are going to be higher there and we just assumed to have less of them when the next cycle hits rather than morph.","Marty Mosby","And really what we're talking about is higher yielding loans that have been run off that because they're not really core relationships like you said you wouldn't reoriginate these. So, these weren't core relationships, they just happen to be higher yielding. So, you're kind of derisking and you're getting the incremental balance sheet usage pushed out to free up capacity for that core, which just has a lower margin than some of these higher yielding portfolios had? And then, when you look at your deposit pricing in a sense of talking about this tail end, this has been a cycle where deposit betas have been much better than historic averages. What has caused you to want to assume that all of a sudden, the performance is going to get that much worse, and there\u2019s big catch-up versus the stability that we're already starting to see in deposit pricing that's in the market today. Bankrate.com rates have already started to flatten out, if not come down a little bit. So, I don't really see the inclination to keep assuming for this other than just a measure of conservatism. So, I just want to see what you saw in the market that makes you want to incorporate this?","John Shrewsberry","Yes. So, very specifically, our own cumulative beta trailing 12 months today is 43% and a quarter ago, it was 38%. So it feels like our experience is that we are catching up a little bit. Now, through the cycle beta is still much lower as you're pointing out, and this could very well be the end of it if. If the risk-free rates aren't moving, if the Fed is not moving anymore, but we're taking what we've just seen in this quarter and extending it out a little bit, which if we're wrong, then, we will -- it's not causing us to run around and raise all of our deposit prices, but it is causing us to forecast on what might end up being a conservative basis.","Marty Mosby","And then, Allen, I was going to ask, when you start getting at talking to the regulators, would you have a chance to do -- I mean, I can't imagine that you'll have been passive or not trying to be as aggressive as possible to fix the issues. I mean, this has been a very critical issue for the Company and it's been something that I think the management has been talking about for since the beginning. This is the most important thing to deal with. So what specifically do you walk away with from those meetings in the sense of -- we've heard a lot of generics, but I mean, what in the -- how do we amp up from what we've been doing or is it more like the [indiscernible] bank situation, when you just explain we're kind of setting the stage or we're setting the new standard that then everybody will have to come to, it just takes long to get there, and they're just kind of keeping the pressure of the regulators or to make sure that you can kind of set the bar for everybody else as you go through this changing process that you've been working on?","Allen Parker","Marty, it's a really good question, and I think there could be something to your notion that we are setting a new standard, and if so, that's perfectly okay with us. We really want to be the best company that we can possibly be. We have been serious. I think that we're going to do everything we can to do an even better job. We're going to redouble all our efforts and all of us on the operating committee have made clear to everybody on the team that we're just going to do a better job across the board, planning, hiring, motivating people, improving the quality of the work that we do, and above all else, just to execute on what we know we can do. I mean, this is an extraordinary team and if anything, we just have to work harder to bring to appropriate conclusions the things that we have in flight. So yeah, we're on a journey, but I think we're journey people, motivated and excited about because it's a journey to a great place.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.","Steven Chubak","So, I wanted to ask a question on profitability targets. At 2018 Investor Day, you provided profit targets. It assumed a flattish revenue environment versus '17 and if I look today, that core revenue run rate is about $5 billion below that level and it's certainly encouraging to hear that you remain committed to the expense goals for '19, especially during this period of, let's just call it CEO purgatory, but given the significant revenue shortfall that exists today, I'm wondering if there's any sort of commitment to deliver on the targets that had been outlined at that point in time, whether it's 14% to 17% ROTCE or the efficiency targets. I think I'm just trying to understand what targets if any shareholders should be holding the current management team accountable to.","John Shrewsberry","Those are good questions. So with respect to different people's definition of core revenue, there will be, as we've talked about some of the fundamental line items that are relatively easy to track and how they perform through cycles, we also have a recurring -- different people will ascribe different levels of reliability to it, but different types of gain taking et cetera, that's -- or gain generation that you could add to the top of that depending on what the market is delivering to us.","On expenses, we\u2019ve reupped for this year. We've talked about the fact that in 2020, it\u2019s appropriate given the fact that a new CEO will be in and then importantly in that, return generation is our capital plan and getting the denominator down because we carry a lot of excess capital and I think that shareholders should hold us accountable for executing, for delivering and performing on our capital plan as well. So at this point in the cycle, where we are with rates, we're going to apply every lever within our risk framework for generating the right mix of loans and investing in the right mix of securities and non-interest income.","We're leaning hard in the areas where we generate trust and investment fees, deposit service charges as mortgage and certain market-sensitive categories in particular, and then frankly, most importantly, I think our shareholders will hold us accountable for the execution that Allen has described of moving the ball down the field against our regulatory commitments in 2019 and into 2020 as well, but those are very concrete steps that people can point to that will have outcomes attached to them.","Steven Chubak","Okay. But, could we hold management accountable when discussing some of those outcomes to the targets that have previously been outlined, or do we have to take a simply wait-and-see approach?","John Shrewsberry","Well, I think for this year, since we've reupped on expenses, we certainly can. I think for 2020, what we're telling you is we're going to have a different CEO. And so that's -- it's hard for us to put words in that woman or man\u2019s mouth before they've arrived. And on the capital plan, for sure, I think that you should hold us accountable for that.","Steven Chubak","Okay. And then, just one follow-up for me. There was an earlier question discussing the prospect of restructuring of strategic alternatives. And I recognize it's still early days in that search process. But one of the businesses that's gotten a lot of attention in some of my investor discussions is wealth management. It's clearly been impacted by the account scandal, but there are a number of firms that have actually indicated very strong interest in growing, whether it's organically or inorganically, in this particular area. And I'm just wondering, given the steady pace of advisor attrition, strong interest from peers to maybe pursue M&A in this area, whether you would be -- open to considering a strategic sale if it offered a path to creating greater shareholder value, or said differently, if somebody else can maybe better monetize the asset?","John Shrewsberry","Yes. In the relatively near term, I certainly doubt it. I think that the wealth opportunity given our 70 million customer footprint and the attachment to our core banking capabilities, what we do in mortgage et cetera, all are probably, they provide a path to the greatest value creation. The changes that Jon Weiss is making in running that business I think will continue to generate a high level of value creation. The way you've phrased the question, it presupposes that it would be a higher value creation for Wells Fargo shareholders if we did that. And of course it's an obligation of the firm to look at anything like that. I just doubt that that would be true. So, it's not on the short list of things that we're talking about as we've been doing the noncore trimming here and there like retirement, for example most recently. But as you say, if anybody made a proposal to Wells Fargo that was value maximizing for our shareholders, that's our job is to respond to that.","Allen Parker","Let me close by thanking all of you for joining our first quarter conference call. And as always, we'd like to thank all our team members for their hard work, dedication and enthusiasm. As I hope we've made clear on the call this morning, this Company is not standing still during this interim period and our team members are a critical part of our moving forward. We look forward to speaking with all of you again next quarter. Thanks very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a Question-and-Answer Session. [Operator Instructions]. ","I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference.","John Campbell","Thank you, Regina. Good morning. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO and President, Tim Sloan; and our CFO, John Shrewsberry, will discuss fourth quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our fourth quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today\u2019s call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our website.","I will now turn our call over to CEO and President, Tim Sloan.","Tim Sloan","Thank you, John. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 2017 was a transformational year for Wells Fargo as we made significant progress on our efforts to build a better bank. Our vision of satisfying our customers' financial needs remains unchanged, but how we execute this vision has evolved. ","This evolution includes develop new ways to more efficiently serve our customers and create a better customer experience, which includes investments in innovation, streamlining and centralizing processes in organization structures, strengthening the foundations of the way we manage risk and building a robust and more modern data and technology infrastructure. ","Pages we supplement highlight the few of the actions we taken at Wells Fargo better for our customers, our team members, our shareholder and our communities. Some with our customers in order to help those impacted by hurricanes last year we provide a payment relief and proactively way -- to approximately 100,000 customers. We've also made a number of customer friendly changes to help all of our customers to better manage their accounts. For example, in March we introduced Automatic zero balance alerts and we now send over 18 million real time alerts a month, enabling our customers to make a deposit or a transfer so they don't overdraw their account. ","In November, we introduced Overdraft Rewind, which has already helped over 350,000 customers avoid overdraft charges. We believe that using data and technology to help our customers better manage their finances will enable us to grow and build more long-term relationships. ","In 2017, we accelerated the pace of innovation and launched value added technologies, including card-free ATM access, which our customers have used more than 5 million times since March. And since June, our customers have sent more than $10 billion through Zelle for P2P payments. As our customers have increased their use of online and mobile channels, we've made it easier for them to interact with us digitally. For example, digital credit card account openings were up 47% from a year ago. In November, we launched Intuitive Investor, our digital brokerage advisory offering, and later this quarter we will fully rollout our digital mortgage application, which combines the power of Wells Fargo Data with a You Know Me customer experience. ","In 2018, we expect additional innovations including instant issuance of debit cards to customers in mobile wallets and control tower, a central hub for customers to view and manage the places where their Wells Fargo cards and account information is stored. ","In addition to these innovations, we rely on our team members to help drive an exceptional customer experience and in 2017 we took a number of steps to enhance team member benefits, including adding four additional paid holidays, announcing plans to grant restricted stock rights to approximately 250,000 team members, and increasing the minimum base pay for all U.S. based team members. We increased the minimum hourly rate, to $13.50 in 2017 which impacted 31,000 team members. After the passage of the tax cuts and Job Act, we announced another increase to $15 an hour starting in March 2018 and we are also reviewing team members, who were already making $15 an hour or slightly above to ensure that they are paid appropriately based on their role. We estimate that approximately 70,000 team members will receive a pay increase related to these changes. ","Our goal is to deliver long-term value for our shareholders through a balanced business model, strong risk discipline, efficient execution and a world-class team. In 2017, we generated $22.2 billion of net income, with an 11.35% return on equity. From that, we've returned $14.5 billion to our shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases. This is up 16% from 2016. Returning more capital to our shareholders remains a top priority. ","Another goal is to make positive contributions to the communities we serve. And in 2017, we donated $286 million including more than $4 million to areas that were impacted by Hurricanes, California wildfires and other natural disasters. We also announced that we are targeting $400 million in donations to non-profits and community organizations in 2018, an increase of approximately 40% from last year. And beginning in 2019, we are targeting 2% of our after-tax net profits for corporate philanthropy. ","Our results in the fourth quarter were strong and they included a net benefit from the tax cuts and Job Act. While it's too early to determine the full impact, it appears that tax reform will benefit our customers and help grow the U.S. economy and surveys indicate business confidence has increased. Other items that impacted our results in the fourth quarter included, the gain on the sale of Wells Fargo Insurance Services, and higher litigation accruals. ","Our efforts to transform Wells Fargo were evident in our results in 2017, including record deposit balances, improved retail banking household retention, increased brand satisfaction with most recent visit scores, which are now back to the levels we had prior to the sales practice settlements, growth in debit card and credit card purchase volume, both up 6% in the fourth quarter from a year ago, record levels of client assets in wealth and investment management, historically low credit losses, exceptionally strong capital and liquidity levels. And while our expenses increased driven by higher litigation accruals and investments in our businesses and capabilities, we are on track with our expense initiatives and we remain committed to our target of $4 billion in expense reductions. John will provide more details on this later in the call.","In summary, Wells Fargo is a much better company today than we were a year ago. And notwithstanding our challenges, I am confident that the hard work, dedication and resiliency of our team members demonstrated throughout 2017 will make Wells Fargo even better in 2018 as we continue our transformation. ","John will now discuss our financial results in more detail.","John Shrewsberry","Thanks, Tim. And good morning, everyone. We are earned $6.2 billion or $1.16 per share in the fourth quarter. And as Tim mentioned our results included three noteworthy items I will describe in a minute. First, I want to quickly highlight the impact from our election to early adopt the new hedge accounting standard which was mentioned on the call last quarter and was discussed in our third quarter 10-Q filing. It\u2019s described in a note on slides that highlights, slide 4. As a result of this early adoption, our previously reported EPS for prior quarters in 2017 was revised resulting in a net $0.03 per share increase in EPS for the first nine months of the year. We have more information on this accounting standard in the appendix. ","On page 5, we summarize the noteworthy items which included a $3.35 billion after-tax benefit or $0.67 per share from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. I will be providing more details about this on the next page. Our results also include an $848 million gain on the sale of Wells Fargo Insurance Services which benefited EPS by $0.11, and we had a $3.25 billion litigation accrual in the quarter for a variety of matters including mortgage related regulatory investigations, sales practices and other consumer related matters. The majority of this expense was not tax deductible and it reduced EPS by $0.59.","On page 6, we provide more details on the impacts of the Tax Act. The estimated tax benefit from the reduction to net deferred income taxes was $3.89 billion, was somewhat unique in that the tax effective, our temporary difference results in a net deferred tax liability which is primarily driven by differences between the book and tax treatment of our leasing and mortgage servicing businesses and mark-to-market timing differences. ","In addition, we\u2019ve not had big historic net operating losses which are now less valuable under the Tax Act and we earn substantially all of our income in the US, so we have lower amounts of foreign cash subject to deemed repatriation. This benefit was partially offset by a $370 million after-tax loss from valuation adjustments related to leverage leases, low income housing and tax advantage renewable energy investments. ","In addition, there was a $173 million tax expense from the estimated deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings. We currently expect our full year 2018 effective income tax rate to be approximately 19%. ","And we\u2019ll highlight much of what\u2019s on page 7 later on the call. So, let me just point out on the asset side, we purchased $20.9 billion of securities in the fourth quarter which were largely offset by one-off and sales. ","On the liability side, our long-term debt balances declined $14.2 billion primarily driven by lower federal home loan bank debt. ","I'll be highlighting our income statement drivers on page 8 later on the call. So, turning to page9. Average loans declined $521 million from the third quarter with commercial loans down $692 million partially offset by a $171 million of higher average consumer loans. However, we did have some positive momentum in our loan growth during the quarter with period end loans up $4.9 billion from the third quarter. ","Let me highlight the drivers starting on page 10. Commercial loans increased $3.2 billion from the third quarter, with C&I loans up $5.2 billion. C&I growth was broad based and included seasonal growth in financial institutions and commercial distribution finance as well as growth in asset backed finance and corporate banking. Commercial real estate loans declined $2.1 billion from the third quarter, reflecting our continued credit discipline in a very competitive market. ","Consumer loans grew $1.7 billion from the third quarter, similar the trends we've highlighted throughout the year. We had growth in first mortgage loans and credit card balances and declines in junior lean mortgages auto and other revolving and installment loans. As a reminder, growth in the first quarter will be impacted by seasonally lower mortgage origination and credit card balances. ","Auto originations were relatively flat linked quarter and were down 33% from a year ago. We've reduced volumes while strengthening the credit profile of this portfolio and our origination volume with the FICO score above 640 grew to 85% of total originations in the fourth quarter, up from 76% a year ago. We expect balances will continue to decline throughout 2018 given the transformational changes we're making in the business. ","Our deposits reached a record high in the fourth quarter and our average deposits increased 2% from the year ago. Our average deposit cost increased 2 basis points from the third quarter and was up 16 basis points from a year ago. The market hasn't made changes to the rates paid on consumer and small business banking deposits and neither have we. As Fed funds and LIBOR have increased we've had incremental deposit repricing for commercial and wealth and management customers. If the tax act drives stronger, industry loan growth this year, deposit betas could be impacted somewhat as market demand for deposits increases to fund this growth. ","Our full year 2017 net interest income increased 4% consisting with the expectation we provided at Investor Day. Net interest income in the fourth quarter declined to $136 million from the third quarter, primarily driven by the $183 million reduction to net interest income from adjustments related to leverage leases due to the tax act, which reduced loan yields in the quarter. Similarly, our NIM was down 2 basis points to 284 as the negative impacts from the adjustment related to leverage leases and growth in average deposits was partially offset by lower average long-term debt and a modest benefit from all other growth repricing and variable terms. ","Investors often ask us about our loan swaps. So, let me provide some additional details on our position. As we previously disclosed between 2014 and 2016, we entered into received fixed rate swaps to hedge some of our LIBOR based commercial loans when the expectation was the interest rates to be lower for longer. We converted lower yielding floating rate loans into higher yielding fixed rate loans. ","At the peak, we had $86 million worth of loan swaps. We actively manage these positions as starting in the third quarter, we began to unwind some of them. At year-end, we had $51 million of notional outstanding, and we've unwound more early this year leaving us with that current notional value of closer to $30 million. The reduction in swaps will reduce interest income from these loans in 2018, but it's increased our interest rate sensitivity from the low end, back to near the midpoint of our range of 5 to 15 basis points for a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. ","Being modestly more asset sensitive at this point in the rate cycle should be beneficial. However, it's important to note, that during the extended period of loan interest rates since these swaps we're entered into they generated incremental revenue of approximately $3 billion for Wells Fargo. The cost of unwinding the swaps which is approximately $700 million will be amortized over the remaining life of the original derivative which averages approximately 3 years. ","Our net interest income for full year 2018 will be dependent on a variety of factors including the level and of slope of the yield curve as well as deposit betas and earning asset growth trends. ","Non-interest income grew $337 million from the third quarter. This increase included the benefit of the $848 million gain on the sale of Wells Fargo Insurance Services, which was partially offset by a $414 million reduction from impairments on low income housing and renewable energy investments resulting from the tax act. Deposit service charges declined $30 million from the third quarter, driven by customer friendly changes including the launch of Overdraft Rewind in November which Tim highlighted at the start of the call. ","Trust and investment fees increased $78 million on higher asset base fees and retail brokerage transaction activity. Mortgage banking non-interest income declined $118 million from the third quarter, largely due to a $71 million decline in residential mortgage origination revenue, driven by a 10% reduction in origination volumes primarily from seasonality in the purchase market. The gain on sale margin in the fourth quarter was 125 basis points relatively flat from the third quarter, and based on current pricing trends and channel mix in our held-for-sale pipeline we expect the margin to decline in the first quarter. ","Servicing income declined $47 million, primarily from lower net hedge results due to the impact of changes in MSR valuation assumptions, including the impact of increasingly competitive industry pricing, lower carry on our MSR hedge in the flatter yield curve environment and increased customer payment deferrals in areas impacted by recent hurricanes. ","On page 15, we provide details on our trading related revenue, which declined $49 million from the third quarter, primarily driven by declines in customer trading activity from lower volatility and compressed spreads. ","Turning to expenses on page 16. Expenses increased $2.4 billion from the third quarter largely driven by the $2.2 billion higher operating losses. On page 17, I'll highlight the other drivers of the increase. ","The $142 million increase from the third quarter in compensation and benefits expense reflected higher stock award expense, primarily from stock price and performance impacts on prior period awards. Higher salaries expense was largely driven by higher costs from the additional paid holidays we granted our team members in 2017. Increases in running the business discretionary and infrastructure cost were driven by typically higher advertising and equipment spending in the quarter. ","On page 18, we showed the drivers of the year-over-year increase in expenses, which was also primarily driven by higher operating losses. Compensation and benefits expense increased $475 million, primarily due to annual salary adjustments and higher benefit costs which were partially offset by lower FTE. Our FTE were down 2% from the year ago reflecting the sale of our insurance services business as well as declines in consumer lending and community banking. Higher compensation and benefits expense also reflected $115 million of higher deferred comp expense which is P&L neutral. ","On page 19, we highlight the progress we made in 2017 on our expense initiatives which was primarily driven by the efforts we\u2019ve made through centralization and optimization. We centralized enterprise functions that were previously distributed across our organization. ","In addition, we realigned businesses to eliminate redundancy and leverage customer synergies and we\u2019ve continued to make transformational changes for our operating models including in-contact centers, technology and operations. ","We also saved money through continued improvement in vendor leverage in contract pricing. We have done this by using our centralized contract team to negotiate rates based on the aggregated volume of the entire company.","We reduced travel and entertainment expense by 2% by enhancing our travel policy standards and leveraging technology. We also exceeded our target of 200 branch closures in 2017 and to date, the closures have had minimal impact on household retention and growth. Based on customer channel usage, we currently expect to close 250 branches or more in 2018. Branches play an important part in serving our customers and we will have as many branches as our customers want for as long as they want them. ","Based on our current assumptions regarding consumer channel behavior and our own technology advances as well as other factors, we can see our total branch network declining to approximately 5,000 by the end of 2020. ","We are also reducing properties and other businesses including standalone mortgage locations which stand [ph] by over 10% in 2017. We are also transitioning operational activities in our auto business from 57 regional banking centers into three larger regional sites. ","We expect to complete the consolidation in the first half of 2018 helping us further standardize process in the business. As we pursue these reductions, we will continue to support team members by helping them find other positions while we also consider the banking needs of the communities we serve. ","We are on track to achieve our targeted $4 billion of expense reductions which have been identified and assigned to the business leaders who have specific responsibility for achieving them. As a reminder the first $2 billion of targeted expense saves by year end 2018 supports our ongoing investment in the businesses which includes a number of key areas such as enhancing our compliance and risk management capability, building a better bank and strengthening our core infrastructure. ","We expect the additional $2 billion targeted annual expense reductions by the end of 2019 to go to the bottom line and be fully recognized in 2020. These expected savings do not include the completion of core deposit intangible amortization expense at the end of this year which will amount to $769 million in full year 2018 and also it doesn\u2019t include the completion of the FDIC special assessment which we expect should happen by the end of 2018. ","Finally, it doesn\u2019t include expense savings due to business divestitures which we highlight on page 22. ","As part of our efforts to be more transparent in response to investor request, we are providing more detail on our expense expectations for 2018 on page 21. We currently expect that full year 2018 total expenses to be in the range of $53.5 billion to $54.5 billion. This expectation includes approximately $600 million of typical operating losses this year and excludes any outside litigation and remediation accruals or penalties. ","As I mentioned on the call last quarter we expect to achieve a quarterly efficiency ratio with a 59 handle by the end of 2018, not including any outside litigation accruals. ","2018 revenue which will impact the efficiency ratio will be influenced by a number of factors including the absolute level of rates, the shape of the yield curve, loan growth, deposit betas, credit spreads, cash redeployment and the absolute level of the equity markets. And just as a point of reference, we estimate our efficiency ratio sensitivity to be plus or minus 60 basis points for every 1% increase or decrease in revenue from the $88.4 billion we earned in 2017. We will provide guidance on the expenses for 2019 in our Investor Day in May. ","For the past couple of years, we\u2019ve been taking a hard look at all of our businesses and their contributions and as a result we\u2019ve had multiple divestitures, we thought it will be helpful to share the revenue and direct expense associated with the businesses we sold over the past two years, which we provide on page 22. As you can see there was a revenue impact from selling these businesses but they were sold for sound economic reasons and generated nice returns for our shareholders. As a reminder, Wells Fargo Insurance Services was sold at the end of November and the share owner services is expected to close later in the first quarter. ","Turning to our segment starting on slide 23. The majority of the impacts from the tax act as well as the litigation accruals in the quarter were included in our community banking results. ","On page 24, we highlight the customers continue to actively used their accounts, we have strong growth and digital secure sessions up 8% from a year ago and we continue to have declines in branch and ATM interactions reflecting the increased use of digital channels by our customers. ","On page 25, we highlight balance and activity growth which included an increase of 6% in both credit and debit card purchase volume from a year ago. As Tim mentioned, branch satisfaction with most recent visit scores are now back to the levels we had prior to the sales practice settlements. I believe the transformational changes we\u2019re making to better meet our customers financial needs including providing bankers with innovative tools to enable more meaningful financial conversations with our customers not only improves customer service, but will also drive growth. ","Turning to page 26. Wholesale banking results in the fourth quarter included the gain on the sale of our insurance services business. Total wealth and investment management client assets reached a record high of $1.9 trillion, and average closed referral investment assets were up 12% from a year ago. ","Turning to page 28. Our credit quality remained exceptionally strong, our loss rate for the full year was among the lowest in our history and in the fourth quarter our loss rate was 31 basis points of average loans. All of our commercial and consumer real estate loan portfolios were in a net recovery position in the quarter including our home equity portfolio. Non-performing assets have declined for seven consecutive quarters and were less than 1% of total loans for the second consecutive quarter. Continued improvement in the oil and gas portfolio have benefited this trend. ","During the oil and gas cycle over the last three years, we established a peak oil and gas reserve of $1.7 billion in the first quarter of 2016 and incurred through the cycle losses of $1.2 billion. We believe we\u2019ve largely put this issue behind us and we\u2019ll no longer provide credit updates on this portfolio in future quarters unless factors change, but we will continue to include the size of the portfolio in our 10-Q, filings. We had a $100 million reserve release in the quarter reflecting continued strong credit performance. ","Turning to page 29, our estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio fully phased in increased to 11.9% in the fourth quarter remaining well above our internal target level of 10%. We remain focused on returning more capital to shareholders and we turn to record $14.5 billion through common stock dividends and net share repurchases in 2017, up 16% from 2016. We had net share repurchases of $6.8 billion in 2017, up 42% from 2016, and period end common shares outstanding declined 2% to 4.9 billion shares. ","In summary, we began 2018 with an exceptionally strong asset quality, liquidity and capital. We're on track to achieve our expense targets and the transformational changes we're making throughout Wells Fargo will help us achieve our six goals and drive our long-term success. ","We'll now take your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead. ","Erika Najarian ","So, I expect you to differ me to Investor Day, but I'm going to try anyway. I'm sure that your investors are going to refine your 2019 and 2020 outlook for the company following your results. And if you think about your new guidance for dollar expenses in 2018 and again fully acknowledging that you will get more color in May, is it fair to take that $53.5 billion to $54.5 billion range, assume a growth rate, and this is for 2020, assuming normal growth rate over the next two years and then take out the $2 billion in cost savings, the $769 million in CDI expense and the $573 million in sold business expense, isn't included?","Tim Sloan","Yeah. Erika, I think that's a fair description of what could happen. I think one of the big impacts to that could be what revenues look like in 2020, but I think that's fair. ","John Shrewsberry","The one thing I'd add that will be, we've been talking about, we'll talk about more at Investor Day as you mentioned, is the arc of the ongoing reinvestment or investment in the various programs that we have to transform Wells Fargo. Some of them are regulatory in nature, some of them are [probation] in nature, but there are variety of them, each of them has their own arc. They're in place today and so how they come off the total is going to be the missing link for what happens in 2019 and maybe even in 2020 for some of them. ","Erika Najarian ","Got it. And my follow up question is on the consumer loan side, it was up $1.7 billion on a linked quarter basis. Two of your peers are more relatively upbeat in terms of the consumer outlook for 2018 especially relative to tax reform. And the question for you is, has the attrition in the consumer book bottomed in 2017? ","And on the mortgage side as you think about non-conforming loan growth and loan originations, is there still a gap between what your underwriting standards are today and what you think they could go down to if we had better guidance or reformed guidance from the agencies on mortgage?","Tim Sloan","So, Erika good question. I think let me respond in a couple of ways. First, I think it's absolutely fair and the feedback that we've been getting from our customers is that we should all be cautiously optimistic on the impact of the tax reform act on consumers. There have been millions of employed folks across the country that have gotten pay races and bonuses and the like, and I think that\u2019s a net positive for economic growth. ","As it relates to cyclically to our consumer loan growth, we believe that we will grow mortgage loans this year. We believe that we will grow credit cards this year. But we believe that it\u2019s likely that the home equity book will continue to decline, not -- if you look at the home equity book and you divide it in the kind of the post crisis and pre-crisis book, pre-crisis book just continues to decline as we\u2019ve been talking about for years. But we expect the post crisis book to grow. But I don\u2019t think that growth will offset the decline in the home equity book for 2018. ","And then likewise as John mentioned at it relates to auto, we believe that with all the changes that are going on in the auto portfolio, notwithstanding the underlying credit improvement and new originations, that we will see a continued decline in that portfolio throughout 2018 and in our current estimates this maybe, the lines will start to cross the fourth quarter this year may be first quarter 2019, it\u2019s -- we will find out. But I would think about our consumer portfolio, we are optimistic about -- again about the impact of the tax act on consumers.","Erika Najarian ","Follow-up on the underwriting side. ","Tim Sloan","Yes, we don\u2019t anticipate making any changes to our underwriting. Our underwriting, as it relates to mortgage, that we look at those every day and we are going to be competitive from a market standpoint. We are also going to take the long-term view and not get too aggressive at any one point in time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Tim Sloan","Congratulations Matt. You were right. We needed to provide $1 expense guidance. We listened to you. Can you mark that down in your calendar?","Matt O'Connor","I do think it\u2019s a good first step given [Multiple Speakers] 2019 and 2020 trajectory, I think of great importance. So, appreciate that\u2019s coming in a few minds. The only thing I \u2018m really been focused on and obviously the market as well is just the legacy issues and at this point a year and a quarter after taking over CEO and obviously being in very senior roles for many years before, do you feel like you\u2019ve identified Tim, all of the legacy issues and they have been all disclosed. And now you are at the point where you\u2019re just finishing out working through them internally and hoping to reach settlements this year where applicable?","Tim Sloan","Well Matt it\u2019s a very fair question, particularly with the accrual that we took this quarter. And my answer continues to be very consistent and that is I think we\u2019ve made a lot of progress in terms of looking at the operations of the company. But I can\u2019t provide you with a guarantee or absolute assurance that we won\u2019t be making additional changes in the future to anything that we might find. But again, we\u2019ve made a lot of progress.","Matt O'Connor","And I guess I wonder why you can\u2019t. Because I feel like -- you\u2019ve been there a long time, John has been there a long time. I appreciate it\u2019s a big company and any company can have issues that arise. So, I am not trying to kind of get the all clear on everything for forever. But it does seem like there\u2019s a number of issues that are probably legacy in nature that you\u2019ve identified and I would assume you\u2019ve reviewed and re-reviewed in triple shake [ph] banks or are doing that now and I do still think it\u2019s great importance to be able to turn the page whether it\u2019s for the investors, the employees, I would think it\u2019s relevant too, so that\u2019s why just continued to push on this as well.","Tim Sloan","Look this is very reasonable question and I love to live in a world where I can give you an absolute guarantee and certainty, but it\u2019s just not the world we live in. I mean we\u2019ve been working very hard and looking at operations across the company. We have invested a significant amount of money in doing that, we\u2019ve been very transparent when we have issues for all of you. I know that sometimes it\u2019s disappointing, but that was the promise that we made and when we find that we\u2019ve made any sort of mistakes we fix them and if there is a customer on the other end that\u2019s been harmed, we will remediate them. But I just can\u2019t provide you with that absolute guarantee at this moment in time, maybe someday I will, but I think it\u2019s going to be something we look at the rare view mirror over a longer period of time as opposed to having some inflection point today or tomorrow or the week after that. ","Matt O'Connor","And just last thing on this, are there certain businesses or regions or customer segments that you are still reviewing, maybe they\u2019re not as close customers to you like those third-party relationships that can be a little trickier like are there still segments that you\u2019re reviewing that you are just not a 100% sure is not issues or?","Tim Sloan","Yeah. again, it\u2019s a fair question. I would say that we\u2019re continuing to look across the entire company as opposed to in any specific area. Again, we\u2019ve made a lot of progress, but as I reflect on my first year and a quarter in this role, I think it\u2019s fair to say that one of the mistakes that we\u2019ve made at this company was that we didn\u2019t have a thorough enough review of the businesses on an ongoing basis. So, our review will be continuing, we\u2019re never going to declare victory, we\u2019re going to always make sure that we\u2019ve got the right checks and balances from a corporate risk standpoint and an audit standpoint and we\u2019re making even more investments in the infrastructure and collecting data in a different way. So, we want to continue to make improvements. So, again the punch line matters that we\u2019ve made a lot of progress and we\u2019ve been very disclosive, but I can\u2019t provide you with absolute certainty. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ken Usdin","Hi, good morning Tim. How are you guys doing. Questions on the fee side of the business. Maybe to start with, nice to see that trust side are actually moving the right way. I\u2019m just wondering how much of that is any improvement in transaction side. How much of it is the higher markets and what\u2019s your just basic outlook for how that business can do going ahead?","Tim Sloan","Well we\u2019re optimistic and we\u2019ve seen growth in that business for the last few years, we\u2019ve had a nice transition [Multiple Speakers] that\u2019s a good point John, we\u2019ve had a nice transition in the senior leadership from David Carol who did a terrific job to John Wise. I think John mentioned in the fourth quarter that he thought we'd see 4% to 5% type revenue growth this year. And so, we continue to be optimistic. A large part of the increase in the fourth quarter to your point was related to higher underlying values, but again that tends to drive revenues in future too. But we continue to be optimistic about that business and to reinforce John's point about the improvement in referrals from community banking to wealth and investment management. ","Ken Usdin","Okay. And I guess I'm just wondering the markets are up a lot and your referrals are up a lot, but obviously the revenues are up but not as much. So that whole underlying shift to seize and decompression, is that start to stabilize or is it just an ongoing burden you always just have to overcome on with volume?","Tim Sloan","Well, your point is fair. Because there have been some changes in the business that attracted the entire market because of the DOL rule and implementation last year. And it's a competitive business, but again, I think John was clear that he, John Jon Weiss clear that he thought that he would see 4%, 5% not even say 6% growth on the top-line. So, we're comfortable with that. ","John Shrewsberry","I also think this secular shift this intentional shift to emphasize recurring asset management relationships over transactional revenue. Means you've got the means, the outcome that you're describing but less volatility around it because you're less reliant on people trading stocks and more aligned with the managed solution which is a more stable form of revenue. ","Ken Usdin","Got it, okay. And then just to keep on in another big area, fees. Just on the mortgage business, you got your platform rolling out and there is obviously it's major potential transition happening just with rates, and tax and housing markets. So, what's your expectation for just your size of the mortgage market and what do you think share can be? And within that, you've got a big, big mix sale of correspondent versus retail as a percentage. And can your new platform start to change that mix?","Tim Sloan","Yeah. So, I think the NBA is calling for the overall mortgage market size to be down a little bit. They can't factor in what might happen with more economic expansion as a result of the tax act. But call the size of the market unchanged to down, it's probably going to continue to be a little bit more of a purchase market from a reify market or trending more in that direction, which is a more competitive market for us to operate in. As a big servicer, we have an advantage in the reify market. As a result, our retail share may end up being a little bit lower, but we do a lot of correspondent lending and servicing. And so, our volumes represent the aggregate of what we originate directly and what we fund and service for correspondents. ","So that's part of why margin is down because that mix from retail to correspondent means our costs are less but our revenue opportunities is less too. So, I think it's our expectation that the market is flat to down a little bit. Again, unless tax reform does something remarkable which will be great. I think it's our expectations that gets, it stays competitive. I mentioned in my comments. We think the first quarter is going to be a lower margin quarter than the fourth quarter based on what we can see. Some of that is specific behavior and a part of the agencies, because of programs that they run in the fourth quarter to get things done. And as it relates to our competitiveness, whether it's our feet on the street or our technological innovation that's rolling out right now, we anticipate being as competitive as we can possibly be in every market and maintaining our leading share. And so, it's a big point of emphasis for Michael DeVito and the folks who manage that team, but we don't want to cede that position. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. ","Brian Kleinhanzl","Great, thanks. Hey, good morning. Quick question on the loan growth, it looks like CRE was loan growth again this quarter and you did mention that you saw focusing on continued credit discipline. But can you maybe breakdown kind of what you are seeing in that market currently, how much farther do you have to kind of wind down this book, I mean how much lower can it go? ","Tim Sloan","We don\u2019t want to wind down this book. I mean we are the largest commercial real estate lender by far in not only in total but in almost every product type and we have the most diverse and broadest commercial real estate platform in the market. We are committed to this business long-term. But to be committed to the real estate business long-term you need to also make important and disciplined decisions when you see that you are at a period in the cycle that doesn\u2019t last forever but a period in a cycle where, things that that -- underwriting standard or pricing might be a little bit out of balance. That\u2019s how you get to stay in this business through cycles because you made good decisions. So, we want to grow this book but we want to grow it in a way that makes the right decisions for our shareholders. ","So, what we have seen this year is an increase in competition, slightly lower in credit spread -- standards excuse me, and a little bit more aggressive pricing and that's meant that our book has declined a little bit. But again, we\u2019ve got a balanced business here and so our real estate capital markets business has absolutely been on fire and you can see that other parts of revenue in the company. So, I wouldn\u2019t look at this as we\u2019re purposely rolling down this book because we don\u2019t like the business, we love the business. We want to grow it so that we are ready for next year and the next cycle. ","Brian Kleinhanzl","And then maybe a separate question on the retail bank metrics, like the primary consumer checking account growth, just the other positive year-over-year, if you look at it where it was last December, you\u2019re up 3% year-on-year. May be if you could break down what you are seeing with regards to new customer acquisition versus the attrition? Because I thought you said the attrition had slowed, did you see the acceleration in the fourth quarter? Thanks.","Tim Sloan","I don\u2019t think we saw acceleration. I think that Mary Mack and team are doing a terrific job in terms of fundamentally changing that platform. It takes time to make changes in a business that has 5,800 branches and call centers and tens of thousands of team members who are working very hard. We made changes in terms of incentive plan. We made changes in terms of the management team to streamline that. We\u2019ve improved training and we\u2019ve also delegated responsibility so that our folks in branches can address customer opportunities and needs more quickly, that takes time. But I am pleased with the progress and our expectation for 2018 as we are going to see checking account growth, I would also say -- primary checking account growth, I would also say an improvement over what you saw in the fourth quarter but I would also say that underlying value of those accounts has increased, and we\u2019ve talked about that at Investor Day last year. And we are continuing to see that trend.","John Shrewsberry","One thing I would add is that the 2015, \u201816 primary checking account growth numbers were also benefited by a major attempt to convert people who were primary. They were customers of Wells Fargo but they were at that point primary into primary customers. And so, we had a backlog of relationships to convert to primary that we\u2019ve, I\u2019d say we basically worked through and now it\u2019s really about net new customers to the bank and making them primary customers. And so just to comp owner. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","John Pancari","Back to the loan growth front. Thanks for the color on the areas you\u2019ve commented on already. I know you\u2019re seeing some of the interest in still and auto and declines in home equity and you\u2019re being selective in CRE. So, given that as you look at 2018, can we see growth in 2018 in average loans versus full year 2017? And as a commercial that can really drive that growth despite the headwinds?","Tim Sloan","Yeah. Hope so, our plan is to do that, John. I think the wild card is just the pace of underlying economic growth, and we\u2019re the largest lender in this country and so we\u2019re dependent not only on the hard work and effort of the great team of relationship managers, but it\u2019s also a function of economic growth. So, if we see an increase in economic growth that should be a net positive. Just anecdotally I would tell you that I\u2019ve spent a lot of money in the last week and a half with our commercial and corporate customers and there is a lot of optimism out there. ","John Shrewsberry","The C&I loans, credit card and first mortgage is likely where our net loan growth is going to come from in 2018 and similar to the quarter. ","John Pancari","Got it, got it. Thanks John. And then just secondly on capital, I know we\u2019ve seen that article recently in the journal in the camel ratings and everything. And assuming -- I know you haven\u2019t commented on it, but want to say if you have anything to say about the ratings. And then secondly if that is true and everything is there an implication in terms of capital deployment. And if you could just talk about how you\u2019re thinking about deployment as you look at 2018?","Tim Sloan","So, fair question given the media coverage. We can\u2019t comment on confidential supervisory information from our regulators and so we won\u2019t. But as it relates to capital return, I think that I said it early in the call and John repeated it that we\u2019re pleased to have increased the amount of capital returned to our shareholders by 16% year-over-year and our expectation is that we will continue to increase capital return because we have excess capital at the company to fund our growth. And so, our goal is to reduce our 11.9% Tier 1 common equity number over the next few years to something closer to 10%. I don\u2019t know exactly what that means in terms of what our submission for C-CAR is this year or next year for that matter. But, we\u2019re certainly going in that direction. John, I don\u2019t know if you have any other comment.","John Shrewsberry","No, that\u2019s right the I guess I was interpreting the question also mean deployment for growth and loan portfolio and that would be the first call on our capital share and make loans for our customers. There is no M&A in our future that would be a use of capital that we can possibly imagine at this point. And thus, the high starting point in the ongoing relatively high level of capital generation should lead to attempting to return more of that to shareholders. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead. ","John McDonald","Hi. Hey, good morning. Just want to clarify the outlook on expenses the range for 2018, that would include the community contribution stuff that you list on page 3, the $400 million on donations and the other things there?","John Shrewsberry","Yes, it does. And the higher base pay for the roughly $70,000 fee numbers. ","John McDonald","Okay. And then, John, you also mentioned hoping to get to 59 handles on the efficiency ratio by late 2018? I guess you had to kind of make some assumptions about kind of the economy and rate hikes there. Could you just give us some sense of what it would take to kind of get there?","John Shrewsberry","Yeah, I mean. I think we are imagining 3 rate hikes built into our baseline scenario. We don't have a lot of economic impact from tax reform built into our current forecast for 2017 to the extent that it achieves its desired goals to see some upside there. I think those would be the big drivers. And one of the key estimations we have to make as what's going to happen with deposit pricing throughout the course of the year. I think we're anticipating normalizing betas over the course of the year that feeds into that range.","John McDonald","Okay. And how do you evaluate further reduction in the swaps, what's kind of the calculus that you go through? And has that remain fairly way you've got. ","John Shrewsberry","Sure. The calculus is what is our outlook for rates over the next couple of years versus what the forward curve implies because that's where swap pricing comes from. And if we think that if there is a chance that we're going to be earning more over the next couple of years, then it might make sense to get out of today's fixed rate to get back into a floating rate scenario. Then we do the math to figure out what the swap mark is and the amortization cost is and what the benefit of increased asset sensitivity is. And we've been doing that and it's made sense to us to reduce that position. ","John McDonald","Okay. And then just on the expense outlook and efficiencies. I know you don't want to get into 2019, 2020 too much, but just maybe broader thoughts. I'm not sure if this came up before, I think it might have, but with all the tailwinds that you have in '19 and '20 is, is there any reason that directionally the 2019 expenses wouldn't be down absent a material pickup in business operations. And then maybe John, you can address that. And Tim, are you holding or Tim, is there any reason you wouldn't be holding a team to getting back that efficiency ratio middle of that range, the 55 to 59 by 2019 and further deeper into the range in 2020. Is that broadly a goal that you're going to hold folks too?","Tim Sloan","I'll pick that. That's a goal that I hold myself too as well as the senior management team. So, you're spot on there John. ","John Shrewsberry","And there is no reason, for the reasons that we've laid out, the expectation is that those incremental cost would be coming off in '19 and '20 and expenses would continue to trend lower. The caveat I guess I would give is if there was some -- several years ago we went through a period like this where we gave specific expense guidance and then there was a wild mortgage reify here with a revenue opportunity was used and expenses, direct expenses grew to reflect to take advantage of it. So, absence something like that, which we'd all be happy about if occurred, then as you say, there is no reason to believe the expenses shouldn't keep coming down based on these structural items that we're talking about that will fall off. ","John McDonald","Okay. And again, just to clarify Tim. How would you phrase the efficiency ratio goal over the next 2 to 3 years?","Tim Sloan","As we said, our expectation is to get -- by the end of this year to get down to 59 handle and then continue to make progress year after year after year. We should be within the 55% to 59%, that\u2019s a goal to get in there. And then once we are in that range, we are going to continue to make progress. We\u2019ve got to improve the efficiency of this company. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Betsy Graseck","Hi, good morning. A couple of follow-ups. One, the 53.5 to 54.5 expense target that you\u2019ve put out for this next year, what is the relative number that we are assessing that against in 2017? I know there\u2019s a lot of one-timers here. And I just wanted to get what your view on 2017 like-for-like is?","John Shrewsberry","We\u2019re not -- we don\u2019t really normalize our 2017 expenses and I think many people would obviously look to take out their larger operating losses that we experienced. But beyond that I wouldn\u2019t view much of a normalization for you just because it\u2019s a slippery slope.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. And then second question is just on liquidity. I noticed there was a couple of questions already on that. But I think if I heard you correctly, it accelerates beyond what we\u2019re generating today. Your expectation is that you might need to reset deposit rates, did I hear you right on that?","Tim Sloan","Actually, my reference there is more to the market. I don\u2019t think people appreciate how much the industry is holding the line of retail and small business deposit prices. It might be as a result of the fact that there\u2019s been a lackluster on demand. And if the economy heats up because of tax reform and everybody has got higher loan growth, then somebody is going to -- may very well begin to defend their deposit franchise in order to fund it, or to attract deposits in order to fund it. So that\u2019s more of an industry comment than a Wells Fargo comment specifically.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. If you mind giving us your view on your situation just grace the question because your LDR looks like it\u2019s around 73 or 74 so, seems like there \u2026","John Shrewsberry","I would say that we don\u2019t think that we have to do too much, although again if there\u2019s a big cyclical change that causes betas to catch up to where people might have previously imagined they should be, looking at prior cycles of rate increases, then if we\u2019re looking for a catalyst or imagining one that could cause that, one of the things that could cause it is a big pick up in loan demand, it hasn\u2019t been there. And we\u2019ve been studying deposit response as an industry without that loan demand, if you were to add loan demand, it could change things, that\u2019s my point. Your point is right, our loan-to-deposit ratio is very modest. We\u2019ve got a lot of liquidity where we are not in a position where we think we need to attract a lot of incremental deposits to fund the next $10 billion of loans. But the industry overall has -- should be thinking about whether an increase in loan demand overall changes the calculus for deposit pricing.","Tim Sloan","And Betsy just on deposit pricing for a minute, I would just also make an observation separate from John\u2019s point which I completely agree with on loan demand and the potential impact is that when I think about the interaction and the relationship that we have with consumers, it\u2019s not just about deposit pricing, it\u2019s about how much firms are expanding from a marketing standpoint which doesn\u2019t go into deposit pricing line and I think there\u2019s been a lot of discussion about that this year, that\u2019s maybe ramped up for some firms more than others. It\u2019s also about the massive investment that we\u2019ve been making in technology to improve innovation so that we\u2019re not at the margin just competing on price, we\u2019re competing upon the value of the relationship and the convenience in the service that we can provide. And we look at the pace of innovation particularly for us, I think that\u2019s been one of the drivers and some of the reasons why we\u2019ve been able to continue to attract deposits. We\u2019re providing real value to all of our customers because of the massive increase in innovation and we\u2019re going to continue to do that. So, we\u2019re not just competing on price. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead. ","Tim Sloan","Good morning. Thank you very much for those comments on CNBC this morning, my mother thinks -- you\u2019re now her favorite analyst. ","Scott Siefers","At least I am somebody's favorite analyst. Thank you, please pass along my gratitude. Tim, I guess actually John I have got a question for you. On the NII outlook for 2018, I appreciate the comments earlier on the rate outlook that\u2019s actually there. Are you still thinking kind of a low single-digit number for NII growth year-on-year is good for 2018?","John Shrewsberry","Yeah. I think it\u2019s a little earlier to fully forecast it. There is a lot going on. And we\u2019re just talking about deposit pricing and what that means that could be a huge driver of this year. It wasn\u2019t really as much of a topic last year. We\u2019re shaving some NII of the top for the -- on the tax equivalency front for our tax-exempt investments that\u2019s probably worth $400 million and some change in 2018 versus 2017. And then the loan growth and cash deployment are going to matter too. So, it is a stated goal that we\u2019re trying to grow net interest income period-over-period, year-over-year and so that\u2019s what we\u2019re vectoring towards. But, at this point may be at Investor Day it will be easier to think about the year as a whole because we will have a quarter and some change behind us. But, I wouldn\u2019t pencil in last year\u2019s growth rate this year until we get a little bit further into and we know what tax reform means and a couple of other things. ","Scott Siefers","Okay. All right. Perfect. And I think you hit my next SCE question on there as well. So, appreciate it. And then actually just on the effective tax rate guidance. When you look at sort of gap between your effective tax rate and the FTE tax rate, any noticeable change that we should expect now that tax reform is down in there?","John Shrewsberry","No, no I don\u2019t think so. And we\u2019ll probably continue to give \u2013 well we\u2019ll certainly give call out changes in our guidance on the effective tax rate overall if conditions change throughout the course of the year, it will be impacted by a couple of things. Most notably how much money we\u2019re making. But that\u2019s the number for now. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead. ","Saul Martinez","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. On the fees, on the overdraft to wide product and forgive me if I missed, but did you quantify how much that adversely impacted deposit fees in 4Q. And how much more it could linger on into the 1Q 2018 results?","Tim Sloan","So, it was $19 million in the quarter although it came in during the quarter. And so, it will be -- it will probably be more in the first quarter. And we\u2019ll see how customers adapt to that capability overtime. ","And just for anybody, who isn't familiar with the product, essentially if you overdraft payments tonight and your direct deposit hits in the morning, we don't charge you for the overdraft, it happened the night before, that's where the Rewind comes from. So, we'll see a full quarter of it in Q1, we'll call it out at the end of the quarter and make it transparent so the people can model it in. But we think it's a very useful capability to help folks who are generally speaking right at the end of the pay cycle when they have an overdraft situation and then rectify it the next day. ","Saul Martinez","Okay, that's helpful. And secondly on John, on your comments on deposit betas and the possibility of sort of maybe a non-linear type of increase in deposit betas if you start to get loan growth. Is there any way to -- I know you're probably going to say it's difficult to put numbers around it, but I'll ask anyway? If you were to see loan growth pickup and let's just say loan growth picks up to mid-single digits. Is there any way to think through the parameters about how much deposit betas can move up maybe based on history or some assumptions of consumer behavior? But is there any way to think about sort of the parameters around which you might see deposit competition and deposit betas move up in that type of scenario. ","John Shrewsberry","I don't have a silver bullet for you. But I can tell you that you could stress or model some sort of a catch up to historically normal levels, call it the 40% level. And then ask yourself, by bank who might go first and why? And as Tim mentioned, there are a lot of non-economic reasons for customers who want to maintain relationships maintain balances etcetera call it the very full service with the less full service. All of those things matter. But everybody's deposit franchise is going to look a little bit different. So, people have more core primary types of transactional account relationships and some people are funded with how their money they are seeking the highest yield at any point in time. And that's going to, it's different banks that are going to behave differently. My general guess is that within the relevant range for likely loan growth for Wells Fargo, that if we achieve the higher end of that range, and the impact on our deposit price isn't really going to be because we think that we need to go out and raise more money and jack up our deposit cost, but rather that it's happening to others and they're doing it and we respond -- and if we feel we need to we will be responding to what's happening in the market. ","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research. Please go ahead.","Nancy Bush","Hi, gentlemen. I have a couple of questions for you. And this probably falls into the last question as well. For many years, you were the lowest rate payer in the nation and you are able to maintain that through the location of branches et cetera et cetera. From a competitive standpoint and given the issues over the last couple of years, do you need to kind of get into the middle of the pack or the top? I mean how do you feel competitively, where you need to be positioned with deposit pricing in a rising rate environment. ","Tim Sloan","Yeah, Nancy it's a very fair question. I don't think our view particularly as it relates to retail consumer customers has really changed. And what you have seen in our deposit pricing so far, this year is that we're one of the lowest if not the lowest in the industry. And our expectation is that we will continue to be able to do that because of the franchise that we have, not only the physical franchise but also the digital franchise that we\u2019ve continued to invest in, based upon the innovation and the convenience that we are providing to our customers. I think when you move from traditional retail deposit customers to wealth customers, it\u2019s more competitive and you\u2019ve seen the higher weighted there and we\u2019re kind of in the middle, and that\u2019s fine with us. I think we\u2019re comfortable there. And then as you move to larger corporate customers or financial institutions and the like, it\u2019s very competitive, where your deposit days are close to 100 percentage you can get. And I think that\u2019s been pretty consistent through cycles for us as well as the rest of the industry. So that\u2019s how I would break it down.","John Shrewsberry","On the last point I would add, we\u2019ve been a little bit more active with some of the financial institution customers to get their deposits because we don\u2019t have a leverage ratio problem so we can afford to have a slightly better balance sheet. We can use the liquidity from time-to-time. So, if we weren\u2019t doing that, because that is the highest cost deposit number, we probably weighted average basis like a lower deposit cost payer. But it\u2019s really some purpose to do more business of various types with those customers by having that deposit relationship. ","Nancy Bush","Okay. And also, the follow-on I have is about branch closures. And I am sure you guys have seen the articles over the past couple of months, there was a series I think in the Wall Street Journal a few weeks ago, about how rural America is being impacted by branch closures that there are many small towns now that basically have no bank branches. And I am wondering if this is the coming of bigger regulatory issue or it\u2019s coming more on to the regulatory radar screen and do you guys anticipate that you may in the future have to not close branches that you would have closed otherwise because of their locations?","Tim Sloan","Well Nancy again it\u2019s a fair question. I think that when we look at our branch network, we included a number of factors beyond just a P&L for the branch as a likely expectation for growth or quality of customers. There is also CRA type requirements and other reasons that we want to keep branches open in certain markets. ","But to your specific question about regulatory interaction, we haven\u2019t had any increase in regulatory interaction related to a significant increase of -- regulatory interaction related to rural branches as of this point. ","John Shrewsberry","I would say there is big investment in digital capability that allows people to bank from anywhere including opening accounts, including applying for and having credit trenches [ph] including deposit taking, eases the burden doesn\u2019t completely remove it, but it makes it easier for people who live far from branches even if there is a branch there, may be 30 miles away, still be in the county. We are making it easier for people to do that from home. So, it\u2019s a better situation than it was 20 years ago or 40 years ago and that same calculus is being weighed. ","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.","Gerard Cassidy","Good morning. Can you guys share with us -- you talked about bringing this efficiency ratio down with 59 handle on by the end of the year and then further improvement in following periods. What percentage of the improvement comes from revenue versus expenses or vice versa. How much is going to come from expenses versus revenues?","Tim Sloan","Well, you can see the range that we\u2019re talking about for expenses for the year and while that\u2019s an annual number and other quarterly number. We showed some sensitivity around our 2017 on our revenue items. So, right now we\u2019re very focused on specific actions that are being taken on the expense side. And we have to make some assumptions about what\u2019s happening in the revenues estimate, what the handle range will be on efficiency later in the year. ","And very importantly, I\u2019d remind everybody that Q1 is a very -- is high for seasonal expense I think you know that, it is your business. But that\u2019s something to account for. So, John asked the question earlier about what\u2019s going to happen -- or I forgot who asked the question about NII in 2018, there is a range of estimates depending on the drivers that I mentioned similarly on the noninterest income front. We\u2019ve got a lot of things that are core and easy -- easier to forecast but there\u2019ll be other just as well. So, we\u2019re trying to grow revenue. We have control over expense and it\u2019s the expense that we\u2019re through specifically pointing to in terms of what\u2019s driving the outcome. ","Gerard Cassidy","Okay. And then in your community banking metrics in slide 24, you obviously give us good data on the digital customer\u2019s and such. And you guys have alluded to on the call about opening up new accounts and selling products through these lines and that seems to be where the industry is going and you\u2019re going. Can you share with us what kind of penetration you have whether it\u2019s credit cards or other types of consumer loan products that you\u2019re actually opening up through the online channel versus people having to come into a branch?","Tim Sloan","So, right now I\u2019d say credit card is probably the easiest one to point to. I think 43% of card originations in 2017 were digital. Now, to be fair we -- it\u2019s not so important to us what that percentage is, we want more of our customers to have our card in their wallet and if they get it digitally or they get it in-person either will work. But, 43% are trending towards half of our card openings were digitally transacted in 2017. That\u2019s an interesting metric and that\u2019s up from a very small percentage in prior years. ","Mortgage will be -- this will be the year to see to see what the trend is there as we fully roll out the digital mortgage applications, people who aren\u2019t -- including people who aren\u2019t already customers in Wells Fargo. And while we have the digital account opening process for two of the investor which is something that we\u2019ll be measuring all year and figure out how much benefit our customers and prospects drive from interacting with us in that way.","Gerard Cassidy","And just on the mortgage, when do you guys go live with that again? I knew it was this year, but is it first quarter or second quarter?","Tim Sloan","Well, it\u2019s live now for a people who are already customers of Wells Fargo. You can enter through -- I know you all are customers at Wells Fargo, you can log on to our online banking or digital banking platform you can see it there. But it will be available for all comers in the first quarter. ","Gerard Cassidy","Okay. And then just my final question in your wholesale banking side you talk about investment banking market share dropped to 3.6% versus 4.4%, the narrow scope focus. Can you give us some background or color on what you mean by what you did to the market share came down?","John Shrewsberry","Yeah. And let me give in order that\u2019s going to reflect some large deal volume could be some leverage finance volume, it could be cross boarder activity, some of which are probably higher beta for us depending on whether we get it or not. I think on an annual basis, we probably assume that we're still going to trend towards the 5% 6% plus market share range, which is where we've been recently. But I'm going to think terribly different. ","Tim Sloan","As you said to reinforce John's point. I think what we saw in fourth quarter was more leverage buyout type transactions and kind of this because of our underlying credit discipline. We tend to have a lower percent market share in those types of deals. And so that would at the margin probably have driven most of that decline. ","Tim Sloan","Again, thank you all for joining us this morning. I know it's always a busy morning the first day of earnings for the industry. I want to reiterate the fact that 2017 was a very transformational year for Wells Fargo. And I also want to emphasize the hard work, dedication and resiliency of our team members, who made the company a better bank today than it was a year ago. And again, notwithstanding the challenges that we have ahead, I'm optimistic that Wells Fargo will be a better bank a year from now. So again, thank you for your support.

Mr. Rowe, you may begin your conference.","Jim Rowe","Thank you, Regina, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf, and our CFO, John Shrewsberry will discuss first quarter results and answer your questions.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our first quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I\u2019d also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today\u2019s call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement.","Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our website.","I will now turn our call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf.","John Stumpf","Thank you, Jim. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. We earned $5.8 billion in the first quarter, which reflected the benefit of our diversified business model and our continued focus on the real economy. By building relationships with our existing customers and successfully generating new relationships during the past year, we were able to grow loans and deposits and increase our revenue. Our capital levels remained strong and we continued to focus on rewarding our shareholders by increasing our dividend and reducing our shares outstanding.","Let me highlight our growth during the quarter compared with a year ago. We generated $21.3 billion of revenue, up 3% from a year ago with growth in both net interest income and non-interest income. We had broad-based loan growth with our core loan portfolio increasing by $54.2 billion or 7%. Our deposit franchise continued to generate strong customer and balanced growth with total deposits reaching a record $1.2 trillion, up $102.1 billion or 9%, and we grew the number of primary consumer checking customers by 5.7%. Our credit performance continued to be very strong with net charge-offs down $117 million and our net charge-off ratio declined to 33 basis points.","Our financial performance resulted in strong capital generation and returning capital to our shareholders remains a priority. Our net payout ratio was 61% in the first quarter. We\u2019re extremely pleased that our 2015 capital plan allows us to increase our quarterly dividend by 7% to $0.375 per common share for the second quarter of this year, of course subject to board approval. Our ability to increase our dividend every year since 2011 demonstrates the benefits of our diversified business model and conservative risk management, as well as our disciplined capital management process.","We have over 90 different businesses that are benefiting from the continued strength in the U.S. economy. While the first quarter economic headlines again demonstrated that the economic recovery has been uneven, I believe the underlying economic expansion that is approaching its sixth anniversary remains largely on track. Interest rates remain low, homes are affordable, consumer and small business confidence remains high, and the labor market is approaching full employment after a record 54 consecutive monthly payroll gains. I\u2019m optimistic that the improving U.S. economy will continue to provide Wells Fargo with many opportunities to better serve our customers, our communities, and reward our shareholders.","John Shrewsberry, our Chief Financial Officer, will now provide more details on our first quarter results. John?","John Shrewsberry","Thanks John, and good morning everyone. My comments will follow the presentation included in the quarterly supplement, starting on Page 2. John and I will then answer your questions.","Wells Fargo had another strong quarter, earning $5.8 billion and $1.04 in EPS in the first quarter and returning net $3.3 billion of capital to shareholders. Our results were driven by average loan and deposit growth and lower expenses while we maintained our strong capital and liquidity positions. Our results also benefited from a net $359 million discrete tax benefit in the first quarter primarily from a reduction in the reserve for uncertain tax positions due to the resolution of prior period matters with U.S. federal and state taxing authorities. As a reminder, we also had a $423 million discrete tax benefit in the first quarter of last year. We take a prudent approach in accounting for our tax liability, which can result in discrete tax benefits depending on the resolution of prior period matters with taxing authorities.","Page 3 highlights our results compared with a year ago, including increased revenue and pre-tax pre-provision profit, strong loan and deposit growth, and lower share count reflecting net share repurchases.","Page 4 highlights our revenue diversification and the balance between spread and fee income in the first quarter. The benefit of the diversity of our 90-plus businesses was demonstrated by our ability to grow both net interest income and non-interest income in the first quarter compared with a year ago, which was a key driver of our performance. As I\u2019ve highlighted in the past, the drivers of our fee generation vary based on interest rates and economic conditions. For example, market-sensitive revenue, which includes trading and gains from debt and equity investments, declined 22% from a year ago, dropping from 14% to fee income to 11%. However, other businesses had strong growth and we generated higher trust and investment, card and mortgage banking fee income. With this broad-based growth, we were able to grow fee income 3% from a year ago.","Let me highlight some key drivers of our first quarter results from a balance sheet and income statement perspective, starting on Page 5. I believe our balance sheet has never been stronger. We generated core loan and deposit growth and have increased liquidity and capital to record levels. Let me take a minute to describe how we\u2019re managing in the current rate environment.","We\u2019ve been able to perform well across a variety of rate cycles over time because of the diversification of the business model. We\u2019re often asked about how we manage our interest rate risk, in particular the timing of making investments in a lower rate environment. As you might imagine, we evaluate our interest rate risk position continuously and frequently weigh options to alter the overall sensitivity of the balance sheet. We consider factors such as the expected growth in loans and deposits performance under a wide range of rate scenarios and the trade-offs between the protection from lower rates afforded by adding duration, and the consequences of those actions in higher rate scenarios. Based upon these analyses, we then make decisions about the kind of instruments we use. We can purchase securities outright or extend the duration of variable rate loans with interest rate swaps and the magnitude and profile of the duration we add. All in all, we try to balance a number of considerations and maintain flexibility as conditions evolve.","Turning to the income statement on Page 6, revenue declined from fourth quarter as net interest income was lower, reflecting two fewer days in the first quarter and lower income from variable sources; however, non-interest income grew from the fourth quarter even though the fourth quarter included a $217 million gain on the sale of government-guaranteed student loans. The growth in fee income reflected momentum across our businesses, which I\u2019ll highlight throughout the call.","As shown on Page 7, we continued to have strong broad-based loan growth in the first quarter, our 15th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Our core loan portfolio grew by $54.2 billion or 7% from a year ago, and was up $914 million from the fourth quarter. Linked quarter commercial loan growth was driven by real estate, construction and lease financing. Consumer loans grew slightly as growth in non-conforming mortgage, auto, security-based lending, and student loans was largely offset by payoffs in the junior lien portfolio and seasonality in credit cards.","On Page 8, we highlight our loan portfolios that had strong year-over-year growth. C&I loans were up $31.9 billion or 13% from a year ago, with broad-based growth across most of our wholesale businesses. Core one-to-four family first mortgage loans grew $13 billion or 7% from a year ago, reflecting continued growth in high-quality non-conforming mortgages, primarily jumbo loans. The credit quality of our core mortgage portfolio remains strong with only 7 basis points of credit losses in the first quarter.","Credit card balances were up $4 billion or 15% from a year ago, benefiting from strong new account growth and the Dillards portfolio acquisition in the fourth quarter. Auto loans were up $3.7 billion or 7% from last year. While we continued to benefit from the strong auto market, new originations were down 10% from a year ago, reflecting our continued risk and pricing discipline in a competitive market.","As you can see on Page 9, we had $1.2 trillion of average deposits in the first quarter, up $97.5 billion from a year ago and up $25 billion from fourth quarter. Our average deposit cost was 9 basis points, consistent with the fourth quarter and down 2 basis points from a year ago. We successfully grew primary consumer checking customers by 5.7% from a year ago and primary small business and business banking checking customers increased 5.5%. Our ability to consistently grow primary checking customers is important because these customers have more interactions with us, have higher cross-sell, and are more than twice as profitable as non-primary checking customers.","We grew net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis by $396 million or 4% from a year ago, reflecting strong growth in average earning assets, up $170 billion or 12%. Net interest income declined $190 million from fourth quarter due to two fewer days in the first quarter and lower variable income. The net interest margin declined 9 basis points from the fourth quarter due to strong customer-driven deposit growth. This reduced the margin by 5 basis points but had minimal impact to net interest income. Lower interest income from variable sources due to reduced loan fees and PCI loan recoveries decreased the margin by 3 basis points. Liquidity-related activity, which was not LCR-related but taken to demonstrate market access and the liquidity of our securities portfolio, reduced the margin by 1 basis point. All other balance sheet and repricing did not impact the margin in the first quarter.","Our balance sheet remained asset-sensitive and we\u2019re well positioned to benefit from higher rates. We believe we can grow net interest income in 2015 compared with 2014 even if rates remain low, as we demonstrated last year.","Total non-interest income increased $29 million from fourth quarter and grew $282 million from a year ago, up 3%. Trading gains increased $229 million from fourth quarter, primarily from higher customer accommodation trading, reflecting better markets in high grade\/high yield and RNBS, as well as seasonality. Mortgage banking revenue increased $32 million from fourth quarter on higher origination volume, up $5 billion or 11%. Fifty-five percent of originations were for refinancing, up from 40% in the fourth quarter as rates declined. We ended the quarter with a $44 billion application pipeline, the highest pipeline since the second quarter of 2013, and we expect funding volumes to increase in the second quarter given the size of the pipeline and the seasonal home buying that typically occurs during the second quarter spring buying season.","Our gain on sale ratio increased to 2.06% in the first quarter as pricing margins expanded, reflecting strong refinance volume and lenders priced to balance volumes and capacity. We currently expect the second quarter gain on sale ratio to be at the higher end of the range we\u2019ve seen over the past five quarters, 140 basis points to 206 basis points.","Servicing income declined $162 million from the fourth quarter as MSR results declined $127 million, reflecting higher prepayment expectations associated with reductions in FHA mortgage insurance premiums. This valuation adjustment directly reduced our servicing results in the quarter.","As shown on Page 12, expenses were down $140 million from the fourth quarter. Our first quarter expenses included $452 million of seasonally higher employee benefits expenses from higher payroll taxes and 401k matching, as well as $236 million for annual equity awards to retirement-eligible team members. These seasonally higher expenses were offset by lower salaries, reflecting two fewer days in the quarter, lower revenue-based incentive compensation and reduced outside professional services, equipment, travel and entertainment, and advertising expenses. While we will not have the seasonally higher personnel expenses in the second quarter, there are certain expenses that will increase, including salary expense, reflecting high day count and annual merit increases, and certain expenses that are typically lower in the first quarter, such as outside professional services and advertising expenses, are also expected to increase.","Our efficiency ratio improved to 58.8% in the first quarter, and we expect the efficiency ratio for the full year 2015 to remain within our targeted range of 55 to 59%.","Turning to our business segment, starting on Page 13, community banking earned $3.7 billion in the first quarter, down 5% from a year ago and up 7% from the fourth quarter. As I highlighted earlier, we had continued strong growth in primary consumer checking customers, up 5.7% from a year ago. Our broad-based and industry-leading distribution channels are one reason for this growth. While our customers actively use all of our channels, including more than 75% of our deposit customers visiting a banking store at least once within the last six months, mobile banking is growing the fastest. We had 14.9 million active mobile customers, up 19% from a year ago. Our customers are increasingly using this channel with mobile banking sessions up 38% in 2014, while customer usage of our stores has remained stable.","We also continue to successfully grow retail bank households. February was our highest monthly net gain of retail bank households in four years. These new households provide us with growth opportunities as we focus on meeting their financial needs through our diversified product line. An example of how we\u2019re capturing this opportunity is in our debit and credit card businesses, with card fees up 11% from a year ago. Debit card purchase volume was up 8% and credit card purchase volume increased 16% from a year ago. Our credit card business continued to have strong new account growth and active account growth.","Wholesale banking earned $1.8 billion in the first quarter, up 3% from a year ago and down 9% from fourth quarter. Loan growth continued to be strong with average loans up $35.7 billion or 12% from a year ago, with broad-based growth across many businesses. We\u2019re excited about our announcement last week regarding the purchase of $9 billion of commercial real estate mortgage loans from GE Capital. This is a portfolio of performing loans primarily in the U.S., the United Kingdom and Canada, which are active lending markets for us. We also agreed to provide $4 billion of financing to Blackstone Mortgage Trust for their purchase of a commercial mortgage portfolio. We expect these transactions to close in the second and third quarters of this year. This is an excellent example of how the combination of our balance sheet strength, the expertise of our team members and our relationship focus positions us to capture opportunities for growth, both organically and through acquisition.","While we remain disciplined in deposit pricing, we continue to benefit from strong deposit growth with average core deposits up $44.4 billion or 17% from a year ago. Wholesale banking also had broad-based fee growth, up 11% from a year ago with many of our diversified businesses growing at double digits. Investment banking fees grew 44% from a year ago, and we increased our market share to 4.9%. This growth reflected continued improvement in our equity capital markets and investment-grade originations. Treasury management revenue grew 11%, reflecting new product sales and repricing.","Wealth brokerage and retirement earned a record $561 million in first quarter, up 18% from a year ago and up 9% from fourth quarter. WBR\u2019s pre-tax margin was 24% in the first quarter, close to their long-term target of 25%. These strong results reflected 8% revenue growth from a year ago driven by 12% growth in net interest income and 8% growth in asset-based fees. The partnership between WBR and community banking has been successful, generating over $1 billion a month in closed referred investment assets. During the past year, 58% of referred assets were from new investment clients of Wells Fargo.","We\u2019re also benefiting from increasing our license to private bankers in our banking stores by 15% from a year ago. This partnership has also contributed to the growth in brokerage advisory assets, which were $435 billion, up 12% from a year ago.","WBR\u2019s strong loan growth continued, up 14% from a year ago, the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth. This growth was driven primarily by an increase in high quality non-conforming mortgage loans and security-based lending.","Turning to Page 16, credit quality in the first quarter remained strong with our net charge-off ratio declining to 33 basis points of average loans. Non-performing assets have declined for 10 consecutive quarters and were down $618 million from fourth quarter. Non-accrual loans declined $338 million and foreclosed assets declined $280 million. The reserve release was $100 million in the first quarter, down $150 million from fourth quarter and down $400 million from a year ago.","Let me update you on our energy portfolio. We had $18.5 billion of oil and gas loans at the end of the first quarter, or 2% of total loans outstanding. The size of this portfolio was relatively stable from fourth quarter, up only $65 million. Approximately 55% of our portfolio was in the exploration and production, or upstream sector. We\u2019ve been an industry leader in the energy sector for over 40 years, and we take a disciplined approach to not only underwriting but also managing these loans and relationships. Our teams constantly monitor and evaluate this portfolio on a loan-by-loan basis.","In the first quarter, we performed an even greater review of each loan in this portfolio, and in March we began the spring redetermination process for our reserve-based loans. We realized minimal credit losses related to energy loans in the first quarter and our allowance at the end of the first quarter contemplated the inherent credit losses associated with our oil and gas exposure.","Our capital levels remain strong with our estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III, using the advanced approach fully phased in at 10.53% in the first quarter. Last month, the Federal Reserve and the OCC announced that we may begin using the advanced approach\u2019s capital framework starting in the second quarter. This approval did not include stipulations requiring us to increase our current advanced approach RWA.","We returned $3.3 billion to shareholders in the first quarter through dividends and net share repurchases. Our common shares outstanding declined by 7 million shares in the first quarter, reflecting 48 million shares purchased during the quarter partially offset by 41 million shares issued, primarily through employee benefit plans which are seasonally high in the first quarter. In addition, we entered into a $750 million forward repurchase contract that settled earlier this month for 14 million shares. We expect to reduce our common shares outstanding through share repurchases throughout the remainder of the year. As John noted earlier on the call, our 2015 capital plan included a proposed increase to our second quarter dividend to $0.375 per common share, subject to board approval.","In summary, the first quarter demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model, as shown by the results we highlight on Slide 19. Through our consistent focus on serving our customers in the real economy, we have realized growth across many of our businesses that will help drive future momentum. We\u2019ve grown primary consumer checking and small business and business banking checking customers. We\u2019ve added new credit card accounts, increased debit card purchase volume, and achieved strong retail bank household growth. Mortgage originations have grown, commercial card volume has increased, and we\u2019ve grown investment banking market share. Treasury management fees have grown at a double-digit rate. We\u2019ve increased assets under management, and we have higher retail brokerage managed account assets. I\u2019m optimistic that our diversified business model will continue to generate opportunities for growth and will enable us to continue to invest in our businesses.","We will now be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","Our first question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Erika Najarian","Yes, good morning. Thank you so much for giving us a detailed rundown in terms of how you\u2019re thinking about your liquidity strategy. I also appreciate the $28.4 billion in deposit growth came from consumer and escrow, but taking a step back, of the $1.2 trillion in period-end deposits, how much would you classify as non-operational corporate? I guess we\u2019re just wondering is adopting a similar strategy as your other large bank peers on non-operating deposits, will that be able to alleviate some of the liquidity pressure on the NIM without much give-up on the LCR?","John Shrewsberry","It\u2019s a good question, and I\u2019d say the answer is we\u2019re not impacted in the same way as some of the other banks who have gone to the measures that they have announced to discourage those types of deposits. We\u2019re not constrained by the leverage ratio at this point. We\u2019re not meaningfully impacted by institutional non-operational deposits in our GSIB score, and so we\u2019re serving institutional customers and in some cases taking their deposits if it makes sense in the context of the bigger relationship, but we\u2019re not in the same position as the couple of banks who have had to go out of their way to drive down either leverage--change their leverage outcome or drive down their GSIB score.","So we will--we\u2019re thinking about those relationships in a way where we can do the most good for Wells Fargo shareholders, so if other people are charging more or are consolidating business activity to be willing to take those deposits, there\u2019s an opportunity for us to improve our business with those same types of customers, but it\u2019s not quite as urgent because we don\u2019t have those problems.","Erika Najarian","I guess a better way to think about it is a lot of this excess deposit growth is going to be positive for your LCR and NSFR, given that it looks like it\u2019s mostly retail, so low outflow, high ASF factor type of deposits.","John Stumpf","That\u2019s correct. And Erika, the other thing that I know you\u2019re aware of, we love the entire relationships, so surely on the retail side but it\u2019s even true on the wholesale side. When we become the primary account holder, or think of it as a financial partner with a customer and deposits lead with that, good things happen. So that\u2019s all part of serving customers broadly and deeply.","Erika Najarian","Just as a follow-up, then I\u2019ll step back, you\u2019ve been very consistent in terms of falling in that 55 to 59% efficiency ratio range, and you\u2019re consistent in terms of your forward guidance. Again, given some of the other large bank guidance in efficiency out there, will it take rates for Wells Fargo to move further down to the 55% portion of that range?","John Shrewsberry","Well, that would be one way to do it. An increase in rates, which would have an increase in revenue without a lot of associated expense, would do that. There are other ways to move a little bit lower in the range, depending on the mix of where revenue comes from and the initiatives that we have to manage expenses. But we\u2019re comfortable in the range, we\u2019re at the higher end of the range today, which is still an industry-leading level, and these other folks who are enacting their efficiency plans are coming towards us so we\u2019re going to keep doing what we\u2019re doing.","John Stumpf","But we\u2019re not standing still. We watch every expense around here as we repurpose dollars we save into things that we have to invest in.","Erika Najarian","Got it. Thank you for taking my questions.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Bill Carcache","Thank you, good morning. Can you put into context for us whether the investment opportunities that you discussed that you see before you at the moment are--do you see them as growing, or are they getting harder to identify as you look ahead at, say, the next 12 months versus the last 12 months? Then relating to these investment opportunities, how should we be thinking about the trajectory of your payout ratio longer term? As you generate more capital going forward, is it fair just to view your payout ratio as being inversely related to your investment opportunities? I guess I\u2019m asking from the perspective of kind of general overall view that higher payout ratios are better, but I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s really how we should be thinking about it for Wells Fargo, given that your capital position is already largely optimized and you\u2019re not sitting on a lot of excess capital at the moment, so whether or not we should be thinking about that.","John Shrewsberry","So by investment opportunities, are you referring to our deployment of liquidity, or are you referring to, like the GE Capital case, where we\u2019re buying a portfolio of loans with customers?","Bill Carcache","I think the GE Capital case, any other RWA growth for attractive return generation.","John Shrewsberry","So serving our customers and deploying our capital in that way is the first call on our capital. We\u2019re trying to grow earning assets with customers with cross-sell benefit and create new and bigger relationships with customers that we have. So certainly a certain amount of that factored into our capital plan, so that we are imagining doing that while returning capital to shareholders at a high level; but if the landscape were to shift so that the opportunity became more meaningful for us to originate more assets and in some cases acquire more assets that are good for us, then I think we\u2019d be looking long and hard at that.","John Stumpf","As far as the return on capital to shareholders, I think our record speaks for itself, and I know John mentioned it in his comments that we very much appreciate investment our shareholders have made in us and that we\u2019re stewards of their capital, and returning as much of that as is prudent is what we plan on doing and want to do. There is no reason for us just to keep adding capital. On the other hand, first call is to grow the business, as John mentioned, and we will return as much, as I mentioned, as we prudently can, as you just saw recently with our increase in our dividend, or at least the ability to increase the dividend.","John Shrewsberry","And the trick, of course, is to only take advantage of investment opportunities that are capable of generating the kind of return on equity that we\u2019ve been generating, and to keep distributions up to keep our capital level at the point - you use the term optimized - so that we\u2019re not carrying excess capital that\u2019s harder to produce that return on. That\u2019s the balance.","Bill Carcache","That\u2019s very helpful. My last question is on the dynamic that we\u2019re seeing with loan growth outpacing deposit growth across the banking system as a whole, but for the larger banks, including Wells Fargo, I guess we\u2019re still seeing deposit growth outpacing loan growth. I was hoping that you could just talk about what you think may be driving that, and do you see anything on the horizon that you think could change that; in other words, just lead to loan growth outpacing deposit growth at the large banks as well.","John Shrewsberry","Well, I think every large bank has a slightly different business mix, and so whatever accounts for their loan growth is going to be unique to them. In our case, because we\u2019ve done such a good job at attracting retail households and attracting wholesale relationships that are bringing meaningful liquidity in, deposit growth has been outpacing loan growth for some time, and it would take a big move in loan growth - which could include utilization of existing credit facilities or incremental funded loans - in order to catch up with that. It would have to be in a higher economic growth environment, I think, for loan growth to get into the 9% range, which is where deposits have been.","Now, if we\u2019re buying portfolios of loans like we are in the next couple of quarters, that will certainly have an impact on that, but that\u2019s not probably something that you would project into the future at that same pace. So I don\u2019t see that turning around in the near term.","John Stumpf","In fact, these are some of the strongest deposit growth years I\u2019ve seen in my 30-some years with the company, and I think it\u2019s partly because of the way we work together as a company, our distribution, the convenience we provide for customers, our focus on this. So it\u2019s been very strong, and all signs are that we\u2019ll continue to have a very strong deposit growth profile.","John Shrewsberry","And at 9 basis points, it\u2019s not as though we\u2019re overpaying.","John Stumpf","No, exactly.","Bill Carcache","That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you for taking my questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","John McDonald","Hi, good morning. John, we wanted to just go back to the efficiency ratio. Is it reasonable to expect as long as rates stay low and credit is as good as it is right now, you\u2019re likely to stay at the upper end of your targeted range? I think John Shrewsberry, you said last call you\u2019d be okay staying at the higher end of the--you know, in this kind of environment. Is there any expenses that are kind of still cyclically elevated? Maybe just give a little more color there.","John Shrewsberry","Yes, we\u2019re continuing to--we\u2019re always looking for ways to be, as John said, as efficiency as we can and to make the most of every dollar we spend. At the same time, now is the time when there are big demands in information security and compliance and risk management, and so if we\u2019re finding dollars on the efficiency side of the ledger, we\u2019re reinvesting them either in products and services for our customers or in becoming best-in-class across all risk management aspects. So that\u2019s probably going to keep us here at the higher end of the range, unless we have a breakout in some revenue category or we have an increase in rates, which is fine. At 58, 59%, it\u2019s still an attractive level to be performing at, and we\u2019re improving our company every day.","John McDonald","Okay, and on TLAC, John, is there some thoughts that you could share in terms of preparing for TLAC? The rules, obviously, aren\u2019t finished yet, but are you taking steps to prepare for your assessment of the most likely proposal that you\u2019d see on that front?","John Shrewsberry","Sure, so we\u2019ve got a variety of analyses of most likely or best case\/worst case, and they look a lot like what\u2019s out there in the public domain. We\u2019re going to end up issuing more term debt during the phase-in period, and we\u2019ll probably start in the relatively near term to leg into it so that we don\u2019t end up with an enormous overhang that has to be issued in a short amount of time. There\u2019s still a lot to know--oh, go ahead?","John McDonald","Oh no, sorry, I was going to say is it preferred as well? If you could just kind of weigh in on preferreds relative to where you think you might need to be.","John Shrewsberry","Yeah, well there\u2019s a little bit of preferred left to leg into our capital plan, but not much. And of course, there might be more if there\u2019s RWA growth and the whole capital stack expands pro rata. I think we\u2019re at 149 basis points of preferred today, and our target is 150, so we\u2019re pretty close there. But if we grow RWA, then there\u2019s an opportunity for more of that.","The big job to do is going to be on the senior unsecured side, and so we need to know what the total quantum is as a result of where we end up in the 16 to 20 range as a base. We need to know what\u2019s included and excluded, and there\u2019s still things on that list that are being resolved both in the international and domestic standard. And then, we need to know the exact phase-in period, which we think we know.","So when you look at those calculations with what we have maturing or otherwise running off, and then as I mentioned growth in RWA, that will lead us to what our annual issuance has to be to get there on time when the rule is final.","John McDonald","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ken Usdin","Hi, good morning. John, I was wondering if you could provide any color to help us understand on the new loan purchases, is there any way to put in context either the yield of the portfolio relative to the existing yield of the Wells Fargo book, and do you bring over expenses with it or is it largely just interest income coming over, as has happened in your prior acquisitions of loan books?","John Shrewsberry","So the yield on the portfolio looks a lot like our commercial real estate portfolio today, because the loans look a lot like our commercial real estate loan portfolio today, and it\u2019s not coming over with material expense. I think we probably will have to add some small number of incremental people, but as you know, we\u2019re the largest commercial real estate lender in the U.S. today and we\u2019ve got a big, seasoned team all over the country that\u2019s close to borrowers and close to properties. That\u2019s the core team that will be managing the portfolio. If we\u2019re adding people, it\u2019s in the tens or maybe dozens of incremental professionals in order to help with asset management, but not a big number in the context of the size of the portfolio.","Ken Usdin","Okay. Then as a follow-up, with regard to potential other portfolios that GE had talked about, given your positioning in terms of helping them through the structure, as you mentioned, do you guys get a different look or have you already taken a look at other parts of the book and this is just the first tranche of what could be more, or what\u2019s your general perception of the opportunity set that could come forth for Wells Fargo?","John Stumpf","They're a great customer, and we\u2019re trying to continue to help them and work together like we did here. They mentioned in their announcement that there is more to do, and we\u2019ll go through in any way that we can be helpful to them in ways that our good for our shareholders as well. So there is opportunity there - I can\u2019t really be specific about it because there are competitive processes at work, and this is their balance sheet, after all. But we will definitely be working closely together to see if there are other ways that we can help them.","Ken Usdin","Okay. One follow-up on your credit comments. Understanding that energy is baked into this quarter and that you still net release reserves, can you just kind of give us the pushes and pulls within the credit buckets in terms of how much more improvement do you continue to see on the rest of the book, ex-the energy side, or have we really just kind of gotten to the end of the natural improvement?","John Shrewsberry","Well, there is still meaningful improvement in first mortgage in particular. You\u2019ve seen charge-offs - they continue to come down, NPLs are down. The portfolio is performing very, very well, so as a result, there was room to take stock of what we think the issues are with the energy portfolio and end up with a net reserve release - a modest one, but a net reserve release. So it\u2019s quarter by quarter, we\u2019ll look at it at the end of the second quarter and see what the numbers tell us, but things do continue to improve.","John Stumpf","But Ken, I think we should also add that while there is still more improvement to be had on residential, on the other hand our commercial side has been close to or even in a recovery position. That won\u2019t last forever, so there is always pushes and pulls here, but overall credit is really, really doing well here. That\u2019s an industry phenomenon, but especially here at Wells.","Ken Usdin","Understood. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners. Please go ahead.","Scott Siefers","Morning guys. Just a couple of quick questions. So John, the tax rate has kind of bumped around, and this quarter obviously you had the discrete issue that you called out. What\u2019s the appropriate FTE tax rate to use going forward?","John Shrewsberry","The best way to think about the remainder of the year tax rate is to take the $359 million discrete tax benefit out of the first quarter and then recalculate the tax rate, which would get you to the mid-32s.","Scott Siefers","Yes, exactly. Okay, thank you. Then the other one - when you had been talking about the mobile growth, you had noted also that branch use has not been declining. From your perspective, who is coming in and what kind of stuff are they doing, and as you look at overall branch traffic and use and the need for branches, is it a good thing that people are still coming in, in that it makes for an easier, more direct cross-sell, or is it more of a negative in that you have to make mobile investments but you can\u2019t really leverage via fewer branches necessarily, or as much branch reduction as you might hope. How do you think about that dynamic?","John Stumpf","Yes, here\u2019s how we think about that. We start out with a customer, and customers tell us branches are important. We hear that every day, and while our other channels are growing - in fact, if you think about the 12,000 consumer interactions we have a minute in this company, 80% or so are what I would call digitally supported, either let\u2019s say online or mobile, and mobile being our fastest growing. But our stores, our 6,200 stores are still busy. Seventy-five percent of our customers come into a store once every six months, even millennials or our most advanced on the digital side visit our stores, visit ATMs. But 85% of our growth sales happen there, providing solutions, so it doesn\u2019t mean we have to build 5,000 or 6,000 square foot stores.","As you probably know and we\u2019ve talked in the past, we\u2019ve tried some different concepts where we have 1,000 square foot stores that at night become an ATM vestibule and in the daytime the walls fold in and it becomes a full functioning, digitally-enabled store. We\u2019re doing that kind of thing, but our most loyal customer today is not necessarily the one who has the most products, it\u2019s the customer who does the most things with us, uses the most channels most often. So there is a--and we\u2019re increasingly becoming an information provider. We\u2019re in the information business as much as on the retail we\u2019re in the financial services business, so this is really about connecting all the channels, not about trying to drive customers into what\u2019s cheaper for us. That\u2019s not how we think about that. We think about what\u2019s best for them, and branches still remain an enormously important part in that.","Scott Siefers","Okay, that\u2019s good color. I appreciate it. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Joe Morford","Good morning, guys. I guess first, compared to the fourth quarter the commercial loan growth was a little slower outside of real estate construction. Was some of that seasonal, or were there other factors in play there? And just in general, how do you feel about the current levels of demand on the commercial side?","John Shrewsberry","So the big Q4 to Q1 change is that we closed the sale of the student loan portfolio in Q4, which created a big C&I loan that happened toward the end of the quarter, so the step-up there was from a pretty elevated place. That has an impact in the calculation. I think in the first quarter, we feel good. Pipelines look pretty good. We\u2019ve talked to the leadership of the business and people are active, so from one quarter to the next, tough to tell. The year-over-year trend in C&I loans is really, really healthy, and then that step-up calculation is a little disadvantageous just to the math, but business is good.","Joe Morford","Okay. The other question was just curious what your early read is on the spring selling season this year, and are you starting to see any signs of a return of the first-time home buyer?","John Stumpf","Well Joe, since we\u2019re a big retail originator, that\u2019s obviously a big opportunity for us. Your question would suggest that the first-time home buyer had been a bit absent in this recovery compared to what it\u2019s been in previous recoveries, but I think some of the work that the industry did along with the GSCs in understanding put-back risk and transfer of risk makes credit a little bit more available. There is a little bit more activity going on, wage increases and increases in employment, that have been helpful. Affordability is really--you know, it\u2019s a good time to buy a home, so you never know. We\u2019re hopeful - we\u2019re going into the quarter with the highest pipeline - $44 billion - that we\u2019ve had in a couple years, so we\u2019re well positioned and we\u2019ll have to see what the numbers show, but we\u2019re running on faith here.","Joe Morford","Sounds good. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Mike Mayo","Hi, can you hear me?","John Stumpf","Yeah, hi Mike. Good morning.","Mike Mayo","Hey. Can you talk a little bit more in the housing backlog? How does it look by region, and what are the areas of strength?","John Shrewsberry","It\u2019s hard to say. It would be--the mortgage business that we\u2019re looking at right now, we\u2019re talking about national statistics. I guess obviously when we\u2019re talking about affordability and particularly for first-time home buyers or people who are most likely to benefit from the easing of the credit box that John just referred to, they probably would have the hardest time in the hottest markets, which - no surprise - are coastal markets and big cities, sitting here in San Francisco and many of you in New York. So things are more affordable in the middle of the country. That wouldn\u2019t come as any surprise. Most of what we\u2019re referring to is the national pipeline and statistics, and as far as I can tell, the production is pretty balanced from our various mortgage offices.","John Stumpf","Mike, just a couple things that you probably already know, as John mentioned, there are certain markets where the biggest challenge for housing is lack of inventory. Still, the entire Bay Area is a bid market where you bid for houses, you--I mean, my daughter and son-in-law bought a house recently. You have to write a letter and tell them how nice you are and how many children you have. A nice letter plus a lot of money will get you in the bidding process. That\u2019s not true, of course, everywhere, but I was in Miami recently and that market, it\u2019s stunning how that market is really doing so well. You would have looked back six years ago and you couldn\u2019t imagine what\u2019s going on today.","So it just depends, and it\u2019s a bit about what\u2019s happening in those local economies. In the Bay Area, of course, what\u2019s happening in migration technology and so forth has really created a lot of activity here. So it\u2019s a bit of a mixed bag, but all in all, we\u2019re optimistic about the second quarter here.","Mike Mayo","Right, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Paul Miller","Yes, thank you very much. You talk very positively about your mobile banking, your online banking, which I think everybody is having that same trend, but I know you\u2019ve opened a couple express branches, or whatever you want to call them, in the Washington DC area. How are they working out? Are you planning to expand those types of branches?","John Stumpf","Yes, we have--the first one there was NoMa - north of Massachusetts, and we had a second. Now we\u2019re doing a couple others in other markets, but I don\u2019t want to suggest for a minute that you\u2019ll see 6,200 NoMa\u2019s with 1,000 square feet across the franchise. I think it\u2019s a bit of everything, meaning that there is some hub and spoke where you have a larger established branch or store that\u2019s been there for many years, and then you have others around that maybe wouldn\u2019t be as large. You have some like the case in north of Massachusetts where you couldn\u2019t get 5,000 square feet, and 1,000 square feet is optimal for that market.","So this is really about looking at our distribution, and what we call actually health of your distribution - are you in the right location with the right hours, the right people, the right footprint, and does the store or the branch work in concert with all the other channels of distribution so customers can start transactions one place, finish another place. Is there ubiquity, is there one version of the truth around information, and how customers serve themselves or want service from us.","So it\u2019s a whole bunch of things that really matter in this, and I think the proof in the pudding is our ability to grow primary checking accounts. I\u2019ve never seen growth of 5.7%, and like John mentioned, it\u2019s not that we overpay on deposits - 9 basis points. I mean, this is the magic of how this thing all works together.","Paul Miller","And also over by NoMa, you also opened up one in a Safeway--I think it was a Safeway out there. I know a lot of people are moving away from supermarket banking. I don\u2019t think you are a big player in that area, but is that working out also?","John Stumpf","Yeah, at one time--this goes back a number of years. In 1998 when the former Norwest, the side of the family I came from, and Wells merged, Wells was hugely indexed - over-indexed to grocery stores. We\u2019ve been adjusting that since that time, but again we think of it density within a market, and sometimes to fill out that density it\u2019s a freestanding ATM machine, sometimes it\u2019s in-store, sometimes it\u2019s a NoMa 1,000 square foot, so it all fits into what we call the S-curve.","Maybe I\u2019ll just digress for a second. If a community has, let\u2019s say, 500 banking locations, that\u2019s optimal for a community, and you have 20% of those - 100, and that\u2019s the optimal amount, you\u2019ll actually get more than 20% of the business. You\u2019ll get 25% of the business because certain competitors will have 10% of the stores and they\u2019ll get 8% of the business. So there is a magic to the density and where the density is and how it works together, and that\u2019s just part of our learnings after many, many years. So sometimes grocery stores fit into that, sometimes they don\u2019t. It surely would not be a lead-only strategy, but as an augment, it\u2019s very powerful.","Paul Miller","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research LLC. Please go ahead.","Nancy Bush","Good morning, guys. How are you?","John Stumpf","Nancy, hi.","Nancy Bush","I have a question for you, John S - Stumpf.","John Stumpf","Yeah, there\u2019s two John S\u2019s around here!","Nancy Bush","John S. doesn\u2019t go anymore. There have been several articles recently, one a couple of days ago, I think maybe in the Wall Street Journal or somewhere, about the changing risk profile at Wells Fargo. They look at increased percentage of revenues coming from investment banking and assign a risk premium to that. Could you just address the whole issue, and just frame out for us how big you want investment banking and\/or capital markets activities to be there?","John Stumpf","Yes, it\u2019s a good question. We think of customers--and Nancy, I\u2019ll get to the specific question, but the way we think about business here is around relationships, relationships with team members. My 11 direct reports have 28 years with the company. We think of relationships with our customers, our communities, our shareholders. Buffett\u2019s been an owner of ours for 25 years. We love long-term things, so as it gets to investment banking activities, we think of that as another solution, another product, another service. Most of the revenue that comes from that business is from existing customers who have been doing business for a long, long time. When you are the number one middle market bank, when you have leadership positions in energy and ag and commercial real estate, and you do business with 80-plus or 90% of the Fortune 500, you\u2019re going to get opportunities to serve customers deeply and broadly. If that means that through our skills and our people and our value proposition that customers, corporate customers want us to help them with valuation, issuing debt, issuing equity - wonderful. If we\u2019re not good enough to get that and they go someplace else, we just have to work harder.","So I don\u2019t really look at lead tables. I guess I read where--in fact, I read for the first time when I read the Journal that we were number seven or eight or nine - I can\u2019t remember the number it was. I could have cared less, absolutely cared less. I only care that we do the right thing for customers, and if that means that we\u2019re moving up - terrific. If that means that others are growing faster because they\u2019re taking risks or doing things that don\u2019t make sense to us, God bless them. So that\u2019s how we think about it, not as a standalone business, as one more way to help customers succeed.","Nancy Bush","So I guess that\u2019s sort of it may or may not grow.","John Stumpf","Exactly. Just based on our skills and the market availability.","John Shrewsberry","Nancy, a couple of data points I\u2019d give you, just to help you dimension it. If you look at Wells Fargo compared to the peer group on the risks that we run, that we report in our 10-Qs and 10-K, we\u2019ve got a more modest set of trading businesses with a very low risk profile, at least as measured by VAR, which is the popular public version of that. Our investment banking fees, while we\u2019re thrilled and happy to have them, amount to a couple billion dollars a year, something like that, on a $90 billion revenue base. I think this quarter we were in the $420 million, $430 million range for trading revenue, which is appropriate for the needs that we have, for customer accommodation, and for managing our own risks. But still, in the scheme of a $1.7 trillion balance sheet, the equity that we carry, and $90 billion worth of revenue, it\u2019s just another one of or a couple of the 90-plus businesses that we refer to, and it\u2019s not imagined to grow in an outsized way from where it is today.","We\u2019re always trying to do more, serve customers better. We have great people, but if we--imagine we doubled the size of the business over some period of time while the firm grew at it steady organic rate. We\u2019d still be in a relatively modest percentage of the overall firm.","John Stumpf","And Nancy, the risk really would be if you ever saw where the market is shrinking, let\u2019s say in investment banking or capital markets, and we\u2019re outsized growing because we\u2019re taking on risks with customer relationships that we had not known, that\u2019s where you see the imbalance. That\u2019s, again, just not who we are.","Nancy Bush","Okay. Second question for John No. 2, in mortgage banking, if you could just repeat what you said about gain on sale. I was writing as fast as I could, but I missed the number. And where do you expect it to be in the second quarter?","John Shrewsberry","Yes, so the first quarter was at about 2%, a little more - 2.06%, which is the high end of the five-quarter range, and the second quarter is operating in that neighborhood, so we feel like we\u2019re going to be at the high end of the range in the second quarter as well.","John Stumpf","There\u2019s a lot more discipline this time around, Nancy, with gain on sale margins, as you well know because you\u2019ve seen this industry over a long time, so--and that\u2019s a healthy thing.","Nancy Bush","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Morning. Just a follow-up on the mortgage competitive landscape here. It\u2019s interesting - we saw JP Morgan out earlier today with a big increase in correspondent originations versus a year ago. I think maybe you\u2019ve been a little more consistent in that business, so it\u2019s just some ebbs and flows. If you could just remind us on the correspondent and maybe talk about the mix that you\u2019re going after right now.","John Shrewsberry","Yeah, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a mix of going after as much as a mix of what\u2019s coming in. We\u2019ve been very consistent, as you said. What happens when rates pop down and refis spike up is that our own servicing portfolio results in a lot more applications because the easiest thing for somebody to do when they want to take advantage of a rate rally is call Wells Fargo, because we probably already have their mortgage. So that\u2019s going to have a bigger influence on a strategy that we might have around correspondent, and I think you can see in the supplement that retail was $28 billion and correspondent $20 billion of this quarter\u2019s activity. That\u2019s not an inconsistent blend versus the last several quarters.","There are more correspondents these days, as you know, that go direct to the agencies because the agencies have opened the window to them, and that\u2019s also a lower margin business for us, so all things being equal, we\u2019re happy to be a retail lender but we do serve a big correspondent constituency.","John Stumpf","And Matt, if you go back in time, we actually had a larger share of the correspondent because there was a number of competitors who backed away, walked away from that market, who come and go from time to time. So that will ebb and flow as participants either stay in or get out, or whatever.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Then to circle back on expenses, I guess I\u2019m focused on, call it the people cost - the salaries, commissions, incentive comp, employee benefits. If you sum those three lines, it's up, I think, 6, 7% versus a year ago. I know there\u2019s the trading nuance that we need to adjust for, but is there some impact of the mortgage pipeline impact on those numbers as you staff up in anticipation of higher volume? I\u2019m trying to reconcile why that growth might be so much versus revenue in some of the categories in fees.","John Shrewsberry","Yes, I wouldn\u2019t look towards mortgage. I would look towards risk management and investments that we\u2019re making along those lines. The beauty about mortgage in the first quarter was that this refi pipeline helps use the capacity that we would have needed in the fourth quarter and we anticipate needing in the second quarter, so it was a greater level of utilization. For better or for worse, the changes in year-over-year are a variety of other things, including business mix, by the way, in terms of how commissions get paid and other revenue-related incentives. But it would be that plus investments made in compliance and risk management, cyber and information security, things like that. Those are--we have the best people and those are not inexpensive.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Any way to size that, either on an absolute basis or versus, say, a year ago, just that overall bucket of, call it non-revenue related cost?","John Shrewsberry","I don\u2019t have an accurate number. I think we\u2019ve talked about $100 million a quarter, a couple quarters ago as having been an observable increase in that category, and it\u2019s not any lower than that today. Maybe we\u2019ll see if next time around we can put a finer point on that.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay. All right, thank you very much.","Operator","Again, that is star, one for any questions. Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","Eric Wasserstrom","Thanks very much. John, just to follow up on your energy-related comments, and I appreciate the detail you provided, but can you just clarify - was there in fact any increase in general or specific reserves for that portfolio or any downward migration in internal risk ratings, or anything of that nature?","John Shrewsberry","There was a little bit of downward migration, not enough to meaningfully drive the reserve. There was a little bit of an increase in NPAs, but negligible, and we realized minimal losses in the quarter in the energy portfolio.","Eric Wasserstrom","Okay.","John Shrewsberry","But the change in reserve reflects all of the actual migration, the actual observation of performance in the energy portfolio.","Eric Wasserstrom","Understood. One of the other institutions indicated that based on the forward price curve, they would expect some of the pressure on the E&P sector [indiscernible].","John Shrewsberry","I\u2019d have to say yes. I mean, we\u2019re in the middle of our spring redetermination process for the borrowing base loans, so we\u2019ll have a better feeling afterwards. We have noticed a lot of capital raising going on in the space. We talked last quarter about the risk to our investment banking income around energy-related firms, because we\u2019re large in that space, and we had a great first quarter in energy investment banking because lots of equity was raised, lots of firms went to the debt market to turn themselves out. So that\u2019s a very positive sign - there\u2019s people taking steps and changing their balance sheets and improving their risk profile, so that and the combination of where the forward curve demonstrates that energy prices might be going is helpful. But again, that\u2019s reflected in our early view of our allowance and it will be better informed once we finish our borrowing base redeterminations.","Eric Wasserstrom","And typically when is that?","John Shrewsberry","During this quarter.","Eric Wasserstrom","Great, thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.","Marty Mosby","Thank you. I want to drill into the mortgage banking a little bit more, in that when we managed ours and we had this recognition of origination at close and not interest rate locked, whenever prepayments kicked in, servicing income was compressed as you had to write down the servicing for the expected prepayments, but origination income wasn\u2019t at its full run with refi. So in my mind, I was just trying to look at this first quarter as kind of the launching pad going into much stronger, and not to quantify that, but just a stronger return of revenues on mortgage from that timing effect.","John Shrewsberry","Actually, I think that\u2019s a pretty astute observation, because we would be valuing the MSR on prepayment expectations, which reflect that lower interest rate, and we haven\u2019t taken the gain on the pipeline and what\u2019s locked and slated to close in the second quarter.","Marty Mosby","Two follow-ups to that thought process. Seventy-one basis points on the servicing portfolio has to be close to an all-time low. Are we getting to the point that even with prepayments, we wouldn\u2019t need much more revaluation given you\u2019ve already incorporated a lot of the expected prepayments into the current valuation?","John Shrewsberry","It\u2019s a good observation, but it\u2019s tough to say. We look at that calculation regularly, but in connection with our preparation of our financial statements on a quarterly basis, and take everything into account that\u2019s available then, and that\u2019s when we strike the value.","Marty Mosby","Then lastly when you convert your unclosed pipeline of $44 billion into what would be a normal pull-through into originations in the next quarter, I get to something like $75 billion to $80 billion. Does that seem about right in the sense that that\u2019s the kind of run rate you\u2019re getting into at this point?","John Shrewsberry","Tough to know. We don\u2019t know what hasn\u2019t happened yet, and that\u2019s what\u2019s going to--the applications that will be received and pulled through in the quarter, so too early to speculate.","Marty Mosby","The good thing is that half of it is already done in the unclosed pipeline, so you at least know that part.","John Shrewsberry","That\u2019s right.","Marty Mosby","All right, thank you.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","John Pancari","Thanks for taking my questions. A quick question on the margin. I wanted to get some color on the 13 basis point decline in commercial loan yields. I know you indicated that was partly impacted by fees. Did lower loan fees account for all of that, or how much of it was downward pressure on yields from pricing pressure?","John Shrewsberry","It\u2019s more PCI loan recoveries and lower loan fees than competitive pricing pressure. Those things that we call the variable components of interest income are harder to predict, and when a loan gets resolved that\u2019s been sitting in workout, sometime it comes through the margin line, and then if a loan prepays or there is loan fee hung up in its carrying value, then that sometimes comes through interest income as well. It\u2019s those types of items that are tough to plan for, tough to budget, and in this particular quarter were lower than in prior quarters.","John Pancari","Okay, and then how does that play into your margin outlook? Is it fair to assume still mid-single digit basis point compression per quarter as we move through \u201915?","John Shrewsberry","It\u2019s too tough to call, because it depends on what happens with deposit growth, it depends on what happens with loan growth, and then other investments that we make in the securities portfolio. That\u2019s what\u2019s going to drive it. It\u2019s led by what happens to deposit growth, and of course if there were a move in interest rates, that would have an impact as well. We\u2019re not trying to forecast it in this instance.","John Pancari","Okay, all right.","John Stumpf","Yeah, our real focus is on generating growth in net interest income, and the margin is more the result, not the reason.","John Pancari","Right, okay. Then on that front, John, if you could just talk a little bit about loan growth expectations. I know you gave some good color on what you\u2019re seeing on C&I, but CRE, you saw still declines in your total CRE book. I want to get some thoughts around a sustained inflection in that portfolio organically, and then is it also fair to assume that the loan growth overall should remain in the mid-single digit range at this point?","John Shrewsberry","Tough to call, because it depends on the mix. We\u2019ve got a variety of commercial and consumer asset types here that each have their own market and cyclical dynamics. I think we expect cards were probably at a seasonal low in the first quarter, so between seasonality and issuing new cards, that business probably grows. Auto, we\u2019ve kept--it\u2019s grown but kept relatively stable. It\u2019s gotten to be a more competitive market, and we\u2019ve picked our spots, I think, a little bit more delicately. In commercial real estate, it\u2019s going to be tough to spot the organic component of it because the purchase of the GE portfolio and this incremental loan to Blackstone Mortgage Trust is going to have a big impact in the second and third quarters.","But if I\u2019d add anything to that, it\u2019s that now the competitive dynamic in commercial real estate lending is a little bit different because a big competition is exiting the business. That probably means something for us organically, if that\u2019s helpful.","John Pancari","Okay, thank you. My last question is just on the credit side. The oil and gas reserve post what you did this quarter, can you quantify where that reserve stands right now?","John Shrewsberry","You know, we don\u2019t call it out specifically. We capture the whole portfolio in our overall allowance for loan losses and feel that that is absolutely adequate for the loan book that we have, which incidentally has never been better overall. Oil and gas loans are approximately 2% of the total portfolio.","John Pancari","Right. Okay, thanks again for taking my questions.","John Stumpf","Okay, this concludes our call, so thanks. I especially want to thank you to all 265,000 team members for a very, very good first quarter, and thanks for all of you on the line. We will see you next quarter. Bye bye.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for participating.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like turn the call over to Jim Rowe, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Rowe, you may begin your conference.","Jim Rowe","Thank you, Regina, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today during which our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf; and our CFO, Tim Sloan, will review first quarter results and answer your questions. ","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our first quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our website at wellsfargo.com. ","I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf.","John G. Stumpf","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Our outstanding results for the first quarter demonstrate the strength of our franchise and the benefit of our diversified business model. Our ability to meet our customers' financial needs throughout our geographic footprint and broadly diversified businesses is clearly reflected in our results. ","Let me quickly review some of the highlights of the first quarter. We grew revenue to $21.6 billion, up 6% from a year ago. We generated net income after tax up 13% and EPS up 12% from a year ago. Pretax preprovisioned profits increased 14% from a year ago. We had positive operating leverage and our efficiency -- expense efficiency ratio improved by 250 basis points from a year ago. We grew our retail banking cross-sell ratio to a record 5.98 products per household. Credit quality continued to improve with our charge-off ratio declining to 1.25%, the lowest level since 2007. Our profitability ratios reflect these strong results with our return on assets growing to 1.31%, up 8 basis points from a year ago, the highest it's been in 4 years. Our return on equity increased to 12.14%, up 16 basis points from just a year ago. ","We continued to grow capital with our estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio under Basel III increasing to 7.81%. We are extremely pleased that during the first quarter, we were able to reward our shareholders by increasing our dividend for the second consecutive year with an 83% increase to $0.22 per share, per quarter. ","Wells Fargo's performance has benefited from our diversified business model and the improvements in the economy. We remain focused on our commitment to do all we can to help customers and the overall economy. We are helping homeowners stay in their homes with over 740,000 active trial or completed mortgage modifications since the beginning of 2009. We've also helped nearly 5.6 million customers secure new low-rate loans for home purchases or refinancing since the beginning of 2009. ","In the first quarter, we successfully completed integrating the largest and most complex bank merger in our nation's history. It took us 3 years, but we did it the right way, on time and under budget. We believe our strong results this quarter are just the beginning of our ability to capitalize on all of the tremendous growth opportunities ahead of us as we move forward as One Wells Fargo, serving our 70 million customers coast-to-coast. ","Now Tim, our CFO, will provide more details on our financial results.","Timothy J. Sloan","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. My remarks will follow the presentation included in the first half of the quarterly supplement starting on Page 2, and then John and I will take your questions. ","As John highlighted, we achieved very strong first quarter results with record earnings of $4.2 billion, up 3% from the fourth quarter and up 13% from a year ago. Earnings per share were a record $0.75, up 3% from last quarter and 12% from a year ago. This is our ninth consecutive quarter of EPS growth. That's real consistency. ","Our ability to grow our bottom line consistently during a time when the industry has faced many challenges reflects the underlying strength and the benefit of our diversified business model. This quarter was no different. As Slide 3 shows, we have a diversified loan portfolio, balanced spread and fee income and our sources of noninterest income are well diversified. ","Let me start by highlighting some of the key drivers of our results this quarter, and I'll add more detail later in my remarks. While total loans declined this quarter, our core loan portfolio, which excludes the planned runoff from the liquidating portfolio, was up $1 billion from the fourth quarter. Our securities portfolio grew $7.7 billion as we continued to deploy cash into longer-term investments and benefit from continued strong deposit growth, with deposit balances up $10.2 billion. ","Now let's turn to the income statement. Revenue grew by $1 billion or 5% from the fourth quarter on strong mortgage results and fee growth throughout our diversified businesses while net interest income was stable. As expected, our expenses remained elevated in this quarter, but we generated positive operating leverage. We expect second quarter expenses to decline by $500 million to $700 million and that our quarterly expenses will continue to decline over the remainder of the year. ","Now let me cover our results in more detail. As shown on Page 6, period-end loans were down $3.1 billion from the fourth quarter as we continue to reduce the size of our liquidating portfolio. Excluding the runoff of $4.1 billion of liquidating loans, our core loan portfolio grew by $1 billion. Commercial loans grew $299 million as growth in C&I was partially offset by lower commercial real estate and foreign loans. Loan growth benefited from $858 million of loans acquired from Burdale Capital Finance during the quarter. As we head into the second quarter, we have a nice tailwind for increasing loans with the announced acquisition of BNP Paribas' North American energy lending business, which includes approximately $3.9 billion of loans outstanding and is expected to close later this month. ","Consumer loans declined $3.4 billion from the fourth quarter, as growth in our auto and our private student lending portfolios was offset by lower junior lien mortgages and seasonally lower credit card balances. Average loan balances were flat linked quarter, but we had growth in many portfolios. We believe we're well positioned to grow loans during the rest of the year. ","We had strong deposit growth with average core deposits up $5.6 billion from the fourth quarter and up $73.7 billion or 9% from a year ago. Core deposits were 113% of average loans. Average core checking and savings deposits were up 12% from a year ago and were 93% of core deposits. Consumer checking accounts were up a net 2.5% from a year ago. We have successfully grown deposits while reducing our deposit costs for 6 consecutive quarters. Deposit costs in the first quarter were 20 basis points, down 2 basis points from the fourth quarter and down 10 basis points from a year ago. ","Tax equivalent net interest income was stable from the fourth quarter, with average earning assets essentially unchanged and the NIM was up 2 basis points. That said; we expect continued pressure on our NIM as a result of the current interest rate environment. The benefit of disciplined deposit pricing, with interest-bearing deposit costs down 3 basis points in the quarter and the redeployment of short-term investments into longer-term securities largely offset the expected runoff of higher-yielding loans and investments during the quarter. ","Noninterest income increased $1 billion from the fourth quarter, up 11%. This growth was broad-based and reflected very strong mortgage results. Mortgage banking revenue increased $506 million, up 21% from the fourth quarter, driven by strong originations and higher margins. Mortgage originations were $129 billion in the first quarter, up 8% from the fourth quarter. Only 15% of our origination volume this quarter was from HARP. The unclosed mortgage pipeline was solid at $79 billion at quarter end. Mortgage results included a $343 million reduction in the value of MSRs to incorporate a higher discount rate. Market-sensitive revenues were up $458 million from the fourth quarter and included $364 million in equity gains. These equity gains were up $303 million from last quarter but were in line with our quarterly average last year of $370 million. Trading gains increased $210 million from the last quarter, reflecting the benefit from $109 million of higher deferred compensation plan investment results, which is offset in expense, and stronger core customer accommodation trading. Trust and investment fees increased $181 million, up 7% from the fourth quarter from higher retail brokerage transaction activity and asset-based fees. ","Turning to expenses. Recall that we indicated last quarter that costs will remain elevated in the first quarter. Noninterest expense increased $485 million from the fourth quarter, driven primarily by 2 factors, higher personnel expenses and operating losses. Now let me walk you through the first quarter expenses in more detail on Page 11. ","Employee compensation expense increased for 3 primary reasons: first, we had $476 million of seasonally higher employee benefit expenses from higher payroll taxes and 401(k) matching; second, we had $120 million of higher deferred compensation expenses, which are offsetting revenue; and finally, we had $166 million of higher commission and incentive compensation expenses, driven by revenue growth in mortgage, retail brokerage and insurance. In addition, we had $314 million of higher operating losses, primarily due to additional litigation accruals for various legal matters. Offsetting these increases was $262 million of lower merger integration and Compass severance expenses and $329 million in lower expenses from seasonally higher fourth quarter levels in equipment and foreclosed asset expense and other benefits including Compass cost saves. ","As shown on Page 12, we expect second quarter expenses to decline by $500 million to $700 million, driven by the elimination of merger integration expenses and lower personnel expense, and we expect expenses to continue to decline over the remainder of the year. As you will recall, when we first provided you detail on our expense initiative in the second quarter of last year, we stated that we expect that our fourth quarter 2012 expenses to be within the range of $10.75 billion to $11.25 billion, with the target of $11 billion. This target assumed a certain level of revenue growth, which we now expect to be stronger than we originally assumed, obviously a very good thing. Because of expected higher revenue, we're now targeting fourth quarter 2012 expenses to be $11.25 billion. We have continued to make progress on reducing expenses through our Compass expense initiative. For example, noncustomer-facing team members and contractors in high-cost geographies are down 11% from the beginning of 2011, and we've reduced technology expense by 3% despite meaningful growth in IT-related volumes. ","Turning briefly to our segment results starting on Page 13. Community Banking earned $2.3 billion in the first quarter, benefiting from strong mortgage results. Retail banking sales continued to generate strong growth, with core product sales up 9% from a year ago. Retail banking cross-sell grew to 5.98 products per household, up from 5.76 a year ago. Cross-sell growth occurred throughout the franchise. With the East cross-sell 86 basis points lower than the West, we have plenty of opportunity to earn more business from our customers in the East. Credit card penetration in our retail banking households continued to increase to 30%, up from 27% a year ago. We generated record consumer auto originations in the first quarter of $6 billion, up 25% from fourth quarter and 10% from a year ago. ","Wholesale Banking earned $1.9 billion in the first quarter, up $232 million or 14% from the fourth quarter. This strong bottom line growth reflects record revenue of $6 billion, up 11% from the fourth quarter, which was broad-based across our diversified commercial businesses. Wholesale Banking also generated record pretax preprovision profit and positive operating leverage, with the expense efficiency ratio improving to 50.6% in the first quarter compared with 54.2% in the fourth quarter. Loan growth was broad-based, reflecting new and existing customer growth and our ability to capitalize on acquisition opportunities in this environment. For example, we have grown our Commercial Banking portfolio for 20 consecutive months from new originations and increased line utilization from our middle-market customers. During the past year, we have completed $4.8 billion of loan portfolio acquisitions. And this quarter, we announced the acquisition of $3.9 billion on loans outstanding from BNP Paribas, which we expect to close later this month. ","Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement earned $296 million. Excluding the fourth quarter's gain on the sale of H.D. Vest of $153 million, earnings would have increased 34% from last quarter. Revenue increased 1% from the fourth quarter. Again excluding the fourth quarter H.D. Vest gain, revenue grew 6% from last quarter. This growth was driven by higher asset-based fees, strong brokerage transaction revenue and securities gains in the brokerage business. Managed account assets were up $26 billion or 10% from the fourth quarter, driven by strong net flows in market performance. First quarter net flows reflect recovery to levels last seen in the second quarter of 2011. Our continued focus on helping customers succeed financially drove cross-sell to 10.16, up from 9.85 a year ago. ","Credit quality continued to improve this quarter as shown on Page 16. Net charge-offs were down $245 million from the fourth quarter and were 1.25% of average loans, down 48 basis points from a year ago and the lowest charge-off rate since 2007. Provision expense was $2 billion, including a $400 million reserve release in the first quarter. Absent significant deterioration of the economy, we continue to expect future reserve releases in 2012. ","Nonaccrual loans increased $722 million from the fourth quarter. This entire increase was a result of the reclassification of $1.7 billion of performing junior lien loans and lines to nonaccrual status in accordance with interagency guidance issued to the industry this quarter related to junior liens behind a delinquent senior lien loan. Only 12% of these reclassified junior liens were 30 days or more past due. This policy change had an immaterial impact on our earnings since the loans were already considered in our loan loss allowance and the related interest income impact was minimal. Absent this policy change, nonaccrual loans would have been down $948 million from the fourth quarter with declines in all loan categories. This continues the trend of improvement that started in the fourth quarter of 2010. Loans 90 days or more past due were down $412 million or 20% from the fourth quarter, with declines in both commercial and consumer portfolios. Early-stage consumer loan delinquency balances and rates also improved from the fourth quarter, driven by seasonality but are also significantly better than a year ago as portfolio performance continued to improve. ","We service $1.8 trillion of residential mortgages. We like the cross-sell opportunities this provides, and it also positions us well to benefit from refinance waves like we're experiencing now since existing customers usually give us the first chance when they refinance. On Page 18, we highlight why we believe our servicing portfolio is the best in the industry. 71% of our servicing portfolio is service for the agency; only 5% are private securitizations, and 79% of those were prime at origination, and over 1\/2 were originated prior to 2006. Most of the loans we securitized were jumbo loans. We do not have private label option ARM securities nor do we have a significant amount of home equity securitizations. ","Reflecting the quality of our servicing portfolio, our delinquency and foreclosure rate was nearly 400 basis points lower than the industry average, excluding Wells Fargo, based on the most recent publicly available data. Our delinquency -- our total delinquency and foreclosure rate was 6.89% in the first quarter, down from 7.2% a year ago and from a peak of 8.96% in the fourth quarter of 2009. The repurchase reserve increased by $118 million in the first quarter. Total repurchase demands were down $154 million from the fourth quarter, down approximately 25% from a year ago and down 57% from the peak in the second quarter of 2010. ","As shown on Page 20, our capital position continued to improve, with our Tier 1 common equity ratio increasing to 9.95% and our estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio under current Basel III proposals growing to 7.81%, up 31 basis points from the fourth quarter. We've been able to grow our capital ratios while rewarding our shareholders by increasing our first quarter dividend by 83%. We purchased 7.6 million shares in the first quarter, primarily through a forward repurchase transaction entered into during the fourth quarter. We called $875 million of 6.38% trust preferred securities in the first quarter, which we redeemed today. ","In summary, our diversified business model, focused on basic banking, generated another quarter of outstanding results with record earnings, robust revenue and pretax preprovision growth, positive operating leverage and continued improvement in credit quality. These results drove our ROA to 1.31% and increased our ROE to 12.14%, and our capital ratios continued to grow. We increased our dividend rate to $0.22 per share, which we paid to our shareholders in the first quarter. ","We are well positioned to continue to grow, ending the quarter with a strong mortgage pipeline, and we are focused on capitalizing on acquisition opportunities, increasing our cross-sell, growing our loans and deposits and reducing our expenses. We look forward to sharing more details on our growth opportunities at our Investor Day next month. I will now open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets.","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I wondered, Tim, could you give us a sense of the yields you're getting on some of the loan portfolio purchases you've made to date and how additive they are to the margin? And also, are you still seeing a good pipeline of opportunities and just how competitive is the market now for these acquisitions?","Timothy J. Sloan","Sure, good question. When you look at the yields that we received on our commercial real estate loans that we bought last year in a number of transactions, they were more or less consistent with the rest of the portfolio. These were generally high-quality loans. As you recall, a good portion of those were customers that we already knew. So I would say that it was consistent with those yields. And then in terms of the Burdale Capital Finance portfolio, again, it was pretty consistent, high-quality stuff with the Capital Finance portfolio. In terms of how competitive the market is, I wouldn't say that it's really changed a whole lot. I mean, in any situation that we're seeing, that we're interested in, there's at least a handful of competitors and everybody wants to grow, so you've got to pay an appropriate price.","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just one other is that you mentioned HARP accounted for around 15% of the origination volume in the first quarter. Do you see that rising much and having a greater impact on your business? And beyond that, just in general, what are your thoughts on the current strength of the housing market?","Timothy J. Sloan","Well, John, do you want to...","John G. Stumpf","Yes. I want to tell you, on the housing side, we're seeing improvement. And we've been seeing that for some time, but we're seeing it more. And it depends on the region of the country, strength, of course, and the different price points. But when you have the dynamics of higher rental rates and lower home values at great financing rates, there's a point in time where the market's going to clear and you're going to see improvement. I think we're getting very close to that tipping point, and we've seen it in some of the markets. In some markets like Northern California, Texas, the District of Columbia, in that area, stronger. Other areas would be a bit weaker, but we are seeing improvement there. With respect to HARP, you're right. 15% of our volume was HARP. But we have a pretty good pipeline there. HARP 2 is an opportunity for very high loan-to-value or \"underwater\" from an equity perspective, current borrowers to refinance. And we're going to see more volume in that.","Timothy J. Sloan","And John, maybe let me just add on to that. And that is, Joe, most of the volume that we saw from HARP was from HARP 1. And again, about 15% of the total fundings in the first quarter. So we're just beginning to see the results of HARP 2 start to kick in. How long that continues, we don't know. But right now, the mortgage business is very good for us.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I was wondering about if you could give us a little color on your approach to share buybacks. Are you purely price-sensitive? Or does it kind of depend on what other uses of capital you have? Could you give us some color on how you think about the buybacks?","John G. Stumpf","Sure. We've been very consistent with our view of rewarding shareholders. First of all, those of you who know us well know that we are very shareholder-friendly and -centric. There's a number of dynamics that are going on right now. We are still buying back TruPS. We have increased our dividend by 83%. We are going to -- we have approval to do more repurchase this year than last year. We're very happy we went through the CCAR with no objections to our plan. And we want to have enough capital around so we can grow this company. And we believe we are a growth company. So we will buy back when it's opportunistic for us to do that. But again, we have all of those other issues in play. And I think balance, consistency and a friendly view around rewarding our stockholders. So again, we have great emphasis on that; will really dictate what we do.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And a question for Tim on expenses. Tim, any color on the pace of expense decline throughout the year from the second quarter, third and fourth? Does it pick up steam? Or do you envision that kind of spread evenly throughout the quarters as we go towards that fourth quarter goal?","Timothy J. Sloan","Yes, John, a good question. Again, nothing's really fundamentally changed as we think about expenses from the prior quarter. I mean, we're committed to reducing our expenses and improving operating efficiency. Again, we feel good about the $500 million to $700 million. But in terms of the specifics as it relates to the third and fourth quarter, obviously, to get down to the $11.25 billion target that we set, it's going to have to be spread pretty evenly. But again, we feel confident in our ability to do it and are looking forward to it.","John G. Stumpf","Yes, John, I'd like to add one thing to that. We are absolutely committed. But if we get to the fourth quarter and if for whatever reason there is all kinds of revenue available in a certain business or a number of businesses, we're not going to be slavish to any one number. We're going to do the right thing for the stockholder, and we're going to make sure that we continue to produce the kind of results you want us to do. But we are committed to that number. We have plans in place. We know we're going to get it, but we're not going to be slavish to it.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Understood. Okay. And then Tim, is there any Compass savings that go beyond the fourth quarter? Are there savings that you'd be working on for the year 2013 out of Compass or anything else?","Timothy J. Sloan","Oh, sure. Absolutely. I mean, I think that's a really important point. It's not as if we put together an expense focus and when we get to the fourth quarter and just stop being focused on improving operating efficiencies. I mean, I think that post the merger integration, it really gives us an opportunity to focus on operating leverage and improved efficiencies. And we'll continue to do that into '14, '15 and '16. And we're not going to stop.","John G. Stumpf","Yes, absolutely. And because the key here is if we're more efficient on things that customers don't want to pay for, we can add sales people, add more value to things that customers want to have, so we can compete for revenues and grow our franchise and do all the things that add value.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then just a question on Basel III for Tim, I guess. Tim, your pro forma ratio of risk-weighted assets to total assets under Basel III is high; it seems like almost 100%. Where's the biggest inflation of your risk-weighted assets coming from under Basel III? Is it kind of the sub-investment grade securities that get hit pretty hard? And is there an opportunity to mitigate that over time?","Timothy J. Sloan","Well, I don't know if I would describe it as an inflation of our numbers. I mean, we go through what we think is an appropriate review of all of our assets and try to compare them to what the Basel -- what we think the Basel III rules are going to be. Others, it may be where you're going that others have different ratios, I don't know how anybody else is doing. I know how we're doing it, and I think we're doing it in an appropriate way. Having said that, obviously, because it's an important ratio, we're going to look at our risk-weighted assets and make sure that we're getting the good return on all of our risk-weighted assets as we roll into Basel III. But I think the other important point is that regardless of what the risk-weighted asset level is, capital's not an issue for us, right? We're at 7.81%. The minimum requirement for us, we know, is 7%. Maybe there's going to be a SIV buffer, maybe not. And so we're not concerned about -- we're not overly concerned about that ratio, but we spend a lot of time making sure that it's calculated correctly.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And does the treatment of MSR under Basel III affect at all how you decide or not decide to grow the business? Or will decisions to grow mortgage servicing or not be independent kind of capital treatment? I just want to get that. Is that the factor in how you look at the MSR?","John G. Stumpf","John, first of all, we love the mortgage business. We love it because our customers love it. 2\/3 of our customers are in the mortgage business, and I don't know how you can be in the consumer banking business if you're not in the mortgage business. Along with checking accounts and mortgages, that drives a lot of the household acquisition. And once a customer does a mortgage with us, great things happen. They stay longer, they buy more products so that's great. And in our mortgage business, specifically on the MSR, as you know, it's a balanced business. Origination on one side and servicing on the other side, and they move in opposite directions with what happens in interest rates. Yes, there is an element of the MSR that we think is not -- we don't agree with the treatment under Basel because we think it's as good an asset as you can have. But that being said, if rates do rise and the mortgage servicing asset goes up in value and less of it gets counted for capital or there's a bigger exclusion, other great things happen in the company. There's offsets and there's balances. We're not going to let one ratio and one issue like that drive us away from the business that we think is a good thing for customers, for our stockholders, for everyone involved here. It's not that we're oblivious to it, and we're looking for other ways to mitigate it. And we spend a lot of time on that. But it's just not a deal stopper around here. We love the business.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","You mentioned that 15% of your total fundings were HARP. Could you just give us a sense of the application volumes that have been HARP-related? And then I just had a follow-up question on the ultimate approval of HARP relative to other apps that you've been seeing.","Timothy J. Sloan","Yes. The application volumes again were about 15%. HARP 2 was kind of rolled out in the middle of the quarter, and so those applications are up a bit. But I wouldn't describe -- it wasn't a significant portion of the first quarter volume. Our expectation is they're probably going to increase. But again, we think it's a good program. We think it will be helpful. But it's in its early stages. But obviously, given the servicing book that we have, we're going to be a large part of that program.","John G. Stumpf","And Betsy, one thing that's a little different about that, you actually have to -- we spend a little more time marketing. You have to actually go and talk with people and help them understand how they qualify and how they fit into the program. And we're doing that. We have feet on the street. We have people available. We have a big retail distribution, and we think it's a -- first of all, we think it's a good thing. It's great to see people who have made their payments every month, even though they're under water or hugely under water. And now to be able to help them put a few hundred dollars extra in their pocket every month, that's terrific.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So a little bit more expensive to get the refi in obviously. But I guess, the question is what is the -- what has the approval rate been? What do you think the approval rate is likely to be relative to other refis, non-HARP refis?","Timothy J. Sloan","That's a fair question. But I think we're too new to rate into the HARP 2 program. I think over the next few months, we'll have a better appreciation for that, but I wouldn't want to guess on that one.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just a minor question that has to do with loan growth. I know that, that's a priority for you. Given the push-pull in the portfolio where you've got -- some of the portfolio is obviously still in runoff, do you feel that you can drive net loan growth over the next year or so? Or do you have to wait for that runoff portfolio to really shrink a little bit more dramatically before you can anticipate that?","Timothy J. Sloan","No, we think we could continue to drive the growth. I mean, you saw in the third and fourth quarter of last year that we saw point-to-point growth in both quarters. This quarter, we were down a bit. But we feel good about our ability to grow loans organically as well. And in addition, as we mentioned, we've been active from an acquisition standpoint. So any quarter might be a little bit up, a little bit down, but over time, we feel confident about our ability to grow the loan portfolio. And we don't think we're going to need to wait until the liquidating portfolio just declines to a small number.","John G. Stumpf","And Betsy, the other thing is in the first quarter, there is some seasonality. So we typically see card balances coming down in the first quarter, and then you see that change over the rest of the year. So we believe we can grow organically here. And as Tim mentioned, it will be lumpy, but we have lots of opportunity.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. Then I guess, just a last question on this topic is competition. So clearly, there's competition with other banks. There's also competition with the capital markets, right, because interest rates are so low. So I'm just wondering how do you deal with that, particularly in the commercial real estate and the C&I space, where your borrowers might be able to access longer-term funds cheaper than they have historically. Would they choose to be doing that as opposed to drawing down C&I lines or doing a CRE...","Timothy J. Sloan","Well, they might. No, it's a fair question. I think depending upon what's going on in the capital markets, you can see kind of an ebb and flow back and forth. And I think from our perspective, look, even though we want to grow loans, the most important thing is do the right thing for the customer. And because of the fact that we've got a broader base of product and services today, including an investment banking capability, unlike maybe where we were a few years ago, we can help them do that. So we sit down with our customers and give them our best recommendations. If it's a commercial real estate customer, whether or not we could do it on-balance sheet or whether we could do it in a CMBS market, so on and so forth. So there's no question, there's always going to be competition from the capital markets. It was a little bit less in the third quarter of last year, a little bit more in the fourth quarter, probably a little bit more steady state this quarter, but you're going to see that ebb and flow.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Brian Foran with Nomura.","Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I guess, on the $1.7 billion reclass of home equities, I totally realize you guys have already reserved for it. But just in thinking about what the loss content on those loans might be, I guess, Chase kind of put out there a 55% cume loss rate on these kind of high-risk seconds. Is that a reasonable guess for the type of reserves you would already have against that bucket?","Timothy J. Sloan","Yes. Our experience hasn't been 55%. I think that our view is that we needed to be consistent with this interagency guidance. We had taken into consideration the fact that these were junior lien loans behind sub-performing first for an extended period of time. This isn't the first time that we took that into consideration in our loan loss reserve, so we think that we're adequately reserved. But we haven't seen a disproportionate incremental loss rate on this portfolio relative to others. But we've taken into consideration the loan loss reserve and we have for a while.","John G. Stumpf","The biggest driver on losses here is jobs. If people have income and if they have work, that drives it more than anything else. But also, there's no question that once they don't have a job, the severity is almost complete. I mean, so in other words, you lose most of it. But we're not running at those kind of numbers.","Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And then I know you've touched on a lot of the different aspects of HARP. But just one follow-up would be on how does it affect the gain on sale outlook for the mortgage business over the remainder of the year?","Timothy J. Sloan","Well, I think it's going to be just a function of volume. I mean, I think we -- if the HARP 2 is successful, it will continue to increase volume. The margins that we've had have been good. But I think generally, they've been a little bit overstated in the market in terms of media reports and the like. Again, HARP 2 loans are good, the program seems to be catching on, it's in its early stage. And the way that we price those loans is as similar to any other refinance.","Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","If I could sneak in just one last one, I guess, going back to John's question on the risk asset-weighted inflation. I agree with everything you said. But maybe the thing that's not obvious based your business mix is the $346 billion higher risk-weighted assets under Basel III versus Basel I as of March 31. And how much of those -- that risk-weighted asset difference between Basel III and Basel I is something that would be permanent versus how much of it is from things that can be mitigated or reduced over time like subprime MBS that might be on the books or things like that?","Timothy J. Sloan","Well, so let's step back for a minute. I guess I'm disagreeing a little bit with the premise that somehow there's inflation in how we're calculating our risk-weighted assets under Basel III. The rules for Basel I and Basel III are just different. You've got to take into consideration things like operating risk. You've got to take into consideration counterparty risk. And everybody's doing that in the industry; we're doing that. And so again, we feel comfortable with our calculation. We're not going to do anything inappropriate in terms of doing that calculation. Having said that, we're going to make sure that it's appropriate. But again, we're not overly concerned about our risk-weighted asset level just because of the fact that we've got adequate capital in the country -- or company, excuse me.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Erika Penala with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Could you give us a sense of how you're treating any associated seconds if you're refinancing a first under the HARP program, particularly if there is an underwater situation?","Timothy J. Sloan","Well, we normally look at the exposure together or in tandem. But in terms of any additional specifics, we can get back to you. We'll talk to our mortgage folks and follow up. But I don't think there's anything special going on.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess, I'm just wondering, I understand that the $1.7 billion increase in the home equity problem loans was part of a reclassification. But is the improvement generally in home equity problem loans for the industry going to be stagnant as perhaps some of the underwater home equity loans are charged off as the first are refinanced under HARP? Am I thinking about this the wrong way or...","John G. Stumpf","No, I think you said -- here's how we think about it. Every time, anything we can do to help a customer reduce their first mortgage obligations through refinancing to lower rates or modifications of the first, obviously helps the second because it's about the total expense and the debt coverage around that. So as part of how we normally work with customers, we look at with respect to their debt and we work through the refinancing. So the reclassification has really nothing to do with how we're going to work with customers or how we feel about future losses. It's merely an interagency rule that we are honoring. We have seen our home equity losses continue to come down. That's been a function of working through some of the more challenged customers early. And it's also been because of refinancing to lower rates, to taking pressure off plus the improved job situation, employment situation. So all those 3 have helped on the home equity portfolio. And I think we'll see continued improvement there.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And just one last question, it's a follow-up to Joe's question. The loans that were required from BNP, are they going to be in line with the commercial yields on the books today or accretive?","Timothy J. Sloan","Well, we haven't acquired them yet. The deal should close this month. When we look at that portfolio, again it's a high-quality portfolio. We're familiar with many of the borrowers, and we have relationships with them right now. We're in a number of the deals, so I would say it's consistent.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Ed Najarian with ISI Group.","Edward R. Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So a couple questions. First one is sort of a follow-up to John McDonald's question on the operating cost. And I guess, I'm just trying to think about the trajectory of the decline and how you're describing it. I get the idea of getting to the high end of the range by 4Q on higher revenue. But in the fourth quarter, you were $12.5 billion on costs. You said we're expecting to remain elevated in the first quarter but then decline significantly starting in the second quarter. Now we're up to $13 billion, and you're looking for a $500 million to $700 million decline in the second quarter. That takes us down to $12.3 billion to $12.5 billion on your guidance. So I guess, I'm wondering why is that second quarter number not materially below the fourth quarter number. Do you -- especially given that it won't include a Wachovia integration cost, whereas the fourth quarter included a fairly large one, do you expect more litigation? Or what is it that I'm missing on sort of 2Q versus 4Q?","Timothy J. Sloan","Well, Ed, I think that based on what we see in the second quarter, we're comfortable in providing the guidance that our expenses are going to be down between $500 million and $700 million. Could they be a little bit more than that? They could, right? But we're comfortable with that number right now. And again, that number is based upon an expectation of revenues. We feel comfortable -- as we mentioned, we entered this quarter with some nice tailwinds in terms of the mortgage pipeline, as well as some acquisitions that we've mentioned. So could the number be a little bit bigger? It could, but we're comfortable with that range.","Edward R. Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. But given that you don't -- if we take out Wachovia integration expense from the fourth quarter, it would actually be up somewhat from the fourth quarter ex integration cost. Is that outlook because of higher incentive comp? Or what is it that would be driving that core number up a little bit versus 4Q as opposed to down ex the Wachovia integration in 4Q? I just trying to understand the point where your thoughts are on how that's trending.","Timothy J. Sloan","Yes. I mean, you're jumping to the conclusion that it will be up. We're saying that we feel comfortable with the $500 million to $700 million guidance. There's always going to be some puts and takes in our expenses as we move through the quarter. But again, we believe that we're going into this quarter with nice revenue, right? And as we've demonstrated this quarter, when you think about it, our revenue was up $1 billion from the fourth quarter. Do you have a little bit more expense related there? Of course, you do. Our revenue was up $1.3 billion from the first quarter last year. Were there a little bit higher expenses? Of course, there were. So we're feeling good about this quarter, right, and we feel good about the $500 million to $700 million. Could it be a little bit higher in terms of the reduction? Sure, it could.","Edward R. Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, all right. And then just one more. When I look at the net interest margin and expanding by 2 basis points, what seems to have been sort of the surprise factor was the overall yield on your commercial loan portfolio, going up by 6 basis points from 4.10% to 4.16% in the fourth quarter to the first quarter. Is there anything in there that's abnormal? Or is there any thoughts about what caused the yield on the commercial loan portfolio to go up a little bit linked quarter versus down a little bit?","Timothy J. Sloan","No, I wouldn't say there's anything abnormal in that. I think we're starting to see the yield settle down just a bit. Every quarter, we have some level of volatility in terms of special items that are in the numbers, and you saw some of that last year, too. But there's nothing abnormal in there.","John G. Stumpf","Yes. And that's actually influenced a little bit by some of the workouts that we do on the commercial side. So that's -- that will bump around a little bit. But I think it's important as long as we're talking about the NIM to mention 2 things. And you know both of these, Ed. First of all, we don't manage the company around the NIM. And secondly, I think still think it's going to be under pressure going forward.","Edward R. Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. I didn't get a chance to look real closely at sort of how the accretive yield came in. But were there some commercial loan sale gain that sort of impacted -- unmarked commercial loans that sort of impacted that yield at all in the first quarter or not really?","John G. Stumpf","It wasn't much. But there's always a little bit here and there.","Timothy J. Sloan","No, that wasn't a driver in terms of the NIM. And in fact, the accretion was actually down a little bit from $552 million to $514 million in the first quarter.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I know you're probably sick of talking about HARP. But as of April 1, I mean, have you guys disclosed how much of HARP-eligible loans is in your servicing portfolio?","John G. Stumpf","No.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And secondly, as of April 1, I believe that you can start to refi other people's servicing portfolios under HARP. I'm just wondering, I think the jury's out if that's a smart move or not. Have you made any decision on that yet?","John G. Stumpf","Well, Paul, how we think about that, first of all, since a lot of HARP loans you get through a marketing, you need to kind of know where people are. It's easier to do your own portfolio than someone else's. That being said, we want to take on all comers, and this is where our cross-sell in the community bank gets very involved, as they talk with customers, and frankly, other parts of the company where we are able -- if someone has a mortgage that's not with us that we can do. But I would say, we'll know more about that as time goes on. But I would bet the biggest part of the HARP 2s that we will do will be for our own portfolio, just pulling [ph] the information.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then going back, because I didn't quite understand the answer, I didn't get it correct, I think. On the HELOC portfolio, of which I believe is like close to $1.6 billion that you moved over, was there other -- $1.7 billion, sorry about that. Was there other loans that where the first is defaulted that are not nonaccruals in the HELOC portfolio?","John G. Stumpf","No.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","No. So this is the entire community of loans where the first has been defaulted?","John G. Stumpf","Correct.","Timothy J. Sloan","Correct.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Hopefully, I didn't miss it. I know you commented on NIM being under pressure but growing loans. When we combine those 2 and think about your both capacity and desire to buy some more securities, how does that all shake out for net interest income dollars from here?","Timothy J. Sloan","Well, I think as John said, we continue to believe that the net interest margins could be under pressure. Having said that, I think that we've got the ability to grow loans organically. We believe that we can do that. The core loans were up again this quarter, a little bit less than in the third and fourth quarter, but we feel confident about our ability to grow our core loans. And one of the other things that I think is important to note is that the diversification in terms of the loan growth this quarter was a little bit better than the third and the fourth quarter because we saw auto loans and student loans growing, whereas in the third and the fourth quarter, it was a little bit more of that focus on Wholesale Banking. As it relates to -- but the other avenue we have obviously to grow loans is through acquisition. We continue to demonstrate that we're active there and we're paying appropriate prices and bringing new customers to the company. In terms of securities purchases, we're going to continue to manage the portfolio as we have very prudently. We're not going too far out under the curve. Having said that, if we got incremental liquidity that's not needed for our customers in terms of loans, we're going to invest appropriately. And you saw our securities increase about $7 billion to $8 billion this quarter, so we'll continue to do that. And then I think the other point to make is just in terms of the input costs, and that is we've been able to continue to grow deposits while reducing our deposit costs. So we feel good about the ability to grow net interest income.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then separately, as we think about the provision expense, I was just looking at one of the slides, over the last few quarters, the provision expense in dollars has been relatively stable. It seems like you still have quite a bit of excess loan loss reserves, most of the credit metrics continue to improve from here or up until here. How do we think about the pace of reserve release going forward?","Timothy J. Sloan","Yes. That's a fair question. I think we believe that we'll have incremental reserve release, whether -- I'm not 100% sure what the pace is going to be. We don't really make those decisions until the end of the quarter. But we do think based upon the continued improvement in the portfolio, which we've continued to see, that we will have additional reserve release. But it's going to be less than it was last year. I mean, the pace of improvement has slowed down a little bit. I think the important thing is that we've gotten through the point at which the lines of the reduction in the loan loss reserve release and the improvement in charge-offs cross so that what we're seeing is a real kind of buttoned-down provision expense and net charge-off level.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then just lastly, if I could sneak in a third one here. The tax rate calculation was around 35% this quarter. It's averaged probably 25% to 33% the last 3 years. Anything different or just a little more conservative earlier in the year?","Timothy J. Sloan","Well, it was up a bit this quarter. And we think that the tax rate for 2012 is going to be higher than last year because we're making more money. But beyond that, I wouldn't read anything into it.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Just to further clarify. So your expense guidance is $250 million higher. And John, you said you're not going to be slavish to any one target. Can you guys commit to having positive operating leverage?","John G. Stumpf","Yes.","Timothy J. Sloan","Yes, absolutely.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","So you're going to miss it, but revenues will be a lot more higher -- or at least higher than that $250 million, no matter how we slice it.","John G. Stumpf","We're not saying that.","Timothy J. Sloan","No, we're not going to miss it. Okay, a year ago, we gave guidance, right, 6 quarters ahead and we gave you a range of $10.75 billion to $11.250 billion. But we said then and we said now, those are based upon a certain set of revenue assumptions, so we're going to come in at the high end of the range...","John G. Stumpf","Because revenues are at a high.","Timothy J. Sloan","Because revenues are higher, not because we're executing on our expense reductions.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then separately, John, especially for you, if I asked you 15 years ago what bank this quarter might have some of the best year-over-year growth in investment banking, as you guys said, it's up 20%, a record wholesale and the biggest absolute growth in syndicated loan volume, would you ever have guessed it'd be your company as opposed to JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citi, Goldman, Morgan Stanley or some of these firms that are no longer around? So my question really is, is this mission creep? Is this opportunism? What's changed from going back? And I know you've evolved with your acquisitions, and I'm sure we'll talk more about this at Investor Day. But it seems as though you're getting farther away from what made at least legacy companies strong and you're doing more activities further away from your headquarters. So how should we think about that?","John G. Stumpf","Well, when I think of 15 years ago, I had a mustache and dark hair, so you're dating me now. But let's think about this, Mike. The company today clearly has evolved. But I think it is a more customer-relevant, safer. Our risk profile is reduced from 15 years ago. And if you think about the business, look at the balance in the business today. But before I get to that, what stayed consistent is we continue to be a relationship business. We're in a relationship, the long-term relationship with our customers. And today, we have more products to offer to these customers to help them succeed financially. We're more balanced. If you look at our income statement, this quarter, 1\/2 of the revenue comes from fees for services, 1\/2 from the margin. 1\/2 comes basically from wholesale and 1\/2 from consumer. We now have diversity of geography. So I think if you look at that 15-year period, you should even be happier today than -- and it's safer, more diversified, more customer-focused, more value. And we'll talk about this more at Investor Day. But I think the evolution to that time reinforce what we were trying to do 15 years ago, not moving away from it.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And then specifically as it relates to syndicated loans, I'm surprised when I look at first quarter of this year versus first quarter of last year, the biggest dollar amount increase in acting as agent for syndicated loans is Wells Fargo. And I'm just...","John G. Stumpf","You know what, Mike, that's a great thing. Why are people coming to -- why are customers coming to Wells Fargo? Because they believe in our model, they believe in the company. They like the people they work with. They know that we've got a strong balance sheet. They know that we're going to be able to deliver for us, right? That's a great thing. It diversifies the business, and it reinforces the model. Everything around here starts with the customer. Why wouldn't we want to help our customers? Why wouldn't we want, if we deal with a large Fortune 500 company and we're doing loan business with them and they want to issue debt to buy a subsidiary or whatever. But why wouldn't we want to help them do that? We happen to have 15,000 terrific retail brokerage people out there, advisors who can help with that and sell this, and we have great people on to help them price the debt or the equity. This is what we ought to be doing.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And then last follow-up -- I'll let you finish, too, but we can finish at the Investor Day. But is some of this opportunistic, though? Because the European banks' market share in this area has gone from, what, 37% down to 21% over the past year. So not only, I guess, I'm hearing you say your clients want this more, but is this some Wells Fargo opportunism?","John G. Stumpf","Well, of course. There are -- some of the foreign banks are retreating to their home countries. The industry has changed in a lot of these areas. And we celebrated our 160th birthday a few weeks ago. We've always evolved. We always have change in product offerings and channels. But what stayed true around here and will continue to stay is that it's all about long-term relationships with our customers, helping them succeed. So when I look at percentage changes from year-over-year or whatever, I don't -- first of all, percentages always have a numerator and denominator, and I don't get too excited about that. What I get excited about is if we keep customers at the center of what we do, great things happen. It always does.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research, LLC.","Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division","Two questions for you here. Something we haven't heard a lot about lately is Wells Fargo Financial. Could you guys just talk about what the results have been since you've moved or tried to move the Wells Fargo Financial people into the branch?","John G. Stumpf","Well, those folks -- most of those folks on the production side, many of them went into the banks, and they've become personal bankers. They're helping us serve customers, make loans. So yes, that's been very successful.","Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division","Have you been able to track how many -- how much business you might have lost for people who just don't want to go into a bank branch to get their loan or whatever?","John G. Stumpf","We've really not, but what's happened is we actually had more distribution now because we got rid of 700 or 800 stores, but we picked up 3,000 with the acquisition of Wachovia. So I don't -- I've not heard -- as I'm out there on the street, I've not ever heard from anyone that I prefer not going to a bank where I'd prefer going to a finance office. What's changed mostly in that business, Nancy, is that much of what we did in Financial were loan accommodations, where we would take 3 or 4 different loans and be a debt consolidation on homes. And of course, what's happened to home value is that business really changed a lot. But the people we brought over were primarily lenders. They knew that part of the business well, so that helped enculturate even more in our banking stores this idea that we want to also be a great place to borrow money if your credit qualified.","Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division","Right. And my second question sort of goes back to this point, and it incorporates HARP and HAMP and all the other issues that we've had around mortgage banking. But it's an issue -- or it's a question that relates more to moral hazard going forward. We've had all these changes. People have found that they can have their principal reduced, they can have their rates reduced, et cetera, et cetera. So how does that impact your underwriting of a mortgage going forward? Do you have to put a big orange sticker on it saying, \"We really mean this, this is really what the thing is going to be\"? Or I mean, how do you think about that, protecting yourself going forward?","John G. Stumpf","Well, it's a great question. So a couple things, first of all, to think about. Of the 50 million mortgages in America, about 10 million or 11 million are underwater. And of those 11 million, 90% or so are current. So generally, Americans, by a vast majority, want to pay their bills if they have the income to do it. Secondly, you build your best portfolios, whether it's for your own account or whether you sell it off and keep the servicing, you build your best portfolios after a downturn, not going into a downturn. And when the bubble is expanding, usually you have your worst portfolio builds. And the third thing is on the big yellow sticker, I don't know that -- or the orange sticker. Today, in fact, since really 2008, the mortgage business has retrenched and it's more like it was done prior to 2002 or '03 where there is full documentation, income verification, a proper amount down depending on which program it is. So I'm -- and I think nothing would fix all of this more than a little appreciation in housing and getting to the bottom, which I think we're very close to that point where we're going to see an inflection point here. So I don't know if I answered your question, but that's how we think about it.","Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division","So do you think you're just getting a better customer who will treat their mortgage document a bit more carefully or take it more seriously going forward than did some of the people coming into this?","John G. Stumpf","Nancy, I think it's a good point. I think everybody involved in a mortgage needs to have skin in the game such that mortgages are good. I mean, that's the originator, that's the borrower, that's the realtor that puts the borrower and whatever, together if it's a purchase. It's the people who package and the rating agencies and the servicing. And mortgages aren't complete until they pay off and it's well done, so it's the whole process. I think everybody is showing more care and diligence today, and that's a good thing.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill.","R. Scott Siefers","I just had a quick question on the mechanics of the new regulatory guidance in that $1.7 billion that you moved over. So since it's now a nonaccrual, obviously, you don't accrue the interest, but the vast majority is still paying, so the cash is coming in. When you receive that cash, does that go into NII now? Or does it go directly to pay down principal balances on the related loans? How does that work?","Timothy J. Sloan","Like all nonperforming assets or nonperforming loans, this isn't different. It pays down the principal.","R. Scott Siefers","Okay. So there's some -- in your case, it's an extraordinarily small amount, but on a kind of go-forward ramification, I guess, to the earnings stream then.","Timothy J. Sloan","It's not material.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Fred Cannon with KBW.","Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","This is actually Brian Kleinhanzl on for Fred. So I just had a quick question on the rep and warranty. It looks like the repurchase demands are coming down or have been coming down for the last couple of quarters but the reserve keeps building from here. I mean, is there a target you're trying to get to? Or when can we finally see that the reserves come down for the rep and warranty?","Timothy J. Sloan","Yes. And fair question. The total demands outstanding both number and balances were down in the first quarter and were down kind of roughly 25% year-over-year. The new agency demands for the more difficult vintages, the '06 to '08 vintages, declined a bit from the fourth quarter. But the additions that we put into the reserve were more or less in line with last quarter. We continue to add to the reserve, do the elevated demands from Fannie. And because of the projected higher mortgage insurance rescissions, Freddie's been in line. So we're hopeful, it's going to come down at some point. But we just haven't seen it come down enough yet so that we would want to reduce the reserve.","Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then on a separate topic, you used to give a disclosure about the excess liquidity that you held on the balance sheet. Haven't seen that in the last couple of quarters. What is it that you think the excess liquidity is right now on the balance sheet? And given that the Basel committee has just come out with saying that there's going to be a large shortfall under a third, Basel III standard, is it -- what is your idea of what that excess liquidity is for you?","Timothy J. Sloan","Yes, I don't recall -- we'll go back. I don't recall us giving any sort of guidance as to what our excess liquidity is. I can tell you that we've got a lot of liquidity right now, which is terrific. It's allowed us to grow the loan portfolio year-over-year and grow the securities portfolio in a smart way. And we're still working through and the regulators are still working through what the new liquidity guidance is going to be related to Basel III. There's a lot of discussion going on about that. But when you look at our balance sheet, particularly how we're continuing to grow low-cost deposits, we don't have a liquidity issue at all.","John G. Stumpf","See, I think that's the key, Brian. When you look at this company, our liquidity is such solid. I mean, can you imagine $900 billion plus of deposits at 20 basis points, and again virtually all of it\u2019s core; a big chunk of it is consumer. So this is just so, so valuable, and so undervalued today, given where interest rates are.","Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","And just a quick question on the deposit costs. I mean, we saw them come down again this quarter basically on that core funding. Is there still room for those to come down in the following quarters? I mean, they're already kind of an industry low. So have you guys think that there's a lot more room?","Timothy J. Sloan","You know what, every time we get down to a lower number, we talk to our folks and we ask them to continue to not compete on price, continue to compete on value and relationship. And I think that's one of the primary reasons we're able to continue to reduce cost. Whether or not we're going to be able to continue to do that in the future, I don't know for sure.","John G. Stumpf","And you are getting pretty close here, but it's down 10 basis points in a year. I don't think you sat here a year ago and said, \"Could you bring it down 10?\" People would've said, \"I don't think you can.\" So we're always looking to find that right area. But the reason they're coming down is more about the mix as opposed -- we have to compete which we do, but when you have the number of checking or near checking that we have, that's just -- that's magical.","Operator","Your next question will come from Andrew Marquardt with Evercore Partners.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just a follow-up on that last question. In terms of the margin guidance, you had talked about how despite the 2 basis points better this quarter, that we should expect some pressure going forward. Just hoping we can get some color in terms of magnitude. Is it kind of in the low single-digit range? And then it also sounds like despite that, you still feel confident in holding the NII up with loan growth and earning asset growth.","Timothy J. Sloan","Yes. Andrew, it's a fair question because there's been a lot of volatility in the NIM, which is candidly why we don't manage to it. I don't know what the NIM is going to be this quarter, and I don't know what it's going to be next quarter. What we do know is just the math is that there's pressure on it for sure. We're hopeful that we can continue to relieve that pressure as best we can through a reduction in our deposit costs. But in terms of specifics, I'm not going to provide any guidance because I can't.","John G. Stumpf","But Andrew, you're right on the fact that -- forget the margin. Look at net interest income. That's really what drives us because that's the result of the work we do every day of getting new customers and selling them more things and so forth, getting deposits and selling loans. And I wake up and think about that more than I do about the NIM. And there, we think we have good opportunities to continue to produce the kind of things that drive net interest income.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","So is it fair to assume then the confidence in terms of a higher NIM really won't come until the macro backdrop really improves in terms of a higher rate environment? Is that fair or maybe the run-off portfolio slows?","Timothy J. Sloan","I think it -- I wouldn't say it's confidence. I think it's just more probability. I think it's less likely that the NIM is going to grow. Not impossible because we've been able to grow it a little bit over -- a few basis points in the last couple of quarters since the decline in the third quarter last year. It's just a little bit less likely.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then lastly, just on the -- going back to expenses, in terms of the slight change in terms of the guidance for year end at the upper end now, you had mentioned that, that's driven by higher confidence in revenue. You're feeling better about revenue more than you have before. Can you help us understand exactly where exactly do you feel better about it? Is it really mortgage banking or trading? Or what is it that makes you feel better?","John G. Stumpf","Across-the-board.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. So no one particular area feeling better in terms of mortgage having greater strength or trading coming in better?","John G. Stumpf","No.","Operator","Your final question will come from the line of Chris Mutascio with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Christopher M. Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I have 3 quick questions. Tim, on the margin guidance in terms of percent or dollar amount, does that take into consideration perhaps a more aggressive TruPS redemptions than just the $875 million announced today or are redeeming today?","Timothy J. Sloan","No, we're getting through really the end of the -- the tail end of the TruPS redemptions that we're going to be doing. I mean, most of the activity occurred last year. So that's -- we'll continue to redeem TruPS in an appropriate way, but it's not going to be as big a driver as it was last year.","Christopher M. Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. The second thing is gain on sale margins this quarter versus last quarter, do you have those handy on the mortgage side?","Timothy J. Sloan","Yes, I think it was -- this quarter was, I think, 2.36%. And that's up from 1.9% in the fourth quarter.","Christopher M. Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then finally, with the robo-signing settlement, do you have discretion on who you modify? In other words, can you modify the firsts that are delinquent ahead of the -- of your own home equity loans?","Timothy J. Sloan","We certainly have discretion in terms of what you modify. I mean, there's not -- there aren't specific requirements for specific borrowers. We may -- and there's a lot of detail in our 10-K in terms of the specifics on the settlement. And I would -- rather than go through that in detail right now, I'd just ask you to take a peek at that. We provide a lot of detail about how we see the settlement and how it would affect us.","John G. Stumpf","Thank you, everybody. And thanks for joining our call. We appreciate your interest and also the ones who asked the questions. Thank you much, and we will see you next quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

We generated earnings of $21.9 billion and earnings per share of $3.89, both up 16% from a year ago. Our core loan portfolio grew by $39.8 billion, almost $40 billion, up 6%. Our credit performance continue to be very strong with total net charge-offs down $4.5 billion, or 50% from just a year ago. Our outstanding deposit franchise continued to generate strong deposit growth, with total deposits up $76.3 billion or 8%.","By focusing on meeting our customers' financial needs, we achieved record cross-sell across the company, with retail banking cross-sell growing to 6.16 products per household, wholesale banking increasing to 7.1 products and wealth, brokerage and retirement cross-sell achieving 10.42 products.","We also had very strong returns this year by growing ROA by 10 basis points to 1.151% and return on equity by 92 basis points to 13.87%. We continue to generate strong capital growth with our estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III increasing to 9.78%. This was a great year for our shareholders. Our stock price increased 33%. We returned $11.4 billion in capital to our shareholders through our higher common stock dividend and more share repurchases in 2013, up 33% from 2012. In our recent CCAR submission, we requested even more capital to be returned to our shareholders.","As we start the new year, I am excited about the opportunities ahead for our country, for our customers and for Wells Fargo. The unemployment rate has declined, GDP growth accelerated and consumer confidence is near a five-year high. While we don't expect the same rate of home price appreciation we had last year, we do expect the housing market to continue to recover which will benefit the U.S. economy and despite the rise in home prices and interest rates over the past year, housing is still very affordable. During the year ahead, we will continue to build on our commitment to our customers and to our shareholders and invest in our businesses to generate growth for decades to come. I am proud of all that our team members accomplished this past year. Our earnings power and capital strength have never been stronger. We believe we are well-positioned for 2014 and we are optimistic about the many opportunities ahead for continued growth.","Tim Sloan, our Chief Financial Officer, will now provide more details on our fourth quarter and full year results. Tim?","Tim Sloan","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. MY comments will follow the presentation included in the quarterly supplement starting on page two and then John and I will answer your questions.","For the fourth quarter, Wells Fargo earned a record $5.6 billion and $1 in earnings per share, both up 10% from a year ago. These strong results were broad-based with higher net interest income, fee growth across many of our businesses, lower expenses and improved credit quality. We have now achieved 16 consecutive quarters of EPS growth and 11 consecutive quarters of record earnings per share. Our ability to grow over such a long period of time reflects the benefit of our diversified model.","On slide three, you can see the strong growth in 2013 that John just highlighted, including a 16% increase in full-year net income and earnings per share.","Slide four illustrates our revenue diversification. We do not rely on any one business to generate growth. The power of our model and the benefit of our diversification were demonstrated in our 2013 results. As interest rates rose during the year, mortgage refi volume naturally waned as expected. As a result, revenue we earned in 2013 for mortgage originations declined $3.4 billion from 2012. However over the same period, we had double-digit fee growth in brokerage, investment banking, cards and mortgage servicing. This diversification enabled us to generate double-digit earnings and earnings per share growth.","Let me start by highlighting some key drivers of our fourth quarter results from a balance sheet and income statement perspective, starting on page five. Our balance sheet has never been stronger. We increased our earning assets by 5% by growing loans, purchasing securities, an increase in short-term investments as deposit growth remained robust. We continued to increase our capital levels even as we returned $3 billion in capital to our shareholders including reducing common shares outstanding by 16.6 million shares in the fourth quarter. The improving economy and high quality loan originations continue to result in improved credit quality with net charge-offs declining to 47 basis points.","Turning to the income statement on page six. Revenue increased in the fourth quarter as we grew both net interest income and noninterest income. Net Interest income increased while our net interest margin declined 12 basis points. Our ability to grow noninterest income even as mortgage origination volume declined reflects the benefit of our diversified business model. On a linked quarter basis, we had strong fee growth in retail brokerage, trust and investment management, investment banking, card, commercial real estate brokerage, mortgage servicing and insurance.","Our efficiency ratio improved as expected. Our expenses declined driven by lower personnel costs which were partially offset by seasonally higher fourth quarter expenses for equipment and professional services as we continue to invest in our businesses and addressed evolving compliance and regulatory standards.","Let me now cover our business drivers in more detail. As shown on Page 7, we had strong loan growth, with period end loans up $26.2 billion or 3% from a year ago and up $13.5 billion from the third quarter or 7% annualized, with broad-based growth across almost all of our portfolios.","Our liquidating portfolio continued to decline and is now less than 10% of total loans. This is down from 22% at the time of the merger five years ago as we have reduced the size of this portfolio by $110 billion. Excluding our liquidating portfolio, our core portfolio grew by $39.8 billion, or 6% from a year ago and was up $16.7 billion from the third quarter.","We have grown our loans on a year-over-year basis for 10 consecutive quarters, and for the past seven quarters year-over-year growth has been at least 3%, despite run-off from our liquidating portfolio.","On slide eight, we highlight how broad-based our loan growth was in the fourth quarter. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2012, foreign loans grew $9.9 billion or 26% and included growth in trade finance and a UK CRE acquisition we completed in the third quarter. C&I loans were up $9.4 billion or 5% as we successfully grew loans in asset-backed finance, government banking and corporate banking.","Real estate 1-4 family first mortgage loans grew $8.6 billion, or 3%, even with the run-off from our liquidating portfolio and included growth in high quality non-conforming mortgages.","Auto loans were up $4.8 billion or 10%, reflecting record originations in 2013. Credit card balances were up $2.2 billion, or 9% with strong new account growth.","We generated strong deposit growth throughout the year and growth actually accelerated in the fourth quarter with average deposits growing $34.8 billion or 13% annualized from the third quarter. This growth was diversified across our businesses with strong consumer and commercial growth, while we continue to reduce our deposit costs, which were down five basis points from a year ago to 11 basis points.","Demonstrating the strength of our deposit franchise, we have successfully grown deposits while reducing our deposit costs for 13 consecutive quarters. We also successfully grew primary consumer checking customers in the fourth quarter, which were up a net 4.7% from a year ago, an increase from 3.9% last quarter.","As shown on page 10, we grew tax equivalent net interest income from a year ago and from the third quarter. In fact, our NII this quarter was the highest it's been in five quarters. Average earning assets grew $58.3 billion from the third quarter, up 5% reflecting increases in short-term investments, loans and investment securities.","Our ability to grow net interest income on both, the linked quarter and year-over-year basis, while our NIM declined is why we don't manage to the net interest margin but instead focus on growing net interest income.","Our NIM declined by 12 basis points from the third quarter to 3.26%. This decline was driven by two primary factors. First, our continued strong customer-driven deposit growth, which has little impact on net interest income, but is dilutive to the NIM, reduced the margin by six basis points.","The liquidity-related actions we took in the third and fourth quarter in response to increased regulatory liquidity expectations reduced the margin by six basis points. Balance sheet re-pricing and growth and variable income did not impact the NIM in the fourth quarter.","While the factors that reduced the net interest margin in the fourth quarter were largely P&L-neutral. We expect they will continue to impact the NIM in the near-term. Non-interest income increased $132 million from the third quarter with lower mortgage origination revenue offset by stronger trust and investment fees and higher mortgage servicing revenue. While mortgage banking revenue was down $1.5 billion from the fourth quarter of 2012, we had strong momentum across a number of our other businesses.","Let me highlight some of the year-over-year increases we had in non-interest income. Trust and investment fees were up $259 million with strong growth in brokerage asset-based fees, growth in our trust and investment business and higher Investment Banking fees. These businesses now account for 36% of our noninterest income, up from 28% a year ago.","Card fees were up $91 million benefiting from strong account growth and increased usage in both our credit and debit card businesses. Insurance was up $58 million from improved results in our crop insurance business. Deposit service charges were up $33 million from a year ago benefiting from strong account growth and increased treasury management services to our commercial customers.","As expected, our mortgage origination volume declined this quarter as highlighted on Page 12. We originated $50 billion of mortgages in the fourth quarter, down 38% from $80 billion in the third quarter. Refis declined 32% of origination volume and purchases increased to 68%, a significant mix shift from a year ago and we filed for 65% volume and purchases were only 35%. Our unclosed pipeline declined to $25 billion at the end of the quarter down 29% from the third quarter.","While still early in the quarter, we currently expect origination volumes in the first quarter to decline from the fourth quarter reflecting seasonality in the purchase market and lower refi volume, but we expect the rate of decline slow from the levels we had in the third and the fourth quarter. Our gain on sale margin was 1.77% in the fourth quarter, up from the third quarter but lower than the historical elevated levels we experienced in the second half of 2012 and the first half of 2013. While there are a lot of factors that impact the margin, we currently expect margins in the near term to remain in the range we saw in the second half of 2013.","Reflecting the lower origination volume we had lower incentive compensation expenses related to mortgage production in the third quarter. We also had lower personnel expenses reflecting a reduction of 5,300 mortgage FTEs we announced in the third quarter and additional reductions of approximately 1,150 FTEs announced in the fourth quarter. The full quarter run rate of these lower FTEs will be reflected in expenses in the first quarter. We reduced our retail mortgage fulfillment FTEs by nearly 50% since our peak staffing levels in the first quarter of 2013.","Our servicing revenue was up $205 million from the third quarter and up $459 million from a year ago as prepayment speeds have slowed. We announced at the end of the quarter an agreement with Fannie Mae which was fully covered through previously established mortgage repurchase accruals that resolved substantially all repurchase liabilities related to loans originated prior to 2009. Reflecting our agreement with Fannie Mae our outstanding repurchase demands were down 46% from the third quarter to $708 million. As a reminder, we announced last quarter a similar agreement with Freddie Mac. So we have resolved substantially all agency repurchase demands for loans originated prior to 2009. As a result outstanding repurchase demands were down $1.2 billion from a year ago and our repurchase reserve declined $899 million, the lowest level since the second quarter of 2009.","Expenses were stable from the third quarter, declining $17 million as shown on page 13. Salary expense was down $99 million reflecting lower mortgage banking staffing and severance expense. Incentive compensation expense was down $54 million driven by lower mortgage production revenue partially offset by higher investment banking and retail brokerage activity. A number of our expenses are typically higher in the fourth quarter such as equipment expense which was up $96 million due to seasonally higher annual license renewals.","Our outside professional services increased to $131 million which included higher project related spending on business investments and compliance and regulatory related initiatives. Our efficiency ratio improved to 58.5% in the quarter, down 62 basis points. While we have seasonally higher personnel costs in the first quarter, we will have lower project spending and lower mortgage expenses reflecting a full quarter run rate from reduced staffing. We expect that our efficiency ratio will remain within our target range of 55% to 59% in the first quarter.","Turning to our business segments, starting on page 14. Community banking earned $3.2 billion in the fourth quarter, up 12% from a year ago and down 4% from the third quarter. Retail banking continued to consistently grow cross-sell, achieving a record 6.16 products per household up from 6.05 products a year ago. Our credit card business continued to have strong results benefiting from seasonality and new account growth. We grew new accounts by 29% from a year ago and household penetration increased to 37%, up from 33% in the fourth quarter of 2012. Purchase volume grew 14% from a year ago. Our auto business had an outstanding year with record originations in 2013, up 26% from a year ago. This strong growth reflects the increase in sales and the benefit of our partnership with GM.","We remained focused on serving the needs of our small business customers as well. We extended $18.9 billion of new loan commitments to small business customers during 2013, up 18% from 2012 and grew our primary business checking customers by a net 4.7% in the fourth quarter compared to about year ago.","Wholesale banking earned $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter, up 4% from a year ago and up 7% from the third quarter. These results reflected strong deposit and loan growth, both up 7% from a year ago. Loan growth was broad-based and included strong growth in asset-backed finance, commercial real estate and international.","Our investment banking business continued to have strong growth with 2013 market share of 5.6%, up from 5% in 2012. This growth reflects the success we have had by focusing on relationships, with investment banking revenue from wholesale banking customers up 22% in 2013, including a 16% increase in revenue from existing, commercial and corporate customers.","Treasury management revenue was up 8% in 2013, reflecting strong sales growth and pricing increases. We continually invest in this businesses' products and platforms and have been expanding our team of treasury sales experts, because this is an important product for building relationships with our wholesale customers.","Our asset management business also had an outstanding year in 2013, with total assets under management up 8%, reflecting net client inflows and increased market valuations.","Wealth, brokerage and retirement earned $491 million in the fourth quarter, up 40% from a year ago and 9% from the third quarter. As you know, this is a business that we have been focusing on and investing in since managing more of our customers' wealth that is an important part of our vision of meeting our customer's financial needs.","Our results benefited from the improvement in the markets and strong net flows. WBR client assets grew 11% to $1.6 trillion from a year ago. This growth was broad-based and included retail brokerage managed account assets of $375 billion, up 23% and wealth management client assets of $218 billion, up 7%.","Institutional Retirement plan assets grew 12% from a year ago. We also had strong deposit and loan growth, with average core deposits up 7% and average loans up 12% from a year ago.","Turning to credit on Page 17, the significant improvement we had in credit quality throughout 2013 continued. With fourth quarter net charge-offs declining to only 47 basis points of average loans.","Loans in our commercial portfolio were only six basis points and consumer losses declined to 82 basis points. We continue to have strong improvement in our commercial and residential real estate secured portfolios. Our commercial real estate portfolios were once again in a net recovery position as they have been every quarter in 2013.","Our consumer real estate portfolios continued to benefit from the improvement in the housing market with losses down $918 million or 69% from a year ago. Non-performing assets declined $1.1 billion from the third quarter and were down $4.9 billion or 20% from a year ago.","Both, commercial and consumer non-accrual loans declined while foreclosed assets increased $135 million from the third quarter, reflecting an increase in government insured foreclosed assets, primarily driven by changes to loan modification programs which slowed foreclosures in prior quarter.","Reflecting the continued improvement in economic conditions, we had a $600 million reserve release, down $900 million last quarter. Given current favorable conditions, we expect future reserve releases absent a significant [duration] in the economy. We grew our estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III, a 9.78% in the fourth quarter, 78 basis points above our internal target of 9%.","While we have been building capital, we have also been focused on returning more capital to our shareholders. We increased our dividend by 31% in 2013 and purchased 124 million shares. We remain committed to returning more capital to our shareholders and our 2014 capital plan requested an increasing in our dividend and share repurchases compared with our 2013 capital plan. Of course our request is subject to Fed review and nonobjection.","In summary, our results in the fourth quarter and throughout 2013 were outstanding. We grew loans and deposits, increased our capital liquidity levels and reduced risk as our diversified businesses generated double-digit earnings and EPS growth. In addition we return $11.4 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. While the future is never certain, we start 2014 in a much better position than we started 2013. The slow and steady growth we had in 2013 positions the U.S. economy for continued growth in 2014. We successfully settled many outstanding issues during 2013 including pre-2009 agency repurchase demands, agency MBS securitization and the independent foreclosure review. We also have more clarity regarding Basel III capital requirements and have taken actions in response to increased regulatory liquidity expectations. We believe that we never been positioned better and we are excited about the opportunities ahead for our customers, our team members and our shareholders.","We will now open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","Good morning. Just circling back on the efficiency ratio and, I guess, specifically on the expenses here. As we think about entering 2014, what kind of growth expense base, you have got $12.1 billion roughly, there is some seasonal factor as some of the mortgage cost that need to come out. How should we think about that in a static revenue environment?","Tim Sloan","Well, I wouldn't worry about it being a static revenue environment. Our goal is to grow revenues over time and I think we have been able to do that, notwithstanding some of the challenges we have had. Matt, we are really focused as we think about our expenses on revenue efficiency and the efficiency ratio, how much it costs us to deliver a $1 in revenue. We were very pleased to be able to improve our efficiency to 58.5%, again down 62 basis points from the third quarter and down almost 30 basis points from the fourth quarter of last year.","I think when you think about the fourth quarter efficiency in expenses, we did call out that we had some seasonal expenses that boosted the total expenses in the fourth quarter. We talked about some of the equipment expenses as well as some of the professional fees. As you think about the first quarter, our expectation is that we will be able to operate within our range of 55% to 59% and believe that over the year, we can continue to improve that from the first quarter.","I do think we will have some benefit in the first quarter from lower seasonal expenses as we mentioned. We will also have some benefit from a lower run rate of expenses in the mortgage business but, overall, again we are very focused on the efficiency ratio and we continue to believe that we can make improvements.","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","And this is just a follow-up. Can you remind us what needs to happen to get to the lower end of the 55% to 59%? Obviously it's a range and you can show continued progress but that 55%, will that depend on a materially different macro environment or you can get there executing just what you can control?","Tim Sloan","Well, it's a fair point, Matt, because we look at the efficiency ratio, its going to be a function of expense dollars as well as revenue. I think to get to the low end of that range, we will need to see the combination of both, in crew expenses and lower expenses, which we think we can do over time but also with improved revenue. That said, if the revenue takes off and the dollar amount of our expenses are up and our efficiency ratio improves, that's fine too.","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","Just sneaking a quick one here. On the equity investment book, can you just remind us how big it is and is there any impact from Volcker on that portfolio?","Tim Sloan","Yes. A good question. Overall let me answer it maybe a little bit broader question and that is that as we look at the final Volcker rules, there aren't any real significant and material changes that we need to make in any of our businesses to comply. Obviously there is going to be increased reporting and things like that. The only the product business line that's really impacted, which is the [of your] question is the portion of our equity portfolio that's made up of limited partnership investment, that's a little bit less than $2 billion.","We stopped making those investments a few years ago when the first draft of the Volcker Rule came out and so that portfolio is liquidating down in the normal course. From time-to-time, we could potentially do some sales from that portfolio, but we don't believe that compliance with Volcker and the liquidation of that portfolio in the normal course will have a material impact on our financial results.","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","Okay. All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Hi. Good morning, Tim. I was wondering if you could give a little bit of color on the net interest margin and interest income outlook and your thoughts. I think you said you expect some ongoing pressure on the NIM. I am wondering if you could give us some of the puts and takes on that. How does the recent rise in a 10-year yield help you as you reinvest and then where are you on the liquidity actions? Do you still need to pick more there? Obviously, the rules aren't finish, but if you could give us a feel for your progress there.","Tim Sloan","I will answer your question in maybe reverse order. Maybe start with liquidity. Let me just step back and frame that a little bit, because you have seen us take some liquidity action in the third and the fourth quarter. Set the rules aside for a minute, and that is that first and foremost, we have got to be able to operate this company with sufficient liquidity to be able to withstand stressed environments both, in terms of an economic downturn as well as an economic expansion. I think, we have been able to demonstrate our success in doing that as we went through the last downturn, so the short answer is that we think that the existing liquidity we have as a company is sufficient to manage the business.","Having said that, there are a couple of standards that are out there. First, there's is the international standard and I can't comfortably tell you that we have exceeded the international LCR standards. Unfortunately, I can't tell where we stand as it relates to the domestic rules, because they haven't been finalized yet. The NPR was issued in the fourth quarter as you know. It's out for comment right now.","I think it's fair to say that you generally the current NPR is a little bit more conservative than most of the folks in industry have [got], and so in an anticipation of finalizing the domestic rules, the way that I would think about it is we have changed the complexion of our liquidity and what I mean by that is, we have increased some of our longer term deposits. You saw us do that in the third quarter and the fourth quarter and then we issued some additional debt in the third quarter, so we have made a lot of progress in terms of complying with rules that haven't been finalized yet.","The other thing that I would mentioned is that, there is a lot of good dialogue that's going on right now in terms of those rules and it's likely that there will be some changes. Then lastly I would point out that our expectation is the compliance period as it relates to those standards, theirs is going to be elongated meeting. We need to get to about 80% compliance by the end of this year, beginning of next year, so a long-winded overview, but I think what we have been able to demonstrate as we have changed the complexion of our liquidity and anticipated the final rules is that we can still deliver record earnings and we can still grow net interest income and that's really good segue into the first part of your question which is the net interest margin.","The net interest margin was down 12 basis points and the most of that was related to liquidity or deposits as we mentioned. In fact all of that was. Half of it was, we had great deposit growth. You have seen that over the last 16 quarters we have had great deposit growth, long-term that is a terrific thing from our perspective and will take that impact on NIM all day long.","Then the other half was related to the full quarter impact of liquidity actions that we took in the third quarter plus the liquidity actions that we took in the fourth quarter. So again, a reduction to the NIM but we have been able to grow net interest income.","So how were we able to do that with the NIM declining? Well, the good news is we had $13.5 billion dollars of point-to-point loan growth which is absolutely terrific. I can't promise you we will have that every quarter but not only is it terrific but results very broad-based, as I mentioned. And then also, our securities did grow and candidly, we are in a much better position today than we were six months ago or a year ago or a year and a half ago in terms of the reinvestment yields that we can achieve today versus the rolloff in the existing portfolio.","I can't tell you today because of the valley that occurred over last few days but they we will get pretty close. So over time, as we have said over the last few quarters, we believe that we continue to grow net interest income.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Okay, great, and then the second question is on capital return, and John mentioned your request to do more of this year than last year on capital return. When I think back here, April 2012 Investor Day, you laid out a goal for a total payout ratio of a range of 50% to 65%. I was wondering if anything has changed with you now exceeding your Basel III capital targets. Industry asset growth still seems sluggish such that you might reconsider at some point the upper bound of that target and at some point you will stop paying out more than 65% of total earnings?","Tim Sloan","Yes, it's a fair question. The short answer is no. We haven't changed that range of 50% to 65%. Part of the reason is that we are not at the high end of that range yet. So we are going to take it one step at a time. Clearly, we thought the payout that we had in 2013 was a pretty significant increases as we talked about. On a gross basis, f $11.4 billion. Something that we are very, very proud of and there are, as John mentioned and as I mentioned, our capital plans submission requested an increase from that. So we are hopeful to continue to make progress on that, subject to the Fed review but it is something, John, that we are going to continue to look at. But that that 50% to 65% is not etched in stone forever. It's going to change just like it has changed throughout our history.","John, I don't know if you --","John Stumpf","Yes, I think that's a really important point. It was a year and half when we came up with that. We are still there but those things change over time and as we continue to build liquidity and capital, we are not bound by that. And we are very shareholder friendly here. I think you know and our investors have known it for a long time.","Tim Sloan","But, John, I would add, Maybe this is a bit of an advertisement for our Investor Day that's going to be in May. We might change that. So let it be a good reason to come.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Okay, and you are kind of inflecting you are not reducing the share count on a net basis tenure overcoming option issue and things like that. Do you expect that to continue with a net reduction in shares?","Tim Sloan","Yes we do. Again, I can't promise it will exactly happen every quarter but my guess is, it probably will. But I think we reached the high point in the second quarter of last year and we have been very clear that our expectation is to continue to reduce that share count. So that's our plan, John.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America","Good morning.","Tim Sloan","Good morning, Erika.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America","I just wanted to take a step back. John, Wells Fargo has been able to post pretty good point-to-point loan growth, even with demand in the industry for loans being humdrum. That being said, as we look out to 2014, have we hit an inflection point in terms of loan demand on both the corporate side and the consumer side?","Tim Sloan","Inflection, meaning that loan growth is?","Erika Najarian - Bank of America","Grown demand in both the corporate side and the consumer side, loan demand didn't start picking up for the industry, generally.","Tim Sloan","I think there will be some loan growth at the industry level. I am much more confident about our ability to grow loans, just based on what we have done in the past, what we have done this past quarter. But I will tell you, I am hearing more, when I talk with customers, about their interest in building something, adding something, investing in something. So there is more activity going on, I would say it's going to be a watershed moment, but yes I am optimistic about the economy. I mean, we sit here this January at an economy and frankly as a company in better shape and I have said here in the last five or six Januarys, so, yes, I am [proudly] optimistic about the industry and optimistic about our company able to grow loans and over time grow revenues.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America","Got it. Tim, in terms of the future impact of incremental liquidity actions, I know the NPR in the U.S. is (Inaudible), but is it fair for us to assume that the bulk of future liquidity actions won't impact your margin as much as the six basis point this quarter?","Tim Sloan","I would love to be able to tell you absolutely, but since we don't know what the final rules are, I want to be careful, so I can't give you a specific answer. I think the important thing is, should you have confidence in, A, our ability to move forward to try to anticipate some of those rules and not have it impact our net interest income or our earnings, the answer is yes.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America","Got it. If I could sneak one last question in here, is it fair for us to look at the 12% quarter-over-quarter drop that the NBIA is forecasting for origination volume and it seems that the drop that Wells Fargo will experience next quarter be similar on a sequential basis?","Tim Sloan","I don't know if I would jump to that conclusion. Our mix is a little bit different or can be a little bit different on average compared to the industry in any given quarter. I think it's reasonable to assume that there will be a client because of the impact of just the colder winter months as well as the fact that the volume is really driven much more by purchase activity now than it was by refinanced. We expect the decline but to be specific in terms of the magnitude decline, I don't know what that's going to be.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets.","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","John Stumpf","Good morning, Joe.","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets","I guess, first is just a follow-up, a clarification from Erika's question. The loan growth in the core portfolio strengthened quite a bit this quarter to $16.7 billion from $8.6 billion. I understand that's fairly broad-based, but how sustainable do you think that is as we go through 2014 here?","John Stumpf","Joe, it's a fair question. I think, when you say the 8.6, you are talking about the 8.6 from a year ago?","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets","No. The third quarter. Just the sequential core growth in the core loan portfolio.","John Stumpf","The good news is that as you mentioned that the growth was very broad-based. Again, in almost every one of our loan portfolios, with the exception of home equity, where we are still originating a good quality home equity loans.","I don't know if I would take this quarter and say this is what we are going to do every quarter from here on out, I think even last year when you axe out the impact from some of the tax changes that folks were anticipating the fourth quarter can tends to be a pretty strong quarter.","Our expectation for 2014 is that we are going to grow loans. What rate that will be? I don't know, but certainly the fact that this quarter was so broad-based, I think it is a good indication of our ability to grow loans at a faster rate than we did in 2013. Again, I think the other point to make about loan growth in this quarter is that is that we didn't have any acquisitions driving that growth. This was all organic, not that there is anything wrong with acquisition. We love them, but that was a bigger driver in the third quarter that was in the fourth quarter.","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. That's helpful. Then the other question was just, wondering if you could kind of broadly speak about kind of key areas for investment in 2014 and along those lines what are your plans for the branch network given the growth in mobile banking and your recent piloted the neighborhood stores?","John Stumpf","Joe, we are making a lot of investments in technology as customers are interested in mobile and in other ways to access us. We still believe that stores are important and we believe that because our customers tell us that, and we do have that pilot that you mentioned and we are assessing that, looking at that. We will build stores this year. I don't think there will be a significant net increase because sometimes we build a new one and we consolidate one or two into that but most of the investments we are going to be making will be in areas like product and convenience for customers.","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets.","Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets","Yes. Thank you very much. Hi, guys. we know the mortgage market is on a downward trend. It looks the market is down another 25%, but you guys were down more than that, I think north of 30% and now your market share has dropped down to 17% and I also know that you guys have done a lot of refis and a lot of that is the refi side. I know you don't really model the market share but do you see continued declines in that mortgage space?","Then secondly, do you think that Mel Watt could be a game changer relative to opening up the credit box maybe with some of these going down the FICO score?","Tim Sloan","Yes, Paul, a good question. We have talked on a number of occasions about how our market share, over the last couple of years was disproportionately high, primarily because the biggest driver for origination volume until the last couple of quarters was refinances, and the reason for that, again to remind everybody, is that we are the largest servicer and the quality of our servicing book was the highest in the industry. So we had many more opportunities than most to be able to meet the needs of our customers by refinancing existing customers, by refinancing their mortgages. So it's not surprising and something that we had been indicating was going to occur as the percentage of refinance volume declined in absolute dollars as well as the percentage of the total decline that our market share would go down.","I think as we get to a more purchase driven market, we actually think we have got a great opportunity to grow the business because we have the biggest retail network and sales force in the market. So we believe that we can grow over time, but again the focus is not about market share the focus is about generating appropriate revenue, making sure that we are meeting the needs of our customers and doing that very efficiently. So again we are very excited about the transition into a purchase driven market because we got the best team and the largest team that's out there.","John Stumpf","Paul, with respect to Mel Watt, we are looking forward to working with him. We know him and I believe he has the same interest we all have, as Americans and as our institution has make mortgage lending and money available to creditworthy, Americans so they can buy houses. He already is digging in. He has put the increase to GP just on hold so he can understand. So we are all looking forward to working with him.","Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets","I mean, do you think the government could make some adjustments there to get the industry to maybe open up the credit box more than it is right now?","John Stumpf","Well, I still believe there are some mixed messages coming out of Congress or Washington, I should say, and if we can all get on the same page that would be helpful. I think there some movement happening in that direction, but we will just continue to work on that.","Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets","Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse","Great, thanks. Most of my questions have actually been answered. But just following up a little on the mortgage business. You have alluded to us in a couple of different narrations, but given how rapid that decline in refinance has been and it is likely to continue, are there any either other steps that you taking or strategic opportunities that you seek on in the business over the next couple of quarters?","Tim Sloan","Well, you know, we announced recently that we are going to be doing some portfolio lending for jumbos and high-end and we have an emphasis on that. And as you know, housing is an uniquely important asset class for Americans and uniquely important for recovery. So no recovery for housing in that play a leadership role and that's part of my optimism for the future and that housing is getting better and that we are seeing more activity on the purchase side, which is really good for America, so we will continue to make complying loans. We are also doing more with respect to our balance sheet.","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse","Is there just anything with respect to kind of integrating it somewhat more directly with the consumer bank?","John Stumpf","Well, I will tell you they are really - all hands are on deck there. I don't recall the exact percentage, but it might be 30% or so, but whatever mortgage we do get customer referrals from our bankers, so it's a big card. It's very integrated and actually when you have a purchased money market that actually plays to our strengths, because we are so actively involved with builders, realtors and there is a lot of referral activity that goes on to help serve those customers.","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Good morning.","John Stumpf","Hi, Mike.","Tim Sloan","Hi, Mike.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Just first a tactical question, the changes that accretable yield on purchased credit impaired loans, so this is back around page 33, 34, 35 of the news release or in the back section of it, but the drawdown there, the changes in accretable yield, I thought it would be drawn down even a little bit more in the fourth quarter.","It seems like it's been drawn down a lot year-over-year, but the last quarter it wasn't drawn down a lot. Just conceptually I thought the better credit quality for some of these problem loans, the more you can realize and recover to earnings and it looks like it slowed in the fourth quarter. Can you just give some color on that accounting and what you think?","Tim Sloan","Mike, there wasn't any major changes that occurred from an accounting standpoint in the fourth quarter. As you know from time-to-time we have look at the amount of our accretable yield and non- accretable difference and made some adjustments. We did not do that in the fourth quarter, so I would just describe the fourth quarter as just a reflection of just changes within the underlying customer mix. We had more customers that were paying their loans and then paid off, but there was nothing major that occurred in the fourth quarter.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","How can you take a look at that? Because, isn't it the case that with better credit quality that you would tend to realize some gains over time?","Tim Sloan","Mike, it's something that we think about and talk about a lot, but from a process point of view, we review it on a quarterly basis to make an affirmative decision in terms of the amount of the non-accretable difference and the non-accretable yield in terms of whether or not we make any changes, but that's the quarterly update that we do.","John Stumpf","Mike, you know as we make those determinations it then accretes over the life of the assets, so it's a long event, if you will, over 12, 13,14, years, whatever the life those assets is that how it accretes in.","Tim Sloan","I think the important point just to remember is that when you turned the clock back five years ago, I think there was a lot of skepticism in terms of whether or not the right marks were taken at the time of the Wells Fargo and Wachovia combination and then there was a lot of concerns about the portfolio. As you know the accretable yield has actually increased over that period of time, so we have $19.1 billion that's expected to accrete over the remaining life of loans. We are very excited about that.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Then a separate question, so what you can control and what you can't control, let's go to what you can control and that's the economy and you guys had talked about that some. What's the line utilization for commercial or wholesale in the most recent quarter?","Tim Sloan","It hasn't really changed a whole lot. It's still about or in the mid-30s, but that wasn't a major driver for loan growth in the quarter. At some point, we will get to the point where there's a little bit more utilization, but that's been pretty stable in the mid-30s.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Then separate from the market share, I know Wells would like to continue to gain. You seem more optimistic on economy, but line utilization hasn't really changed. It sounds like fourth quarter you had some good loan growth, but maybe it won't be quite as strong, seasonally strong, so do you really feel the economy is that much stronger or John, you said the best January in five to six years. Are you thinking next couple of quarters, next couple years? What drives you to that conclusion?","John Stumpf","Yes. When I was talking about the best January, that's compared to the five January's. I have sat and had this kind of conversation with you. Our merger is done. Capital liquidity, credit, legal issues, view on regulatory all better. Deposit growth, loan growth, cross-sell, the engagement of the team. So all of those things are better.","Am I saying there is a full recovery and there is going to be a watershed moment this year? No. I am not saying that but I am saying that uncertainty here, more things from more prospects and customers about buying a car, building a house, starting a business, adding new product lines. There is certainties to at least some that.","Couple of years, I didn't even hear about that. So its going to be a breakout year but we are going to see steady improvement and that's good for even now as rates rise in response to that which is a normal thing that reduces the refinance volume. The other side of that is improving credit which improves a lot of things. So that's good for America and good for our company over the long-term.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","And then lastly, what you certainly can control. I know you are proud of having 16 quarters in row of higher EPS growth but I down imagine you expect this level of equity investment gains to continue or this level of reserve releases to continue. You called out some seasonal expenses but how do you expect to continue that progression? What should be the main drivers?","Tim Sloan","Yes, Mike, look, we are not going to promise you that we are going to have a seventeenth consecutive quarter. We hope we do but the fact of matter is the complexion of every quarter is different. We could have that we, and I think we probably did have the same conversation about a year ago, how are we going to be able to grow, and when we think about what the company has accomplished over this last year in the face of a significant backup in interest rates that had a big impact on one of our businesses, we were able to deliver record earnings.","How were we able to do that? We grew our loans. We grew our investments. We grew our deposits. If you look at noninterest income outside of mortgage origination, we went through a laundry list of five or six businesses and there are more that were up and most of those were up double digits. We have improved our efficiency and John has mentioned we think we can continue to make progress there and credit continues to improve.","Will we have our loan loss reserve release in the first quarter of $600 million? I don't know. We do think we are going to have future loan loss reserve releases. So the fact of the matter is that what we have been able to demonstrate in the fourth quarter and all of 2013 is our diversified model works even in the face of headwind and as John mentioned it doesn't seem like there is as many headwinds out there than there were a year ago in January.","So we are very excited of our ability to continue to grow earnings. Whether that means 17, 18 or 19 quarters? I don't know. But over time we are going to grow earnings at this company.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Hi, good morning, guys. On the brokerage businesses, the business this year, the trust and investment fees grew 13% when you have a nice correlation. Just wondering, especially with the lag built-in on some of the pricing of the fee base, how confident do you feel that you can sustain that kind of mid-teens type of growth rate in that part of the company?","Tim Sloan","Yes, Ken, a good question. I don't know if I would focus on a specific growth rate. We do think we can continue to grow and its going to be a function of the fact there is a little bit of a lag in terms of how the business is priced and paid for. The wealth, brokerage and retirement business has done a great job in terms of increasing the percentage of their recurring fee revenue. I think it's now above 75% and that was the goal that David Carroll set out at our Investor Day a couple of years ago. So we do think we can continue to grow.","What the growth rate will be? I don't know but in addition, one of the other things that we talked about at Investor Day a couple of years ago was the partnership between the WBR and our retail bank and that partnership continues to work very well from a referral basis. So that business is performing very, very well. Our expectation is that it will continue to grow. I hope that it continues to grow at a double-digit rate, but can't promise you that.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Okay.","John Stumpf","Our expectations are pretty high there, because we are starting from a lower base. And if you look at size of our retail franchise versus the size of the wealth, brokerage and retirement, we have lot of upside. As Tim mentioned, the partnership especially between any bank and Wells Fargo's retirement couldn't be better and there is just tons of opportunity there, so it's opportunity for the company.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Okay. Great. Secondly with regard to the rate sensitivity, you guys did disclose your rate disclosures a little different than most others do and I am just wondering with regards to the liquidity preparation and the changes you have made and you have referred to earlier, how if it all any rules on liquidity side change at all your assets sensitivity when and if you someday we get the front-end moving? Maybe I will just leave it there.","John Stumpf","Good question. Really given the amount of liquidity build that we had in the third quarter, it didn't have a material impact on our total balance sheet. Did effect net interest margin as we mentioned, so it really doesn't have a big impact on our interest rate sensitivity. I mean, we have experienced that the biggest impact that we could have to the company from an interest rate sensitivity standpoint when you think about the impact that we had in the third and fourth quarter from the rate rise in the impact on the mortgage business, we are very sensitive to a rise in the short rate which I know everybody believes will never happen, but some day it will and that will be beneficial to us.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Okay. Great. Then last just quick question. The tax rate has been running a little bit lower. Do you have any thoughts on just what we should be thinking about as far as the future tax rate? Thanks, guys.","Tim Sloan","Yes. The tax rate for the fourth quarter was 30.9%. That was a little bit higher than the fourth quarter of last year. Our expectation for this year is that our tax rate will be plus or minus what has been this year. Maybe just a little bit higher, but I guess not that it shouldn't have a material impact on our results.","Jim Rowe","Regina, we will begin with the next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Mutascio with KBW.","Chris Mutascio - KBW","Good morning, John and Tim. How are you?","John Stumpf","Hi. Chris. How are you doing?","Chris Mutascio - KBW","I am doing well. Happy New Year.","John Stumpf","Happy New Year.","Chris Mutascio - KBW","Just two quick follow-up questions on the professional services cost that you highlighted being about 130 or so million higher on a sequential quarter basis. Then you broke that into different kind of buckets project spending and then also compliance and maybe regulatory related spend. Can you breakdown those two different buckets that calls the $130 million increase? Then just as a follow-up, how much of the compliance and regulatory related part of that is permanent or is not permanent?","Tim Sloan","Yes. Some really good question. One of the challenges that we have is that some of the investment that we are making, say, for a project impacts both is the investment in the business but also it's going to have a regulatory or compliance nature to it, so I don't have any detail handy to break that down, but it's not exactly how we think about it.","I will tell you that as we mentioned last quarter that our compliance and regulatory costs are up year-over-year and we are in the process right now of making sure that we got the best risk managed the company in the industry, so there will be some continued investment that we will need to make there.","Having said that, how much of that is permanent and how much is kind of a one or two time-type investment, I don't have an answer for you, so I apologize for not being able to provide some real specifics there, but again to repeat I do think you will see a decline in the professional services line in the first quarter.","Chris Mutascio - KBW","Okay. That's fair enough. A separate question. The net charge-off ratio was pretty stable with third quarter. I was kind of wondering did you think we finally has have had four on that ratio or could there have been some year-end cleanup in fourth quarter that would lead you to believe that maybe the charge-offs could go even lower in the first quarter.","Tim Sloan","I don't know for sure. Here's the way I would think about it. I will give you two numbers that made up the 47 basis points. The losses that we had in our commercial portfolio were about six basis points. We think we have got a great team that's very good at making loans on the commercial side but having a loss rate of six basis points is probably not something that's going to happen forever. So I think there's, probably over time, not necessarily in the first quarter, some pressure there.","On the other hand, the losses in our consumer portfolio were about 82 basis points. Now when you think about the composition of the consumer portfolio, clearly, there is some portion of that portfolio that's going to have higher loss rates like credit card. That's an area that we are building over time.","On the other hand, when you look at some of the other consumer businesses, we are not originating loans today that are going to generate 82 basis points of loss in the next year or two years. We are originating high quality loan. So my guess is there is probably a little bit more pressure over time and the commercial loss rate to go up and the consumer loss rate could go down. Again when you look at that 82 basis points, the disproportionate share continues to come from our home equity portfolio which among all the portfolios is really benefiting from the improvement in underlying residential real estate values.","Chris Mutascio - KBW","Fair enough. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Guggenheim Securities.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Partners","Hi, I wanted to ask you two lines of questioning. First, on the share count. If you look at the repurchase volume that you have been able to do, share count is holding relatively flat. I was curious if you thought, as you increased repurchase going forward, do you think the share count can start to come down? And then, I wanted to ask you one more question about that.","Tim Sloan","Marty, in fact the share count has been down from the high in the second quarter of last year and the short answer to your question is, yes. The primary driver there is going to be the level of our share repurchases. We increased our share repurchases this year over last year. We have submitted a capital plan which calls for a request for more share repurchase. So the short answer again is, yes. We think we can bring that down over time.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Partners","The impact of equity compensation, would you think the dilution that you do have that offsets some of the share repurchase. Would that be more from issuance or more from market price appreciation?","Tim Sloan","Well, it's a complicated answer to a straight forward question and recall that we changed our options program a couple of years ago or a few years ago. So the impact of that is going to decline. On the other hand, we will continue to have a good portion of our incentive compensation around here based upon our equity because we believe that that aligns our team members with our shareholders.","So the fact that that is there is very important to us and hopefully, you will appreciate it's important to you but I don't imagine that that's going to have a significant change to the share count calculation. The primary driver there is going to be our ability to repurchase more shares and, again, we think we can increase that over time.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Partners","Okay, other kind of area I want to delve into was asset sensitivity. Earlier questions were kind of starting to allude to that but as you have seen this outsize deposit growth that you have been able to attract, you have been really pushing that more and more into cash. So that does make you more asset sensitive than probably your just overall measure with look and then also as longer term rate start to go up, you can begin to be able to restructure the portfolio a little bit. You have got excess capital. There is going to be some opportunities to accelerate asset sensitivity by restructuring as well. So just thought you could think about a few of those kind of tactics or other things that might make you be more asset sensitive than you look on the cover of your reports.","Tim Sloan","Well, you are absolutely correct. We are very asset sensitive. The disproportionate share of our loan portfolio is floating-rate in an environment where the short-end of the curve starts to increase which, at some point it will. We believe that that will be a net addition to revenues because our loans will probably reprice faster than our deposits. You have seen that before with Wells Fargo in prior cycles.","In terms of the investment portfolio, you are also correct, in that given the back up in rates and the current yields that we are getting off our portfolio, we can get much more attractive returns that are more or less about what the runoff is right now. Not exactly, but as rates continue to rise, it's going to make those returns even more attractive and we will get some benefit from a revenue standpoint there, so we think we are positioned fairly well for the environment that we are likely to be in over the next few years which is in the short-term probably an increase in the long end of the curve. I don't know by how much, but it probably will increase. Then in the next year to two years an increased short end.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Partners","Then lastly, John, you mentioned the mortgage portfolio and increasing the volume there. With the GDPs going up here shortly, especially on a higher quality customers, those low GDPs historically have pushed us to origination and servicing versus portfolio and mortgages, but it seems like you are really looking at that as an opportunity, especially with the steep yield curve to add some assets plus value especially as mortgage rates relatively adjusted to these new GDPs.","John Stumpf","That's right. My understanding is the latest increase in GDPs is the one that would suggest it has actually been put on a hold for a bit, but absent that yes, we think there is opportunity here to serve a customer base through portfolio lending and we have done that for a long time, but there's opportunities here and we sure want to serve that customer base.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Partners","Thanks.","John Stumpf","Thanks, Marty.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Keith Murray with ISI.","Keith Murray - ISI","Hi.","John Stumpf","Hi, Keith.","Tim Sloan","Hi, Keith.","Keith Murray - ISI","I just wanted to ask what's your home price assumptions as you think about sizing the mortgage business and on the credit side as well, what do you assume for home prices for '14?","John Stumpf","We think probably a lot where most economists are in the range of 3% to 5% increase if you look broadly. Now I think what you are seeing is some more regionalization going on in residential real estate, so I mean I live in San Francisco. It's been stronger here than for example than in the Central Valley, but housing is getting better generally everywhere but I think 3% to 5% is a pretty safe range.","Keith Murray - ISI","Okay. Then just going back to the payout ratio specifically on dividends, you were right at 30% for 2013 on dividend payout. As you think about approaching this year's CCAR, what are you comfortable with on the dividend payout ratio? I know, above 30% gets you extra scrutiny. How do you think about the dividend payout?","John Stumpf","Well, I can just repeat what Tim and I have said is that the submission is in. It's our request to do more on dividends and repurchase. It's in with the fed right now. We will all know here in another six weeks or so, so let's just wait for that time and see when that comes out.","Keith Murray - ISI","Okay. Thanks a lot.","John Stumpf","Thank you. I want to thank everybody for joining us, I very much appreciate your interest in our company and the questions and we will see you next quarter. Thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for participating and you may now disconnect."],"21678":["Wells Fargo & Company.

[Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Rowe, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Rowe, you may begin your conference.","Jim Rowe","Thank you, Regina, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf, and our CFO, John Shrewsberry will discuss third quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our third quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I\u2019d also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today\u2019s call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings; including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement.","Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our website.","I will now turn our call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf.","John Stumpf","Thank you, Jim. And thank you, good morning and thanks for joining us today. We earned $5.8 billion in the third quarter, as our diversified business model generated growth in revenue, loans, deposits and net income compared with a year ago. We remain focussed on meeting the financial needs of our customers and are investing in businesses so we may continue to meet the evolving needs of our customers in the future. The strength of our franchise also positioned us well for the acquisitions we have recently announced. We are excited that the transactions with GE Capital will enable us to deepen relationships and increase our presence in commercial businesses that serve the real economy.","General Electric, like Wells Fargo is one of America\u2019s great companies and the businesses we are acquiring are industry leaders with proven business models and exceptionally talented and experienced people. We are excited to have them join the Wells Fargo team. John Shrewsberry will provide more details on the recent GE Capital announcements at the end of the call.","Let me now highlight our results this quarter compared with the year ago. We earned $1.05 in earnings per share, up 3% from a year ago. We generated $21.9 billion of revenue, up 3% with growth in both net interest income and non-interest income. We grew pre-tax, pre provision profit by 6%.","We continue to have broad based loan growth with total loans reaching a record $903.2 billion. This is a bit larger than the size of our loan portfolio at the time of the Wachovia merger at the end of 2008. However, the quality of our current portfolio is significantly better than at the time of the merger.","Our core loan portfolio increased by $73.4 billion, or 9% from a year ago reflecting both strong organic growth and the benefit of the acquisitions we have completed over the past year. Our deposit franchise once again generated strong customer and balanced growth with total deposits reaching a record $1.2 trillion up $71.6 billion or 6% from a year ago and we grew the number of primary consumer checking customers by 5.8%.","Our financial performance resulted in strong capital generation and returning capital to our shareholders remains our priority. Our dividend payout ratio is 35% and we repurchased 52 million shares of common stock in the third quarter.","Turning to the economic environment, the global economy showed some signs of weakness in the third quarter, primarily in China and other emerging markets. This weakness impacted the financial markets and the rising value of the U.S. dollar has caused the trade deficit to widen.","As you know, Wells Fargo is a U.S. centric company and the U.S. economy while not immune to these developments has proven quite resilient. The low energy prices that are negatively impacting certain aspects of the economy have provided a welcome boost to consumers with many now beginning to redirect their savings into purchasing goods and services.","As an example, new auto sales were at their highest levels in a decade. Housing continued to rebound with home sales at their highest level since 2009 and a limited supply of homes of new homes are driving new home constructions and while the latest jobs report was disappointing relative to expectations the labor market continue to show steady gains with September posting the 60th consecutive month of rising employment something never before accomplished and the unemployment rate is at a level that many consider to be the long term norm.","As the U.S. and the world economies evolve, Well Fargo remains focussed on the building blocks of our growth. Increasing the number of household reserve, adding commercial relationships, deepening consumer and commercial relationships and growing loans and deposits, this focus will benefit our long term growth while we continue to meet our customers financial needs and navigate the challenges of today\u2019s economy.","John Shrewsberry, our CFO will now provide more details on our third quarter results. John?","John Shrewsberry","Thank you, John and good morning everyone. My comments will follow the presentation included in the quarterly supplement, starting on Page 2. John and I will then answer your questions.","Our third quarter results demonstrated consistent financial performance and momentum across a variety of key business drivers. We continued to have strong loan and deposit growth across our diversified commercial and consumer businesses. We grew revenue by generating growth in net interest income and non-interest income. We produced positive operating leverage as our expenses declined.","Credit quality remained strong with net charge-offs of only 31 basis points of average loans and we operated within our targeted ranges for ROA, ROE, efficiency and net payout ratio. Let me now highlight these key drivers in more detail.","On page three, we showed the strong year-over-year growth John highlighted including revenue, pre-tax, pre provision profit, loans, deposits, net income and EPS and we reduced our common shares outstanding by 106.5 million shares over the past year.","Turning to page four, we continued to benefit from the strength of our balance sheet which has positioned us well to take advantage of growth opportunities including our recently announced acquisitions. We grew total assets by 7% from a year ago and 2% from second quarter with growth in loans, short term investments and investment securities. Our funding sources increased with continued deposit growth and increased long term debt and short term borrowings.","Turning to the income statement overview on page five, revenue increased $557 million from the second quarter with growth in net interest and non-interest income and we generated positive operating leverage as expenses declined.","As shown on page six, we had strong broad based loan growth in the third quarter, our 17th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Our core loan portfolio grew by $73.4 billion or 9% from a year ago and was up $17.1 billion from the second quarter. Commercial loans grew $9.4 billion and consumer loans grew $7.7 billion from the second quarter.","Our total loan portfolio is balanced between commercial and consumer loans with commercial loans now 50% of our portfolio. Our portfolio has become more balanced as we have experienced run off in our liquidating consumer portfolios and have growth our commercial portfolios through organic growth and acquisition.","On page seven, we highlight the diversity of our loan growth. C&I loans were up $38 billion or 15% from a year ago, the growth was diversified across our wholesale businesses with double digit year-over-year growth and asset backed finance, corporate banking, commercial real estate, structured real estate and government and institutional banking. Commercial real estate loans grew $12.8 billion or 10% from a year ago and included the second quarter of GE Capital transaction and organic growth.","Core 1-4 family first mortgage loans grew $15.3 billion or 7% from a year ago and reflected continued growth in high quality non-conforming mortgages. Credit card balances were up $4 billion or 14% from a year ago benefitting from strong new account growth, more active accounts and the Dillard\u2019s portfolio acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2014.","Auto loans were up $3.9 billion or 7% from last year. We had record new originations in the third quarter up 10% from a year ago reflecting the strong auto market while we have remained disciplined in our approach.","As highlighted on page eight, we had $1.2 trillion of average deposits in the third quarter up $71.8 billion from a year ago and up $13.6 billion from the second quarter. This growth was broad based across our commercial and consumer businesses. Our average deposit cost was 8 basis points down 2 basis points from a year ago and stable with the second quarter. We continued to successfully grow our primary consumer checking customers which were up 5.8% from a year ago and our primary small business and business banking checking customers increased 5%.","Page nine highlights our revenue diversification and the balance between spread and fee income. Our earning asset mix results and diversified sources of interest income and the drivers of fee generation are diverse also. We had strong equity gains in the third quarter comprising 9% of our fee income up from 5% last quarter and 7% a year ago. Our total market sensitive revenue which includes trading and gains from debt and equity investments increased $210 million from second quarter but was down slightly from a year ago.","We grew net interest income $516 million or 5% from a year ago, reflecting strong growth in loans and securities and by adding duration to the balance sheet. The $187 million increase in net interest income from the second quarter reflected growth in investments and loans including the benefit from the GE Capital loan purchase and financing transaction related to commercial real estate assets that settled late in the second quarter.","Net interest income also reflected one additional day in the quarter accounting for about one third of the increase from the second quarter. These benefits were partially offset by reduced income from variable sources including purchased credit impaired loan recoveries, periodic dividends and loan fees.","The net interest margin declined 1 basis points from the second quarter. The decline was due to customer driven deposit growth which reduced the margin by 3 basis points, but had minimal impact to net interest income. Lower income from variable sources also reduced the margin by 3 basis points, these decreases were partially offset by balance sheet growth and repricing driven by security purchases and higher loan balances which benefited the margin by 5 basis points.","As I have discussed previously our view on interest rates has evolved over the past year to be more of a lower for longer expectation for both short term and long term rates. As a result, we\u2019ve been adding duration to our balance sheet, however our balance sheet remains asset sensitive and we are positioned to benefit from higher rates and we expect to be able to grow net interest income over the long term even if the rate environment continues to be challenging.","Total non-interest income increased $370 million from second quarter, driven by higher equity gains, other income, deposit service charges and card fees. Gains from equity investments were up $403 million from the second quarter reflecting strong results from venture capital, private equity and other investments. We recognized gains on more than 10 different holdings demonstrating the diversity of our equity portfolio and our long term commitment to this business.","Non-controlling interest reduced the impact of the equity gains through our net income and increased $120 million from the second quarter. The other non-interest income category was up $406 million in the third quarter driven by the impact of lower interest rates on our long term, our long term debt hedges.","As a reminder, we required from an accounting perspective to measure the hedge effectiveness at the end of each quarter and while the net impact is generally expected to be zero over the life an instrument, interest rate and currency volatility can cause this line item to vary from quarter to quarter.","Other income also increased from higher income on our equity method investments as well as the gain on our sale of warranty solutions which happened in the third quarter.","Mortgage banking revenue declined $116 million from the second quarter. Origination volume of $55 billion was down 11% from the second quarter reflecting the expected seasonal slowdown in the purchase market, but was up 15% from a year ago benefitting from a stronger housing market. 66% of originations were for purchases in the third quarter up from 54% in the second quarter.","We ended the quarter with a $34 billion application pipeline down 11% from the second quarter but up 36% from a year earlier. Based on the current rate environment, the level of our pipeline and the seasonal slowdown in the purchase market we currently expect originations in the fourth quarter to be lower than the third quarter.","Our production margin on residential held for sale mortgage originations was 188 basis points in the third quarter. This ratio has been refined from how it was determined in prior quarters in an effort to provide investors with better information on a residential originate and sell business. Based on our updated approach, we currently expect our production margin in the fourth quarter to remain within the range of the past five quarters at 170 basis points to 195 basis points.","As shown on page 12, expenses were down $70 million from the second quarter. The decline was primarily due to lower employee benefits from reduced deferred compensation expense which was largely offset in trading, expenses also benefited from lower advertising expense and reduced insurance expense reflecting seasonally lower, premium driven compensation costs in crop insurance.","We also made a $126 million contribution to the Wells Fargo Foundation which increased other non-interest expense. Operating losses were stable from the second quarter but they remained higher than the five quarter average as we continued to have elevated litigation accruals for various legal matters.","We continued to invest in our businesses with particular focus on risk, cyber and technology projects. These investments partially reflected in higher outside professional services expense in the quarter. Our efficiency ratio improved to 56.7% in the third quarter. We are focussed on managing expenses, partially reflected in the 27% reduction in travel and entertainment expense from a year ago as we reduced non-customer facing travel, however we expect to operate at the higher end of our target efficiency ratio range of 55% to 59% for the full year 2015 and until our revenue benefits from higher rates we expect to remain at the upper end of that range.","Turning to our business segment, starting on Page 13, community banking earned $3.7 billion in the third quarter, up 7% from a year ago and up 10% from second quarter. One of the drivers of our long-term growth is our ability to attract new households to Wells Fargo.","Year-to-date through August, we\u2019ve had the strongest new retail bank household growth in four years, and during the third quarter we announced an initiative that makes the experience of opening an account easier for the millions of consumers which used to bank with us.","Our new and existing customers are increasingly using our digital offerings with active online customers up 8% and active mobile customers up 17% from a year ago. We are growing our credit and debit card businesses through new customer growth and increased usage among existing customers. Credit card purchase volume was $18 million up 15% from a year ago and debit card purchase volume was $71 million up 8% from a year ago.","Our Wells Brokerage and Retirement segment has been renamed Wealth and Investment management, reflecting the realignment of our asset management business from wholesale banking into wealth and investment management. We also moved our reinsurance business from wealth and investment management and our strategic auto investments from community banking into wholesale banking. These changes are part of our regular course of business. We are always looking for ways to better align our businesses, deepen existing customer relationships and create a best-in-class structure to benefit both our customers and our shareholders. For comparative purposes prior period segment results have been revised to reflect these changes.","Despite a challenging equity market environment, wealth and investment management earned $606 million in the third quarter up 10% from a year ago and up 3% from the second quarter. These results reflect a strong balance sheet growth and net interest income growing 18% from a year ago.","Average core deposits grew 6% from a year ago and loans grew 16% in the ninth consecutive quarter of double digit year-over-year growth. Loan growth was driven by an increase in high quality non-conforming mortgage loans and security based lending.","Retail brokerage and managed account assets were flat from a year ago and down 6% from second quarter, the length quarter declined reflected the weak equity markets. As a reminder, managed account asset fees are priced at the beginning of the quarter so fourth quarter fees will reflect the weaker September 30th market valuations.","Wholesale banking earned $1.8 billion in the third quarter, down 8% from a year ago and 13% from second quarter. The length quarter decline was driven by lower non-interest income primarily as a result of lower equity investment gains and reduced sales in trading and investment banking activity reflecting market volatility.","Balance sheet growth remained strong with average loan growth of 15% from a year ago. This growth benefited from the GE Capital loan purchase related to commercial real estate assets that closed last quarter and also reflected broad based growth across most wholesale businesses. Average core deposits grew 12% from a year ago. Treasury management revenue continued to grow up 9% from a year ago driven by new sales of treasury management solutions.","Turning to Page 16, credit quality remained strong in the third quarter. Our net charge-off rate was 31 basis points of average loans, up slightly from second quarter primarily from seasonally higher auto losses.","Non-performing assets have declined for 12 consecutive quarters and were down $1.1 billion from the second quarter. This improvement was broad based driven by improvements in our commercial and consumer real estate portfolios.","We did not have a reserve release in the third quarter; the first quarter was no reserve release since the first quarter of 2010. While we continue to benefit from improvements in the performance of our residential real estate portfolio we also increased commercial reserves reflecting deterioration in the energy sector. As a reminder, only 2% of our total loans outstanding are in the oil and gas sector and we continue to work proactively with our customers as we manage through the current industry cycle.","We've started the fall redeterminations and reserve-based energy loans are performing as expected. We believe the energy services sector will incur greater challenges in the near term as it adjusts to lower commodity prices and this view was reflected in our reserving process.","We\u2019re also monitoring all loan types in MSAs where greater than 3% of employment is directly tied to oil production. To date, while we have not experienced measurable differences in the portfolio of performance between oil and non-oil communities, overtime we would expect some co-related stress in communities that are dependant on oil and gas.","Future allowance levels whether they are higher or lower will be driven by a variety of factors including loan growth, portfolio performance and general economic conditions.","Turning to Page 17, our capital level remains strong with our estimated common equity tier-1 ratio under Basel-3 fully phased in at 10.7% in the third quarter. We returned $3.2 billion to shareholders in the third quarter through dividends and net share repurchases and our net payout ratio was 60%.","In summary, our third quarter results demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model with strong growth in loans and deposits and revenue growth reflecting higher net interest and higher non-interest income.","Our returns are among the best in the industry with an ROA of 132 basis points and an ROE of 12.62%. Our strong liquidity and capital positions us well to serve our existing customers while growing our customer base organically and through acquisitions.","Let me conclude by highlighting the transactions we\u2019ve announced over the past couple of weeks. We summarized these announcements starting on slide 20. As John mentioned earlier, operating from a position of strength allows us to make quality acquisitions that help us serve more markets and meet more of our customer\u2019s financial needs. In connection with these transactions, we\u2019ve maintained our long standing discipline due diligence process and our strong capital position provides us with the capacity to acquire these businesses and assets.","I\u2019ll start by highlighting the largest transaction which involves approximately $32 billion of assets. Yesterday, we announced an agreement to acquire GE Capital\u2019s commercial distribution, finance and vendor finance businesses as well as certain corporate finance loan and lease assets. Over 600 Wells Fargo team members were involved in the evaluation and due diligence which occurred over the past few months. This agreement provides us with a unique opportunity to add relationships and earning assets in businesses where GE Capital was an unequivocal market leader and where we either have meaningful experience or in the case of commercial distribution finance is a strong compliment to our existing capabilities.","These businesses have established in deep relationships with their customers and we are excited about the opportunity to enhance these relationships with the breadth of our product offerings. These businesses are run by experienced teams with average tenures of over 20 years. We will also benefit from the acquisition of GE Capital state of the art customer facing systems that will create efficiencies. We expect this transaction to close in the first quarter of 2016 with minimal impact on our liquidity position.","Over the medium to long term, we plan to fund the acquisition with anticipated growth and deposits and in the short term we will likely have to increase our borrowings to preserve our liquidity position.","Similar to the GE Capital transaction related to commercial real estate assets that closed in the second quarter, the loans releases roughly 90% based in U.S. and Canada will be recorded a fair value inclusive of a life time credit loss at close, including transition cost related to integrating these businesses we expect this acquisition to be neutral to modestly accretive to our 2016 results.","At the end of September, we also announced an agreement to acquire GE railcar services, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2016. This transaction involves 77,000 railcars and just over 1000 locomotives as well as associated operating at long term leases that will be added to our existing First Union Rail business, making us the second largest railcar and locomotive leasing company in North America.","Similar to GE Capital transaction that they completed earlier this year, we were able to find a partner, in this case, a Berkshire Hathaway Company, to agree to acquire the assets that did not align well with our business strategy. This acquisition will add to the quality and diversification of our existing fleet and add to our capacity to meet the industries growing demand for railcars.","Just to summarize the timing related to our GE transactions, our results this quarter include the impact from the GE Capital transaction related to commercial real estate assets that closed in the second quarter and we expect to close in the first quarter of 2016 the GE railcar transaction and the GE Capital transactions we announced yesterday.","John and I will now be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Joe Morford","Thanks. Good afternoon everyone -- good morning, everyone. Still too early.","John Stumpf","Hi, Joe, good morning.","Joe Morford","Just -- I guess following up first on the last comments about the GE Capital acquisitions, just I guess curious to learn a little bit more about fit with the existing platform that you have where some of the synergies are. And then, any color you may be able to share in terms of the profitability of these businesses or the relative yields. I guess I was a little surprised you're saying maybe only modest earnings accretion. Is that due to some of the expenses you're bringing on with their staff and\/or the higher near-term borrowing costs?","John Stumpf","So with respect to the first part of your question, Joe the businesses line up well as we said the commercial distribution finance business is an asset based lending business that operates between OEMs on the one hand and the distributors on the other. It will fit in Well Fargo alongside what we describe as Well Fargo Capital Finance, our ABL business. The GE team has leadership and speciality in their version of ABL lending but of course we\u2019ve got the team that\u2019s been together for 20 plus years in ABL and this will complement them nicely. And as we mentioned the technology that they used to run their business is also something that we think we can benefit from in our broader business overtime.","The vendor finance business aligns well with our equipment finance business. Our equipment finance business tends to focus on the users of equipment, their equipment finance business has big relationships with OEMs who are selling equipment and so we think that they are very complimentary when put together.","With respect to the question about 2016 accretion, we think there will be plenty of expenses in order -- people expenses, technology integration expenses, premises expenses perhaps another thing. So we're focused on doing that integration the right way. It's going to take some time. We're going to be very thoughtful about it. And we're more focused on the medium to long term impact than what this means in 2016.","John Shrewsberry","Joe, I've been around the acquisition game for a long time and what we typical have said in the past and this is probably truer with the depository that we look for accretion by year three. It will happen sooner in this case, because its not as complex, but we have learned that to do these things well you practice on yourself not on your customers. You get everything done right and we really look at this as John mentioned, as a long-term value-add to the company. So things that closed in the first quarter you bound to have expenses around integration to get this really done right.","John Stumpf","Actually Joe, you also asked about funding. And that is part of the equation here. We will be term funding components of this, so it's not as easy as absorbing existing cash. I think some of the early analyst reports have reflected that belief. So, we'll be layering in some term funding in advance of the assets coming on. Then we'll have some incremental costs et cetera and we're trying to maintain our liquidity buffers through and after the addition of these assets. So, makes it a little bit more complicated than some of the math that I've seen so far.","Joe Morford","Okay. That's all really helpful. I appreciate that color. I guess the other question was just I recognize the equity investment gains this quarter really came from a number of different investments. But any color on maybe what's a good run rate there or just maybe market sensitive revenues overall, recognizing they were down a couple hundred million this quarter?","John Shrewsberry","In both cases I would look at something like a five-quarter average of equity gains on its own and then equity gains, gains on debt and trading activities as well. I think they're probably more representative of a run rate.","Joe Morford","Okay. Thanks so much.","John Shrewsberry","You're welcome, Joe.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.","Marty Mosby","Thanks for taking my questions. You talked about the expenses being elevated with legal, and last quarter there was about a $225 million increase. Is that still the same number that's kind of embedded in the overall operating expenses this quarter?","John Shrewsberry","Marty, there is going to be a run rate of what we had last quarter, where we are this quarter probably for a period of time. I mean, each individual legal matter is its own thing and we can't comment on litigation. But I would think of them as part of the environment that we're in and operating losses in total are probably going to remain about where they are. If they begin to come back down, that would be great. But I wouldn't consider this to be outsized at, call it, $500 million for the quarter for total operating losses.","Marty Mosby","The other thing is that you look at wholesale banking, that's where you see some of the pressures that we have seen in other banks with capital markets activities. You had the reduction in the fee income but not much reduction in expenses. You talked about compensation expenses going lower but were offset by losses. Can you break those two things out so we can get a feel for the two components in the expense line?","John Shrewsberry","So I would expect the expenses that are directly related to revenue to generally, especially over the course of the year to reflect their production of revenue might not be as linear from quarter to quarter as revenue moves up or down. And that's been true for some time. We have operating losses like a legal settlement for example, that will temporarily elevate expenses in that business unit at the firm while they may remain elevated, they don't necessarily remain elevated in wholesale banking or in any individual segment.","So I wouldn't expect for example, compensation expenses cycle for the firm as a whole or for the division as a whole as a result of a one time in an operating loss. But all told, I would say that we pay for performance in that group. Our total approach to performance based comp seems to hold very well with the revenue sources that we have and the operating and the results of the segment make sense to the cycle or frankly for any full year.","Marty Mosby","Thanks. Any further duration extension on the assets structure given the outlook that rates will stay lower for longer? I appreciate.","John Shrewsberry","Not much. You can see that we added a few billion dollars of net securities to our investment portfolio. We like where we are from an asset sensitivity standpoint today. We're going to be adding these incremental assets that we talked about in connection with the GE portfolio, some of which are leases, so you think of them as a little bit longer term and fixed rate which will have the same impact as adding securities. So, we've slowed down a little bit in adding duration in the third quarter compared to the second quarter which I think you can see in the deck and we still have conviction that we're probably in a lower for longer rate scenario.","Marty Mosby","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Mike Mayo","I just wanted to follow-up on that last comment. You believe you're in a lower for longer rate environment. Do you think the U.S. economy is getting better or worse, I guess, I'm hearing on the one hand John you're mentioning some additional confidence in some areas. On the other hand you mentioned global economy is being the headwind, so which is it? Is the U.S. economy getting better or worse?","John Stumpf","Yes, Mike, it\u2019s a good question. I think \u2013 we think it's getting better, but only incrementally better. So, as we \u2013 none of us know of course, but this year the GDP in the U.S. let's call it 2\/1 maybe 2\/2, maybe next year as maybe 2\/5 something like that, 2\/4 to 2\/5, so better but not substantially better. You know us well, so you know that most of our business is U.S. centric, but clearly some of our businesses that we support and do business with have a international component to them, either sales or whatever the case is and the rest of the world, the biggest risk I think the U.S. economy is what's happening in the rest of the world, I think that's unquestionable. So \u2013 but better but not hugely better.","John Shrewsberry","With respect to rates lower for longer applies. We think of it is at the short end and the medium to long end of the curve and so the Fed starts moving rates in December or in the first quarter, we will be sitting here a year from now we think with one, two or three, 25 basis point moves under our belt at probably best case with respect to how far things might move. And unless there's meaningful inflation which isn't anybody's radar screen right, than it doesn't feel like that's going to have an impact on long terms rates, it feels like more of a flatter curve environment and long rates in the vicinity of where they are now and what something really different begins to emerge.","And of course like good news is for round about our forecast we performed better. We're constructing ourselves to do well in this environment. But if we end up in a higher short term or higher long-term rate environment than we're forecasting that's actually, that's not good for Wells Forgo.","Mike Mayo","With that expectation are you taking the second look at expenses, I mean, your efficiency ratio this quarter moved in a better range, but do you have a plan B to say, we expect these headwinds to last for longer, therefore we're going to do something extra?","John Shrewsberry","Yes. I describe it as a full time plan B, which is they were always looking a way to be more efficient. We highlighted a couple of them over the last few quarters. We took a hard look at T&E a year ago. We're down 25% year-over-year. We've talked about our real estate strategy we where shrunk by 20 million square feet over the last few years and still have more to go. As there are varieties of programs like that, but most of that savings gets absorbed by areas where we're changing or improving the firm. We're spending money on compliance, on risk management, on technology, on innovation. So I've got some conviction that we're not going to move below the higher end of our range, while we're still in this lower rate environment because whatever savings we get by being thrifty we end up reinvesting into the programs that I mentioned.","John Stumpf","Yes. Just to put an emphasizes on that Mike, expenses get a lot of discussion around here and we are keenly focus on them, because as John mentioned he saved \u2013 and we think of it in ways of what will the customer pay for and what makes us a stronger long term provider of services to our customers and to be a more relevant company to all our constituents. And you save in one side and you invest on the other side. And some of those investments have been fairly significant. But it\u2019s a constant drumbeat around here.","Mike Mayo","All right. Thank you.","John Shrewsberry","Thank you, Mike.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Erika Najarian","Yes, good morning. Just to follow-up on Joe's question. John, could you give us a sense of what the average yield of the 32 billion in GE assets that you're putting on and what the fee income generation was for last year?","John Shrewsberry","No. Just because we haven't disclosed the yields on that portfolio, but I can tell you Erika, it looks a lot like our \u2013 like that portion of our own wholesale portfolio and I would add frankly that their approach to risk analysis of their loans looks like our risk analysis of their loans and their pricing on those loans looks like our pricing of similar loans. So, you should think of it as a component piece of what our wholesale banking outcomes look like. And in fee generation, is the question was GE generated in fees with those loans or what\u2026","Erika Najarian","Yes. Or is that business that you're acquiring generated in fees?","John Shrewsberry","So, the revenue streams of that business are more net interest income streams rather than fee streams. I mean, there are certainly loan fees but they get amortized into yield. I can tell you in our own analysis of this and I'm sure in yours also, as we look out over some period of time we can imagine a lot of other products and services that we'll be providing to the same customers that GE wasn't in a position to offer them directly, so its part of the long-term value creation, but there's isn't a run rate that in there today, because GE was a primarily a lender rather than a full service provider of banking capabilities.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And just wanted to get some clarification on your comments earlier because adding these assets have the same impact of extending duration on the asset side, should we expect cash balances to stay relatively stable from the average balances of the third quarter?","John Shrewsberry","It depends on what's happening with deposit growth over the timeframe that we're talking about. This is five or six months in the future, so all things seeing equal, but maybe you could say us and by cash \u2013 cash and HQLA are high quality liquid assets are interchangeable in some ways, so I would look at the some of those things, not just cash depending on how our rate view evolves and what goes on in terms of the opportunity to get more invested et cetera. These are risk assets, that's one sort of use of cash, cash at the fed or cash in treasuries are two other related uses of cash so, I don't want to over complicated, but it\u2019s a little bit different than just the cash balance.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And just to sneak one last one in. Your results clearly demonstrates your strength on your relationship for the consumer in the corporate side. Given your balance sheet and capital strength and some difficult headlines that we are seeing from European bank, how are you thinking in terms of your medium-term strategy to increase your market share with institutional clients, given potential market shared dislocation and your strength in capital, particularly in leverage capital?","John Shrewsberry","I wouldn't think of our medium term strategy any differentially than how you've seen us behave in the recent past in that area. We have great relationships with our large number of institutional clients and counterparties and there are something interesting things to do, but we've got high regard for our capital on our funding and real meaningful expectations for how we get paid for using it as we work on those relationship. So we're already doing that from time to time something interesting will reveal itself and we'll consider it, but there is no change in strategy that it\u2019s going to result in us having a different risk profile or trying to fill our major vacuum that maybe being left behind by European bank or something else over the next few years.","John Stumpf","Yes. What you would liked about us in the past you like about us in the future regarding that.","Erika Najarian","Got it. Thank you so much.","John Stumpf","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","Eric Wasserstrom","Thanks and good morning.","John Stumpf","Hi, Eric.","Eric Wasserstrom","Hi. How are you? I just want to make sure that I'm fully understanding kind of what the key points of leverage are in the income statement as we look out into next year. Obviously it seems like the biggest contributor as a revenue driver is asset growth stemming in part from these acquisitions, but given sort of NIM commentary and the efficiency ratio commentary, should we expect positive operating leverage into next year or more basically zero?","John Shrewsberry","Well, we are always striving to generate positive operating leverage, so that's a goal as we set out to plan for the coming period. In terms of what happens it will be \u2013 it will reflect what we're primarily emphasizing which is the growth in relationships which leads to a growth in loans and a growth in deposit, credit discipline and further penetration on all in our product areas with the customers that we have. Other macro events sit on top of that with respect to where rates go et cetera, tough to know. And we're not as focused on that or can't be as focused on that, because we can't control some of those outcomes. So we're setting ourselves up to have expense discipline. We're setting ourselves up to add relationships. We're setting ourselves up to deliver into those relationships which you see in loans deposits and many of our product areas, but how it lands in a given quarter is more difficult to forecast.","John Stumpf","Eric, we're enjoying some of the strongest growth years we have seen and what we describe as the core building blocks of long-term shareholder value creation, relationship, loans, deposits, depths of relationship, new primary checking household growth. And as John mentioned depending on the macro environment not all that shows up in that value creation the next quarter, but over the long period or even the interim period that is \u2013 the best way we think to successfully grow and add to the things that are customers and our shareholders value.","Eric Wasserstrom","No, certainly. So it sounds like than its basically top line led operating leverage stemming in part from continued shift in mix of revenue sources, is that fair?","John Shrewsberry","Well, we surely want the top line, but we're watching the expenses were nothing goes on examined around here and we'll see how things turn out.","Eric Wasserstrom","And if I can just do one quick follow-up on asset quality, it sounds like from your commentary the go forward expectation should be for provision to roughly equal NCOs, is that right?","John Shrewsberry","So, it's up to forecast. We've gone through five years of reserve releasing. We've been saying for a few quarters that what's going to happened, subsequently it's going to reflect loan growth, portfolio performance and general economic outcomes. Does that mean that we remain at a no release, no provision level? That's too precise to forecast. But it should, if we grow our portfolio and the new assets look like the assets that we already have that we'll begin providing for those which could become more of net outcome as we're already had a generational low in terms of charge-offs which means that credit performance can't really improve meaningful from where we are today. It's already that good.","Eric Wasserstrom","Great. Thanks very much.","John Shrewsberry","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Scott Siefers","Good morning, guys.","John Shrewsberry","Good morning.","Scott Siefers","John, I was hoping you could talk for a moment on some of the changes in the loan yields within the commercial buckets. A few of them like commercial mortgage, construction, leasing, they came under a little more pressure than I would have thought. I imagine at least to a certain extent that's due to both the financing on the GE deals, but was curious to get your color and thoughts on what might be going on there?","John Shrewsberry","Yes. So I wouldn't think of that as attributable to those assets coming on. It really has more to do with the variable sources that loan fees that sometimes accelerate that run through their PCI recoveries or other things that are more \u2013 that are harder to forecast in more one time, so you see them changing these two yields and these two dates side by side, but its not a general change in the inherent yield or the customer yield on the portfolio.","Scott Siefers","Okay. All right. That makes sense. And then just one sort of nitpicky question. Did you guys quantify anywhere the size of the gain from the Warranty Solutions business? I think when you announce it sold it for $150 million in cash, but I wasn't sure where it had been recorded on the books?","John Shrewsberry","Yes. It's less than a penny per share. I don't think that we did put that anywhere but you're the first person to ask it, so there you go.","Scott Siefers","All right. Okay. I think that\u2019s' \u2013 I'm all set. Thank you very much.","John Shrewsberry","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Hilder with Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.","David Hilder","Good morning. Thank you. I noticed what appeared to be reversal of prior deferred comp expenses and wondered what the reason for that was?","John Shrewsberry","I don't think if it is a reversal, but every quarter our employee benefit expense on the one hand and our trading results on the other hand reflect the outcomes from our deferred comp approach. Our employees voluntarily defer comp and we neutralize the outcomes for them and we provide that return and we do it on a hedged basis, so that our results reflect. When our equity markets go up, our trading line goes up and our employ benefit expense goes up. When equity markets move down not just to generalize, the reverse is true. In this quarter we had equity markets down. We had trading revenue down and we had an equal amount of employee benefit expense down. So it's really just the cyclical ebbs and flows of that program. There's no change in approach or reversal of anything.","David Hilder","Great. Thanks very much.","John Shrewsberry","You're welcome. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research, LLC. Please go ahead.","Nancy Bush","Good morning guys. How are you?","John Shrewsberry","Good morning.","John Stumpf","Nancy, good morning.","Nancy Bush","Two questions for you. John, when you did the initial GE portfolio acquisition I guess that was couple of quarters ago, you said that you were going to continue to look at assets at GE and obviously you did. I guess my question is GE going to continue to be keeps on giving, I mean, is there more there that you're looking at or is this sort of the end of the GE pot?","John Shrewsberry","So, you may have seen the list in the paper today of the 13 announcements that they've had since they declared that they were going to wind down GE capital and three of those line items are attributable to our activity, the commercial real estate, the railcar and now the commercial businesses. And we just incidentally we look very closely at many of the other things that look like they might have a fit for Wells Fargo and for one reason or another they were a better fit for somebody else either because of the asset type or the pricing scenario or something else.","I think this pretty much concludes their U.S. business, I think they've got some things to sell around the world and because of our U.S. centric approach its probably true that we're not \u2013we wouldn't be playing a role like the role that we played in these three on those future acquisitions.","Now having said that, we've been advisor in some of these other transactions, we've been a lender to a winning bidder in some of these other transactions. There maybe other things to do. But in the way we've approach these three businesses that were of these three portfolios that we're acquiring. I don't think there is more of that coming from GE capital.","Nancy Bush","My second question would be whether the integration of this latest large business from GE is basically going to preclude you from looking at other possible asset portfolios et cetera at other companies due to the funding issues?","John Stumpf","Yes, Nancy, I would answer it this way, never is a really definitive word, but I'd say on the other hand the focus right here now is to do this and do it really well. This is a lot to say grace over. We have lots of experiences in acquisitions. We're going to treat this as a merger, doing it well provide huge benefits to all those involved and that's job 1, job 2 and job 3 right now I do this really well.","Nancy Bush","IF you guys could just clarify I mean you're going \u2013 are you going to be moving people, how is this physically going to work?","John Shrewsberry","These businesses are primarily headquartered in the Chicago area and the Dallas area and nothing about that is intent to change. So there maybe some opportunity to -- for their people in the field to team up with our people in the field, but the bulk of the people will remain, doing what they're doing, right where they're doing and we'll figure out how to help, how to improve, how to optimize but not a big migration. Yes, we have real estate and locations and people on the Wells side in both those locations, so\u2026","Nancy Bush","Okay. All right. Great. Thank you.","John Shrewsberry","Thank you, Nancy.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question will come from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","John Pancari ","Good morning.","John Shrewsberry","Hey, John.","John Pancari ","Back to the loan yield topic, just based on your answer there is it -- are you implying that that commercial yield decline of 15 basis points that we saw this quarter could actually snap back next quarter?","John Shrewsberry","No it depends on what happens with resolutions, with prepayments that accelerate loan fees into yield etcetera, so it could. I'd say as a general matter based on where we are in the cycle there are fewer resolutions, fewer PCI windups today and I wouldn't expect. We're not making bad loans anymore, so we're buying them for that matter in quite that way.","So I would expect that type of accounting to quiet down and more reflect the amortization of loan fees into yield, and then of course the acceleration of those when loans prepay. We are in the higher commercial loan prepayment environment probably just because things are so liquid. But I wouldn't expect it to snapback, but it certainly could increase a little bit, move around etcetera.","John Pancari ","Okay. And then one other thing on the margin, the swaps, I just want to get an idea of how much the swaps benefited the margin in the quarter and then also your appetite to add incremental swaps?","John Stumpf","So, we don't break out what the swaps benefit is to the margin as we have described, our approach to adding duration to the balance sheet for everyone's benefit, a portion of that\u2019s been done by swapping floating rate loans defect which has very similar impact to adding fixed rate securities to the portfolio. We don't anticipate a lot more of that activity.","Today, I mentioned in response to one of the earlier questions that we think we are about where we need to be from an asset sensitivity perspective that could change its deposit flows, ebb and flow and we could end up with a lot of more liquidity to deploy, but at the moment, I think, we're \u2013 we like where we are from an asset sensitivity point of view and so we probably won't be moving rapidly down the path toward meaningfully growing the securities portfolio today or for swapping, more floating rate loans.","John Pancari","Okay. And then lastly just on the credit side, on energy just want to see if you are in a position to quantify your energy reserve right at this point and then also your criticized ratio in energy lending?","John Stumpf","We don't breakout the components of the allowance. But I can tell you that our approach through the first and second redetermination dates since the price of crude moved down meaningfully has been from my observation a conservative approach. We're re-rating credits down before waiting for information from borrowers based on what we know about relationship and trying to get ahead of this.","So, well frankly as I mentioned in the services space we could continue to see more negative migration or even some meaningful negative migration in the industry. We feel great about where we are from allowance perspective in the energy space where we stand today. But we don't break out the component pieces of the allowances.","John Pancari ","Okay. Thanks. One more very quick one on that topic. The AFS portfolio with oil and gas bonds, I think you indicated a couple quarters back that it was around $1.5 billion. Is it still around that amount?","John Shrewsberry","I don't have the total in front of me, but I can tell you which is part of your question, actually 1.4 is the number. We took some OTTI in the quarter in that space. Those are of the corporate names in that portfolio, energy names were the ones that were most under water for the longest period of time which certainly a part of our review for other than temporary impairment and in the quarter in our results reflects taking those impairments through the P&L. So we feel good about our bases in those assets.","John Pancari","Got it. All right. Thank you.","John Shrewsberry","Thank you.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Paul Miller with FBR. Please go ahead.","Paul Miller","Yes, thank you very much. Most of my questions have been answered. But on the jumbo loan market, it's one of the areas I think if you're not number one, I think you are number one, but we're seeing more and more market share go to the jumbo markets. Can you add more color around that?","And then in the loans that you put in your portfolio my guess is most of them are jumbos. And where do you feel that you're going to be filled up there?","John Stumpf","So the loans that we put up as single family mortgage loans that we put on our balance sheet, virtually all of them are prime jumbo loans because as you know there is no secondary market for those loans, so to serve those customers we end up keeping them.","John Shrewsberry","You know frankly we \u2013 there is no magical numbers in terms of when we are full. Our total single family real estate portfolio hasn\u2019t shrunk or grown in the aggregate over the last few years meaningfully, the level stayed about the same, but we\u2019ve have home equity paying off. We've had pick-a-pay paying off, we\u2019ve had other lower quality loans winding down and prime jumbo loans winding up a little bit. And I guess I would anticipate that to continue as jobs are stronger and housing is stronger there are more people looking at those types of homes requiring those types of loans and only a balance sheet lender can provide that loan because there\u2019s no place in size for a mortgage company or any place else to go. There is no government program and there is no private label market.","John Stumpf","I\u2019d also add this, Paul that, as a percentage even though the overall real estate, present real estate totals have not changed, the quality has improved significantly and while the totals were the same since we\u2019ve grown our loans the percentage of those loans as a percentage of our overall portfolio, loan portfolio is down and those jumbos also tend to have a bit \u2013 they tend to turn over a bit because they have a little less duration because those folks tend to move more often and so forth. So, and these are for our very best customers and it\u2019s \u2013 and we are \u2013 we should be like that asset class.","Paul Miller","Okay, guys. Thank you very much.","John Shrewsberry","Thank you very much.","John Stumpf","Thank you. This concludes the call. Thank you all for joining us. We always appreciate your interest and involvement and again for all the questioners. We will see you here three months from now; it will be 2016 reflecting our fourth quarter earnings. So thank you very much. Bye, bye.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for participating. And you may now disconnect."]}}
