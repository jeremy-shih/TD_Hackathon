Today we'll review the first quarter 2018 results and the 2018 outlook. Before getting to the results I'd like to discuss Brexit and the new accounting standards. Now that Brexit is less than a year away, many of our clients as well as well as Wills Towers Watson itself are working hard to put in place the appropriate models and structures to ensure our business continuity.","Most importantly we're committed to do what it takes to continue providing our clients with seamless service to the extent possible regardless of what the Brexit regulations. We have a large footprint across Europe and in the case of our broking business we're leveraging this existing footprint and capability by engaging with regulators as we seek to establish the appropriate model for our clients and business.","We're adopting similar approaches in our investment business and our other segments. We serve many multinational companies and we've always assembled the best global resources to service our clients. We aim to continue this as we move through the Brexit process.","As of January1, 2018, we adopted a new accounting standard ASC 606. A detailed description of the impact of ASC 606 will be provided in the Form 10-Q filing. We also provided the detailed explanations of how the new standard impacted the presentation of our financial statements in our earnings release this morning.","The impact of the new standard is a onetime adoption year issue for 2018. We anticipate that approximately $45 million of revenues, which would have been fully recognized in 2018 using the prior accounting standards, will now be recognized in 2019. Once we get past this calendar year, the full year 2019 results should look more comparable to the 2017 results.","More import, the accounting change doesn't impact the underlying business momentum and should have no material impact on free cash flow. Mike will discuss this in more detail later in the call.","2018 is a critical year as our merger initiatives went down. We understand the importance of reporting our merger objectives and results in a clear consistent manner. To that end, will continue to provide our 2018 guidance and merger objectives based on the prior accounting standards as you saw in this morning's earnings release. We'll also discuss our results on today's call in terms of both the old and the new accounting standards.","Now, I'm pleased to turn to our results. I will first report the results using the prior accounting standard. Based on the prior accounting standard without the impact of ASC 606, reported revenues for the first quarter were $2.6 billion, up 10% as compared to the prior year first quarter and up 4% on a constant currency basis and up 6% on an organic basis. Reported revenues included $123 million of positive currency movement. We observed growth in all of our segments and regions for the quarter.","Net income was $447 million or up 27% for the first quarter as compared to the prior year first quarter net income of $352 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $841 million or 33% of total revenues. This is an increase of 19% as compared to the prior year of 708 or 30.5% of total revenues. This was an increase of 250 basis points in the adjusted EBITDA margin.","For the quarter diluted earnings per share were $3.31 and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $4.41. Currency fluctuations for 605 revenues had a $0.24 positive impact on our first quarter adjusted diluted EPS. The majority of this currency impact related to our French operations as most of their annual renewals are booked in the first quarter of the calendar year. This currency impact was already incorporated into our original 2018 guidance of $9.88 to $10.12.","Now, turning to results based on ASC 606 of the new accounting standard. Reported revenues for the first quarter were $2.3 billion. Net income for the first quarter was $221 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $557 million or 24.3% of total revenues. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $1.61 and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.71.","Now, let's look at each of the segments in more detail. As part of our portfolio review and integration process, we realigned teams which resulted in some movement of revenues and cost between segments. We also implemented a refined segment allocation process, the restructuring and asset allocation charges were applied to our 2017 results. All of the revenue results discussed in the segment detail and guidance reflect revenues on a constant currency basis unless specifically stated otherwise.","Please note, in previous years we reported on commissions and fees. We feel revenues are more reflective of overall company performance as revenue is a more comprehensive measure. Segment margins are calculated using segment revenues and exclude unallocated corporate cost such as amortization of intangibles, restructuring cost and certain transaction and integration expenses resulting from mergers and acquisitions as well as other items which we consider non-core to our operating results.","The segment results include discretionary compensation. All commentary regarding the segments will be based on the prior accounting standard unless stated otherwise.","So for the first quarter, total revenue grew 4% on a constant currency basis and 5% on an organic basis and this is against a very strong first quarter in the prior year. We experienced growth in all regions and segments this quarter. Most of our regions have experienced revenue growth for five consecutive quarters.","For the first quarter of2018 the international region led growth with 6% growth, North America and Great Britain both had growth of 4% and Western Europe has growth of 3%. Without the impact of ASC 606, Human Capital and Benefits or HCB had a strong quarter with revenue growth of 3% and organic growth of 4% as compared to the prior year first quarter. As a reminder in the prior year first quarter HCB had 5% constant currency and organic growth. HCB has now had growth for the last five consecutive quarters.","Talent and Rewards first quarter revenues grew 5% as compared to the prior year first quarter, primarily due to an increase in advisory software sales and product revenue with very strong growth in Western Europe and international. This growth was slightly offset by lower demand in the advisory businesses in North America.","Our Technology and Administration Solutions or TAS revenue increased by 5% as compared to the prior year first quarter, growth was a result of new clients and project work related to change orders. Health and Benefits revenues increased by 5% as compared to the prior year first quarter primarily as a result of strong sales of our global benefit offering in Great Britain, international and Western Europe. North America's revenue growth was muted due to the timing of sales and contracting as well as in internal reorganization.","Retirement revenue growth was 2% as compared to the prior year first quarter. North America's growth was as a result of increased tension administration support partially offset by reduced actuarial work in Canada due to their triennial valuation cycle. Great Britain led the revenue growth for the segment as a result of consulting demand for actuarial and risk Solutions. International also had strong growth, notably in Asia driven by strong results in China and Hong Kong.","Western Europe's revenues declined in large part due to timing issues in Germany related to our pension brokerage business and the expected contraction in the Netherlands. The HCB first quarter revenue was $1.02 billion with an operating margin of 38%, up 120 basis points from the prior year first quarter.","Now turning to the HCB results including the impact of the new revenue standard, the HCB segment had revenues of $832 million and an operating margin of 23%. The primary difference between the accounting standards is that the new standard pro-rates health care policies over a twelve month period rather than recognizing the revenue at the time of the sale. Approximately 40% of our health care policies in the middle market are sold with effective dates other than January 1. Overall we continue to have a positive outlook for the HCB business in 2018.","Now turning to Corporate Risk and Broking or CRB, which also had a strong quarter, revenues increased 5.5% on a constant currency basis and 6% on an organic basis as compared to the prior year first quarter. As a reminder, in the prior year first quarter CRB had constant currency and organic growth of 3%. CRB has now had five consecutive quarters of revenue growth and post the 2016 and 2017 restructuring, we have had three strong consecutive quarters of growth in North America. Revenue growth was experienced in every region. International had revenue growth with 9% primarily due to growth in CEEMEA and Asia with a slight offset due to softness in Latin America and Australia.","Central and Eastern Europe and Middle East Asia's overall revenue growth included positive timing of a renewal and securing a large construction project. Great Britain and North America both had strong growth at 7%. Great Britain's revenue was impacted by the growth noted in CEEMEA and strong new business in facultative in financial lines. North America's revenue growth was a result of better than expected new business and a retention rate of 95%, up three percentage points as compared to last year and an increase in fees related to the forensic accounting team.","Western Europe's growth was led by France's strong renewal season and strengthened specialty offset by slight declines in Germany. The CRB revenues were $758 million with an operating margin of 19%, up 180 basis points to the prior year first quarter. This margin improvement transpired despite a higher corporate allocation for aggressive work.","Now, turning to the CRB including the impact in the new revenue standard. For the quarter CRB and revenues of $740 million and an operating margin of 17%. The primary difference between the accounting standards is that affinity products are prorated under the new standard. This will have no impact on the total 2018 annual revenues as all policies were effective as of January 1. The primary difference in expense is that under the new standard expenses are recognized when the sale becomes effective. Under the prior standard they were recognized as incurred. We're pleased with the momentum in our CRB business globally.","And now we're into the strong performance by Investment Risk and Reinsurance or IOR. Revenue for the first quarter increased 3% on a constant currency basis and 5% on an organic basis as compared to the prior year first quarter. Both constant currency and organic revenue growth was 5% in the first quarter of 2017. As a reminder, the reinsurance line of business represents treaty based reinsurance with some facultative business produced in wholesale. The bulk of facultative reinsurance results are captured in the CRB segment.","Max Matthiessen led the segment with 9% revenue growth as a result of an increase of assets under management and new business. Reinsurance revenue grew by 6% as a result of solid renewals and strong new business especially in North America. While there were pockets of rate increases on catastrophe impacted business, pricing was essentially flat across our multiline global portfolio. Wholesale grew by 5% as a result the new business momentum and some pull forward of business booked in the second quarter last year. Insurance consulting and technology grew by 2% on a constant currency basis and 3% on an organic basis.","ICT revenue growth was a result of increased consulting project and software sales. As a reminder we sold the UBI business in 2017. Investment grew 2% as a result of new client implementations slightly offset as a result of market factors impacting performance fees. Underwriting and Capital Management or UCM, experienced a decline of 10% in constant currency revenue as a result of the divestiture of the U.S. programs business in 2017 and Loan Protector businesses in the first quarter of 2018. UCM organic growth was 5%.","The IRR segment had revenues of $539 million compared to $491 million for the prior year first quarter and 45% operating margin, up 110 basis points from the prior year first quarter. IRR experiences a seasonally high operating margin in the first quarter primarily driven by the timing of revenues and reinsurance.","Now turning to the IRR results including the impact in the new revenue standard, IRR had revenues of $574 million and operating margin of 45%. The primary difference in the accounting standards is related to the revenue recognition for the proportional treaty reinsurance broking arrangements. Under the prior accounting standard the revenue was pro-rata under the new standard the revenue is recognized upon the effective date of the policy.","We recently announced the integration of our Insurance Link Securities of ILS portfolio and teams have moved from our securities line of business to Willis Reinsurance. This move reflects our ongoing efforts to evolve our IRR segment and better align our portfolio of businesses to position us for long term sustainable growth. ILS is an important part of the capital advice and solutions that we provide to clients and we're excited to integrate that ILS business within Willis rate. Overall we continue to feel positive about the momentum of IRR business for 2018.","Now revenues for the BDA segment increased by 8% from the prior year first quarter. BDA has now had nine consecutive quarters of revenue growth. Individual marketplace revenues increased by 14% as a result of increased membership from the 2017 fall enrollment season. Group marketplace and benefits outsourcing revenues grew 2% as a result of new client wins and special projects. The BDA segment had revenues of 195 million with 22% operating margin, up 50 basis points as compared to the prior year first quarter.","The BDA segment reflecting the new revenue standard had revenues of 122 million and an operating margin of negative 26%. The primary driver of the difference due to the accounting standards is related to the individual marketplace. These revenues must now be recognized at the data placement rather than prorating the revenue starting at our effective date. This means that the revenue typically generated by placements in the 2017 fall enrollment period was recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of January 1, 2018. This revenue under the prior standard would have started to be recognized in January 2018 on a pro-rata basis throughout the year.","However, the overall revenue profile should not change in 2018 as under the new standard the revenues generated by the policies placed in the fall 2018 enrollment season will be recognized immediately, so this will change the seasonality of the revenue recognition to be higher in the second half of the calendar year. We continue to like this business and we're optimistic about the long term growth in this business.","So, before concluding my remarks I'd like to provide you with an update regarding the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority or FCA investigation. During this last quarter we received an update from the FCA regarding the previously disclosed investigation of the aviation insurance brokerage sector. We had previously disclosed that the European Commission had taken over the competition law aspects of the investigation, but the FCA retained jurisdiction over the brokerage regulatory matters that do not relate to competition law.","The FCA has now informed us that they will not be taking enforcement action against us for the brokerage regulatory matters. The European Commission Civil Competition investigation is ongoing and we have no further update to provide at this point. For additional detail, please refer to our SEC filings on this matter.","Again I'm very pleased with the first quarter results. I certainly hope that despite the confusion of adding the additional element of the new accounting standards, we've been able to communicate the strength of our underlying business. I feel very good about the momentum in the overall business, the general state of the global economy and our integrated market approach. Of course I'd like to thank our colleagues who continue to service our clients without fail.","And now turn the call over to Mike.","Mike Burwell","Thanks John. And I'd like to add my congratulations to our colleagues for another great quarter, but I'd also like to thank our clients for their continued support and trust in us. Now, let me turn to our overall financial results.","Let me first discuss income from operations. Without the adoption of ASC 606, income from operations for the first quarter was 538 million or up 34% from 401 million in the prior year. This was 21.1% of total revenues.","Adjusted operating income for the first quarter was 722 million or up 17% from six 619 million in the prior year. This was 28.3% of total revenues. The key drivers of this increase were strong revenue growth and prudent expense management.","Now let me turn to adjust to diluted earnings per share or adjusted EPS excluding the new revenue standard. For the first quarter of 2018 our adjusted EPS was up 19% to $4.41 per share versus $3.71 per share in the prior year. And as a reminder, we had a strong revenue growth in the prior year first quarter in terms of a comparable.","Our adjusted EPS was $2.71 per share under the new revenue recognition standard for the quarter. We adopted the new revenue standard using the modified retrospective approach. This approach was noted in our earnings release this morning and will be in our footnote disclosures to the financial statements in our 10-Q as required by the new standard.","As John mentioned previously, we view this as the best way to assess our performance for 2018. And as a reminder, we anticipate that approximately 45 million of our revenues which would have been fully recognized in 2018 using their prior accounting standard will now be recognized in 2019. We reflected the required change in presentation of the pension expense on our income statement and have restated 2017 to be consistent with the new presentation. This change involve moving non-service cost component from salaries and benefits to other income net.","The year-on-year increase in other income net is primarily due to increased pension income. The increase on an allocated net on a restated basis is primarily due to higher Brexit cost and payroll taxes on invested options. Lastly, we've also started reporting revenues this quarter versus commission and fees give the immaterial difference between the two amounts.","Now moving to taxes, I'd like to provide you with some additional insight into our U.S. GAAP and adjusted tax rates. Our adjusted tax rate was 19.6%, an increase of 4% over last year's first quarter. The U.S. GAAP tax rate for the first quarter was 19.7. Beginning in 2018, the adjusted and U.S. GAAP tax rate will be more closely aligned to the U.S. corporate rate reduction from 35% to 21%.","Deferred tax benefits in the US related to the merger that previously had significant impact on our U.S. get tax rate have now been reduced. There's a possibility there will be further guidance from the U.S. Treasury and others on interpretation or application of new rules. This may result in adjustment to our estimates as we move through the year and we will continue to monitor this and communicate appropriately.","Let's move on to the balance sheet. We continue to have a strong financial position. As expected, free cash flow for the first quarter was 47 million, a decrease from free cash flow of 33 million for the prior year first quarter. The year-over-year variance was related to an increase in payments for discretionary compensation as our 2017 company performance was significantly improved from 2016.","We did not repurchase shares in the first quarter, resulted in 2017 annual bonus payouts. We have already reinstituted our share buyback program and expect to buy back 600 million to 800 million of shares in 2018. As a reminder we have repurchased our retired approximate 8.4 million shares since the merger and paid 546 million in dividends. The dividend was increased by 30% effective as of April, 2018.","Thinking about our full year guidance for 2018, we reported two 2018 financial results in this morning's release based on both the ASC 606 standard and the old accounting standard ASC 605. We want to ensure that investors have a clear line of sight to our progress as we move into the last year of their three year integration period. AS such we are continuing to revise guidance based on the 2017 U.S. GAAP standard.","So now let's review our full year 2018 guidance for Willis Towers Watson. For the company, we continue to expect organic revenue growth to be approximately 4%. For the segments, we expect revenues to be in the low single digits for ACB, CRB and IRR and to be in the mid single-digits for BDA. We could to expect adjusted EBITDA to be around 25% for the full year.","We are moving the adjusted effective tax rate from 24% to a range of 232% to 24%. This tax guidance is consistent for both the old and new accounting standards. We expect free cash flow of approximately 1.1 billion to 1.3 billion in 2018. There is a non-material difference of free cash flow between the prior and new accounting standards. The difference is a result of moving a portion of capitalized software related to appliance system implementations from investing activities to operating activities in the cash flow statement.","This accounting change does not impact or overall guidance nor our capital allocation strategy. We will continue to use the former ASC 605 accounting standard for this year to assess bonus calculations, capital for dividends, share buy backs, internal investments and M&A. Our annual guidance assumes an average currency exchange rate of $1.40 to the pound and $1.23 to the euro.","I'd like to say again, how pleased I am with results and the continued momentum of our business and I'll turn the call back to John.","John Haley","Thanks Mike and now we'll take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Dave Styblo with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Dave Styblo","Hi there, good morning guys.","John Haley","Good morning.","Dave Styblo","So, you obviously put up some solid organic growth again this quarter despite some really tough comps a year ago and I think back then you were called out that the first quarter of '17 benefited from them one to two points of growth. I guess I'm just wondering, was there anything in terms of timing or change orders that you'd spike out for this quarter that helped the first quarter of '18s results and if not then the 4% to 6% organic growth that you've had in the last few quarters, last three quarters I guess specifically, it's obviously a nice uptick. How much of that you think is your company specific initiatives that you've been pushing through with management structures and implementations versus perhaps an uptick in and market demand?","John Haley","Yeah, so first of all look, we've had \u2013there's always little movements between quarters that occur and we've had our usual share of those, I mean there's a HCB, there's the carry forward for 2017 et cetera, but I would say that in general this first quarter is a - the first quarter of 2018 is sort of a normal first quarter and it's 2017 that was the one that was exceptional. And so just to state the obvious we are delighted, we - that was such a tough comparable and the great revenue growth we've had. And I think it's Mike and I both refer to our colleagues throughout our company working very hard and satisfying client needs and that seems to be paying off.","Dave Styblo","And then I guess the follow-up would be with the strong growth in the quarter and lower taxes at least relative to what the street was expecting and the beat was more narrow and that seems to be because margins want to point to strong as expected. I'm curious did you guys accelerate any sort of spending, how did how did the margin side compared to what you were thinking, I just step back and look at the results you would think you would have had a little bit better earnings upside in margin and upside from having such a stronger organic growth quarter. So just trying to reconcile why we didn't see that benefit for all the way through the bottom line for this quarter?","John Haley","So maybe I'll let Mike talk a little bit about that but I mean just a quick comment for me, I think we had a 230 basis point improvement in area adjusted EBITDA margin. I got to tell you that is not something that is below our expectations. So we would be delighted with a 250 basis point increase for the year.","Mike Burwell","Yeah, John and I just had to do your comments and was last ended last year where we ended it 23.2% on an adjusted EBITDA margin basis, obviously the first quarter is a strong quarter for us overall. And as one of our larger quarters, where we look at that is to John's point were 250 basis points up, as a related to our margin on a 605 basis. And we feel very good about that which is all we had focused on in terms of cost reduction and you see it across all four of our segments in terms of margin improvement.","Dave Styblo","Okay. Thanks, I'll step back for others.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi. Good morning. My first question is on a currency, I just want to try to get a couple comments towards last year guidance even though your 24% of currency in a quarter, you told that last quarter there would be a 4% benefit on a year. If I've heard you correctly John you said the $0.24 was in line with your outlook. So two questions do you expect on $0.20 of that come back in our three quarterly or something are offsetting this favorable currency when compared to your initial guidance a few months ago?","John Haley","No. It's the former we're expected $0.20 to come back. The currency impact or $0.04 for the year is still what we think is the right outlook for the year and we always had recognized that there was a seasonality to it.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay and currency didn't have an impact on margin in the quarter, correct?","John Haley","No, no.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. And then I just want to go back in to the larger margin conversation. So you posted in your a pretty strong 6% organic for the second quarter and I well. But I don't think like a lot of operating leverage here at your margin and coming in a bit short I think what was expected obviously under old and new on standard John. Can you talked to maybe some of the saves that \u2013cost saves that fell to the bottom line in a quarter or how did the overall margin drive with what you would expect, you would get this quarter to hit the full-year 25 and is anything one-off that maybe negatively impacted margin in the quarter?","John Haley","Yes. So maybe again I'll let Mike go into some of the details of this. Let me just give you a couple of thoughts overall on that at least I guess I'm, I was actually surprised with prior question this one on the margins because again I thought a 250 basis point was an incredible improvement in them. Now I guess maybe what's happening as you're looking at some of the 606 numbers, I going to tell you from the viewpoint of something trying to run a business. The 606 numbers are worse than useless as far as I'm concerned I mean day for a standard that, recognizes some revenue not at all and some expenses twice. So this first year of transition I don't find that to provide any useful thing and I and I when I'm focusing on the margin program try to look at it in the 605 basis and I thought those results were spectacular so. Mike?","Mike Burwell","Yeah I know, I would just add to John's comments. I mean I did mention and we did have a couple of expense items in there but which were around BREXIT and our payroll taxes on invested options. But those are not big numbers at least and we look at it I just reiterate what John said, I mean we feel very good about where our margins are going to continue to focus on driving and continued improvement on those. And we look at them on a 605 basis and we've continued to push in very, very hard.","Elyse Greenspan","And can you quantify on what level of expensive you might have been in the quarter?","Mike Burwell","I mean we have a variety of different ones without going into those and I will detail but I mean I guess and if you think about what we've done in real estate we've continued to drive our real estate footprint across the organization as we continue to consolidate offices between the two legacy organizations. And I think which are our driving costs we continue to manage our headcount appropriately and make sure that it week we do drive that operating leverage. So as we're driving our revenue growth, we're not looking at just adding headcount so particularly our back office functions we're looking to manage that and look to do drive that appropriately with the footprint that we have today. I'm sorry I would say those are probably two of the bigger drivers lease.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Kai Pan","Thank you and good morning. First question on your guidance, you maintain your guidance for the full-year. If you look underneath the organic growth at that guidance would be better tax rate even lower and you maintain your 25% adjusted EBITDA margin so why the guidance would not be higher?","Mike Burwell","Well the guidance was in a range we still think will be in the range.","Kai Pan","Okay, alright. And then the organic fronts, I just wonder because it's the first quarter comparison was tough and that you achieved 6% actually more than last year's 5%. The second quarter last year actually was it weaker at 2% and do you think the second quarter actually be the comp becoming easier for this year or there's a one of timing issues?","Mike Burwell","We think the second quarter comp is easier.","Kai Pan","Alright, that's fair. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Greg Peters with Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Greg Peters","Good morning, John, Mike and Aida. Thanks for the call and I guess my first question would be around in your press release, you provided a section where you gave select questions and answers. And I appreciate that question two that you provided an answer was around EPS for 2019 and I'm trying not to get in front or over my key tips here but I'm wondering if you could sort of establish some basic guideposts for the investment community and what they should expect around annual revenue growth, margin improvement, free cash flow et cetera if we think about 2019 and beyond?","Mike Burwell","Greg, I think where we're just not. Right now our focus is so much on 2018 and delivering those results and as we think about 2019 there, we're focused on making sure that we have the right kind of capabilities and investments to do well then but we're not necessarily focused on being able to provide guidance at this point.","Greg Peters","Okay. I'm I guess just a tangent to that is we're almost halfway through 2018 and so I haven't heard word on whether there are we're going to see a contract extension for you and who's going to be the CEO in 2019?","John Haley","Yeah. We don't have anything to say about that either at the moment.","Greg Peters","Okay. I'm striking out. Last area I know in the past you've been our legacy revenue synergies the targets for 2018 perhaps you wanted a circle back and give us an update on how you're performing as were moving through 2018 on those legacy targets?","John Haley","Yeah. I mean thanks and we didn't go through and talk about that at this time, it's partly because it's we already had a long script with this double accounting results and everything there to begin with. But broadly things are going well I mean I would say that there are during line with what we had last quarter if they hadn't been we would have called it out.","Greg Peters","Thank you for the answers.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.","Paul Newsome","I'm sorry, Mike. I had questions on the margin and I couldn't get in queue.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Your line is open.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Hi, thank you for taking my questions. Hey, John, the quarter looked really good, organic growth, margin expansion, the EPS. I mean things they looks like the business momentum is accelerating. What they want to pick it is if things are going this well why do you have to wait for cash flow to buy back stock, it's coming. Why when she just make a decision the first quarter which get ahead of this?","John Haley","Yeah, that's a fair - do you want just answer that question.","Mike Burwell","Yeah we it's we're watching it pretty closely and managing in focusing on cash flow and our DSO efforts, our continued focus. We just being improved I guess and conservative and we could have but we did not and as reality.","John Haley","I think that's right Shlomo. The real answer is we were probably just being a little conservative maybe a little overly conservative in terms of doing that. But the first quarter is as we said it is a quarter where we have the big outflow, bonuses and we had a very good year in 2017. So we had larger bonuses than we did the year before. We could have done that maybe we should have.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","And given where you see the business going in the momentum, is it fair to assume that you gave a range and what you should be tracking towards the higher end of the range if not above that just based on where the stock has been tracking recently?","John Haley","Yeah look we feel very good about fitting the guidance that we have. And I think you've worked with us for a while and we don't we're not into just adjusting the guidance on every little upper or down that occurs in the course of the year. So but we feel pretty good about being able to come out in the range we had there or maybe even better.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Right. And that's fair. I was just pointing out at the cash flow in terms of the target share repurchases were 6800 million and given where you're coming out of the strength of the business, so we assume and where the stock has tracked you should assume that you should be able to get to the upper end of that?","John Haley","I think that there's a good first quarter it's more likely that will get to the upper end and it wasn't going into it. So yeah that that's.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Alright, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Arash Soleimani with KBW. Your line is open.","Arash Soleimani","Thanks. I want to ask one more question on the margin and I agree on a year-over-year basis that looks like there's John. Performance but it seems like for some reason the Street expected something higher I mean did you have you have any thoughts on where maybe the disconnect was but with anything and on unallocated expenses perhaps maybe we were expecting to be in there that was in there. And again just thing one more time but it was definitely a strong performance but seems like there was some kind of disconnect between the Street and?","Mike Burwell","Yeah, I mean you have some accounting application that's been going on obviously the 606 and our people were they get in there comfortable with that and thinking about what success it was going to it was 606 was going to present. What the margin then associated with that was what was I going to be and then you had a pension change that happened as well which moved amounts from unallocated net down to income from operations and so that pension income is included another income net in that line item if you compare it on a year-over-year basis, we've obviously restated them appropriately to reflect that in the accounting standards. But overall, I guess I would retreat back to your opening comments I mean we feel very good about the margins and what's gone on overall we try to be as transparent as we can be to highlight the changes that have been going on. But I think it's, it's not easy to model all those activities that are adding in changes that are there and we try to give as much guidance as week we can both in our comments and our disclosures and what we've included in the supplemental schedules that we've posted on our website to try to enhance everyone's understanding of what that means.","Arash Soleimani","Thanks. And then if you provided us but if you put the margin on the margin obviously but we're looking at on a new accounting basis. What would your expansion have been if we were looking at a new accounting versus new accounting margin number?","John Haley","Yeah so I mean on it was so when you adopted it the accounting standard, it's a perspective basis, so and included in that was equally open contracts method which a certain amount of revenue which we had talked about here and $45 million, $50 million range in that literally did not get booked to retained earnings is gone and when as we have articulated, we think will come back and in fiscal year in 2019 and in some form in terms of thinking about it. But we did not restate back as contrasted with what others have done in terms of looking at that margin, we've really been managing the business on a 605 basis and that's really been our focal point. So I am not sure how relevant that would really be.","Mike Burwell","But our margin for last year which were 23.2% for the year so we were looking if we got to the 25% which people's some people were skeptical about that to get to 25 is 100 and so 100 basis points. And so that's why I was measuring against that 250 and thinking for that's pretty good.","Arash Soleimani","Yeah. I know agreed. And then it might seem like a silly question but on the 5% organic growth for the segment I know you don't break out the investment income anymore but the 5% organic versus 6% of the only difference they're just reimbursable expenses?","John Haley","No, the difference between that that's divestitures, yes. So we divested about 1% of our business is in 2017and I guess January of 2018 accounting I didn't there and these were generally lower performing businesses that we divested I think it cost us $0.03 or $0.04 of earnings, but yeah that's the difference, yeah.","Arash Soleimani","Okay, thanks. And just last question and a change in capital management or buyback philosophy?","John Haley","No, no full steam ahead.","Arash Soleimani","Right. Perfect. Thanks for the answers.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Adam Klauber with William Blair. Your line is open.","Adam Klauber","Hi, good morning. I think you mentioned free cash of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion but you mentioned something about a change in capitalization did I get that right and how much does that impact free cash flow?","Mike Burwell","You did get it right and just there's $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion is that number as of now and roughly it's about $10 million for the quarter. That's the impact.","Adam Klauber","Okay, so pretty small.","Mike Burwell","Yes.","Adam Klauber","So this year looks like buybacks and dividend will be the majority of free cash. As we think about next year the merger related activities have do have?","John Haley","I'm sorry you're beating out.","Adam Klauber","Do deals and mergers become more likely in '19 and '20?","John Haley","Yes, yes. I mean I think that when you first do a large complicated merger like we did and errors was complicate it not just on a couple fronts but also it was really three companies coming together, then the first few years after that mergers are relatively unlikely and so each year you go further out it becomes more likely, other M&A activity.","Adam Klauber","Great, thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ron Kenner [ph] with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning, everybody. Just one follow-up on Elyse's question on FX, so we're still targeting 4% of boost from FX, I'm look at the guidance Page and I think Page 21, I do think that the average exchange rates there assumed have gone up a little bit. So I just want to confirm that's all driven by the first quarter or is they so maybe a little more than that coming from FX the rest of the year?","Mike Burwell","So it's all comes in the first quarter.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. That's helpful. And then my second question is around organic growth or actually I guess currency adjusted growth, so that's 5% growth in the first quarter so targeting 3% to 4% the rest for the full-year. Is that as because you were running in to top for the prior part in the second half of the year are there other drivers that maybe result in slower growth for the remaining nine months?","Mike Burwell","I mean we're looking at what's happening in the marketplace we obviously think we have a little better contracts go into the second and third quarter overall but fourth quarter obviously we had had very good growth and sort of a very tough comparable overall. So it's reflecting what we saw happen obviously in terms of actually on the first quarter. We're looking second and third quarter, feel like we had a reasonable comp in the fourth quarter we got another top comp. So that's how we really kind of manage ourselves in terms of what we think the number will be let's.","John Haley","Right. And I think we actually think the market growth will be somewhere in the 3% to 4% range for the year and we expect to be at least that as fast as the markets growing so that's more or less how we got there.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Cohen with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Jay Cohen","Yes. Thank you. It looks like in addition to the accounting changes you made some changes to your own reporting moving things around. Are you provide, we be providing us with that basis of accounting for the final three quarters of 2017, so we can model it affectively for 2018?","John Haley","Yes. We were absolutely we are Jay and it's recast in the slides that are posted on our website so you have on.","Jay Cohen","Great, all the questions are answered. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Hughes with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Mark Hughes","Yes. Thank you. Good morning. Any taught on the bulk some - bulk lump sum work or just broader pension accounting dynamics if we've got those interest rates going up here. What impact you seeing in it in the backlog and all?","John Haley","Yes, so backlog work has bought up and down over the last say half a dozen years or so, it's in a relatively low level right now. We don't have any projections for a pickup this year, it's a little too early to say about next year in some ways a higher interest rates can, they can lower the cost of doing some bulk lump sums of course they also lowered the target liability that you were measuring going to get also, so there's a lot of factors that play in the both lump sums right now we're not projecting a big pick up on that but I think where we are we're just sort looking at this phase and ready to act if we do see some.","Mark Hughes","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Zoranski [ph] with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, good morning, thanks. Mike, in the prepared remarks you mentioned IRS guidance potentially. Just trying to a number of companies have mentioned this as well trying to get more color are you guys being conservative and there could be guidance in the coming months or years where the tax rate could materially change or maybe just some more color on that?","Mike Burwell","Yeah, I mean we continue to get \u2013Treasury continues to issue more clarification and guidance and so we continue to incorporate that in all our calculations and analysis and most recently they have done that and provide as additional guidance as a relates to the guilty tax. So we continue to believe as fast as they got that bill passed that there's continued interpreted guidance that comes out. And so we're trying to be thoughtful and making sure we understand exactly what could impact us going forward. But just to be clear, we continue to appropriately plan tax planning strategies to over time to get us more and more aligned with the statutory rates that were or below and so that's what we continued it to try to do. So I if I'd use conservative or aggressive I think we're thinking about it properly and then so that's why we said and I'm sure that's why others are saying because there's that it's getting the same guidance that we're getting","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, so TBD there. Okay, my less question's on the investment segments, you guys in the past have mentioned about launching an asset management exchange. I believe in the U.S. and it's in the U.K. and it's had a good deal of success. I have noticed some there's been at least one or two of some of prominent lawsuits against some of your peers regarding some proprietary products. Is there just launching these exchanges and some proprietary products to your clients come with added risk?","John Haley","I guess in today's world you can't take a breath without having at it risks. So there's always something there but I look we feel very good about the products we have and we that everything very carefully with our legal department so there's nothing that we're aware of that presents any unusual risk.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ron Kenner [ph] with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, I have just one quick follow-up on the 2019 EPS, I realize it's surely a good guidance but I do think in the past you talked about double-digit growth in the long term. So when we think about that double-digit growth, is that offer that 988 to 1012 guidance for the full-year 2018?","Mike Burwell","Yeah if that's where we end-up.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And we have another follow-up from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Kai Pan","Hi, thank you since I didn't take much of a time last two, want to give to try as is so on your BDA, how is scary change a business that run rate of organic growth slowing down for last two years. Is that is sort of like is maturing of the business? I just wondering the margin profile of the business well that improves given that you are now probably don't need to invest a lot into that system.","John Haley","Yeah so as and as we said the reason it's the growth rate is slower is because the individual market place which is where you get all of the big clients with their all of the retirees that you get ones that all the big cases are pretty much out and there's relatively few of them there and all but one of them are with us so we have a very large in stock base. So the growth rate is slowing down and I guess you could call that a maturing of the market there. We think that the margin impact if we're not investing or maybe I would just say of or not incurring the expense is to enroll very large new clients are some 200,000 life case or something like that then that tends to improve our margins a little bit. I don't think of it so much as investment because we're still doing a lot of investment to make both the individual and the group marketplace keep that at the forefront of technology and keep ahead of any or competitors so we continue to have to do that but we don't have to necessarily hire large people to just implement new big new cases. We prefer of course to be getting several big new cases in hiring people and having the margins be a little bit lower but we'll see what happens.","Kai Pan","Great, my final one is on the pricing side. You see the pricing new neutral to slight up currently and how do you see the momentum going? Is that going to slowing down especially like the mere reinsurance renewals?","John Haley","I don't think we see media being different than what we saw at the beginning of the year. But I think pricing is a dynamic market and these things can change but at the moment we don't see any difference.","Kai Pan","Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. And we have another follow-up from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Your line is open.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Hi, thank you for squeezing me back in at the end. Hey John, can you talk a little bit about the competitive environment and some of the areas higher level areas that you're and maybe just in some of the brokerage areas and then some of the consulting areas and it human resources side, I'm just trying to push out a little bit is the organic growth in the business was better than the peers this quarter seems like it has been on par or better of the last several quarters and want to know are you sensing, are you hearing on the ground from your people that they're doing better competitively or is it just you're in different markets in Asia and compare them the same way?","John Haley","Sure. Mike is chomping at the bit to answer this question.","Mike Burwell","Also, I think we feel very good about what we've seen going on in particular in our international operations in terms of strength and international. We've been and equally as translated to strengthen in Great Britain in terms of working together and serving clients and going through that from a risk management standpoint. And our we look at our defined benefits actions and activities where we continue to grow and we see others not growing there because of a strength of our people, our colleagues, as John mentioned earlier in terms of the quality of our resources and what they're delivering in the marketplaces continue to win more than our fair share in my view and that's because we're still retaining clients and winning more and more business. So I think about, you look at us from an international standpoint, you look at what's been happening in Great Britain, you look at our defined benefits activity, you look at our brokerage business overall versus what's been happening in the marketplace and we look - our defined benefits business is growing. And so we feel good about what's happening at the top line. Now look, there are some areas that we continue to focus on and we mention them. Germany is an area that we're continuing to focus on and nothing ever hits perfect on all cylinders, so we're continuing to focus on that part of our business. But, overall that's - we feel very good.","John Haley","But I think Shlomo may be just to add something too, I think one of the things we've been focused on as we - just as we brought this merger together. This is with - this quarter sort of indicates where we think we'd like to be. When you look at it we have growth across all of our regions, we growth across all of our segments and I think that what we see is the kind of company we'd like to be as one where we have no weaknesses and everything is growing and everything is performing well. As Mike says, as you get down to the smaller units, you can always have pluses and minuses there, but we think to make a strong coming by having no weaknesses.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay, great. Thank you for the color.","John Haley","Okay, is that it then? Thanks very much everybody for joining us and then we look forward to updating you on our second quarter earnings call in August.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program.

Welcome to the Willis Towers Watson First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Please visit our Web site for the press release and supplemental information that was issued earlier today. Today's call is being recorded and will be available for the next three months on our Web site.","Some of the comments in today's call may encompass forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995.","These forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today and the company undertakes no obligation to update these statements unless required by law.

For reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures as well as other information regarding these measures, please refer to the most recent earnings release and other materials in the Investor Relations section of the company's Web site.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. John Haley, Willis Towers Watson, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.","John Haley","Okay. Thank you. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on our first quarter earning call. Joining me here today, Mike Burwell, our Chief Financial Officer and Rich Keefe, Head of Investor Relations.","Today, we will review our results for the first quarter of 2019 and the outlook for the remainder of the year. We are pleased with the results this quarter. We were able to generate strong organic top-line growth of 5%. And this marks the third consecutive quarter in which we have generated 5% or more of organic revenue growth.","Moreover, this quarter, we faced a challenging comparables 6% organic revenue growth in the first quarter of 2018. Despite that challenge, we still manage to generate strong organic revenue growth and more important, we delivered profitable growth with meaningful margin expansion of 200 basis points and double-digit adjusted EPS growth. ","As we discussed at our recent Analyst Day, we have a disciplined strategy focused on generating profitable growth and we feel positive about the strong progress that we have made in this area. I believe this progress is a testament to the immense talent and effort that our colleagues around the world bring to the table on a daily basis.","I would like to take the moment now to recognize their hard work and dedication. Their commitment to client service and living our values and are making deep and lasting impacts on our business, I'm very proud of what they have achieved for the company for our clients and for our shareholders and what for bringing our story to life. I thank them for their efforts and for another solid performance this quarter.","We remain committed to our strategy and we are pleased with the progress that has been made, but we are not standing still. This is demonstrated by a recent announcement to acquire TRANZACT. We are extremely excited to bring TRANZACT into our Willis Towers Watson family. They bring exceptional talent and capabilities to bear including a leading technology driven direct to consumer solution platform and we think they will be a great fit within our company.","This pending acquisition is an excellent example of our focus on investing in areas that deliver a sustainable competitive advantage. We continually look to identify investment opportunities that are high margin or have the prospect of getting to relatively high margin. Similarly, we like them to be adjacent to our core business and have the potential to disrupt or transform some existing value chain.","We believe TRANZACT checks the box across the board and represents a tremendous growth opportunity in the Medicare space. By leveraging Willis Towers Watson technological infrastructure and scale with TRANZACT's telesales and digital marketing expertise, we will have exceptional distribution and enrollment capabilities as well as a broadening position in the rapidly growing Medicare space.","Further, we look forward to unlocking the synergies between the two companies and we as execute on our plans. Overall, we are excited about the step and what it means for Willis Towers Watson for our colleagues and for our shareholders as the next step of significant value creation.","At this time, we are still in the regulatory approval process and we expect to continue -- we continue to expect closing will occur in the third quarter of 2019.","Now, let's move on to our quarter one 2019 results. Reported revenue for the first quarter was $2.3 billion, up 1% as compared to the prior year first quarter and up 5% on a constant currency and organic basis.","Reported revenue included $84 million of negative currency moment. Once again, this quarter, we experienced growth on an organic basis across all of our segments. Net income was $293 million up 33% for the first quarter as compared to the $221 million of net income in the prior year first quarter.","Adjusted EBITDA was $601 million or 26% of revenues as compared to the prior year adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of $557 million or 24.3% of revenues representing an 8% increase on an adjusted EBITDA dollar basis and 170 basis points of margin improvement.","For the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $2.15 an increase of 34% compared to prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.98 reflecting an increase of 10% compared to prior year.","Overall, it was a solid quarter, we grew revenue and earnings per share and it had enhanced adjusted EBITDA margin performance.","Now, let's look at each of the segments in more detail. To provide clear comparability with prior periods all commentary regarding the results of our segments would be on an organic basis unless specifically stated otherwise. Segment margins are calculated using segment revenues and exclude unallocated corporate cost such as amortization of intangibles, certain transaction and integration expenses resulting from mergers and acquisitions as well as other items which we considered non-core to our operating results. This segment results do include discretionary compensation.","The human capital and benefit segment revenue was up 3% on an organic and constant currency basis compared to the first quarter of prior year. The health and benefits business delivered strong performance again this quarter with revenue growth of 11% with new business and product revenue continuing to drive revenue expansion in North America, while global benefit management appointments contributed to the growth outside of North America primarily in Western Europe and Latin America.","Health and benefits revenue growth was also bolstered by the non-recurrence of downward revenue adjustments which were made in the prior year in connection with the initial adoption of the new revenue standard.","Talent and rewards revenue increased 3% as a result of increased advisory and survey work in North America and Western Europe. As expected retirement revenue declined 2% mainly as a result of headwinds from having one less billing day this quarter and the impact of a touch comparable from the prior year, which benefited from the triennial valuation cycle worked in both Canada and Great Britain.","Technology and administration solutions revenue decreased 2% as new business activity was eclipsed by reduced demand for project work in Great Britain.","HCB's operating margin improved by 150 basis points to 25% compared to the prior year first quarter. This improvement reflects top-line growth alongside disciplined expense management efforts. HCB is our largest segment. We're confident about the future prospects of all the businesses within it, on both the short-term and long-term basis.","From employee benefits to executive compensation, HCB sits in a position of strength in the markets it serves attracting top- talent retaining over 90% of its client base and consistently generating industry-leading margins.","Now, let's look at corporate risk and broking or CRB, which had a revenue increase of 3% on a constant currency basis and 4% on an organic basis as compared to the prior year first quarter. North America's revenues grew by 4% in the first quarter primarily as a result of new business. The international regions revenue was up 6% compared to prior year as a result of new business wins in China, Argentina, Venezuela and Central America.","Western Europe contributed 5% revenue growth. Their growth was led by France's new business wins in large and mid-market accounts. Great Britain had a nominal decline in revenue. CRB revenues were $728 million with an operating margin of 17.4% as compared to a 16.8% operating margin in the prior year first quarter. The margin expanded due to the top-line performance coupled with continued cost management efforts.","As a side note, I'd like to say, how pleased I am with the progress the management team and indeed all of our colleagues in CRB have made over the last few quarters. To see the steady top-line growth and the continued margin expansion is excellent and our outlook on our CRB business remains positive going forward.","Turning to investment risk and reinsurance or IRR, revenue for the first quarter increased 6% to $589 billion on a constant currency basis and increased 5% on an organic basis as compared to the prior year first quarter. Reinsurance with growth of 6% continued to lead the segments growth through a combination of net new business and favorable renewals. Insurance consulting and technology grew by 6% mainly from technology sales.","Investment revenue declined because of one offs in the comparable period and timing of performance fee bookings in the current year. Our wholesale business was up 5% on a constant currency basis. On an organic basis wholesale revenues decreased by 6% excluding the Alston Gayler acquisition. The organic decline in wholesale was primarily attributable to reduced marine placements in the Miller unit.","Iowa had revenues of $589 million and an operating margin of 43% as compared to 45% for the prior year first quarter. The margin decline was attributable to softer trading in the Miller unit and one-off timing related items within the investment business. Overall, we continue to feel positive about the momentum of our IRR business for 2019.","Revenues for the BDA segment increased by 10% from the prior year first quarter primarily as a result of having added about 300,000 lives during the 2019 enrollment period in the mid-market and large market space. Project work and out of scope services further enhanced the segments revenue growth. Individual marketplace revenue was down nominally as seasonality for this business is shifting, while the remaining businesses in the segment generated 14% growth primarily led by benefits outsourcing.","The BDA segment had revenues of $135 million with a minus 15% operating margin. Now that's up 11% from a minus 26% in the prior year first quarter. Top-line growth and greater operating leverage both contributed to the segments margin expansion.","Our BDA offerings remained fundamental to our business growth engines of our enterprise strategy. We're optimistic about the long-term growth of this business.","So in summary, I'm very pleased with our progress. We've put a strong earnings growth in the first quarter, we had strong revenue growth, we had meaningful margin expansion and significant adjusted EPS growth all while continuing to invest in our future and return capital to shareholders through dividends.","As we look to the remainder of 2019 and beyond, our future is bright. Our business has continued to shift towards faster growing areas. We expect to reap benefits from our investments in areas focused on innovation such as digital and technology and we're confident in our ability to complete and successfully integrate TRANZACT.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Mike.","Mike Burwell","Thanks John. And I'd like to add my congratulations to our colleagues for another good quarter. And thanks to our clients for their continued support and trust in us.","First quarter represented a good start to the year with strong organic revenue growth, robust margin expansion and underlying adjusted EPS growth.","Now I'll turn to the overall detailed financial results. Let me first assess income from operations. Income from operations for the first quarter was $359 million or 15.5% of revenue up 420 basis points from the prior year first quarter income from operations of $259 million or 11.3% of revenue.","Adjusted operating income for the first quarter was $492 million or 21.3% of revenue up 200 basis points for the prior year first quarter adjusted operating income of $443 million or 19.3% of revenue.","Let me turn to earnings per share or EPS. For the first quarter of 2019 and 2018, our diluted EPS was $2.20 and $1.61 respectively. For the first quarter of 2019, our adjusted EPS was up 10% to $2.98 per share as compared to $2.71 per share in the prior year first quarter. FX was modestly worse than previously anticipated due to a stronger U.S. dollar resulting in a significant net unfavorable impact or approximately $0.12 in the quarter.","Likewise, as previously guided, we're adversely impacted by a decrease in non-cash pension income compared to the prior year which results in a year-over-year decline of $0.12 in the quarter. Excluding the combined headwinds from currency of $0.12, the reduced pension returns of $0.12 and a little bit higher tax rate of $0.02 versus a prior year adjusted EPS growth was approximately 20%.","From an effective tax rate perspective, our U.S. GAAP tax rate for the first quarter was 18.8% versus 16.3% in the prior year. Adjusted tax rate for the first quarter was 20.1% up slightly from the 19.7% rate in the prior year first quarter. This increase in the effective tax rate for the quarter compared to the prior year was primarily due to additional taxes on global intangible low taxed income or GILTI. And we continue to evaluate the impact of global tax reform on our effective tax rate including the effect of new taxes associated with computations for changes resulting from updated interpretations and assumptions issued by the taxing authorities.","As a result, the effective tax rate is subject to movements and will continue to be updated as more analysis and information becomes available. The adjusted tax rate for the first quarter is lower than our full year guidance due to one-time or discrete tax benefits related to excess tax benefits of share-based compensation and valuation allowance releases in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions.","Turning to the balance sheet. We continue to have a strong financial position, in the first quarter, we implemented a new lease accounting standard. This result had no material impact to our operating income, but did result in increase in liabilities on our balance sheet which is largely offset by a corresponding increase in assets. The grossed up total was approximately $1.5 billion.","For the first quarter of 2019, our free cash flow was negative $104 million versus $47 million in the prior year. Q1 is our seasonally lowest quarter from a cash flow standpoint due to the impact of incentive compensation payments. Year-over-year decline in free cash flow is due to higher compensation payments as well as some timing related to income taxes and pension contributions.","As we think about cash flow generation for the remainder of the year, we expect free cash flow to build as a result of operating income growth, improve working capital and disciplined capital spending. In terms of capital allocation, we paid approximately $77 million in dividends and did not repurchase any shares in the first quarter of 2019.","Thinking about our guidance, for the full year, we're reaffirming our original guidance. We continue expect organic revenue growth of around 4% and full year adjusted operating income margin to be around 20%. One point of clarification around our guidance, we will remind you that our fourth quarter is our seasonally highest quarter primarily result of our enrolment activity within our benefits administration and delivery business. Also concerning the HCB brokering recapture from the adoption of ASC 606, we recaptured approximately $11 million in Q1 2019 within the HCB segment and expect to recapture remainder by the end of Q3 2019.","The adjusted effective tax rate is still expected to be around 22% excluding any potential discrete items. And we still expect free cash flow growth of 15% or better. Foreign exchange to be a headwind to adjusted EPS in the first quarter of '19 assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect an FX headwind of around $0.15 for the full year of 2019 despite the additional potential FX headwinds, our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance will remain unchanged as projected to be in the range of $10.60 to $10.85.","On the next quarter earnings call, we expect to update our guidance to reflect the TRANZACT acquisition, which is expected to close in Q3 2019.","Overall, we delivered solid financial performance in the first quarter. While I'm pleased with the results and the continued momentum of our business, there's still a lot of opportunity ahead and remain focused on driving execution.","And I'll turn the call back to you John.","John Haley","Thanks very much Mike. And now we'll take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question coming from the line of Greg Peters of Raymond James. Your line is open.","Greg Peters","Good morning. I'll ask a couple of questions. First on organic growth; the first quarter result running ahead of your full year guidance, if I reflect back on the last couple of years, it seems like the second quarter has always been a struggle, but nevertheless, with you running ahead of your guidance it's suggesting that maybe some of the quarters may be lower going forward than where you were in the first quarter. Can you comment?","John Haley","Yes. I think, Greg, we don't reflect our guidance for what we think are relatively smaller changes we don't. So Mike [indiscernible] even though we had the negative currency effect is bigger than we anticipated, we're not changing our guidance, we have a range there. And similarly with the revenue even though we're a little bit ahead in the first quarter, we're not changing our guidance right now. So we don't adjust for every small little thing.","Greg Peters","I got it. I thought we were done with ASC 606, but it popped up in Mike's comments and if I'm not mistaken, the benefit to 2019 was going to be in total around $40 million and you've only booked $11 million of that. So that leaves $29 million to fall through in the second, third quarter, is that correct?","John Haley","Yes. I'll let Mike comment on that, but let me just say I had -- we were talking about this the other day about 606. I thought we were done with it too and I was telling folks that have reminded me from the scene in Carrie where the hand comes up out of the grave to strangle you. We just can't seem to get rid of this the effects of the standard so up. Mike?","Mike Burwell","Yes. So, Greg, the number actually is $59 million in total and the remainder above the $11 million that I commented on in my prepared remarks will happen by the end of the third quarter.","Greg Peters","I love the analogy. And so should we look at this $59 million as recurring in nature going forward. So, when I think about 2020 et cetera or is this one time where it gets pulled out of 2020 in comparison to 2019.","Mike Burwell","Now, it'll be recurring going forward, is how we think about it.","Greg Peters","All right. I guess the final question would be around the adjusted operating margin, 20% is your target for the year. And then, I look at the segment results and I've always felt like CRB had the most opportunity and yet it looked like, it was a drag on the consolidated adjusted operating margin at least in terms of improvement in the first quarter. Can you give us some updated perspective on how that might progress through the year?","Mike Burwell","Greg, so when we look at it. I mean there's no doubt we continue to see opportunity in that business. Todd Jones and the management team they're very focused on it. And we saw improvement in the first quarter in terms of overall margin improvement. We continue to think of opportunity that we'll see and continue to see that happening. So, as we look at the quarter, we're pleased with the progress they're making. We still see more as about 50 basis points improvement is what we saw in the first quarter for CRB.","Greg Peters","Okay, great. Thanks for that.","John Haley","Try to compare that to others. It's hard to compare that to the improvement in other segments because in HCB some of the 606 changes in other things, so we feel pretty good about the CRB, they're making -- as I said in my remarks, they're making good steady progress at the margin improvement exactly what we're looking for.","Greg Peters","I have other questions, but I'll follow up offline.","John Haley","Okay.","Operator","Our next question coming from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi. Good morning. Thank you. My first question, I'm just trying to get a little sense of the organic revenue outlook for HCB for the balance of the year. So, the previous question you addressed the fact that we have some rev rec benefit coming back into numbers. But then, that was offset this quarter by some timing issues in retirement. And then, also by the triennial valuation cycle. So do either of those -- do the impact of either those of two items benefit you in the back three quarters, are these things that we should be thinking about as being a headwind to organic within HCB for the balance of the year?","Mike Burwell","Yes, Elyse. We really purposely stopped giving the segment guidance and really looking at the totality around the 4% overall. But, we feel really good about the HCB business and their ability to continue to drive revenue growth. We're not overly concerned from the triennial impacts coming forward. They're very small, but we feel very confident, the management team and what that business is going to continue to drive and really contribute as we said on an overall basis around that 4%.","John Haley","I would say that the impact of the triennial valuations tends to be more pronounced in the first half of the year than in the second half.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. And then, in terms of IRR, you guys called out that wholesale organic was down around 6%, I believe due to reduced marine business within Miller. Could you just provide a little bit more color there and if that's something we expect to continue and was that the driver of the margin deterioration within IRR in the quarter?","Mike Burwell","Yes, Elyse. We were just calling out a particular businesses that we had seen, we just started seeing as much -- continued growth in that particular business. But, so yes, that's what we were -- that's what we're highlighting.","John Haley","The margin story is a little bit complicated with some of the expenses and everything.","Mike Burwell","Yes. I mean you do have -- we also have some expenses that we have included in there as we run-off -- continue to run-off and close out of our securities business. And equally when you look at where the market has been in terms of some of our performance fees, but we view those all this timing and we still feel confident back in terms of our overall guidance from an EPS standpoint, at $10.60 to $10.85 range.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. And then, in terms of the TRANZACT deal is and I know you said you guys will update on EPS guidance for that next quarter. Is the right way to think about it in that -- you're getting that business right. If the deal closes in the third quarter, the fourth quarter would be their strongest earnings quarter that relative to that type of seasonality there that would technically be accretive relative to your initial guidance or am I missing something and thinking about it that way?","John Haley","Well, there is something you need to be careful about because we were planning to buy back shares. And if we don't buy back shares and we do TRANZACT instead. Those two were offsetting whether they offset exactly or not that's something, we'll address later on.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question coming from the line of Mark Marcon with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","Mark Marcon","Good morning, John and Mike. I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit more about TRANZACT just in terms of what you've seen post the announcement just in terms of their continued momentum. They've been growing their policies at a rapid rate of 25% to 30%. Wondering if that's continuing if that from what you're seeing from an update perspective? And then, what are you hearing with regards to, obviously, it's early in the political season, but if Medicare ends up being expanded and includes say 50 plusers. How is that going to end up impacting their business?","John Haley","Yes. So I think, first of all, we're continued to be pleased with the performance of TRANZACT and they're doing very well. And in fact we expect to -- we had some sort of performance-related elements to the deal and we expect to be paying off on them. Ideally, we'd like to pay off on all of them. They really grow. But, TRANZACT continues to do -- continues to do very well and we're looking forward to getting together with them.","From the viewpoint of a Medicare expansion, whether it's even to 62 or down into the 50s, I think one of the things we found particularly attractive about the TRANZACT deal is that, if the Medicare space does expand at all that just opens up an enormous market. He has said even an expansion down to 62 would -- what's that like 10 million new lives or something like that?","Mike Burwell","Yes.","John Haley","So, all of that would be good for our business we think.","Mark Marcon","That's great. And then, can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in Great Britain. You talked about HCB and CRB, just wondering how should we think about it because this has been dragging -- Brexit's been dragging on and I'm just wondering, what you're hearing from your people over there and how they're dealing with the uncertainty?","John Haley","Yes. So I would say, I think it's actually been surprising at least to some of us that how that there's relatively little disruption on our day to day work. I mean when we talked about some of the impacts in GB, when we talked about HCB, you noticed what we were talking about was the triennial valuation cycle not Brexit itself. So, we're not necessarily seeing a big impact from there. Even CRB which I mentioned it had a nominal decline in Great Britain. Actually the performance of CRB was really pretty good and it was ahead of what we had our internal projections. And the reason is, we had several a one-off natural resource projects last year that we knew were not going to be recurring. So then coming in where they did was actually ahead of where we are.","Brexit is something that's been weighing on the British people and British business for a couple of years now. But we're not seeing any necessary acceleration of that I don't think. And so like everybody else we're just waiting to see how this plays out.","Mike Burwell","Yes. Maybe John, I would just add one comment and that is to Mark. I mean, obviously, clients come first for us and obviously clients and colleagues. And we've been thinking about various scenarios and various alternatives, obviously, giving our presence and where it sits in that marketplace for some period of time and have continued, I've been working at the detail level at least -- in terms of working out the various alternatives. So, just to add to John's comments.","Mark Marcon","Terrific. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question coming from the line of Mark Hughes with SunTrust. Your line is open.","John Haley","Hello. I don't hear anything operator.","Mike Burwell","We may have lost the operator.","Rich Keefe","Olivia?","John Haley","Olivia? Can you hear something?","Operator","Participants' lines are open.","Mark Hughes","John, can you hear me?","John Haley","Oh, okay. We can hear you now.","Mark Hughes","Okay. Very good. Looking at the BDA business last year the margin was relatively stable through the first three quarters. Looks like both in absolute dollars and percentage, would we think that should be the same this year kind of relatively steady in terms of that loss?","Mike Burwell","Yes, but less of a loss. I mean obviously our team there led by Gene Wickes has been very focused on cost management and continue to -- continuous improvement like all of our segments, continued focused on it. And so, I think that's a fair assumption, but I would say that they're focused on continuous improvement.","Mark Hughes","In the reinsurance part of IRR, I think you talked about the momentum and renewal. Any comment on how much of that is market conditions you're just seeing more activity renewal rates are possibly improved or market share gains?","John Haley","I think it's a combination of all of those so. And we don't -- we can't actually break that down, but I think I wouldn't underestimate the impact of just a change in reinsurance buying behavior among clients too. So, that definitely is an element of it.","Mark Hughes","When you see a change in behavior?","John Haley","So, in other words buying more reinsurance.","Mark Hughes","Got you. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.","Paul Newsome","Good morning. Thanks for the call. Is there any offset to the FX and your thinking about guidance for the year that sort of offset to get us back to the overall total guidance in there that you would highlight?","Mike Burwell","Make sure I follow your question. I guess what I heard you asking is, is saying look with FX at -- $0.12 overall for the first quarter, we had updated our guidance to $0.15 headwind for the year and we did not change our guidance, we kept it at $10.60 to $10.85. So then, therefore, that's what we're assuming, we're going to be able to absorb that within that range that we said would be there. And there's really no change to margins. So that's how we're thinking about it. Call me, if that is -- I'm not responding\u2026","Paul Newsome","That's exactly what I was seeing if there was some sort of -- if you think essentially the strong organic growth offset or anything that you thought you'd want to point out.","John Haley","Now, we just thought we would still be in that range.","Paul Newsome","Okay. I was hoping you could talk about a little bit of the market environment particularly for the brokerage operations and two things I would like you to touch on. One, obviously, there seems to be something going on with insurance pricing? And the other is, there are comments about dislocation of lots of folks from the GLT merger and whether or not that's having any impact on your business?","John Haley","Yes. So I mean I think -- look pricing is generally it -- each particular area has its own pricing changes. So auto is different from cyber whatever, but in general across most of them we're seeing modest price increases. I'd say that that's where -- there's a range everywhere. But they tend to be centered around modest price increases for most of them. I mean cyber is one particular example, worker's comp or both probably centered around zero change. No change in rates, but most of them have some slight one. So that's a headwind for us.","The other thing, what was it, GLT. And look we have seen a -- there have been a lot of resumes on the market and I think that's no surprise. This could be an opportunity for us to add some key people. But I think we also want to be careful about just who we bring on and when. So we're approaching this very carefully.","Paul Newsome","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question coming from the line of Adam Klauber with William Blair. Your line is open.","Adam Klauber","Good morning. Thanks. TRANZACT deal that that gives you obviously great exposure to the growing senior market. You mentioned part of the business is telesales, part of the business is digital. Give any sense just as far as that that senior market how much of the market is digital today in other words, how much of the market actually initiates or does the sales online versus more of the traditional channel?","John Haley","I don't want to wing it here. We don't have a number on that right now. That's something we'll think about putting in when we do our update on TRANZACT for next quarter.","Adam Klauber","Okay. But as part of the thesis that digital online piece is going to grow pretty rapidly?","John Haley","That's correct. We do expect that to grow. Yes. And it's one of things as we said, we liked a lot about TRANZACT.","Adam Klauber","And then thinking forward as you look at other potential deals over the longer term, is it -- are you thinking about more like TRANZACT that have that digital online exposure. Are those in the pipeline I guess what were your thoughts on expanding your digital footprint?","John Haley","So I think something that has that kind of digital capability and that kind of exposure that's a feature that makes a deal more attractive. It doesn't mean that every deal has to have that there. So we'll be looking into that. But in general, what I laid out was where -- we're looking for businesses that are going to be high margin businesses either are already there, or have the capability to get there relatively quickly. We're looking for businesses that fit in and that are relatively near adjacencies to our existing business and we're looking for that simply put because we want to understand the businesses ourselves. We don't want to be acquiring things that we don't understand inside and out. So that's why we're looking for things that are relatively near adjacencies.","But within that, if the deals accretive it's more attractive, then if it's dilutive, if it has more digital capabilities, it's more attractive than if it doesn't. So we'd be looking about that. Having said that, we're really focused on organic growth.","Adam Klauber","Great. And then, as far as you are -- the benefits business for a large and jumbo clients, some of the other competitors there's been some dislocation as you know some have been splitting their tech and consulting, some trying to figure out what to do with their technology. Has been a benefit in -- would you picking up clients in that large and jumbo market?","John Haley","I don't know that we see that as having a particular large impact now.","Adam Klauber","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question coming from the line of Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Yaron Kinar","Hi. Good morning. And I apologize in advance I missed the first part of the call. Did you talk about the FX impact on margins then if not can you maybe talk about that now?","Mike Burwell","Yes. Really no real meaningful impact on margins from FX not material.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. And then my other question, I guess I was caught off guard by the half year in terms of the triennial valuation cycle. Should there be any impact from that for the rest of the year and are there other maybe one-off that we should be thinking about for the rest of the year?","John Haley","Yes. I mean I think the answer to that is no. I mean the triennial valuations have an impact the whole year. I mean it's this year compared to last year. The effect is more pronounced in the first half of the year than it is in the second half of the year. There's nothing else comparable to that. We did call out that the last year that the triennial valuations were a reason that we had good growth last year. So it was something we tried to signal then.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. I must have missed that. And then finally, so the remaining $40 million of ASC 606 catch up in the second, third quarters. Should those be roughly evenly split or do you expect that to be more weighted to one and the two quarters?","Mike Burwell","I would think they'd be pretty even, I guess is the best way I would look at it.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question coming from the line of Sean Reitenbach with KBW. Your line is open.","Sean Reitenbach","Hi. It seems like going back to wholesale, it seems like pricing in many wholesale lines is generally positive and modest really -- modestly accelerating, but revenues decline. Would you guys call it out to the Marine? Are there any concern about the net new business going forward and whether you'd expect kind of to see some positive movement from on renewals due to rate and that be positively impacted going forward?","Mike Burwell","Yes. As John said, we see the rate is -- depends on the line and in terms of modest increase in pricing. Obviously that's winning and continue to win more than net new business so it's both volume and rates. So, we've had -- as we've articulated a little bit of volume change here that's gotten a little soft for us. But let me tell you the management team is very focused on it and we manage it for the entirety of the year, so we're giving an update here at the quarter, but our expectation is to meet what we said in terms of objectives for the year.","Sean Reitenbach","Okay. Thank you. That's the only question I had.","Operator","And our next question coming from the line of Michael Zaremski with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","John Haley","We are not hearing anything.","Operator","I'm showing [indiscernible] from the queue. At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Haley.","John Haley","Okay. Well, thanks everyone for joining us today and we look forward to updating you on our second quarter call in August.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program and you may now disconnect. Good day."],"22905":["Willis Towers Watson Public Limited (NASDAQ:WLTW) Q3 2018 Earnings Call November  2, 2018  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Rich Keefe - Head, Financial Planning & Analysis and IR","John Haley - CEO & Executive Director","Michael Burwell - CFO","Analysts","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company","Mark Marcon - Robert W.

Thank you for joining us on today's call. Today, we'll review our results for the third quarter of 2018 and discuss the outlook for the remainder of 2018. Just as a reminder, as of January 1st, 2018 we adopted the new accounting standard ASC 606, a detailed description of the impact of ASC 606 will be provided in the Form 10-Q filing and detailed explanations of how the new standard impacted our performance and the presentation of our financial statements has been provided in our earnings release this morning.","Our first report the results using the prior accounting standard excluding the impact of the new accounting standard. So based on the prior accounting standard that is without the impact of ASC 606 reported revenue for the third quarter was $1.9 billion, up 3% as compared to the prior year third quarter, and up 4% on a constant currency basis, and up 5% on an organic basis. Reported revenue included $23 million of negative currency movement.","We experienced growth on an organic basis across all of our segments for this quarter. Net income was $85 million or up 257% for the third quarter, as compared to the prior year third quarter net loss of $54 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $368 million or 19.4% of revenue as compared to the prior year adjusted EBITDA of $322 million or 17.4% of revenue, representing a 14% increase on an adjusted EBIT dollar basis and 200 basis points of margin improvement.","For the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $0.63 and adjusted diluted earnings per share were a $1.62. Overall it was an excellent quarter. We grew revenue earnings per share and had enhanced adjusted EBITDA margin performance.","Now turning to the results based on ASC 606 or the new accounting standard. Reported revenues for the third quarter were $1.9 billion, net income for the third quarter was $46 million; adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $313 million or 16.8% of revenue. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $0.33 and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1. 32.","Now let's look at each of the segments in more detail. To provide clearer comparability with prior periods all commentary regarding the results of our segments will be based on the prior accounting standard and reflect revenues on a constant currency basis unless specifically stated otherwise. Segment margins are calculated using segment revenues and they exclude unallocated corporate costs such as amortization of intangibles, restructuring costs, and certain transaction and integration expenses resulting for mergers and acquisitions, as well as other items which we consider non core to our operating results.","The segment results do include discretionary compensation. For the third quarter, total segment revenues grew 4% on a constant currency basis and 5% on an organic basis. Human Capital and Benefits or HCB had a solid quarter with 2% constant currency in organic growth as compared to the prior year third quarter. The solid performance extended across all our businesses in this segment. We had the strongest growth in our health and benefits business with revenue increasing by 6% as compared to the prior year third quarter. The growth is primarily a result of our continued momentum outside of North America related to global benefit management appointments, as well as increases in local and regional market share.","In addition, we experienced solid growth in north America driven by increased advisory work and growth in our specialty products. Talent and rewards third quarter revenue increased by 1% as compared to the prior third quarter even as we narrowed the focus of our T&R software portfolio to those products with the greatest growth and profit potential. The net growth was primarily due to strong market demand for project work in Western Europe and international, coupled with growth in our compensation survey business.","As expected, the retirement business experience nominal growth compared to the prior year third quarter. A lower level of de-risking like bulk lump sums in North America was more than offset by growth in Great Britain related to peak volume in the triennial actuarial valuation cycle and growth in Western Europe due to pension brokerage activity. ","Our technology and administrative solutions or TAS revenue was flat compared to the prior third quarter with increased revenues in Germany from new client implementations offset by a decline in the international region. The operating margin for the HCB segment was 21% an increase of 1% from the prior year third quarter. Revenue growth and disciplined expense management contributed to the margin growth.","Now turning to the HCB results including the impact of the new revenue standard. The HCB segment had revenues of $778 million and an operating margin of 25%. Overall, we continue to have a positive outlook for the HCB business for the remainder of 2018. Now let's look at corporate risk in brokering or CRB, which had a revenue increase of 4% on both a constant currency and organic basis as compared to the prior year third quarter. North America's revenue grew by 6% in the third quarter with strong results across all lines of businesses, while international also continued its strong momentum with 9% constant currency growth and 10% organic growth in the quarter, driven primarily by new business wins in Asia and Latin America.","In Western Europe, there was solid growth of 3% attributable to positive results in Iberia with several new business wins in construction, energy and claims management and similarly there was growth in Switzerland and France as well. Great Britain had a revenue decline of 2% and we continue to see some London market challenges. CRB revenues were $616 million with an operating margin of 10% as compared to an 8% operating margin in the third quarter last year. The margin expanded due to the top line performance coupled with continued cost management efforts.","Now turning to the CRB results including the impact of the new revenue standard. For the third quarter, CRB had revenues of $622 million and an operating margin of 11%. We continue to be optimistic the momentum in our CRB business going forward as we close out the year.","Turning to Investment Risk and Reinsurance or IRR, revenue for the third quarter increased 7% on a constant currency basis and increased 9% on an organic basis, as compared to the prior year third quarter. Reinsurance had a very strong quarter with 10% revenue growth driven by North America and specialty as a result of new business generation, strong renewals and higher investment income. Insurance, Consulting and Technology grew by 8% as a result of increased consulting projects and software sales. Wholesale increased by 9% with new business growth and increased demand across our programs business.","Investment grew 5% as a result of new client implementations and continued growth in the delegated investment services space. Max Matthiessen grew 15% as a result of an increase in assets under management and new business. The IRR segment had revenues of $337 million compared to $321 million for the prior year third quarter and a 15% operating margin, up 547 basis points from the prior year third quarter. The third quarter 2018 margin expanded due to the robust revenue growth for the quarter.","Turning now to IRR results including the impact of the new revenue standard. IRR had revenues of $317 million and an operating margin of 9%. We continue to feel very positive about the momentum of the IRR business for the remainder of 2018. Revenues for the BDA segment increased by 2% from the prior year third quarter, driven by increased enrollments, our individual marketplace revenues increased by 9% and the rest of the segment increased by 12%. Increased membership and new clients drove the revenue increase in benefits outsourcing, while the group marketplace business continued to grow primarily due to new clients and customized active exchange project.","So let me turn into 2019 enrollments. As we mentioned in our previous earnings call, enrollment continued to look strong in both the mid market and the large market space. We currently have over 30 clients with about 300,000 total lives that have committed for the 2019 enrollment period. The mid market sales season is winding down and won't be finalized until later this month. So we won't be able to present final enrollment count until year-end earnings call. The individual marketplace exchange enrollment seasonality has been shifting somewhat over the recent years.","We're seeing enrollments spread more evenly throughout the year due to off cycle enrollments in agents and a more modest increase in enrollments during the fall enrollment season. The BDA segment had revenues of $200 million with a 21% operating margin, up 59 basis points as compared to the prior year third quarter. The expansion in margin was a result of the strong revenue growth, as well as our ability to continue to scale these businesses. The BDA segment reflecting the new revenue standard had revenues of $127 million and an operating margin of negative 26%. The primary driver this difference is due to the effect of the new revenue accounting standard on the individual marketplace.","These revenues must now be recognized at the date of placement rather than prorating them starting at their effective date. This means that the revenue typically generated by placements in the 2017 fall enrollment period was recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of January 1st, 2018. This revenue under the prior standard would have started to be recognized in January 2018 on a pro-rata basis throughout the year. In contrast under the new revenue standard the revenues generated by annual enrollment activity in the fall are now recognized immediately.","So this will change the seasonality of the revenue recognition to be higher in the second half of the calendar year. In summary, I'm very pleased with our progress. We produce strong earnings growth in the third quarter and on track to deliver excellent financial performance in 2018. For the full year, we continue to expect strong revenue growth, meaningful margin expansion and significant EPS growth, all this while continuing to invest in our future and return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","I'd like to thank all of our colleagues for their continued client focus, collaboration and engagement and congratulate everyone on a very good quarter.","Now I'll turn the call over to Mike.","Michael Burwell","Thanks John and good morning to everyone. Thanks to all of you for joining us. My comments will reflect our earnings without the impact of ASC 606 unless otherwise stated. In order assist with comparability over prior year period. ","Now let's turn to the financial overview. Let me first discuss income from operations. Income from operations for the third quarter was $ 66 million or 3.5% of revenue, up 354% from the prior year third quarter loss from operations of $26 million or negative 1.4% of revenue. Adjusted operating income for third quarter was $243 million or 12.8% of revenue, up 10% from the prior year third quarter, adjusted operating income of $220 million or 11.9% of revenue.","Income from operations for the nine months of 2018 was $697 million or 10.8% of revenue, up 60% from the same period in the prior year of $436 million or 7.1% of revenue. Adjusted operating income for the nine months of 2018 was $1.3 billion or 19.4% of revenue, and up 10% as compared to the same period in the prior year in which adjusted operating income was $1.1 billion or18.6% of revenue.","Now let me turn to adjusted diluted earnings per share or adjusted EPS. For the third quarter of 2018 and 2017, our diluted EPS was $0.63 and negative $0.40 respectively. For the third quarter of 2018, our adjusted EPS was up 45% to a $1.62 per share as compared to a $1.12 per share in the prior year third quarter. The nine months of 2018 and 2017 diluted EPS was $4.58 and $2.36 respectively. For the nine months of 2018 adjusted EPS was up 26% to $7.92 per share versus $6.30 per share in the same period in the prior year.","Under the new revenue recognition standard, our diluted EPS was $0.33 for the quarter and $2. 39 for the nine months of 2018 and our adjusted EPS was a $1.32 per share for the quarter and $5.74 for the nine months of 2018.","Let's move to taxes. I'd like to provide you with some additional insight into our US GAAP and adjusted tax rates. Without the impact of ASC 606, the US GAAP tax rate for the third quarter was zero, as compared to negative 53% for the prior year third quarter. Our adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was 17%, a decrease from 32% for the prior year third quarter. Our adjusted tax rate for third quarter is lower than a prior year due to one-time discreet tax benefits.","Let's move to the balance sheet. We continue to have a strong financial position. During the quarter, we successfully issued one billion in senior notes comprised of $600 million of ten-year notes and $400 million of 30-year notes. We feel that this transaction helps with the efficiency of our capital structure and provides additional financial flexibility. The bond proceeds were used to pay off $128 million term loan balance due in 2019 and to repay approximately $862 million under our revolving credit facility.","Year-to-date including the impact of the new revenue standard, our free cash flow was $507 million, an increase of $190 million or 60% compared to the same period in the prior year. Without the impact of the new revenue standard, our year-to-date free cash flow was $544 million, an increase of $227 million or 72% compared to the same period in the prior year. We expect the fourth quarter to be our highest cash generating quarter.","During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 132 million in shares. We expect buyback to have a total of 600 million to 700 million shares in 2018 subject to market conditions. Since the merger, we have repurchased or retired approximately 11.1 million shares and paid $706 million in dividends. So we think about our full-year guidance, we reported quarterly and year-to-date 2000 financial results in this morning's release based on both ASC 606 standard and the old accounting standard ASC 605.","However, we want to ensure that investors have a clear line of sight to our progress as we finished the last year of our three-year integration period. As such, we're continuing to provide guidance on the 2017 US GAAP standard or ASC 605 prior to the ASC 606 standard. So now let's review our full year 2018 guidance for Willis Towers Watson.","For the company, we continue to expect organic revenue growth to be approximately 4%. For the segments, we expect revenue growth to be low single digits for HCB, CRB and IRR and mid the high single digit growth for BDA. We continue to expect adjusted EBITDA to be around 25% for the full year. Transaction integration costs are expected to be in the range of $180 million versus our previous guidance of approximately $140 million to $150 million. The expected increase in immigration spend relates primarily to additional cost savings actions that have identified in our business segments which are expected yield meaningful savings in 2019.","Taking these additional actions into account, we believe we can improve our adjusted EBITDA margin outlook by at least 50 basis points for the overall company in fiscal year 2019. As a result of this free tax benefits recognized in Q3 and our current interpretation of US Tax Reform, we're reducing the adjusted tax rate from a range of 22% to 23% to a range of 20% to 21%. This tax guidance is consistent for both the old and new accounting standards but may change as we complete our US tax reform analysis and receive additional clarification implementation guidance from the US Treasury.","Changes and interpretations assumptions, applicability of retroactive regulations as well as the actions we may take as a result of US tax reform may also impact this guidance. Accordingly, we are raising our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance to a $10.12 to $10.32 from our previous guidance of $9.88 to $10.12. We expect free cash flow of approximately $900 million to $1.1 billion versus our previous guidance of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion in 2018. There is a small difference in free cash flow between the prior and new accounting standards. The difference as a result of moving a portion of capitalized software-related to client system implementations from investing activities to operating activities in the cash flow statement.","This accounting change does not impact our overall guidance or our capital allocation strategy. We will continue to use the former ASC 605 accounting standard for the remainder of 2018 to assess bonus calculations, capital for dividends, share buybacks, internal investments and M&A. Annual guidance assumes average currency exchange rates of a $1.34 to the pound and $1.19 to the euro.","So in summary, we have seen good acceleration and revenue growth, greater operating leverage and continued cash flow improvement this quarter. Which should continue to position us well to execute on our plans this year and help us drive significant shareholder value creation on the long term basis?","With that I'd happy to turn the call back to you John.","John Haley","Thanks Mike. And now we'll take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Your first question comes from the line of Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Kai Pan","Thank you and good morning. The first question on the organic growth, you have nice rebound from the second quarter, if you look at your results towards the segments, it's roughly in line with your global peers. I just wonder could you give a probably more detail about what's the improvement from second quarter to the third quarter. Do you see across your line --are you sort of be able to maintain your share, your competitive position or you be able to gain shares going forward?","John Haley","Yes. So let me say I think when we had the second quarter call I think we advised people that it was probably better look at the first half as a comparison as to how we were doing against our peers versus the second quarter. Only if you look at the first half, we were at or above our peers generally. And one of the things I think we're delighted with the revenue growth we have here. And we're especially delighted because if you look at it in the third quarter of last year, our revenue growth was generally higher than our peers in the third quarter of last year. So we had tougher comparables, so having tougher comparables and getting the growth we had here we couldn't be happier with the result. And we think that reflects our competitive positioning if we look at the third quarter, the whole three quarters of this year. We think that's a fair look at our competitive positioning.","Kai Pan","Okay, that's great. My second question is on the margin. The 200 basis point year-over-year improvements but if-- you also mention your Q&A session on press release that there's a large improvement $32 million in the other income lines. So that probably contributed to most of the margin improvements year-over-year, and so I just wonder what's your view on the underlying basically revenue versus expense gross? And also want to clarify that you said at least 50 basis point improvements versus in 2019, would that imply on the old accounting or new accounting? Basically what I try to get is that your margin next year, will it be like at least 25.5% or 24.5%.","John Haley","So let me -- I'm going to let Mike talk about the specifics of the $32 million et cetera and how that factors in there but let me just make a couple of quick comments. And first of all, one of the things we said coming out of the third quarter -- at the second quarter call was that we, our expenses were running ahead of where we thought they should be then. And we thought that we could control that. And if you look at the margin improvement we have here, what we've done is we hollered our expense growth down to 2%.","So we've had 4% to 5% growth rate and we've had a 2% expense growth rate. That's exactly what we told folks we felt we could do, and that's what's contributing the margin improvement. We think that's something that we can continue to exercise that kind of discipline going forward. I think the 50 basis points that should translate to either revenue standard where as we look at that. That's not impacted as much by the revenues, it's actually an expense control item again. But Mike let -- ","Michael Burwell","Yes, John. I would add on the $32 million other income. So just picking it back up on John's comments. so we look at across the segment's we had 220 basis points improvement in margins across all four segments. And as John said, due to 2% management of expenses in addition to that 5% organic revenue growth. The other income was $32 million is in terms of the change that was included in there. And so that was what we see is pension what we see in terms of managing our foreign currency impacts overall. So that's how we think about it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Your line is open.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Hello, can you hear me? Okay, thanks. I just want to piggyback off the last question and just ask you first just to break out that $32 million year-over-year increase. How much is pension? How much was FX and how much was that loss from disposal business? Because people look at that pension expand gain is kind of a one-time -ish thing and we're trying to get kind of year-over-year growth in margin excluding that. ","Rich Keefe ","I can add a little bit here. If you look at the -- so that's on a GAAP basis that changed on the other income line. We did have adjustments for pension settlement items. So there's a variety of things in there. If you look at the press release and what we adjusted out, if you look at it an adjusted basis, the other income net line I think it's roughly about $12 million difference year-over-year. It's off the income and it's mainly less FX hedging losses that's kind of the composition of that.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","So if we're to take it year-over-year, it's really an increase of 12 and most of it as FX is what you are saying?","Rich Keefe ","Correct, less FX hedge losses.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Got it and then Mike is the entire guidance raised just the difference in tax rate?","Michael Burwell","Yes It is normal.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay, great and then can you also go into what's going on with the free cash flow? It sounded like-- you're saying there was an account, it's differences where you put stuff kind of real estate on the cash flow statement, is that something that just came to your attention in this quarter or no --","Michael Burwell","No. I would say timing is always a challenge in terms of when you communicate things, but what we looked at it was we are completing some additional CapEx spends specifically around our facilities consolidations as we continues in our merger and consolidating office space that we have just as an example. Additionally, you're seeing the additional spend that we're going to do on integration, and that additional drives that incremental cost and we see that benefit obviously in that 50 basis points improvement and moving as John referenced into the fiscal year 2019. ","So those are just a couple of the bigger pieces of that in terms of our adjustment back to it, but we still look at and say look, we're 60% up in terms of our free cash flow. We not going away from our long-term guidance in terms of where we're going to get to from thinking about free cash flow, but we thought it was appropriate to make sure we gave you and ultimately investors view as to what that would be based on what we know.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","So the $200 million difference is how much of it is CapEx and facilities? Is that all of it?","Michael Burwell","No, no.","John Haley","It's a number of things, Shlomo. We have the additional, the CapEx was how much? ","Michael Burwell","CapEx was around $40 million ","John Haley","CapEx was around $40 million. We had the additional restructuring of that was like --","Michael Burwell","$35 million","John Haley","$35 million, we had and this was something we knew earlier, but it wasn't big enough to necessarily adjust but we had a make an extra $40 million pension contribution to the UK. And so there's -- it's a number of little things like that that most of these are items that we expect to be, I mean the $40 million is a one-off for this year for the pension -- UK pension. $35 million is one of the CapEx increases one-off, so there are things that we don't think will affect it going forward, but they did affect it for this year.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Got it, if I could just sneak in the last one. Hey, John given the decline in the stock price and your confidence and hitting all these margins how come you're just not getting a way more aggressive on the stock repurchases?","John Haley","Well, I think what we try to do. Shlomo, is we try not --we actually have some metrics where we use as the stock prices lower --will ramp up our purchases a little bit more than we did, but we also are trying to be real careful about not borrowing to buyback the stock. And if you look this year, this quarter I mean given that we had our dividend payments and our stock repurchases, we returned over 80% of our cash flow to shareholders already.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon from R W Baird. Your line is open.","Mark Marcon","Good morning. And it's nice to see the progress over the three-year period. I was wondering you gave the guidance for the full year by the, in terms of the segment. I'm just wondering how should we think about the growth in the segments next year and the following year. And specifically IRR was seemed to be quite strong, the commentary also sounded strong. Is it possible that we could end up seeing a little bit stronger growth on an out year basis? Or how should we think about that? Thank you.","John Haley","So I think, Mark, we'll be giving our detailed guidance for 2019 at the next call, but just to deal with IRR for the moment. They have had a fantastic year. I think it's been -- it's really all the different parts of it as I was going through have contributed, but especially reinsurance has had a very strong year. As I said in the in my prepared remarks, we expect to see this continued growth through the remainder of 2018. The other comment I could give it this time is we've set ourselves up for a tough comparable for 2019 of course with the good growth we've had here.","But this is also a business that we like the performance and we like the prospects a lot.","Mark Marcon","Yes. So tough comp but overall fundamentals continue to be good and then --","John Haley","Exactly.","Mark Marcon","Yes and then with regard to today on HCB. Can you talk a little bit about what you think we might end up seeing with lump sums for next year given the change in rate environment. How should we think about that and then you've made some changes there optimizing things to a greater extent. How should we think about HCB particularly given the current economic environment with unemployment rates coming down?","John Haley","Yes. So I think, first of all, the bulk lump sums are down this year as we had expected they would be. And so I think we have--there's a case where we have an easy comparable compare to the bulk lump sum going forward for next year. Again, we haven't gotten to any kind of detailed estimate on that but I would say overall the decision to do bulk lump sums is as much an arbitrage rate between what the rate you can catch them out that and the accounting rate that you're using, as it is of the absolute level of the rate.","So there's reason to do both lump sums even when the rates are low, and there's reasons not to do sometimes when rates are higher, but overall we do think the increase in rates will probably pick up bulk lump sum activity, but again we don't have any real thoughts as to how significant that will be or even if it will be significant. But I think it's certainly not going to be a lower level of activity than we've had this year. So we feel pretty good about that.","Mark Marcon","And talent and rewards","John Haley","So another part to your question, Mark, I'm sorry.","Mark Marcon","Yes. Just the talent and rewards within that, within HCB.","John Haley","Yes. So I think talent and rewards is one of the areas that we saw, did not perform very well in the first half of the year particularly in the second quarter. And we said then that we would be taking some actions to try to control expenses there and to get the growth up. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, that's an area that grew about 1% or so. We're actually happy with that because one of the things we've done is made sure that we're trying to focus on the areas that have the growth and the profit potential. And I stress actually growth and profit potential.","There are areas and talent and rewards that we see that seem to be relatively high growth and seem to have very little or negative profit. Those are not particularly attractive to us. We want to be in the high profit and the growth areas. And so doing some of that movement to those areas and getting the 1% growth, we like the margins we had and we think we are placed to grow from there.","Mark Marcon","That sounds great, easy comp, so that sets us up well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi, thank you, good morning. My first question is just about your longer-term guidance for a little double-digit EPS growth. So when we're thinking about 2019 should we essentially be using the EPS guidance for 2018 that you gave us today, and then assume double-digit EPS growth from there, since essentially the Delta between new and old accounting should come back next year.","John Haley","Yes. So I think, Elyse, as I've mentioned in response to a couple of the other questions we're really going to give the detail 2019 guidance at the next earnings call after we're finished with the first -- after we finished with the full year. A couple of comments; one, the idea of low double-digit EPS growth is in fact an aspiration we have over the next medium-term outlook coming up here, but how that factors into any specific year I think we will adjust that as appropriate. That's not to suggest we won't come out with low double-digit growth just that we haven't come out with the actual 2019 numbers yet.","Your point is well-taken though that some of the 2016 difficulties that we've had with 606 will those disappear when we move into 2019. And so we actually expect the kind of growth we would see should be more robust.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, great and then is it possible-- can we get the tax rate? How that's running year-to-date on adjusted earnings excluding discrete items?","Michael Burwell","Well, yes, let me - we pull some data here, Elyse.","John Haley","We are going to try and do this in real life, Elyse, but --so we will try and mention that in a few more minutes if we --it will pop -- we are working and do another answer.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, yes, because I was just trying to get a sense of like go forward tax rate for 2019 and then the unallocated net that was $65 million in the quarter. Is that the right level to think about for that line on a go-forward basis?","John Haley","Mike do you want to?","Michael Burwell","It moves around a little bit, Elyse. I mean I think your estimate we've kind of said that's in the range of where it is but it does move around a little bit.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay and then one more just follow up on Kai's question. Your 50 basis points at least of margin expansion for next year. So there is a margin Delta between new and old accounting. So it's essentially that mean that we'll see 50 basis points plus the margin accretion from getting back the earnings that we lost, meaning it could be greater under new accounting than the 50 basis points.","John Haley","That's correct.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. Your line is open.","Greg Peters","Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. I was-- I wanted to focus on the integration expense and you called it out and there's going to be more integration expense in 2018 than originally visioned. And I'm just curious about how I should be thinking about this line beyond the fourth quarter because it seems like you're finding additional opportunities for savings. And is it reasonable to assume that there's going to be some ongoing continuing integration or restructuring that's going to sort of part of your longer term operational improvement concept.","John Haley","Yes. So, Greg, the answer to that is, no, it's going to be zero. Now if there are restructurings that come up in the future, we're going to, we're actually making a distinct effort, we're going to try not to do that at all, to the extent we do it, we'll just take it as part of the normal earnings.","Greg Peters","Got it and thanks for that. ","John Haley","It's less than half ","Greg Peters","Yes, make sense. I guess the second question I would have is perhaps you can spend a minute and talk about some of the moving parts in organic in CRB, North America versus Europe, UK and I know one of the issues you called up before was the market derived income maybe you can update us on what's going on with that?","John Haley","Yes. So I think our --I think our market derived income is down year-over-year. We see pressure around premium flow into the London market. That's hampering our performance in this space and another important thing is in the prior year period we had several one-time projects that we just don't have this year. And so that's contributing to the overall shortfall, but I would have to say that the London market stands out as a quite a distinction from all the other areas around the globe where we're seeing strong growth.","Greg Peters","And just a follow up on that. Your view on Brexit and how it might affect that business, that's my last question.","John Haley","Yes. I mean, look, I think Brexit is something that as with all businesses across all different areas, we need to be worried about making sure that we can provide continuity of service and a seamless transition for our clients and for -- and indeed for our reinsurance partners post Brexit. And that's really regardless of how things happen. We have plans that we've been working hard on. We are --we've been working diligently to make sure that we're prepared for any different outcome in Brexit. We're very close to finalizing our post Brexit platform including the necessary regulatory approvals.","And that's something that we'll be announcing in the near future. We're not able to say anything today, but we'll come out with something soon on that, but we're confident we have a good plan.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Styblo from Jefferies. Your line is open. ","David Styblo","Hi, good morning. Thanks for the questions. I'm going to maybe try to give you an opportunity to circle back to Elyse's question a little bit as part of this question. But can you help us understand realizing, you don't want to get into specific EPS guidance for next year, what's some of the key headwinds and tailwind would be to that. Obviously, you talked about the increased integration spending yielding another 50 basis points of margin expansion. I think you guys also are not quite realizing the full benefits in this year of the cost energies that run up $175 million. I think the exit run rate goal was $175 million. So I think that provides some incremental benefit next year.","Could you maybe quantify how much that would be? And then on the flip side it seems like again kind of going back to Elyse's question at least the taxes reverting back to perhaps a more normalized level for next year would be a headwind. Is that anything you to add on to that just to help us get a sense of moving parts considering that the Street's 10.74% for next year seems to imply pretty low growth especially off the new guidance range now.","John Haley","Yes. I mean, I when we look at -we feel good about our businesses in terms of their growth prospects going forward. And as I referenced in terms of what we thought we would be in terms of the rates of overall revenue growth and those low to mid single digits for all business except BDA. And really kind of being in that double-digit area, but we feel good about those prospects and obviously as we've continued to perform whether it gives more difficult comps for us no different than we had in this quarter.","But we feel that's the kind of right growth and as John said we will update that here in the fourth quarter. As it relates to tax, I would just say and we're continuing to work the real-time numbers here, but as I mentioned in my prepared comments as well that we had discrete items that drove our tax rate down here in the third quarter. We believe that those discrete items will -- some of those will reverse in the fourth quarter. And again doing nothing more than the math and when you look at it at 20% to 21% effective rate, it gets you about a 23% to 27% rate in the fourth quarter in terms of looking at it. ","As you look at and think about that rate going forward we have no reason to believe it will be different. Frankly, at this time but we'll continue to evaluate all treasury guidance as it's issued and its applicability to us. We do believe we will see some additional rules come in the fourth quarter. We will evaluate those and honestly, we'll update on year end call in terms of what that looks like for us going forward, but at this stage we don't know anything further and that's kind of our best guess and best view, and not guess but our best perspective of it going forward.","John Haley","Yes and let me just make sure we're clear about this. I think to answer Elyse's questions the discrete item we had in this quarter was about $12 million or something like that. That's going to reverse in the fourth quarter. So when we're giving you the projection of 20% to 21% for the year, that's something that's not affected by this discrete item because we've already assumed that's going to reverse in the fourth quarter. And I guess that's really what probably I think Elyse was asking for is. What's a --how can I get to a more normal tax rate and I think what we're telling is 20% to 21% is what we see as the normal tax rate.","David Styblo","Okay that's really helpful on that part. Can you come back maybe to the margins a little bit because I think that's an area just specifically the cost energies that we are still to generate exit run rate of a $175 million. Is there extra that will annualize next year to that to 2019 numbers?","John Haley","Yes. Again, we're not in a position to go into any details really on those things, but I would just say, look, we said when we were targeting our margin of around 25% this year that we thought that we would get increases in the years beyond that. And we expect to see when we come out to update on our expected 2019 earnings in February, we'll be coming out with some expected increases in our margins.","David Styblo","Okay, thanks. And then on just the exchanges, sounds like you guys have about 300,000 members that'll be rolling on it at some point throughout the year in 2019. Can you help us understand what that base is or what you're expecting the base to be at the end of this year? So we have a sense of growth for that business. And is there any comments, I don't think I heard any comments about the right retiree exchange. How the-- how is did the prospects look for that growth next year?","John Haley","Yes. I mean so the growth in the BDA segment is largely a function of the growth in the individual marketplace. The group marketplace is the much smaller portion of that. I don't have the numbers right in front of me in terms of the enrollment. Can I ask you to follow up with Rich on that, but I mean I think here's what we would say is that overall we expect the group marketplace to grow up into the double digits. It'll be a good bit above the double digits probably and a good way into there anyway. And the individual marketplaces probably going to grow in the mid to high single digits. And so that's how the combination comes out right around 10% something like that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tobey Sommer from SunTrust. Your line is open. ","Tobey Sommer","Thanks. I was wondering if you could discuss the broad drivers of organic growth not from a market perspective but internally?. Maybe three levers, price, your internal headcount growth whether it's consultants or brokers and their productivity. How would you kind of prioritize those in terms of ascending or descending order of drivers of growth in the quarter? And maybe as you look out which ones do you think will be the biggest contributors?","John Haley","Yes. So I think look consulting traditionally has been a business that you tend to get, it's by adding consultants that you tend to increase the revenues there. I think in the last decade or so we've seen a little bit more of revenues from increased technology which can give a bit of scale, but I think it's still largely a business which is driven by bodies, and so I think we'll continue to see that is the most important driver although we will see some tools and software and products that are --that'll help.","I think in the brokerage business, it's I think it's a similar thing although I-- and I think what happens though is that to the extent technology comes in and we get some efficiencies and make our brokers more productive then it may be that we can get that without increased headcount.","Michael Burwell","Yes. Maybe John I would just add to your comments on just in terms of the pricing, pricing is really kind of been in that 0% to 1% depending whether you've had losses or not. And so that's really kind of been the overall numbers from a pricing standpoint.","Tobey Sommer","Are you going to be able to generate the kind of organic growth that you're targeting in add ahead and still kind of maintain that 2% expense for us that you mentioned previously?","John Haley","Yes. So, look, we --the business Willis Towers Watson as a whole, we went out after the second quarter results and said we need to be more disciplined about how we're managing it, and these are the kinds of things we wanted to do. We didn't go out looking to cut out people. We looked to reduce unnecessary meetings and be more efficient the way we held meetings to focus on a lot of their internal expenses and not on expenses that are related to client work. And by doing that we pulled it down to the 2%.","We recognize that, and we think that if we continue to do that we can, and that's something that we should be able to continue to do into the fourth quarter and indeed beyond.","Michael Burwell","Yes and I would add, John, just I mean just every investment that we continue to make or every one of our service offerings has a technology component to it, and it continues to drive some level of productivity overall that we're seeing across the business. But as you commented it before, it's not changing overnight. It's incremental in terms of what's happening.","Tobey Sommer","Thanks. Since the integration period, we're coming to a close, how do we think about your capital of employment as we get into the next few years, assuming that the stock starts short like the better organic growth momentum you have there? Thanks.","John Haley","Yes. So I think, look, the --what we've always said is if we can find acquisitions that make sense and in organic growth, we --that's actually what we would prefer to do. We prefer to find things that can grow the organization and grow it profitably. When we're comparing that to a stock that we think is somewhat undervalued at the moment, it's hard to find some acquisitions that actually pass those threshold particularly acquisitions of any size. And so we're going to continue though with that overall priority. Acquisitions that make sense would be number one, and if we can't do that we're going to return our cash to shareholders.","As I mentioned in responds to a previous question if you look at the last quarter, we returned over 80% of our free cash flow to shareholders. I think that's something that we would be looking to do in the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome from Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.","Paul Newsome","Good morning. Thanks for the call. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about what might be or could be possible levers for margin improvements really beyond 2019 and beyond as well and excluding sort of the obvious of just trying to get revenue faster than expenses. Are there other things that you think you can do to improve profitability prospectively?","John Haley","Well, I mean the obviously answer I think is that technology is making us more efficient, making all employees more efficient in all businesses. And I think that's especially true in a professional service firm like ours. And so we continue to look at the possibilities of using technology in all of our consulting businesses, as well as in our brokerage businesses. I mean I joined the company over four years ago as an actuary and I look at the kind of projections it used to take me a month to do on these enormous spreadsheets, actual physical paper spreadsheets that I had.","And today's actuaries press a button and get 10,000 of them in three seconds. So we've seen technology influence everything we do. And I think sometimes we don't recognize some of the incremental things that occur year-to-year, but that would be the biggest part.","Paul Newsome","And a separate big picture question would be thinking about organic growth prospectively are we past the impacts of the integration at this point even though we're still having I guess into the integration charges? And if that's the case then do we have some of that relief or change or differences as we get past 2019.","John Haley","I'm not sure quite what your question is. I mean we don't expect to have --there will be no integration expenses going into next year, but you started out asking about organic growth. I'm not quite sure what your question is.","Paul Newsome","I guess I'm making the assumption that when you're doing integration changes that actually has a negative impact typically on organic growth. And obviously this year has been very strong, and I'm just curious if they're still and in years past you've had lags in organic growth that appeared to have to do with putting the two big companies together. I'm asking if that's in your opinion over and this year and that's we're seeing that or if it's, there's still some benefits to the release, let's call it prospectively.","John Haley","No. I think that's, I think that's over. In fact, I would say that that was almost wholly a 2016 phenomenon. We had a little bit of, in some businesses a little bit creeped into 2017, but if you look at 2017 we performed as, we grew as fast as any of our competitors. And into 2018 we're doing the same. So, no, we don't see any impact from that. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Yaron Kinar","Thanks so much for taking my question. Just want to go back to a free cash flow for a second. Is the software capitalization is that part of the CapEx that you'd called out the $40 million of CapEx or is that separate?","Michael Burwell","It's separate. ","Yaron Kinar","Separate, okay. So $120 million or so of those items that you called out FX and CapEx restructuring that you also have to have the software capitalization. And if we take that and kind of roll forward are you so comfortable with 75% to 80% of the adjusted EBITDA as the free cash flow margin long-term?","Michael Burwell","Yes. I mean as we say long-term right. I mean we're looking that's where our ultimate goal is into the future, yes. ","John Haley","Yes. But I mean I think the, yes, it's so, a; yes 75% to 80% is the right longer-term thing. We, I think our free cash flow is growing 75% or 72%.","Michael Burwell","In terms of this probably this year. ","John Haley","And we expect to see a significant growth next year too, yes.","Yaron Kinar","Okay and then my second question were just going back to the brokerage space. We've seen a couple of deals in that space. Do you see that impacting your business whether in a positive or negative way? Have you seen any maybe revenue creepage or talent creepage from some of those deals moving your way?","John Haley","No, we, I mean I think anytime there's a big deal, there's always some market repercussions that occur there both in terms of the way your competitors are reconfigured, and how they go to market. And in terms of sometimes individuals looking to move from those organizations. And we see a little bit of that but we haven't seen any big impacts.","And this concludes our question-and -answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Haley.","John Haley","Okay. Thanks very much everyone for joining us on today's call. And I look forward to talking about our fourth-quarter earnings and full year call in February.","Operator","And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"22904":["Willis Towers Watson PLC (NASDAQ:WLTW) Q2 2018 Earnings Conference Call August  2, 2018  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Rich Keefe - Head, Financial Planning & Analysis and IR","John Haley - CEO & Executive Director","Michael Burwell - CFO","Analysts","Charles Peters - Raymond James & Associates","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company","Mark Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Mark Marcon - Robert W.

Before I begin, I just want to thank Aida Sukys for her years of service as our Investor Relations Director. Aida has recently moved into another finance position as our company's new Head of Global Finance Business Operations. And I want to thank Aida for her many contributions, her counsel and her partnership over the last 6 years and for being a great ambassador for Willis Towers Watson. We wish her continued success in her new role.","Now we'll review our results for the second quarter of 2018 and the first half of 2018. Just as a reminder, as of January 1, 2018, we adopted the new accounting standard, ASC 606. A detailed description of the impact of ASC 606 will be provided in the Form 10-Q filing, and detailed explanation of how the new standard impacted our performance and the presentation of our financial statements has been provided in our earnings release this morning.","I'll report the results first using the prior accounting standard, excluding the impact of the new accounting standard. So based on the prior accounting standard, without the impact of ASC 606, reported revenue for the second quarter was $2 billion, up 4% as compared to the prior year second quarter and up 2% on a constant currency basis and up 3% on an organic basis. Reported revenue included $38 million of positive currency movement.","We experienced growth on an organic basis across all of our segments for the quarter. Net income was $89 million or up 117% for the second quarter as compared to the prior year second quarter net income of $41 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $427 million or 21.1% of revenue as compared to the prior year adjusted EBITDA of $387 million or 19.8% of revenue, representing a 10% increase on an adjusted EBITDA basis and 130 basis points in margin improvement. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $0.62, and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.88. Overall, it was a solid quarter. We grew revenue, earnings per share and had enhanced adjusted EBITDA margin performance.","First half of 2018, we're very pleased with our financial results. Based on the prior accounting standard without the impact of ASC 606, reported revenue growth for the first half of 2018 was up 7% as compared to the same period in the prior year and up 3% on a constant currency basis and up 4% on an organic basis.","Adjusted EBITDA for the first half of 2018 was $1.3 billion or 27.7% of revenue, an increase from adjusted EBITDA of $1.1 billion or 25.6% of revenue for the same period in the prior year, representing an increase of 210 basis points in adjusted EBITDA margin over the same period in the prior year.","Now turning to the results on ASC 606 or the new accounting standard. Reported revenues for the second quarter were $2 billion. Net income for the second quarter was $65 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $392 million or 19.7% of revenue. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $0.44, and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.70.","Before moving on to the segment results, I'd like to provide an update on our three areas of integration, revenue synergies, cost synergies and tax savings. The original merger objectives included decreasing the tax rate from approximately 34% to 25% by the end of 2017 and also realizing $100 million to $125 million in cost savings as we exit 2018. So to start with the tax savings. We surpassed our tax goal in 2016 and 2017, and we continue to be under our goal with an expected 22% to 23% adjusted tax rate for 2018.","Turning to the cost savings goal. Since the merger, we've saved almost $152 million on a run rate basis and are targeting $175 million of savings on a run rate basis as we exit 2018, which will exceed our original goal of at least $100 million to $125 million run rate savings. Finally, on revenue synergies in the areas of global health solutions, U.S. mid-market exchange and large market P&C. We've already achieved more than 105% of our three year global health solutions synergy sales goals. Our sales pipeline continues to be strong, and we're glad to say we'll be surpassing our revenue goal.","Regarding the mid-market health care marketplace, as we previously mentioned, it's been more difficult to sell versus our original plan, we think due to debates around the Affordable Care Act, which may have delayed our clients' overall decision-making in this area. It's still a bit early to make any conclusion on the mid-market exchange progress this year as the sales season continues into November. But overall, given our cumulative sales through 2017 and the new business pipeline, we believe that we'll be at the lower end of the $100 million to $250 million goal as we exit 2018.","Now turning to the P&C synergies. We had merger to date sales of more than $128 million. We anticipate these revenues being recognized over a three year period in most cases. We're happy with the overall traction in acquiring new clients in the large market, but our average sale size has been less than our original projections. We continue to build our pipeline and add to our talent base. We anticipate we'll end 2018 with about $150 million of revenue synergy sales rather than the $200 million original merger goal. While this would be short of our original goal, it's clear that the U.S. large market space provides a significant long-term growth opportunity for Willis Towers Watson.","And finally, we see revenue synergies develop between the reinsurance and insurance consulting and technology, or ICT teams. It wasn't the revenue synergy we discussed publicly at the time of the merger, but we recognize these 2 groups have relationships and solutions that complemented one another. We've sold more than $25 million of joint reinsurance broking and consulting projects as these groups have been teaming up and utilizing one another's tools and analytics.","Now let's look at each of the segments in more detail. To provide clear comparability with prior periods, all commentary regarding the results of our segments will be based on the prior accounting standard and reflect revenues on a constant currency basis unless specifically stated otherwise. Segment margins are calculated using segment revenues and exclude unallocated corporate costs such as amortization of intangibles, restructuring costs and certain transaction and integration expenses resulting from mergers and acquisitions as well as other items, which we consider noncore to our operating results. The segment results do include discretionary compensation.","For the second quarter, revenues grew 2% on a constant currency basis and 3% on an organic basis. We experienced growth in all of our segments this quarter and most of our regions. For the second quarter of 2018, the international region led with 7% organic growth. North America had organic growth of 4%. Western Europe had organic growth of 3%, and Great Britain organic revenues were flat.","Without the impact of ASC 606, Human Capital & Benefits, or HCB, had a solid quarter with 1% constant currency revenue growth and 3% organic revenue growth as compared to the prior year's second quarter. HCB has now had growth for the last 6 consecutive quarters. For the first half of the year, on an organic basis, HCB revenue growth was 3%. ","Across our HCB segment, we had continued momentum in our retirement business with 3% organic growth compared to the prior year second quarter and growth across all regions. North America growth was 3% with increased consulting services around mortality funding assumptions, data services projects and stronger bulk lump-sum work. Great Britain had 6% revenue growth as a result of increased consulting demand for actuarial and risk solutions. International was flat for the quarter. Western Europe's revenues improved, primarily due to the positive impact of the timing of revenue in Germany's pension brokerage businesses and a growing client portfolio across Belgium, Denmark and Switzerland.","Health and Benefits revenue increased by 4% as compared to the prior year's second quarter, primarily as a result of strong momentum in the global benefit solutions business as well as increased project work and product sales within the brokerage and advisory business in North America.","Our Technology and Administration Solutions, or TAS, revenue increased by 4% as compared to the prior year second quarter due to increased project and call center demand.","Talent and Rewards second quarter revenue declined by 4% as compared to the prior year second quarter, primarily due to an increase in -- excuse me, to a decrease in advisory services in North America and Great Britain and lower product revenues. The decline in the product revenues in the quarter was primarily due to timing, and we expect to recover that later in the year.","The HCB second quarter revenue was $750 million with an operating margin of 16%, down 90 basis points from the prior year second quarter. Margin in the second quarter was adversely impacted by softness in the Talent and Rewards business and by client investments. For the first half of 2018, operating margin was 28%, an increase of 50 basis points from the prior year.","Now turning to the HCB results, including the impact of the new revenue standard. The HCB segment had revenues of $780 million and an operating margin of 19%. Overall, we continue to have a positive outlook for the HCB business in 2018.","Now let's look at the Corporate Risk & Broking, or CRB, which had a revenue increase of 2% on both the constant currency and organic basis as compared to the prior year second quarter. CRB has now had 6 consecutive quarters of revenue growth. For the first half of the year, CRB grew 4% organically.","North America's revenue grew by 3% in the second quarter with strong construction M&A and cyber activity. And post the 2016 and 2017 restructuring, we've had 4 strong consecutive quarters of growth in North America. For the first half of the year, North America's revenue has grown by 5%.","International continued its strong momentum with 6% constant currency growth and 8% organic growth in the quarter, driven primarily by CEEMEA, Asia and Latin America, which had a number of new business wins. Western Europe also had solid growth, primarily led by positive results in France with Affinity program wins and strong new business in risk management and specialties. Likewise, there was growth in Sweden and Iberia.","Great Britain had a revenue decline of 3%, driven by weakness in transportation due to less aviation and marine contingent revenue. Partially offsetting this decline was an increase in our financial lines business, which had good new business generation. CRB revenues were $669 million with an operating margin of 13% as compared to a 16% operating margin in the prior year second quarter. The second quarter was generally a seasonally weaker quarter from a margin standpoint due to the low level of renewals for some lines of business. Revenue pressure from Great Britain adversely impacted the margin as did continued investments in technology, cyber and infrastructure.","Finally, foreign exchange translation had a 70 basis point unfavorable impact on the segment's margin compared to the prior year second quarter. For the first half of 2018, operating margin was 16%, a decrease of 60 basis points from the prior year.","Now turning to the CRB results, including the impact of the new revenue standard. For the quarter, CRB had revenues of $674 million and an operating margin of 14%. We continue to be optimistic about the momentum in our CRB business going forward as we expect revenues to continue to build in the second half of the year.","Turning to Investment, Risk & Reinsurance, or IRR. Revenue for the second quarter decreased 1% on a constant currency basis and increased 1% on an organic basis as compared to the prior year second quarter. For the first half of the year, IRR grew 1% on a constant currency basis and 4% organically. As a reminder, the reinsurance line of business represents treaty-based reinsurance with some facultative business produced in wholesale. Bulk of Facultative Reinsurance results are captured in the CRB segment.","Reinsurance revenue led the segment with 5% revenue growth, driven by international and specialty as a result of solid renewals and favorable timing. Max Matthiessen grew 3% as a result of an increase in assets under management and new business.","Insurance Consulting and Technology grew by 3% as a result of increased consulting projects and software sales. Investment grew 4% as a result of new client implementations, alongside higher performance fees. Wholesale declined by 11%, mainly driven by the timing of revenue that was accelerated into the first quarter of 2018 and less demand in the specialty and program businesses. Underwriting and Capital Management, or UCM, experienced a decline of 6% in constant currency revenue. That's just a result of the divestiture of the U.S programs business in 2017 and the Loan Protector businesses in the first quarter of 2018. UCM organic growth was 3%.","The IRR segment had revenues of $379 million compared to $374 million for the prior year second quarter and a 23% operating margin, down 110 basis points from the prior year second quarter. The second quarter 2018 margin was impacted by planned investments in new technology and analytics such as our Innovisk investment; as well as by our foreign exchange translation, which had a 50 basis point unfavorable impact on the segment's margin compared to the prior year second quarter. For the first half of 2018, the operating margin was 36%, an increase of 60 basis points from the prior year.","Now turning to the IRR results, including the impact of the new revenue standard. IRR had revenues of $385 million and an operating margin of 23%. Overall, we continue to feel positive about the momentum of the IRR business for 2018. Revenues for the BDA segment increased by 9% from the prior year second quarter. BDA has now had 10 consecutive quarters of revenue growth. For the first half of the year, BDA revenues grew by 9%. Driven by increased enrollments, Individual Marketplace revenue increased by 3%. Group Marketplace and Benefits Outsourcing revenues grew 17% as a result of new client wins and special projects. The BDA segment had revenues of $195 million with a 25% operating margin, up 560 basis points as compared to the prior year second quarter. The expansion in margin was a result of the very strong revenue growth as well as our ability to continue to scale these businesses. For the first half of 2018, operating margin was 23%, an increase of 300 basis points from the prior year.","The BDA segment, reflecting the new revenue standard, had revenue of $119 million and an operating margin of negative 26%. The primary driver of the difference is due to the effect of the new revenue accounting standard on the Individual Marketplace. These revenues must now be recognized at the date of placement rather than prorating them starting at their effective date. This means that the revenue typically generated by placements in the 2017 fall enrollment period was recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of January 1, 2018. This revenue under the prior standard would have started to be recognized in January 2018 on a prorata basis throughout the year. However, the overall revenue profile should not change materially in 2018 as under the new standard, the revenues generated by the policies placed during the fall of 2018 enrollment season will now be recognized immediately. So this will change the seasonality of the revenue recognition to be higher in the second half of the calendar year.","Regarding enrollment. The 2019 sales pipeline continues to look strong in both the mid-market and large market space. We currently have over 20 clients with about 270,000 total lives that have committed for the 2019 enrollment period. The mid-market sales season will not be finalized until early November. The Individual Marketplace exchange enrollment process has been changing somewhat over the recent years. We're seeing enrollment spread more evenly throughout the year due to off-cycle enrollments and agents and a more modest increase in enrollments during the fall enrollment season. We're also currently seeing a number of larger companies that are contemplating off-cycle enrollments in 2019.","Our Benefits Delivery & Administration offerings remain fundamental to our business and growth engines of our enterprise strategy. We're optimistic about the long-term growth of this business.","So before concluding my remarks, I'd like to provide you with an update regarding the review conducted by the U.K. Competition and Markets Authorities of the investment consulting market. 2 weeks ago, the CMA published its provisional decision report, which did not recommend any structural changes to businesses. The report describes the market as not highly concentrated and states there is no evidence of conflicts of interest that give rise to a competition problem. The CMA did recommend certain industry-wide remedies involving mandatory tendering, enhanced fee disclosure and common standards for reporting performance. We welcome the recommendations set out in the CMA report.","We've advocated for stronger regulatory oversight of the investment consulting and fiduciary management market for a number of years, and we look forward to working with the regulatory authorities and the wider industry to ensure that best practice becomes normal practice. We also look forward to continuing to work with the CMA, which will issue its final report by March 2019 at the latest.","So to wrap up my comments, I'm very pleased with the first half 2018 results and the overall performance of our underlying business. The results for the first half of 2018 were in line with our expectations, and we believe that we remain well positioned to continue our success in the second half of 2018 and beyond. Likewise, I'm excited to see the progress we've made in building Willis Towers Watson. And I'm proud of the more than 43,000 Willis Towers Watson colleagues around the world, who are focused on their clients' success. I'd like to thank our colleagues for their hard work and for their enthusiasm and support and efforts.","And now I'll turn the call over to Mike.","Michael Burwell","Thanks, John, and good morning to everyone. Thanks to all of you for joining us. Now let's turn to the financial overview. Let me first discuss income from operations. Without the adoption of ASC 606, income from operations for the second quarter was $93 million or 4.6% of revenue, up 52% from the prior year second quarter of $61 million or 3.1% of revenue. Adjusted operating income for the second quarter was $288 million or 14.2% of revenue, and the prior year quarter adjusted operating income was $300 million or 15.4% of revenue. As we highlighted earlier, investments in certain businesses impacted the second quarter margin, as did foreign exchange translation, which had a 30 basis point unfavorable impact.","Without the adoption of ASC 606, income from operations for the first half of 2018 was $631 million or 13.8% of revenue, up 37% from the same period in the prior year of $462 million or 10.8% of revenue. Adjusted operating income for the first half of 2018 was $1 billion or 22.1% of revenue compared to the same period in the prior year in which adjusted operating income was $919 million or 21.5% of revenue. Now let me turn to adjusted diluted earnings per share or adjusted EPS, excluding the new revenue standard.","For the second quarter of 2018, our adjusted EPS was up 30% to $1.88 per share versus $1.45 per share in the prior year second quarter. For the first half of 2018, adjusted EPS was up 21% to $6.29 per share versus $5.18 per share in the same period in the prior year. Our adjusted EPS was $1.70 per share under the new revenue recognition standard for the quarter and $4.41 for the first half of 2018.","Moving to taxes. I'd like to provide you with some additional insight into our U.S. GAAP and adjusted tax rates. Without the impact of ASC 606, the U.S. GAAP tax rate for the second quarter was 14%, a decrease from 17% from the prior year second quarter. Our adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was 20%, a decrease from 29% for the prior year second quarter.","As we mentioned earlier this year, beginning in 2018, the adjusted and U.S. GAAP tax rates will be more closely aligned due to the U.S. corporate tax rate reduction from 35% to 21%. We're expecting further guidance from the U.S. treasury and others on the interpretation or application of their rules before the end of 2018. This may result in adjustments to our estimates as we move through the year, and we continue to monitor this very closely.","Moving to the balance sheet. We continue to have a strong financial position. During the quarter, including the impact of the new revenue standard, we generated $301 million of free cash flow, bringing our year-to-date free cash flow to $254 million, increased from free cash flow of $200 million for the first half of the prior year. There's nonmaterial difference in free cash flow between the prior and new accounting standards. Operating income growth was a primary driver of cash flow improvement. We expect to continue to see free cash flow build as we complete 2018.","During the second quarter, we purchased approximately $269 million in shares. We continue to expect buyback of a total of $600 million to $800 million of shares in 2018, subject to market conditions. [Indiscernible] we repurchased or retired 10.2 million shares and paid $627 million in dividends. We reported quarterly and year-to-date 2018 financial results in this morning's release based on both the ASC 606 standard and the old accounting standard, ASC 605. However, we want to ensure that investors have a clear line of sight to our progress as we move into the second half of last year and of our three year integration period. As such, we'll continue to provide guidance based on the 2017 U.S. GAAP standard.","Now let's review our full year 2018 guidance for Willis Towers Watson. For the company, we continue to expect organic revenue growth to be approximately 4%. For the segments, we expect revenue growth to be in the low single digits for HCB, CRB and IRR and are raising our BDA revenue guidance to mid- to high single-digit growth. We continue to expect adjusted EBITDA to be around 25% for the full year. And as a reminder, the first quarter margin was seasonally high, and we expect seasonally lower margins as the year progresses.","Transaction integration costs are expected to be in the range of $140 million to $150 million versus our previous guidance of approximately $140 million. The expected increase relates primarily to property consolidation costs as we look to streamline our integrated real estate portfolio. We are reducing the adjusted tax rate by 1% from the range of 23% to 24% -- or from 23% to 24% to a range of 22% to 23%. This tax guidance is consistent for both the old and new accounting standards.","We continue to expect free cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion in 2018. There is a nonmaterial difference in free cash flow between the prior and new accounting standards. The difference is a result of moving a portion of capitalized software related to client system implementations from investing activities to operating activities in the cash flow statement. This accounting change does not impact our overall guidance nor our capital allocation strategy. We continue to use the former ASC 605 accounting standard for this year to assess bonus calculations, capital for dividends, share buybacks, internal investments and M&A. Annual guidance assumes average currency rates of $1.35 to the pound and $1.19 to the euro.","I'd like to conclude in saying that I'm pleased where we are at the midyear mark. We've been able to make good progress in our margin expansion efforts with adjusted EBITDA margin improvement year-to-date at 210 basis points. Similarly, we've been also -- made great strides in developing our foundation for long-term growth. We continue to make investments in innovation, integrated solutions tailored to our clients' needs and underpinned by cutting-edge data and analytics to unlock potential for our clients. Examples include our cyber risk management solutions, which help clients assess cyber vulnerabilities, protect them through best-in-class solutions and improve their ability to successfully recover from future attacks.","Our Asset Management Exchange, or AMX, is an innovative institutional asset management marketplace that fundamentally transforms institutional investment for the benefit of the end saver. We recognize that the trend and the power of the global marketplaces, AMX was the first exchange of its kind in bringing the digital revolution to institutional asset management and will be a catalyst for change in the institutional investment. And blockchain. We recently announced the first blockchain transaction for marine insurance along with our partners, EY, M\u00f8ller-Maersk, XL Catlin, MS Amlin, ACORD and Microsoft. This is the first time that blockchain technology is being used in insurance transactions for marine insurance, and this technology is expected to be rolled out in other sectors in due course.","Finally, our Innovisk investment, which is designed to augment underwriting by developing technology that utilizes data and analytics in a more sophisticated manner, should support our underwriting product innovation development and pricing as well as improve distribution efficiencies. Investment in these innovations -- innovative solutions for our clients certainly speaks to our continued thought leadership in the market and our focus on growth. Some of these activities and investments may dampen our results from time to time but are necessary to keep our business dynamic. I feel very confident in the soundness of our underlying business, and I'm encouraged with our progress towards our long-term goals.","I'll turn it back to John.","John Haley","Thanks, Mike. And now we'll take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Greg Peters with Raymond James.","Charles Peters","My first question will be around organic revenue. And if you look at your result in the second quarter and compare it with some of your other publicly traded peers, it looks to be at the lower end of the range. And I recognize, in the first quarter, it was probably at the higher end of the range. But I just have a question for you around momentum. Do you think momentum on the -- in the sales pipeline may be stalling? Or maybe you can add some perspective around that.","John Haley","Yes. Thanks, Greg. And I think you're absolutely right the way you've characterized the quarters over time. And one of the reasons that we spent some time talking about the first half today is we don't think the momentum is slowing in the second quarter, but we do think we have to look at the whole first half together. I think, last year, we, I think, did a good job of alerting analysts generally to the fact that we saw the first half as being -- the first quarter as being stronger than the second quarter and maybe absorbing some of the revenue. We didn't necessarily see that this year, but we think that that's certainly what happened. There was a -- there's a component to that. But when we look at it, we think that the first -- the revenue growth for the first half is a better indicator of what the second half will look like rather than the revenue growth for the second quarter.","Charles Peters","If I recall correctly, you had strong organic in the back half of last year. Is that -- is it just the nature of your business model where organic growth accelerates in the back half of the year versus the first half?","John Haley","I think that's right. And some of these businesses are a little more subject to just timing differences than others. So retirement doesn't really see much of a timing issue at all, and that sort of marches steadily along. But if I look at Talent and Rewards or if I look at the broking business or the reinsurance business, they're subjected timing changes for income [indiscernible].","Charles Peters","Okay, great. Now my second question was around just the segment operating results and guidance. And I guess we're looking at the segment operating income excluding revenue -- the revenue standard for the second quarter '18. And then that corresponds, I suppose, with your full year guidance on an adjusted EPS basis. But for the second quarter, I have to say that the risk -- the results in Corporate Risk & Broking, Investment, Risk & Reinsurance were down year-over-year, excluding the revenue standard. And I suppose -- I don't want to get too hung up on 1 quarter's results, but that was a surprise to some. And then -- but yet you're still holding out the expectation that the overall result is going to get you to your EPS number. So I was hoping maybe you could provide some different -- some additional color behind that to help us understand what's going on.","John Haley","Sure. I know Mike will want to weigh in with some color commentary on this. But let me just say that I think that those 2 segments are actually different, in our minds. IRR, even though the results may look like they're not as robust as we might like, they're actually right on target for what we had projected. And so we have had -- we disposed of some businesses there. We have bumped up -- our biggest investments that we're making in our business are really 2. One is in the Innovisk and the other is in AMX. And both of those are in IRR. So the margins that we have there are exactly on our forecast that we had here internally. But the CRB is different. That was -- that is truly where we had expected to be. And I think it's largely a revenue thing in the second quarter, but it's partly expenses being a little bit higher. Mike, do you want to give a little more color on that?","Michael Burwell","Yes, John. I mean, when we look and think about the CRB point drive that you raised, we look at it and say, we have been making some further investments in resources around cyber, M&A resources that we have deployed into the CRB segment. FX impacted by 70 basis points just in terms of margin for the quarter. And we also -- as we mentioned in the press release, contingent revenue was down a bit for us, specifically in the U.K. that we had seen. So again, we focus on the annual margins overall. As you say, 1 quarter doesn't make a year either one way or another, and so we are focused in terms of where they are. But as John said, it's a little bit below where we'd like it to be, but we're optimistic about what the recovery will be over the second half of the year.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","A lot of the commentary on the margins, 3 of the 4 segments comes down to investments. And I wanted to ask a couple of things around that. First, are -- what are some of the returns you're expecting? And should we see these enhancing the revenue growth in subsequent years? And also, whether some of these investments were stepped up in the course of [indiscernible] or accelerated during the course of the year?","John Haley","Yes. So thanks, Shlomo. The investments are pretty much tracking the way we thought they would be. So there's no step-up in there. I think the -- we see these adding to our margins, I would say, beginning in 2020.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","So it's going to be a margin improvement or also a revenue growth improvement?","John Haley","Both. It should be both. I'm sorry, I thought your question was related to margins. But yes, it should be both.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay. So that's something that -- it's tracking, but it's something will impact in a couple of years. And then just a little bit of a different question. In terms of the demand for the advisory work in Talent and Rewards, I think you mentioned something about timing over there. That was kind of surprising to me because usually, that's -- when unemployment is doing -- it's really low, that's usually the strongest time for the Talent and Rewards business. Can you comment a little bit about what's going on over there in the context of the strength we should be seeing?","John Haley","Yes. So the part that we were talking about with timing was related to some of the products in T&R. And so that revenue gets recognized when we deliver the products. And sometimes, things that we might expect would be -- get delivered in June get delivered in July instead, so they move over. So that's the timing issue. I think, generally, we would expect T&R to be up when unemployment is low and when there's more competition for folks. I think some of the uncertainty in various parts of the world, though, may have limited people's appetite for some of those projects. But T&R is clearly an area where it was lower than we had expected. In fact, we had a revenue decline in Talent and Rewards, and that's something we need to address going forward.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Is there something that you see line of sight to in improvement over there? Or in other words, is it kind of look like a pause? Or is there something that you think you need to be rightsized? Or any other color you might have on that strategically?","John Haley","Well, I would say that it's not necessarily we see that there needs to be a rightsizing. And I think -- again, we think the better estimate for what the second half will look like is the first half as a whole as opposed to the second quarter results. But I do think in Talent and Rewards, our expenses will probably -- we had a good end to last year and then a good first quarter there. And I think we were building up our expenses on the assumption that, that would continue and we need to be -- we need to do a better job of expense management there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Hughes with SunTrust.","Mark Hughes","You described the bulk lump-sum business as being a little bit stronger. Is there a discernible pipeline there? Can you talk about how you think that will go on in the second half?","John Haley","No, it was -- overall, retirement had about a 3% growth, and bulk lump-sums was one of several contributing factors. But it wasn't an enormous difference.","Mark Hughes","And then you may have touched on this on an earlier answer, but you talked about the -- in the CRB business, momentum building up in the second half. What gives you visibility for that?","Michael Burwell","Yes. I mean, we obviously look at the pipeline of growth. We look historically in terms of what that growth has been. If you look overall, third quarter generally is lowest and first quarter being the strongest and fourth quarter being the second strongest. When we look at starting the year every year, we have 93% retention rate in our clients. So we have a pretty good visibility in terms of what those clients are doing and what we've seen over the first half of the year and what the expectations are over the second half of the year. So in addition to our pipeline management as well as our historical view, that's what's giving us that perspective. And equally, as we look at the marketplace, continues to be very strong as evidenced by, as you say, our -- looking at our competitors and the strength in the marketplace.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with R.W. Baird.","Mark Marcon","Appreciate all the color both in the 605 and 606 standards as well as the discussion of the first half relative to just focusing on individual quarters. I'm just wondering, with regards to some of the segments, like for example, in HCB, we talked about Talent and Rewards being the one weak area. On CRB, it sounded like, geographically, Britain was the area where it was weak, particularly in the transportation business. Wondering if you can talk a little bit about the outlook there and what you would anticipate in terms of it potentially improving. And then I've got a follow-up with regards to IRR and BDA.","Michael Burwell","Sure. As it relates to GB, we did see weakness there, particularly around contingent revenue that we look to have. When you look and think about some of the market assessments and views that were going on, it's created and dampened a bit of the marketplace in terms of that outlook, not only today but looking into the future. So -- and equally, you got Brexit still going on there and has not been completed. And so that's paused people a bit just in terms of how we're going to operate into the future, though we're very confident in terms of how we're going to operate. Nonetheless, we've seen that dampening overall in terms of GB and, indeed, saw GB down for the second quarter. Although international was very strong for us outside of GB, and we've seen international grow at 8% and North America grown at 3%. And so we feel pretty good when we look at the overall view of it. So as I said before, we have a pretty good sense of renewals and our client base in terms of our 93% retention of our clients. And so we feel -- that's what gives us that optimism in terms of looking out over the rest of the year as well as the strong market conditions. So Mark, I mean, that's -- I guess that's what I would respond to your question, make sure I hit your -- responded appropriately to what you were looking for.","Mark Marcon","Is there an opportunity to manage expenses to a greater extent in GB as we think about the full year?","Michael Burwell","Looking at expenses, it's a tale of two challenges. One, anytime you're obviously managing people, it's -- when -- you have to go through a process in terms of to the extent you were to rightsize talent. We don't believe that's the great answer for us overall in terms of thinking about that right now, but nonetheless, you need -- there's a bit of a notice period, it just doesn't happen immediately, particularly in GB. But equally, there's a lot of, discretionary expenses that we can turn off immediately if, indeed, we need to do that. And our track record, collectively between John and myself as well as our local leadership, has been able to -- be able to be very agile and be able to make those types of decisions if, indeed, we need to. And -- but nonetheless -- so that's kind of, as we look at the expense situation in terms of managing it, how we think about both of those avenues.","Mark Marcon","Great. And then just with regards to IRR and BDA. On IRR, can you just remind us of the size of divested units? And then on BDA, there was improvement. It sounds like things are being targeted for stronger growth. What was the specific area that's growing at a faster rate on the BDA side?","Michael Burwell","Sure. Why don't I start with the second question first. On BDA, I mean, we continue to see strong demand for individuals. And in particular, when we think about our outsourcing activities that we're doing overall in North America has been very strong demand. So when you think about our overall health and wealth kind of positions have been places that we feel we're doing very well and outperforming the marketplace, and obviously, BDA being one of those. As we reflect on it, I mean, we believe we have a very strong market position. We've got a very strong platform that we continue to invest in, and we've got a very strong management team in terms of leading that business in terms of how it is they're driving it and winning in the marketplace. So we're very optimistic about it. And the other piece is, again, we are one of the only noncustodial banks that are out there that can play in this particular space in BDA. And we continue to make sure we've got the quality right around our via benefits solution and what that means for us. And we're dogfooding that on ourselves as it relates to Willis Towers Watson. And we continue to work really hard to make sure that quality is right as we continue to think about how it is that we bring that to the marketplace. So we're very excited about the BDA business, what it's been doing, how it's been performing and all those things lining up. As it relates to the revenue base, I'll give you the exact number, but my recollection is roughly around $15 million to $20 million in terms of the divested businesses in the current year, the impact.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley.","Kai Pan","My first question, on the -- so you said there's a timing issue, so it's wholesale. IRR was down 11% for the second quarter. I just wonder if you can provide the first half organic growth in wholesale. And also, there are some press release about some of the brokers that are leaving there. I just wonder, would that have an impact going forward in that particular business?","Michael Burwell","Yes. No, Kai, I mean, I would tell you, I think we're very -- still very bullish and excited about the Miller business. What we had seen was one of timing. I'm not aware of any -- or John are aware of any resources that create us any real concerns. I mean, obviously, in any business, you have people that come in and go out, and obviously, you don't want to lose any key individuals. But we've got a really strong leadership team that's leading our Miller business overall. We're very supportive of them. And the conversations that we've had with them have been about really continue to grow that business and are very excited about the prospects for it. The timing issue, we'll get you the exact number. I'll follow back up with you, Kai, just to get you that exact wholesale number overall.","Kai Pan","Okay. Great. And then my second question, you're stepping back on your full year guidance. Looks like everything else remained...","John Haley","Hello, Kai? We're not getting anything.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Klauber with William Blair.","Adam Klauber","The last few years, you've spent a lot of time in integration, and we haven't seen a lot of deals, which makes sense. As we look at 2019, '20 -- 2019, 2020, should we expect deals to pick up?","John Haley","Yes. I think that -- and we said really from the beginning that the first, certainly, 2.5 years or so, we didn't expect we would be doing any sizable deals at all unless they were really quite unusual, just really rare and unique opportunities. But I think we feel pretty good about where we are in integration, and we feel that 2019, we'll certainly be in a position to consider deals.","Adam Klauber","Okay. Okay, that's helpful. And also, you've restated your free cash outlook, I think 1 point -- or cash flow, $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. As we think about that next year, should it be more on -- with the growth of operating earnings? What are the factors should be impacting free cash as we think about 2019?","Michael Burwell","Yes. I mean, directionally, that seems to make sense, Adam, but honestly, I think we'll come back to you and give you more direct guidance as we go through the rest of the year. As we come into the fourth quarter, we'll give you a forecast as it relates to what we believe that will be for next year. So at this stage, I think it'd be -- I think directional guidance what you're saying makes sense to us, but I wouldn't give any more guidance than that.","Adam Klauber","Okay. Okay. And just one quick other question. CRB in the U.S., if I remember, it seemed like retention had been improving in the last couple of quarters. Are you still seeing improving retention this quarter?","John Haley","We don't actually -- we will get -- we will have information on that right yet. But I don't think there's anything that would cause us to think it's off some.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW.","Meyer Shields","I just wanted to follow up a little bit on the, I guess, improving capabilities for dealmaking going forward. Are there geographic regions or services that are of particular interest?","John Haley","I think as we would -- as we look up, there's some of the -- we're in about, what, 120-plus countries around the world. And so we're pretty much in most geographies. Some of them we may like to be a little bit bigger in them, so we might be looking at some particular geographies here or there. But there'd be -- there aren't any that we would be newly entering as to where we go. When we look at the segments that we have, we're in a pretty strong position in most of the businesses we're already in, which makes us think that we're more likely to be looking for some close adjacencies rather than businesses that we're already in. That would be slightly more likely that we'd see acquisitions like that.","Meyer Shields","Okay. Can I incur for that, that you're not looking for, I don't know, we call it transformational, but it's probably too difficult, but anything major?","John Haley","No. I think that's fair enough. I think transformational acquisitions come up relatively well, I'd say. It's not clear you can -- I mean, we're certainly open to those things if they present themselves, but they're not something we would be banking on.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.","Elyse Greenspan","My first question is on your earnings guidance. I'm hoping you could help me tie together a couple of things. So you guys blocked your guidance for EPS unchanged. It sounds like maybe revenue a little bit short in the second quarter, but your full year outlook is unchanged for revenue and for margins, yet your tax rate is going down, so that benefits you better than you thought. And currency was $0.24 positive in the first quarter, and now it seems like it's -- you're not going to see much of an impact on earnings, offset that for the rest of the year. So currency is about $0.20 better than the $0.04 in the initial guidance. So what's the offset, I guess, to the better currency and the lower tax rate that you're leaving your guidance for the year as opposed to raising the guidance?","Michael Burwell","Yes. No, it's a good question, Elyse. I mean, ultimately, what we're looking at is a range, right? And so we think about that as we give it at $9.88 to $10.12 as a range. Obviously, based on that, we think we'll still be in that range. You could think about us in the middle or the higher or the lower end, between it, but we feel comfortable we're in that range. And I think you summarized it appropriately. And we think we're still within that range in terms of how we add everything that's included in there.","Elyse Greenspan","Where do you think the tax rate -- I know you guys lowered the guidance for this year. Where do you think the tax rate ends up in 2019? Does it go up? Like are you sticking with your original kind of higher end of 20s range? Or would it kind of be in line with where you see 2018 coming in?","Michael Burwell","Yes. So we'll look to give you guidance on that in the end of the year. Directionally, I mean, just -- there are certain things that we continue to work through that we need interpretations from treasury to help us understand certain implications in terms of our planning. Clearly, we continue to get more and more information. We continue to do more analysis every quarter. And obviously, that's what's reflected in our ranging it at 22% to 23% and bringing that down from 1%. When we look at potential implications, we could see it potentially going higher, but I wouldn't -- I'm not giving you that guidance at this stage. I would do that as we comment in the end of the year. So it's something that -- honestly, I wish I could just give you more view that these are the rules. The rules continue to get interpreted. We continue to use our folks as well as advisers in working through that. And at this stage, I think there's pressure on it, but I wouldn't get you specific guidance to, Elyse. And I'm trying to give you as much as I can based on what we know right now.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. And then the pension charge, if you guys backed that of adjusted earnings, where did that run through the P&L on a reported basis? Did that go through the segments?","Michael Burwell","Yes, it's in other income net and is adjusted out.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. So it's in other income net. And then one last question. New business, how did that trend in the quarter? I guess, within CRB, was that maybe part of what led to the slowdown in organic growth? Did you see anything in the new business front? Or would you attribute more of the slowdown kind of a way for some of the timing that you pointed out to a drop in retention? Or was it new business? Or was it maybe a combination of both?","Michael Burwell","Yes, Elyse, I mean, I guess I would view it -- again, as John said, I think a little bit more timing than we originally had thought. I mean, that actually happened in the first quarter versus the second quarter. I think retention rates, we don't see a real decline in retention rates overall. New business, yes, to your point, we had seen a little bit less new business that actually came our way in terms of those amounts because, obviously, that's what resulted in those lower revenue numbers versus the marketplace. So yes, I think it's all three of those.","Operator","You next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research.","Ryan Tunis","So I guess my question is really just around visibility in the margin expansion and I guess where your confidence comes from into the back half of the year. Because I guess, looking at this quarter, ignoring, I guess, the lower hedge expense, there wasn't really a lot of margin expansion on 3% organic growth. So kind of thinking into the back half of the year, why should we expect there would be any?","Michael Burwell","Yes. So thank you for the question, Ryan. I think as John mentioned, our T&R business was a contributor to it. We are working very directly in terms of driving revenue growth as well as expense management in terms of thinking about that business and the impacts that, that would have directionally on margin. We are -- as we mentioned in terms of investments, are consistent with what our plans are. But I think we know where the levers are in terms of being able to manage our expenses appropriately, and we will look to do that. And we kept line of sight as to what that will mean in terms of the second half of the year. So that's what's giving us and me the confidence about us and our operating committee and the way that we can deliver those results.","John Haley","Yes. And I guess, Mike, I would just also add like, we did have 130 basis points improvement. I don't consider that nothing.","Ryan Tunis","Okay. And obviously, not a lot of discussion around 2019. I get that, but just -- I guess, John, are you more of the view coming out of this integration, does earnings growth come more, you think, as a function of organic revenue on the top line side? Or do you think it's kind of more of an efficiency story when we're thinking about margin expansion going forward longer term?","John Haley","Yes. I actually think it's a combination, Ryan. I think -- we expect, as I said earlier, to be growing as fast as the market or faster. That's our expectation of what we'll do. And although we didn't do that in the second quarter, we did it for the whole first half of the year. And so when I look to 2019 and beyond, we still expect to be doing that. And so we expect to be seeing that hope on margins. But at the same time, we think that -- we think that there's a lot of things we can do to improve the overall efficiency. And so we expect to see some margin improvement from that, too.","Ryan Tunis","And then just quickly on housekeeping. The pension item stripped out, it was unclear to me. Is that expected to recur in the coming quarters or annually?","Michael Burwell","It's a good question. We're hopeful that it doesn't recur in terms of thinking about it. Obviously, depending on the marketplace, where interest rates are has an impact on it in terms of people leaving the plan and being encouraged to do that and their financial advisers advising them to do it. So we saw -- last year, we've seen it through the first half of this year, but we continue to watch it and monitor very, very closely. And we're hopeful that it's not a recurring event. But I -- right now, I can't tell you that it's not going to continue to be the case based on what we continue to see happen overall.","Operator","This concludes the Q&A portion.

Today we'll review the fourth quarter and the full year 2017 results, as well as provide outlook for 2018. Closing out the fourth quarter of 2017 signified the end of the second year of our three year integration plan. 2017 was an eventful year. We completed a number of organizational changes and corporate initiatives during the year and we made great headway in advancing our innovation efforts.","From an organizational perspective, our key priority was finalizing the restructuring of the Corporate Risk and Broking business with a specific objective of achieving revenue growth in North America by the third quarter of 2017. This was accomplished as planned. The operational improvement program concluded as of December 31 with $95 million of gross savings and we achieved our multiyear goal of $325 million of annual gross savings.","As a result of an extensive review of our portfolio of operations, we divested approximately 10 businesses including a portfolio of programs and executed a couple small bolt-on acquisitions. Last, we added some key talent such as Mike Burwell who came on board as our new Chief Financial Officer in October. Mike has certainly hit the ground running and I couldn't be more pleased with the transition.","From an innovation perspective, we introduced our first CEO Circle Award, a program meant to encourage innovation among our colleagues and to provide a path to bring the best ideas to market. We introduced a number of new solutions and analytics during the year and I'd like to highlight just two of the new client solutions we are very excited about; the Asset Management Exchange or AMX and our proprietary benefits accounts platform.","AMX is a new market place designed to transform institutional investment for the benefit of the end saver. It aims to create a smarter, easier and cheaper way to connect asset owners to those who manage their money. We are very pleased with the reception we received from the UK and Ireland markets in a relatively short time frame. As of the end of December 2017, AMX had over $3 billion in assets under management and we are planning on expanding into several other markets during 2018.","The second initiative is our benefit accounts or accounts business, which is the administration tool for account such as health savings and health retirement accounts. We received our non-bank custodial status last year and enhanced our accounts proprietary platform to integrate with our marketplace and health and welfare administration systems for a seamless transition for our clients.","Ultimately, we anticipate that Willis Towers Watson's account platform will eliminate the need for us to use third party providers in the future. We limited the release to a small number of clients this past enrollment season. We are very pleased with the preliminary results thus far and we plan to continue to expand the program in 2018.","So, moving on to our merger synergy objectives. The original merger objectives included decreasing the tax rate from approximately 34% to 25% by the end of 2017, and realizing $100 million to $125 million in cost savings as we exited 2018. We surpassed our tax goal in the first year of the merger with the 21% adjusted tax rate and we continue to be under our goal with a 22% adjusted tax rate for 2017.","Turning to the cost savings goal, on a merger to-date basis, we've saved almost $130 million and we are raising our savings goal to $175 million as a run rate as we exit 2018. Mike will talk about these efforts a bit later in the call.","Our merger objectives also identified three specific areas of revenue synergies; global health solutions, the U.S. mid-market exchange, and large market P&C. We've already achieved more than 70% of our three year global health solutions synergy sales goals. Our sales pipeline continues to be strong and we expect to achieve our revenue goal in 2018.","As we mentioned on our last call, the mid-market healthcare marketplace sales were muted in 2017 as compared to 2016. We added several large former Willis' clients last year and we believe that the ACA debate may have delayed decision making for the fall 2017 enrollment period. We continue to believe there are significant potential for the mid-market exchange business and we are focused on its growth.","Through the end of 2017, we had approximately $50 million in synergy sales. Given our cumulative sales through 2017 and a new business pipeline, we believe that we'll be at the lower end of the $100 million to $250 million goals as we exit 2018.","Turning to the P&C synergies, we had about 70 new client wins in the large marketplace with merger to-date sales of more than $100 million. We anticipate those revenues being recognized over a three year period in most cases. We are happy with the overall traction in acquiring new clients in the large marketplace, but our average sale size has been less than our original estimates.","We continue to build our pipeline and add to our talent base. We anticipate we'll end 2018 with about $150 million of revenue synergies sales rather than the $200 million original merger goal. While this would be a bit short of our original goal, it's clear that the U.S. large market space provides a significant long-term growth opportunity for Willis Towers Watson.","Finally, we've seen revenue synergies develop between Reinsurance and Insurance Consulting and Technology or ICT teams. Now this wasn't a revenue synergy we discussed publicly at the time of the merger, but we recognize that these two groups had relationships and solutions that complemented one another. We've sold more than $25 million of reinsurance broking and consulting work as these groups have been teaming up and utilizing one another's tools and analytics.","So, now let's turn to our results. Reported revenues for the fourth quarter were $2.1 billion, up 8% as compared to the prior year fourth quarter and up 5% on a constant currency and up 6% percent on an organic basis. Reported revenues included $54 million of positive currency movement. We observe growth in all our segments and regions for the quarter.","Reported revenues for the year were $8.2 billion, up 4% as compared to the prior year and up 4% on a constant currency basis, and up 5% on an organic basis. Reported revenues included $27 million of negative currency movement. Adjusted revenues for the year were up 3% as compared to the prior year and up 4% on both the constant currency and organic basis.","Net income for the fourth quarter was $253 million as compared to the prior year fourth quarter net income of $148 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $484 million or 23.3% of total revenues as compared to the prior year fourth adjusted EBITDA of $419 million or 21.7% of total revenues. This was an increase of 160 basis points in adjusted EBITDA margin.","For the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $1.84 and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.21. Currency fluctuations net of hedging had a $0.04 positive impact from the fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS.","Net income for the year was $592 million as compared to the prior year net income of $438 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the year was $1.9 billion or 23.2% of total revenues as compared to the prior year adjusted EBITDA of $1.77 billion or 22.3% of adjusted revenues. This was an increase of 90 basis points in adjusted EBITDA margin.","For calendar 2017, diluted earnings per share were $4.18 and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $8.51. Currency fluctuations net of hedging had a negative impact of $0.12 on the 2017 adjusted diluted EPS.","Now let's look at each of the segments in some more detail. As a reminder, beginning in 2017, we made certain changes that affected our segment results. These changes were detailed in the Form 8-K that we filed with the SEC on April 7, 2017. All of the revenue results discussed in the segment detail and guidance reflect commissions and fees or C&F on a constant currency basis, unless specifically stated otherwise.","Our segment margins are calculated using total segment revenues and are before consideration of unallocated corporate costs such as amortization of intangibles, restructuring costs and certain transaction and integration expenses resulting from mergers and acquisitions, as well as the other items which we consider non-core to our operating results. The segment results include discretionary compensation.","For the fourth quarter, total segment commissions and fees grew 5% on a constant currency basis and 6% on an organic basis. Human Capital & Benefits or HCB commissions and fees fourth quarter growth was 2% and organic growth was 4% as compared to the prior year fourth quarter. Our Technology and Administration Solutions or TAS commissions and fees increased by 15%. All regions had strong commissions and fees growth due to new client implementations. In addition to implementing new clients, we've been providing additional support for existing clients in Great Britain with respect of legislative changes that we've discussed in previous calls.","Health and Benefits commissions and fees declined in the fourth quarter by 4%, primarily as a result of the sale of our Global Wealth Solutions business in the international region. Organic H&B growth was 4%. North America's large market continued to see strong growth in both project work and product sales, which was offset slightly by a decline in the middle market C&F. Great Britain C&F grew as a result of global health solution implementations.","Talent & Rewards fourth quarter commissions and fees grew 4% primarily due to an increase in corporate transaction projects, software sales and in compensation survey revenues. This growth was slightly offset by lower demand in the advisory businesses in North America. Retirement commissions and fees growth was 3%. Great Britain led the C&F growth for the segment as a result of additional work generated by pension legislation and derisking projects.","North America C&F grew as a result of increased consulting and administration work despite the lower demand for Bulk Lump Sum work. International also had strong growth in large part due to our acquisition of Russell's actuarial business in Australia earlier this year as well as an increase in consulting demand in Greater China. The fourth quarter operating margin for the HCB segment was 22%, flat from the prior year fourth quarter. The margin reflects some planned segment investments and restructuring charges.","For the full year HCB C&F revenues grew 2% with 2% growth on a constant currency basis and 3% growth on organic basis and had an operating margin of 24%. Overall, we continue to have a very positive outlook for the HCB business in 2018.","Now turning to Corporate Risk & Broking or CRB. Fourth quarter constant currency and organic commissions and fees were up 7% as compared to the prior year fourth quarter. North America CRB had solid growth of 4% driven by increased new business, strong retention and forensic accounting claim work related to increased natural disasters. International had 20% C&F growth as a result of strong growth in Latin America especially in Brazil and energy related business in CEEMEA.","Asia had solid growth as a result of new business and soft comparable in the fourth quarter of 2016. Western Europe C&F grew by 7% led by performance in large accounts in Iberia, France and Italy. Great Britain commissions and fees increased by about 1% due to growth in the natural resources and energy lines, which was partially offset by a decline in retail and the delay of a large renewal to 2018. Client retention was approximately 93% this quarter.","The CRB segment had a 28% operating margin as compared to 29% in the prior year fourth quarter. The margin decrease is due in part to a planned increase in corporate allocation related to the Gras Savoye acquisition and a one-time credit in the fourth quarter last year.","For the full year of 2017, CRB C&F revenues grew 4% on a reported constant currency and organic basis and had an operating margin of 18%. We're pleased with the momentum in our CRB business globally.","Now to Investment, Risk & Reinsurance or IRR. Constant currency commissions and fees for the fourth quarter increased 2% and organic increased 4% as compared to the prior year fourth quarter. As a reminder, the Reinsurance line of business represents treaty based reinsurance with some facultative business produced in wholesale. The bulk of our facultative reinsurance results are captured in the CRB segment.","Wholesale C&F grew by 8% due to new marine business and favorable timing. Insurance Consulting and Technology or ICT had 8% C&F growth driven by strong software sales. Reinsurance commissions and fees declined by 1% in the fourth quarter. Growth in International was offset by softness in North America and adverse timing in specialty. However, as a result of improved investment returns, total reinsurance revenues remained flat for the quarter.","Investment commissions were down slightly, but overall revenues increased by about 1% as a result of increased performance fees and delegated client wins. Max Matthiessen grew by 7% through strong new business and increased assets under management. Segment commissions and fees included a decline in the portfolio and underwriting business as a result of the divestiture of many of our small programs.","For the fourth quarter, the IRR segment had a 2% operating margin down from 8% for the prior year fourth quarter. The fourth quarter 2017 margin was impacted by planned investments for new technology and analytics and the divestment of various U.S. programs. For the year, IRR C&F revenues grew 2% with 3% growth on a constant currency basis and 4% growth on an organic basis and have an operating margin of 24%.","We continue to feel positive about the momentum of the IRR business for 2018. Commissions and fees for the BDA segment increased by 11% from the prior year fourth quarter driven by increased enrollments, our individual marketplace commissions and fees increased by 11%, and the rest of the segment increased by 10%. Increased membership and new clients drove the revenue increase in our group marketplace. The Health and Welfare and North America pension outsourcing business has continued to grow primarily due to new clients and customized Active Exchange projects.","Let me turn to the 2018 enrollments. We had a very strong group marketplace enrollment season as we added approximately 200,000 lives. As anticipated, we enrolled approximately 35,000 retirees in the individual marketplace. As we mentioned in our previous call, the individual marketplace exchange enrollment process is changing as the businesses mature. Enrollments will be spread more evenly throughout the year, so we continue to expect another 45,000 to 55,000 retirees to enroll during 2018.","The BDA segment had a 22% operating margin as compared to 11% in the prior year fourth quarter. The increase in margin was a result of the individual marketplace enrollment cycle being scheduled more evenly throughout the year, which allowed us to align staffing and costs more appropriately.","For the full year of 2017, BDA, C&F revenues grew 12% on a reported constant currency on organic basis and had an operating of margin of 21% which represents a 260 basis point increase over the prior year. The BDA segment is in a period of transition as the market and our market approach are continue to evolve. We continue to be optimistic about the long-term growth of this business.","So, as I mentioned earlier 2017 was an eventful year. We can't forget that so many of our colleagues and clients suffered losses during the many catastrophic events that occurred around the globe during the year. Our colleagues never lost sight of the important work we do in times of crisis and their client focus was unwavering. I'd like to thank our colleagues for their efforts in supporting our clients in what was a difficult year. And of course I'd to thank our clients for the great support you've given over the last two years.","Before turning the call over to Mike, I'd like to congratulate Alice Underwood and Mary O'Connor for having the named Women to Watch by the Business Insurance CLM Women to Watch recognition program. The award honors professionals doing outstanding work in risk management and commercial insurance. Recipients are recognized for their leadership, accomplishments and commitment to the advancement of women and diversity in the insurance industry. Alice is the global leader of the company's Insurance Consulting and Technology business, and Mary is the head of Client, Industry and Business Development in Great Britain, and also serves as the global leader of the Company's Financial Institutions Industry. They couldn't be more deserving of this honor.","Now I'll turn the call over the Mike.","Mike Burwell","Thanks John. And I'd like to add my thanks and congratulations to our colleagues for all of their efforts this year and especially ending the year with such strong momentum. I've been impressed by the talent, to drive for excellence and our client commitment that I've witnessed through our organization in particular over the last four months. I came to Willis Towers Watson at a time when our colleagues were in full crisis response mode and they work with their clients to assess the impacts of the recent catastrophes. Seeing this client commitment in action during my first few weeks here was a great introduction into Willis Towers Watson and made me very proud to be part of this organization.","But now for some additional insight into our financial results. Income from operations for the fourth quarter was $110 million or 5.3% of total revenues. The prior year fourth quarter operating income was $88 million or 4.6% of total revenues. Adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter was $436 million or 21% of total revenues, an increase of 17% over the prior year. Prior year fourth quarter adjusted operating income was $374 million or 19.4% of total revenues. The key drivers of this increase were both strong revenue growth and prudent expense management.","Income from operations for the year was $738 million or 9% of total revenues. The prior year operating income was $551 million or 7% of total revenues. Adjusted operating income for the year was $1.77 billion or 21.5% of total revenues, an increase of 9% over the prior year. Adjusted operating income for the prior year was $1.62 billion or 20.4% of adjusted revenues. Again the key drivers of this increase were both strong revenue growth and prudent expense management.","Let's move on to taxes, I'd like to provide you with some additional insights into our U.S. GAAP and adjusted tax rates. The U.S. GAAP tax rate for the fourth quarter was negative 221.4% and the adjusted tax rate was 21%. In connection with our initial analysis of the impact of the U.S. tax reform, we recorded a one-time discreet net tax benefit of $204 million in the fourth quarter. This net benefit includes a $208 million tax benefit as a result of the corporate rate reduction impact and the re-measurement U.S. net deferred tax liabilities are primarily related to the merger related acquisition intangibles.","For the year, U.S. GAAP tax rate was negative 20.5% and the adjusted tax rate was 22%, which surpassed our guidance adjusted tax rate of 23% to 24%. U.S. tax reform is relatively new, and as such we anticipate that the U.S. treasury may issue further clarifications, interpretations or guidance, so there is a possibility that our guidance could be updated during the year.","Moving to the balance sheet, we continue to have a very strong financial position. In terms of capital allocation, we purchased approximately $70 million of Willis Towers Watson stock in the fourth quarter, bringing the total for the year to approximately $710 million, including the cancellation of shares related to the settlement of shareholder litigation.","And as you may recall, our expectation was that the buyback was about $0.5 billion of shares for 2017. Over the last two years, we have repurchased or cancelled on the 8.4 million shares, as we believe this was in the best interest of our shareholders. We also increased the dividend by 10% in 2017.","Free cash flow for the year was $562 million, a decrease from $715 million for the prior year. The year-over-year variance was related to an increase in payments for discretionary compensation as we had a full year of discretionary bonus payments in 2017 whereas we had a partial payment in our partial year in 2016. We have higher capital costs this year due to our increase in integration efforts. The interest charges and the costs related to shareholder appraisal settlement and our prepayment of our corporate taxes in the fourth quarter.","Before moving on to the 2018 guidance, I'd like to remind everyone that new revenue and pension accounting standards were implemented as of January 1, 2019. On January 10, 2018, we filed an 8-K report and hosted a conference call to discuss the potential impact to the Company in the segment results. As we discussed on the call, we don't anticipate any material change on an annual basis, but the seasonality will change for some segments as the result of new revenue standard. A more detailed discussion and examples can be found in our 8-K filing.","The 2018 financial results, we've called this using the ASC 606 standard that our disclosures will include results as if the 2017 U.S. GAAP standard was implemented. As such, the guidance which we will provide you today will continue to be on the 2017 U.S. GAAP standard. We want to ensure that investors have a clear line of sight between our merger goals and our 2018 results.","So now, let's review our full year 2018 guidance for Willis Towers Watson. For the Company, we expect constant currency revenue growth to be around 3%. As John mentioned in his introduction earlier in the call, we've been reviewing our portfolio. And during 2017 and in January of 2018, we sold businesses with revenues totaling $65 million, so the 3% revenue growth equates to 4% organic growth.","For the segments, we expect commissions and fees constant currency revenue growth to be in the low-single digits for HCB, CRB and IRR and to be in the mid-single digits for BDA. Transaction and integration expenses expect to be approximately $140 million. As John mentioned earlier, we have already exceeded our original savings estimates of $100 million a $125 million.","Depreciation expense is expected to be approximately $210 million. The adjustment EBITDA margin is expected to be around 25%. The adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be around 24%.","As I alluded to you earlier, new treasury rules could materially impact this expectation. We expect free cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion in 2018. We had previously committed to delivering a minimum of $1.3 billion of free cash flow. The reason for the range as we settle the Stanford claim for $120 million in 2016 and expected to pay the funds in 2017 in the months approved by the court. Although the settlement was granted, we are still in the process of litigating an appeal. We hope this settlement will approve by late 2018, but it's dependent on the court.","We've increased our integration budget by about $60 million in order to save an additional $50 million in merger synergies, for a total savings of $175 million.","There are two areas where we see opportunity for additional savings. The first is expanded scope of implementation of our ERP system. We shifted our focus creating a global system rather than focusing on our major centers of operations. This will enhance data collection and greater financial efficiency. The secondary investment is in real-estate and data centers. We've been successful in consolidating and optimizing office and data centers, and surpassing our initial savings goals.","We expect to aggressively continue these efforts. And I'd also like to address the steps we have identified during 2018 budgeting progress that makes us comfortable in guiding to the $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion of free cash flow. We see specific opportunities in the following areas; enhanced operational performance, reduction of program cost and capital expenditures, increased working capital, refining our hedging programs and a one-time non-recurring cash event which took place in 2017 such as the shareholder settlement and prepayment of corporate taxes.","We plan to repurchase $600 million to $800 million of Willis Towers Watson stock during 2018 and expect to end the year with approximately 131 million shares outstanding. This would be a net reduction of 7 million shares since the merger, and at the top of the estimated range we discussed at the Analyst Day in 2016.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share, is expected to be in the range of $9.88 to $10.12. Annual guidance assumes average currency exchange rates of $1.33 to the pound and $1.18 to the euro.","So, before I turn the call back to John, I want to remind everyone that we'll be hosting an Analyst Day in Washington D.C. on March 16, 2018 and Meet the Leader session in London on March 22, 2018. We look forward to seeing you all at one of these events.","John Haley","Thanks very much Mike. And now, we'll take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Kai Pan","Thank you and good morning. My first question is on margin. So, if you look, organic growth had been very strong and the margin improvement had been a bit slower than expected. So, I just wonder why you don't have sort of like a higher leverage on the margin and what give comfort for like 25% margin in 2018, and that seems like a big jump like 200 basis points from the 2017 levels.","Mike Burwell","Kai, thank you for the question. You know we think \u2013 we're still confident and comfortable with the 25% EBITDA margin for 2018. In order to \u2013 we've seen a couple of investments that we've made in the current year. One, we referenced in the HCB segment which is both restructuring as well as further technology investments that we've made there. And second in the IRR segment, our AMX investment is what we referenced and John alluded to that in his opening comments, are investments that we've made. So, we feel good about the margin that we have delivered, little over 23% for the current year and we see a bridge and a path forward and we think that's reflective in terms of what's happened in the current year, but we see an absolute path, the 25% margin and that's what we've touched on.","Kai Pan","Okay. Then my follow-up question is on the organic growth front. If you look at across the segments, they increased and the one weak spot is the Reinsurance. Could you talk a little more because some of your competitor peers have, they seem to have a very strong organic growth in Reinsurance? And also, how do you contract your strong organic growth overall versus your seems like lower guidance on the sort of merger synergy.","Mike Burwell","Well, I guess the first is, again remember on Reinsurance, we take faculty, and that is included in our CRB segment overall. So, you know when we look at the Reinsurance segment, we feel very good about where it sits and what it's delivered overall when we see it. So, I guess we're not uncomfortable with where we are in our operations associated with Reinsurance.","You know looking out to future in terms of overall organic revenue growth, we're comfortable really being in that, you know 3% to 4% range that we have historically touched on and we think that make sense for the business given where market condition are and so, I really got no more to say than that's kind of where we are. I don't John anything you'd add to that.","John Haley","Yeah, I mean I think, Mike I agree with what you said. I guess the only thing I'd add is that when you look at the revenue synergies, we said, we expect to be ahead on global health. We expect to be at the low-end on the mid-market exchange business and we expect to be about maybe $50 million below our target on the large company P&C, but we have about $25 million of revenue synergies that we hadn't accounted in terms of the Reinsurance at ICT. When you add those all up, it gets to a point which is pretty damn close to about where our revenue synergies were. And frankly, what we're focused on is making sure that we have a company that is growing and if we grow little bit slower in one area and faster in another to counter it, that will be just fine. But we like the fact that we're getting growth from all areas and we have a great deal of confidence going into 2018.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg Peters with Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Greg Peters","I just wanted to go back a couple of comments that you made. You raised the immigration expense savings to $175 million and you also referenced refining the hedging program. On the $175 million, is that expected to all fall at bottom-line or is there going to be a reinvestment in part of that $175 million? And then can you run through the cost or the savings that you expect to get out of the refining of your hedging program?","John Haley","Yeah. So, let me \u2013 I'll take the first part of that and I'll let Mike explain the hedging, because I just get frustrated talking about it. But \u2013 the $175 million, that's part of our merger cost synergies, and in the merger cost synergies, we expect every penny to drop to the bottom-line.","Greg Peters","And John, that just \u2013 that comes by the end of the fourth quarter of 2018, correct? It's not something that\u2026","John Haley","I say fourth quarter, yeah, that's a fourth quarter run rate exiting 2018.","Greg Peters","Perfect.","Mike Burwell","And Greg on the hedging program, something John and I have been looking at, I specifically have been look it and really revaluating you know how we do it, what instruments we'll use, what's the length of time that we've put in place, and so we' reevaluated that activity. I think we've streamlined it, we've given a greater focus and tension, et cetera and we're optimistic as we look forward that we'll see enhanced management of that going forward.","John Haley","I think we do feel \u2013 we've done \u2013 we've spent a large part of 2017 understanding the hedging, and as Mike says, evaluating it and trying to set up the best program going forward in 2018. And I think both Mike and I have a lot of confidence that the system we have now is better than what we had before.","Greg Peters","Does this mean that there is going to be a little bit more volatility in your reported results around currency or \u2013 I'm just trying to read through the tea leaves here? ","Mike Burwell","No, the whole promissory Greg is the opposite actually, is a bit less volatility than what we've had historically.","Greg Peters","Just the last \u2013 the second question is around free cash flow. I understand your guidance for 2018. Can you just talk to us about some of the drivers in 2017, because it was down relative to 2016?","John Haley","Yeah, I think as I mentioned in the comments Greg, you know what we had seen is first is bonus payment, so in 2017 we had a full year of bonus payments that were recorded in 2016. We only had a partial year that was included in there. We did spend some additional CapEx both in real estate in which we've seen benefits and we'll see benefits for ongoing forward as well as well as technology and I mentioned we had paid some taxes in the fourth quarter which we believe were not appropriate tax strategy for us and so we made some additional tax payments in the fourth quarter. So, those things were the principal changes between fiscal year 2016 and fiscal year 2017 from a free cash flow standpoint.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Thank you for taking my question. Hey Mike I want to focus more on the free cash flow like the last question, and just asking to bridge some of the 2017 to 2018 guidance. Just with some specifics, so there are some high level numbers that are not going to recur like how large was that tax payment that you made in 2017 that will obviously reduce the tax payment in 2018? What else is sticking out over there? And then, just to understand more clearly, are you expecting to make the settlement payment in 2018 and that's why the reduction from $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion to $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. Just trying to understand some of the moving parts and what are some of the highlights that we can understand that bridge?","Mike Burwell","Sure. Well, let me see if I can be helpful on that color. So, first is, you know again coming from 2016 to 2017, let's take 2017 to 2018 just in terms of our thinking. Again, when you look at 2016 to 2017, so cash tax payments you know was roughly in the $50 million range. And you think about it, we had disclosed the shareholder litigation that we had paid was around $33 million and CapEx that you can see in there is roughly $82 million and we had you know the bonus payments in there were $80 million to $90 million kind of range where the biggest pieces that really bridge you from 2016 to 2017. And then as you look out to 2018, what we really see is, you know some operational improvements. You're obviously going to have reduced spending from a T&I perspective, integration perspective and restructuring perspective, and what we see is improvement in working capital and CapEx. So, you know when I look at those components, you know that's $500 million to $600 million that we see in aggregate of opportunities that are there. It's like gets you up in that \u2013 around that $1.3 billion free cash flow. And your last question was, when we expect to pay the Stanford litigation, but right now the reason we did go with that range $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion was if indeed we paid in 2018, then obviously we'll reduce that down to $1.1 billion, expect we don't pay it, we would obviously be at the $1.3 billion and that might get pushed in 2019. Obviously we're at the mercy of the judicial system in terms of how that process moves forward. So, hoping I provide a bit more color.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","It does a bit although, it would be nice if you could get just some brackets around some of the \u2013 some of the elements like $500 million to $600 million, is there something that accounts for $100 million to $200 million. I understand the Stanford is $200 million, but what about some of the other items there.","Mike Burwell","Yeah, I mean I think if you look at our T&I, reduced restructuring in T&I spending. You know you are in the $250 million to $300 million just to give you some further information, insight to that.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay. And then just in terms of the margins in the quarter, there is lot of talk about increased investment in some of the areas \u2013 in some of the units. Just one way to quantify that, just so that we get a sense as to what was planned and what was kind of accelerated in the plan. And John maybe you want to kind of address you know what are you expecting to get out of some of those investment again?","John Haley","Yeah. Do you want to talk about what was the acceleration?","Mike Burwell","I mean so, first, again, we have been investing and John touched on it in terms of highlighted it, what we believe are significant investments around AMX and the IRR segment. We're continuing to look to expand that geographically, and so obviously we need to adapt that appropriately in the particular territories in which it's going to operate et cetera. And we believe that that was the right investment to make so that we can continue to leverage that given the positive response that we've seen you know in Ireland and the U.K. and frankly, it's moving at a very rapid pace, and so we view that as an appropriate investment in terms of being able to leverage that looking 2018 and beyond.","And the HCB segment was you know frankly we thought we needed to \u2013 take the restructuring actions to better align the business and position it for longer term profitability. You know the Julie and team did that and executed within the quarter. We did not include it in our restructuring charge, because we view that as it relates to the prior years and for next year we keep this clear in terms of what was going to happen, and we see that as further productivity. So, we would have been more in that 23.5% kind of EBITDA margin just to come back from a quantification standpoint on an adjusted EBITDA margin basis had we not made those investments, just to kind of quantify and give you some perspective on it in terms of how we think about that.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Hey great. Thank you so much.","John Haley","Okay and so let me just Shlomo give you a little bit more color to maybe Mike's thing on the \u2013 he mentioned $500 million to $600 million of free cash flow improvement in 2017 to 2018. And as we look at that and think about the numbers, we're focused on the grand total, not so much the specific buckets. But if we look at the buckets, we're actually planning for operations to be about say 27% of the total, DSO improvement to be about another 27% of the total and then the CapEx reduction to be maybe 45% of the total. But what we're really focused on is the total as opposed to the individual pieces. But that at least gives you some idea of the relative sizes of what we're working with.","The main investments that we've been making and we \u2013 you know we're doing a little more restructuring to get some of the \u2013 we're taking a little more charges there to get some of the additional benefits in the cost synergies. We have those going on. But this year, the major investments that we've been making in the business, one Mike talked about some of the restructuring we've done in HCB and as he noted, we let that flow through and affect our margins as opposed to separating that out in restructuring charge where we look at this as some necessary restructuring, but maybe little closer to business as usual.","Mike Burwell","And John we didn't adjust it out in the adjustment numbers either.","John Haley","Right, so it's not \u2013 it's not in \u2013 it's not adjusted at all in there, so we're treating it as business as usual. But we think that will pay off just as the work we did in HCB, the year before it paid off in some better margins this year too, improving the margin from what they would have been. We've invested heavily in AMX and brought that out and we've also been investing quite heavily in new technology and new tools in the brokerage business generally. So, these \u2013 and that's actually the most significant investment we're making right now is in some of the new technology and new approaches in brokerage. We also have some investments in analytical tools in HCB. So, I think one of the things that we were focused on doing this year Shlomo is making sure that we as a company, we're focused on the future and investing in what's going to be generating the future revenue flows and the future profits in 2019, 2020 and beyond. And we wanted to make sure, that was moving ahead as we did this. We're still very focused on delivering the results for 2018, but we don't want that to be at the expense of future growth.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird. Your line is now open.","Mark Marcon","Good morning. First of all I want to congratulate you on all of the progress that's occurred over the last two years. You did a lot of things that a lot of people were skeptical of. So, congrats on that and it seems like things are well within range for 2018. I'd actually like to look beyond 2018 first and just think about incrementally what are some of the \u2013 what are some of the things that you could continue to improve upon as we look out beyond 2018, because it looks like the 10-10 is within range. What areas are you most optimistic about? Where are the areas where the free cash flow could improve even further? How should we think about that?","John Haley","So, I would say this I think if you look at our margins and compare them to our competitors, where you would see the biggest difference is probably in CRB and so we think that that is probably an area where we are \u2013 I mean I love the progress that we have made in CRB from the fourth quarter of 2016 to today. If we keep on that \u2013 I think there is further improvement that we can make in 2019 and beyond. And also the investments that I just talked about that we're making, as I said, we're putting more money in investments and making sure that we are at the forefront technologically in CRB than anywhere else. And so, I see that as also something that we contribute there.","I think there is some things we can do just as a matter of housekeeping and better management that will improve things. Both Mike and I think our DSOs are far too high, and we think that there is some significant improvement. We expect to make some improvement in 2018, but frankly we expect to make improvement for several years, year-on and year-out in the DSOs. And so, we see that as an area that we can improve on.","And then finally, we've been spending a lot of time on making sure that we're encouraging and fostering innovation. And I mentioned the CEO Circle Awards we have a number of other programs. It's my belief that most of the best innovation comes from the people on the front lines, who are dealing with clients every day and trying to \u2013 they see what the problems are and they come up with solutions for them. And what we want to make sure is that we have the right kind of environment in this company where people can bring those solutions forward and we can institutionalize them and get them out to market quickly. And we think we've done a number of nice things in the last couple of years to bring that forward and we think that will pay off.","Mark Marcon","That's great. And with regards to the innovation, I mean that's part of the culture and I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about some of the metrics that you are looking at with regards to engagement and our retention, particularly in CRB where you have made a ton of progress?","John Haley","Yeah. So, we did our first annual \u2013 our first all associates engagement survey in the early part of 2017. And we did that \u2013 actually before we started to see some of the real up turns that we had. It was in the very early part of 2017. So, it's not necessarily with all the good results we've had here factored in. But it was a \u2013 overall, we were very pleased with the results. We got over 86% of our people responding to it. I think the most important thing was that in terms of feeling about the Company sharing our values and approving the values of the Company and what we were trying to do, we had extraordinarily high alignment.","We had some things that people indicated that we needed to work on in terms of improving some of the efficiencies in the way we make it easier for people to do the work. We look at engagement surveys as not report cards, but really is areas for us to identify that we can work on to improve the Company. And so, we are taking that feedback. We have a whole program to roll that out. We'll probably do another survey in another year or so. And I expect we'll see some improvement in the areas that our colleagues have identified for us.","On innovation generally though, we have a new venture investment committee that is a committee that reviews ideas that people have. We have invested a lot in infrastructure to make it easy for people to identify some new ideas to get the appropriate support to develop business plans for them. And to bring them forward, we have a pretty rigorous approach to which ideas will pilot test, and then of the ones we pilot test, which ones will put into development. And I think the idea behind that is to say, going forward, we want to have may be a little bit \u2013 any ideas that we're supporting we want to make sure we give them sufficient support that they get a fair chance to do it. But we also want to have a culture of best failure, so we want to get out of things that aren't working. But we are pleased with the whole development across the ranks, Mark.","Mark Marcon","Great. And then just to number of questions real fast. The $175 million in run rates savings that we were going to get to by the end of 2018. Can you just give us a pacing for what's incremental in terms of coming through as the quarters fall through? And then from a DSO perspective, what would be a realistically ambitious goal and what would be like an audacious target in terms of where you can get the DSO too?","John Haley","I'm going to let Mike to take both of those.","Mike Burwell","Sure. When you look at the incremental $50 million, big piece of that is the continued program around real estate particular as we see that optimization continuing to happen. We have certain leases coming due and we'll refine the program that we've learned over the last couple of years. And we believe that we can see incremental benefits from what we've done to-date. And that's the biggest piece of what you are going to see in that $50 million happening in fiscal year 2018. Coming back on your \u2013 remind me\u2026","John Haley","What's a realistic and what's an audacious goal?","Mike Burwell","So, I think a realistic goal is clearly getting that down by five days. I think is realistic. Immediate goal every day is worth $0.01 a share, it's $21 million a day for us. So, we see that, I mean I think 20% reduction would be more of an audacious goal that we would have out there in terms of what we would look to do. And so, as John mentioned, the both of us are very focused on it, as well as frankly the entirely leadership team in terms of managing and driving it in a very focused way. So, we understand what it means to free cash flow. We know what it means in terms of creating opportunities for us to be able to redeploy that free cash flow and return it to potentially investors is an important element to that. So, hopefully that helps.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Hughes was SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Mark Hughes","Thank you. In the CRB segment, a very strong international organic growth, was there some timings benefits of that, your guidance for low-single digits is consistent with what you've had historically, but seems like Q4 was quite strong, is there some reason it should decelerate that much?","John Haley","Well, I think when you look at international you have really a tale of just two very different years between 2016 and 2017. And we mentioned that we thought that there were a lot of things, just a lot of unfortunate breaks in 2016 on international. We thought the actual performance of that business was really much better, but a lot of things brought it down. So, I think we had some easier comparables in 2016. The performance in 2017 has just been outstanding, I think really the whole year. And so, it's a little bit better in this fourth quarter, but it's really good performance the whole year.","Mark Hughes","And then, your large case P&C, it sounds like you're making some progress, but would like to make more, is there \u2013 are you finding this is just something that's going to take longer or it is just hard to do?","John Haley","Yeah. I would say that I think, well two things about this. One, we put the $200 million goal out there, and that was really taking us from \u2013 it was an additional 2% market share we'd estimated. But it was really about a 40% increase in our market \u2013 in what our total revenues were, because we're going from 3.5% to 5.5%, so a pretty big increase there. We are not getting quite as far along as we thought. But even when we've had the $200 out there, we expected that would be something that we would build on in future years and continue to grow our relative market share there.","So, if it comes out the way we are planning now, will have gone from about 3.5% market share up by 1.5% to about 5%, and you know 5.5% something like that, and we expect to continue to grow that over future years. I think it's probably, I mean it's fair to say, it's probably been a little bit harder than we anticipated or at least it's been a little bit slower than we anticipated. And so, I think I mentioned we actually are not as far off on the number of cases that we had brought in, but the average case size is a little bit smaller than we had anticipated.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi. Good morning. Just trying to tie up some stuff, if I look at the earnings guidance that you guys gave, obviously the 10-10 that you guys have pointed to throughout the merger is included within that. It seems like expense saves, you know more positive on, revenue synergy are coming in a little bit lighter than you had expected in a couple of the bucket, tax more or less about in line a little bit better. So I guess I am trying to tie it all together and just understand how you kind of got to your guidance and maybe why it wouldn't be a little bit higher? And then, is the 25% EBITDA margin goal? Is that embedded within the guidance that you set forth for 2018?","John Haley","Yeah. So, I'll give you some thoughts Elyse, and then maybe Mike will want to jump into. Look the 25% EBITDA goal is embedded within there also. I think what I would say is that when we thought about the 10-10. And you will remember from that back in 2016 we did the Analyst Day, we said everything doesn't have to go perfect. We have some things that can balance as to where they are.","I think frankly, we have a lot of things going right at the moment and we feel pretty good about that, which we think it gives us great momentum going into 2018. We do expect we'll lose about $0.06 a share as a result of the new tax bill. And so, if you take the $0.06 a share and added that to our guidance, we have the 10-10 just about \u2013 almost it wouldn't be quite dead center, but it'd be real close. And so, that's about where we had been targeting the whole time that we thought 10-10. We always said it wasn't a slam dunk by any means, but we thought we had a plan to get there and I think we still feel that way. Mike, do you what to add anything?","Mike Burwell","Yes. I was going to add John. I think, Elyse back on the margin, I think we've made those investments. We believe they will pay off going forward. We are obviously focused on variety of different things. As John said, we have a lot of things going right. But obviously we are planning for to drive it as a management team, but we'll have some things that will come up and we think we put the appropriate measures in place, but we think that 25% makes sense and are therefore rolls up to those overall goals adjusted by taxes as John said.","Elyse Greenspan","So the 25% is included in the 2018 target?","Mike Burwell","It is.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. And then as we think about the saves from the OIP and then the higher merger saves. As you guys come up with this guidance, just because it's really hard for us from the outside to see how much might actually be falling to the bottom line. Is there any way you can kind of talk to how much bottom line savings you are seeing as you think about 2018? And then this might relate to the saves going up, but I did noticed the integration costs that you pull out of adjusted earnings went up in the quarter and was \u2013 and had a plan this year. What rolls on the higher costs there?","Mike Burwell","Yeah. So first, Elyse, the higher costs were principally related to additional technology and real estate costs that we had spent activities on. We also had the shareholder suit that came back overall in terms of what we spent additional money on the $33 million that we had as it relates to shareholder litigation settlement was included in there. So, those are the principal biggest pieces of that incremental amount.","On OIP, as John referenced the $95 million, our best estimate of it right now is roughly around half that we've seen in terms of fallen to the bottom line. And equally we talked about $175 million next year in terms of what that looks like as an exit rate amount. So, I know you're trying to go back to those pieces, but those are the biggest chunks that are included in there.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, great. And then one last question on, it seems like it's taking a little bit longer for some of the larger account wins that you guys did, pointed to with this merger. Is that something that maybe \u2013 how do you think about 2019, is it something where you see the synergy is continuing, maybe more coming in over the longer term or is it something where maybe the ability, the gain \u2013 higher share in that market might just \u2013 it's either taking longer or do you think you might not get to the original target?","John Haley","Now we'll get to the original target and go past it.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate the color.","John Haley","Okay.","Operator","This does conclude our Q&A session. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. John Haley for any further remarks.","John Haley","Okay. Thanks very much everyone for joining us this morning. And we look forward to talking with you or seeing you in March.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program.

Now I will turn the call of the John Haley.","John Haley","Thanks, Aida. Good morning, everyone. Today we will review our results for the third quarter of 2016 and provide updated guidance for the full year of 2016. We will also provide consolidated 2016 and certain pro forma 2015 financial results.","Our segment results for this quarter are presented based on the new Willis Towers Watson structure. We provided historical Willis Towers Watson segment information in an 8-K filed on July 14, 2016.","I\u2019d like to take a few minutes to address the management changes we announced last week. First, I\u2019d like to thank Dominic Casserley for his contributions to Willis and all of his efforts in assisting in the creation of Willis Towers Watson. Dominic has been a terrific partner throughout the entire transaction and integration process.","Second, I\u2019m extremely pleased with the appointments we\u2019ve made to the Investment, Risk & Reinsurance and the Corporate Risk & Broking businesses and to the Americas region. Not only have we enhanced the operating committee by increasing the strength of the brokerage perspective, but I\u2019m very excited about bringing the vision and passion Carl Hess, Todd Jones and Joe Gunn bring to their new roles. I\u2019m confident that based on their previous success and the depth of their knowledge of our business they will continue to be strong and effective leaders.","Now let\u2019s turn to our results for the quarter. Reported revenues for the quarter were $1.78 billion, a 2% increase on a pro forma basis compared to the prior year. This includes $51 million of negative currency movement on a pro forma basis.","Commissions and fees for the reportable segments were up 2% on an organic basis. The net loss attributable to Willis Towers Watson for the quarter was $32 million as compared to the prior-year pro forma net income of $209 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $275 million, or 15.5% of revenues as compared to the prior-year pro forma adjusted EBITDA of $307 million or 17.6% of revenues.","The year-over-year decline is due to revenue pressure from CRV and IRR and the seasonality of Gras Savoye business. Adjusted EBITDA for the first nine months of 2016 was $1.35 billion or 22.5% of adjusted revenues as compared to pro forma adjusted EBITDA for the first nine months of 2015 of $1.27 billion, or 22.8% of adjusted revenues. For the quarter, loss per diluted share was $0.23 and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.04. Currency fluctuations net of hedging had a negative impact of $0.02 on adjusted EPS.","Before moving on to the segment results I\u2019d like to provide an update on three areas of integration: revenue synergies, cost synergies and tax savings. First, let\u2019s discuss the revenue synergies. In the first year we expected to achieve sales of approximately 5% to 10% of our stated 2018 revenue synergies.","We are where we want to be but we also realize that achieving our first year goals is a small portion of our overall objective and we still have a lot of work ahead of us. As we've discussed on previous calls, the Global Health Solutions and mid market revenues will primarily be recognized in 2017. The majority of the P&C wins will also impact 2017 and beyond. We are continuing to make good progress in the three areas of revenue synergies we've outlined in our previous communications: Global Healthcare Solutions, the mid market healthcare exchange and the U.S. large market P&C sector. We've won another six Global Healthcare Solution clients this quarter and the pipeline continues to look very strong. We also won 30 single country multinational assignments.","Turning to the mid market exchange, as previously discussed we sold approximately 70,000 eligible lives for the 2017 enrollment. We may see a pause in sales activity while the enrollment season is underway but continue to be pleased with our 2018 sales pipeline. Lastly, in the U.S. P&C large company space we've been awarded 16 new projects so far this year. Now moving on to the tax and cost synergies, we continue to be on track to achieve our original goal of a 25% adjusted tax rate a full year ahead of schedule, in fact. We continue to expect to exceed this goal longer term. We originally estimated merger cost synergies of 100 million to 125 million by the end of 2018 and believe we are on track to achieve this goal. We continue to estimate savings of approximately $20 million in calendar 2016 with an exit run rate of at least $30 million.","Next I'd like to move to the operational improvement program or OIP. Incremental savings from OIP where proximally $14 million from the third quarter of 2015. We incurred an incremental $11 million of restructuring costs in this same time period. We plan to spend approximately $165 million in 2016 for restructuring charges. Now let's look at the performance as well as our revenue and margin expectations of each of our segments. On an overall constant currency basis, commissions and fees for Human Capital & Benefits increased 5%; Corporate Risk & Broking increased 8%; Investment, Risk & Reinsurance decreased 5%; and Exchange Solutions increased 25%. All of the revenue results discussed in the segment detail and guidance reflect commissions and fees constant currency unless specifically stated otherwise. ","Now let's look at each of the segments in more detail. Turning to Human Capital & Benefits or HCB, HCB generated growth of 5% driven primarily by the Gras Savoye acquisition. On an organic basis commissions and fees increased 2%. Retirement commissions and fees were up slightly due to increased bulk lump sum project work in the U.S. and new pension administration client implementations which were offset by softness in the Netherlands. Talent and Rewards commissions and fees were up as a result of strong demand for executive compensation work and the delivery of data surveys, but we continue to experience softness in the Rewards, Talent and Communication business in North America and EMEA.","Moving to health and benefits, we continue to see strong demand in the large company space globally with strong product and plan management activity in North America. Technology and Administration Solutions, or TAS, contributed to produce solid results due to new clients and higher call center demand. We continue to have a positive outlook for HCB business for the rest of 2016. We should continue to see bulk lump sum projects in the fourth quarter. Talent and Rewards is seasonally in the second half of the calendar year and we continue to expect growth in the health and benefits and TAS businesses.","Turning to Corporate Risk & Broking or CRB, commissions and fees grew 8% from the prior year as a result of the Gras Savoye acquisition. On an organic basis commissions and fees were flat. Revenue declines in North America and in the International business offset the growth in Great Britain and Western Europe. In North America a one-time project in 2015 created a strong comparable and our new business was lower than expected.","China and Brazil accounted for most of the revenue declines in our International business as a result of the economic and political climate in those countries. Great Britain had very strong results across all lines of business and Iberia led the growth for Western Europe with some weakness in Denmark and with the Affinity business. We expect Great Britain and Western Europe to continue providing revenue growth and we don't see any significant near-term changes in the Asian and Latin American markets. We are seeing a small pricing headwind in the North American market and continue to focus on building our new business pipeline. Overall we expect similar results in the fourth quarter.","Now to Investment, Risk & Reinsurance, commissions and fees were down by 5% for the quarter. Organic commissions and fees declined 5% primarily due to a decline in the Reinsurance and Capital Markets business. The decline in North America Reinsurance revenues offset the revenue growth in the other region. The Capital Markets business, which is generally volatile and is dependent on transactions, generated its highest revenue ever in the third quarter of calendar year 2015 and had nominal revenue this quarter. So while the business is rather small to our portfolio, the volatility had a material impact on the growth of the segment.","On a positive note we continue to see wholesale delivering solid results from Miller. Risk consulting had modest revenue growth led by software sales and investment had a very strong quarter as a result of increased performance fees and a soft comparable in the third quarter of 2015. We anticipate that IRR will continue to see headwinds in the Reinsurance and Capital Markets businesses as we don't expect the overall environment to change by the end of the calendar year.","Lastly, Exchange Solutions followed up the strong first half with another outstanding quarter with commissions and fees of $161 million, an increase of 25%. Driven by record enrollments our Retiree and Access Exchanges the new increased 35% and the other Exchange Solutions businesses increased 14%. Increased membership in new clients drove the revenue increases. Our health and welfare administration business continues to grow, primarily as a result of the new business we've won over the last two years. We continue to receive high satisfaction scores from retirees where 95% feel they selected the right plans to best meet their needs and we have an overall 93% retiree satisfaction rate. We've also experienced 100% renewal as our first round of active Exchange client contracts were ending this year.","We expect the fourth-quarter revenue growth to be more moderate as the retiree and health and welfare businesses start to overlap the strong enrollment numbers and new clients which were added in the fourth quarter of calendar year '15 which created a strong comparable.","I'm pleased with the progress on a number of initiatives associated with the merger, especially the focus on revenue synergies. We are even seeing crossover in marketing efforts we did not contemplate as we created Willis Towers Watson and we remain committed to continue to support and encourage these activities. In order to provide the investments needed to attain our growth goals we are taking steps to help ensure we achieve our merger commitments of enhanced margins and shareholder return. We are extremely focused on balancing our growth initiative while maintaining financial discipline. I feel we have the right team in place to deliver the 2017 objectives and beyond.","And last I'd like to thank all of our colleagues for their enthusiasm in supporting our efforts and their continued steadfast commitments to our clients. Now I will turn the call over to Roger.","Roger Millay","Great, thanks John and good morning to everyone. I'd like to add my congratulations to Todd Jones, Carl Hess and Joe Gunn. I'm excited about how the experience Todd, Carl and Job bring to the table aligns with our long-term opportunities and goals. Based on their proven track records I'm confident in their future success. Now for our financial results; as a reminder, our segment margins are before consideration of unallocated corporate costs such as amortization of intangibles, restructuring costs and certain integration expenses resulting from mergers and acquisitions. The segment results include discretionary compensation. Income from operations for the quarter was $1 million, or 0.1% of revenues. The prior-year third-quarter pro forma operating income was $104 million, or a 5.9% of revenues. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $243 million, or 13.7% of revenues and the prior-year quarter pro forma adjusted operating income was $267 million, or 15.3% of revenues.","As we highlighted earlier, revenue pressure and seasonality related to Gras Savoye impacted the third-quarter margin. Income from operations for the first nine months of 2016 was $463 million, or 7.8% of revenues. The prior-year first nine months pro forma operating income was $632 million or 11.3% of revenues. Adjusted operating income for the first nine months of 2016 was $1.25 billion, or 20.7% of adjusted revenues. And the prior-year first nine months pro forma adjusted operating income was $1.13 billion, or 20.3% of revenues. The GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 46% and the adjusted tax rate was 22%. Before we discuss the segment operating margins, I'd like to remind you that we provided recast segment operating income for the prior periods in the 8-K we filed on July 14, 2016. Additionally, our segment margins are calculated using total segment revenues. For the third quarter the operating margin for the Human Capital & Benefits segment or HCB was 16% as compared to pro forma 17% last year. As expected, the 2016 margin trended lower due to the Gras Savoye margin being lower than the Company average.","For the first nine months of 2016 the HCB segment operating margin was 22% as compared to pro forma 23% in 2015. We continue to anticipate the HCB segment operating margin will be in the low 20% range for the year. For the third quarter the Corporate Risk & Broking segment or CRB had an 11% operating margin as compared to a pro forma 14% operating margin in the prior-year third quarter. Revenue pressure from North America and the International business impacted margin.","The heavy weighting of Gras Savoye in the first quarter has also changed the seasonality of the quarterly margin. For the first nine months the operating margins for 2016 and pro forma for 2015 were 16%.","We continue to anticipate CRB\u2019s operating margin to be around 20% for the year. The change in leadership has not impacted the focus to drive margin enhancement.","For the quarter the Investment, Risk & Reinsurance segment or IRR had an 8% operating margin as compared to pro forma 10% operating margin in the prior-year third quarter. The revenue pressure from Capital Markets and Reinsurance was generally offset by growth in wholesale, risk consulting and investment.","For the first nine months of 2016 the IRR segment operating margin was 26% as compared to pro forma 25% in 2015. Inclusive of the JLT legal settlement we continue to expect the IRR segment margin to be around 20% for the calendar year.","Exchange Solutions operating margin for the quarter and the prior-year pro forma was 12%. For the first nine months of the calendar year the Exchange Solutions segment operating margin was 18% as compared to 11% pro forma in the prior year.","For the quarter, Retiree and Access Exchanges led the segment with a 27% operating margin as we continue to invest in the active exchange. For 2016, we expect the Exchange Solutions segment margin to be in the mid-teens. As a reminder, margins are seasonally hunger in the first half of the calendar year as compared to the second half of the calendar year due to cost buildup for the enrollment season. Commissions and fees are recognized over the year once the policies become effective, which is typically January 1.","Moving to the balance sheet we continue to have a strong financial position. As of September 30, we had repurchased $233 million of Willis Towers Watson stock. We continue to anticipate a total repurchase of $300 million for 2016.","Free cash flow was $122 million this quarter and $457 million for the first nine months of the year. Free cash flow is generally expected to build through the year. We still expect to deliver approximately $650 million in free cash flow for 2016.","Now let\u2019s review our guidance for fiscal year 2016. We expect to incur approximately $150 million to $175 million for both integration and transaction-related items and restructuring items. Integration and transaction-related expenses and restructuring costs will continue to be adjusted from our GAAP measures.","In fiscal 2016 we are adjusting the expected reported revenue growth to be around 6% and constant currency revenue growth to be in the 9% to 10% range with the primary growth drivers being the Gras Savoye acquisition and the Exchange Solutions segment. Last quarter we estimated that organic revenue growth would be in the 2% to 3% range. Based on the third quarter results we now expect organic revenue growth to be around 2%. We expect GAAP operating income margin to be around 7% and adjusted operating income margin to be around 20%. In calendar 2015 pro forma GAAP operating income margin was 10.5% and pro forma adjusted operating income margin was 19.3%. We are progressing with various cost reduction programs which will allow us to keep this margin in line with previous expectations. We believe that we are beginning to realize the results of this cost control work. While costs can ebb and flow and it can be difficult to fully lock down sequential organic momentum we believe we saw modest net sequential enterprise expense reduction in Q2 and that we enhanced the level of sequential reduction in the third quarter versus the second. Assuming continued organic revenue growth this is the path to margin expansion momentum in 2017.","On a segment basis, we are holding margin estimates to previously reported estimates for all segments. For revenue guidance we will be referring to organic commissions and fees. Based on the third quarter results we are maintaining low single digit revenue growth for HCB, lowering CRB revenue estimates from low single digit growth to flat, lowering IRR revenue estimates from a low single digit decline to a mid single digit decline and, finally, increasing Exchange Solutions revenue growth from high 20%s to around 30%.","The GAAP tax rate for the year is expected to be in the range of 5% to 7% and the adjusted tax rate is expected to be around 23%. We expected GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.30 to $2.50. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $7.60 to $7.80, which is in line with our previous guidance. While our financial results this year haven't been as strong as we hoped, this adjusted EPS range represents upper teens percentage growth over the merger pro forma for 2015. Guidance assumes average currency exchange rates of $1.35 to the pound and $1.12 to the euro.","I continue to be pleased with the integration efforts. While we are seeing early signs of success in areas like reducing the tax rate, winning projects aligned to our revenue synergies and a greater focus on margin management, many of these initiatives are building the foundation for 2017 and beyond. I remain confident in achieving our long term success.","Now I will turn it back to John.","John Haley","Thanks very much Roger. And now we will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Hi, good morning and thank you very much for taking my questions. John, can you just talk a little bit about the progress to date versus the long term goals? It's slower out of the box on the revenue side and clearly you need the CRB segment to pick up in revenue growth on an organic basis to get to where you want to be in a couple of years. What are you seeing internally in the business that makes you feel comfortable that you are going to see that progress over the next year or so?","John Haley","Thanks Shlomo, I think as we came into this year we could see there were some headwinds in some of the businesses that we were facing a little bit. I think we've seen North America has been a place where we've probably seen it, particularly in CRB more than in some areas although International has also been a place where we've experienced a good bit of a decline there. We see those things as being turning around somewhat next year. I think we had tough comparables on the International, for example, last year. We had some reversals of some income that we had booked in 2015 that occurred this year that we have gone on. I think when we said what we were going to try to do this year it was first we were going to try to make sure we got the right kind of margins and then we were going to use that platform to build with profitable revenue growth. I think that's still been our focus. We feel pretty good about coming in at exactly what we had said last quarter with the EPS.","We might be a percent or so lower on or at the bottom end of the revenue guidance that we gave last quarter. But we still feel we will come in right around there. I think with the new team we have in place, too, I think one of the things I like about that with some strong brokerage representation from North America leading both CRB and the Americas geography, I think we are well poised to turn around North America there. So I do feel like we have the right people there. We have the right offerings and I think we just need to build on that.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","So is there anything marketwise that you feel has increased headwinds in North America broking or do you really think it's a people item or a combination?","John Haley","I think you always have a little bit of loss whenever you go through some big changes like this in the merger that we did. So I think we probably lost a little bit of that. I think as we put the organization together we probably made it a little too complex, too, and I know one of the things that both Todd and Joe Gunn are focused on is making sure that we streamline some of the organization and are spending more time with clients and less time internally.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay, and then in the IRR business it seems the guidance implies a pretty big step down next quarter. And is there -- can you just give us a little bit of a thought as to what's in play over there and is that something that we should continue to see those kinds of declines or is that specific to the quarter but don't think about it that way for say next year or so?","John Haley","I think IRR it's a mixture of a number of businesses. As we said in the script, the Capital Markets business is a relatively smaller part of that overall portfolio but in this particular quarter, best quarter ever in the third quarter of 2015. And nominal revenue is really -- I mean, it was pretty close to zero so it was really quite nominal revenue for this year. And it reflects the fact that there's just been a dearth of deals in the insurance business generally. And so we are not expecting to see, for example, that to pick back up in the fourth quarter, although we do see some signs that 2017, we have had a couple of wins recently that could very well deliver some nice revenue in 2017. So we will have to see about that. Reinsurance we have, we are facing some headwinds in Reinsurance. Our Facultative Reinsurance, of course, is off in CRB, so we don't report that in IRR. And that's the part of the business that's been growing more than the tree. We see that business as still facing some headwinds. I think some of the restructurings that our clients have done and some of the just withdrawal of Reinsurance from the market as you've seen some big mergers have also contributed to headwinds for us there. So again we are not projecting that the fourth quarter is going to be a big improvement there either. I think some of the other businesses, investment which has been down for a number of quarters here we saw some real improvement in the third quarter, and I think we feel better about the fourth quarter now than we would have a quarter or so ago. And I think we are beginning to see some signs in the Risk Consulting & Software of a bit of a pickup. So it is a mixed bag. But I think we continue to see pressure on Reinsurance and we continue to see Capital Markets as being down. And I think overall that's what contributes to a lower forecast for the fourth quarter for that segment.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","If I could sneak in just one P&L or balance sheet question for Roger, did the DSOs spike up a lot this quarter? And if so, can you give us a little detail on that?","Roger Millay","Yes, not based on our numbers, Shlomo. So I think in total in our numbers we're a little over 100 days this time. I think that's maybe a couple days higher than in the June quarter but not a big spike up.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters with Raymond James. Your line is open, please go ahead.","Greg Peters","I guess I just wanted to circle back. You gave some excellent color on organic. Can you speak to customer retention specifically in Corporate Risk & Broking and IRR, especially in light of some organic challenges that you are having there?","John Haley","Yes, our retention rate is in the low 90s, which is I think about what -- that's about the traditional rate. I think it's standard for that. I think where we've been seeing the pressure on the CRP is actually some new business wins haven't been as high as we might have hoped, and so that's been more the issue than the renewal rate, Greg, retention rate.","Greg Peters","So I'm just trying to marry that. Roger you said on your path to margin expansion for 2017 assumes organic growth. Just trying to parse out exactly what you mean by that. And then the follow-on to that, John, would be it doesn't seem like there's a lot of changes in the numbers with the third-quarter result that would represent new headwinds towards your 25% EBITDA margin target in 2018. But perhaps you could talk a little bit about anything that's changed from Analyst Day to now that might have adjusted your thinking.","John Haley","Yes, actually, thanks Greg for that. And I will let Roger maybe address that, but let me just address the sort of the macro point you raise there. We don\u2019t actually see anything in these results that have really changes our thinking from what we presented in Analyst Day. I mean when you look as I said at where we project our earnings will be this year, we are still right where we thought we would be at Analyst Day and actually we are even more confident that will be in the range we guided to. So we feel very good about that. The kinds of things, when we talked in Analyst Day we talked about what we needed to do to deliver in 2017 and then 2018. We knew that this 2016 had been a tough year and that it was going to continue to be a bit of a tougher year. But I think we feel like we have everything in place to get to where we need to in 2018. Roger, do you want\u2026","Roger Millay","Yeah, I will just comment, Greg, on my words there and that they weren\u2019t intended to be profound words. It was actually more, and I don\u2019t say mathematics in front of John, it was arithmetic. But what really we challenged ourselves to do this quarter was step back and say do we start to see the seeds of momentum shift towards our margin expansion goal. And while we are still in this period of, one, having comparison, two big acquisition periods so that makes it a little difficult on a comparison side, and so the comparisons aren\u2019t really apples-and-apples, year-over-year. But we took a look sequentially at what we saw in the numbers and given the actions we know we\u2019ve taken this year. The path to margin expansion is continuing the kind of growth as we\u2019ve had this year, albeit at a low level, and then if sequentially costs are going down the way margin enhancement pops is you get to a quarter where you are comparing to a year where you began the cost reductions and revenues have been growing through that period and the margin enhancement pops. And so the only point I was trying to make is, and again with a lot of noise in the system and you have to adjust for things that are seasonal in nature, but we believe that we see a sequential cost-reduction momentum, which means that when we start comparing next year to 2016 that we would expect to see margin enhancement. So I didn\u2019t mean anything particular by citing organic growth, just saying that\u2019s the calculation.","Greg Peters","Perfect. Just a cleanup question on the tax rate, it\u2019s been running ahead pretty much all year of where you thought it would be. When do we start factoring in a lower tax rate for 2017 or 2018 or do we still keep it at the mid-20s?","Roger Millay","Yeah, I mean, I think my view on tax is, one, there is enough complexity there is I don\u2019t like to declare victory on a year until you close the year out. So we are hopeful and as you can tell we dropped our guidance a bit this quarter, hopeful that we conclude that this kind of range is where we\u2019d like to see going forward and then maybe set a new goal. But I'd really like to close this year out before we talk about what 2017 and 2018 might look like.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Ryan Tunis","Hey, thanks. My first question I guess is just on how to think about variable compensation. And I was wondering if in a year where organic is slower does that change the relationship of variable comp to revenues? In other words, is there margin expansion coming through this year in some shape or form because organic growth hasn't been quite what you guys thought it would be at the start?","Roger Millay","Maybe I will start with just a more numerical discussion and John might have some philosophical comments. So certainly we have incentive compensation programs across our businesses that are sensitized to performance and you can see in our numbers that the segments, there's a pretty broad diversity of performance in the segments. So there is a reduction at this point in incentive compensation, total dollars versus what the target amounts might be, and so we have had some adjustments over the last couple of quarters.","In terms of getting where we are right now and getting to the end of the year and having a material impact on margins, I don't think those adjustments are at that level. I guess the other thing just in terms of the way the accounting works that I'd observe is what we called in Towers Watson discretionary compensation, which was a quite material item financially relative to a total year, it's not as material for Willis Towers Watson because there are more separate sales compensation programs in Willis Towers Watson. So, anyway, long and the short is pure bonus not as impactful as Towers Watson was, but there have been some downward adjustments and that's a part of that supported margins somewhat.","John Haley ","And I guess the only thing I would add about that is to say that we do have a pay for performance philosophy and we expect to pay our people better when results are good and not as well when results are not good. So we tend to maintain our variable compensation plans of all different stripes, when we add them altogether we come somewhere in the low 30s as a percent of our pretax pre variable comp margins. So they do adjust, but they actually don't tend to affect the margins themselves that much because they tend to be a constant percentage of that.","Ryan Tunis","Okay. That's really helpful. Then I guess my follow up is just thinking about organic on the Reinsurance side, I think listening to John talk about these headwinds, it comes across as sounding environmental softness in North America Treaty Capital Markets. And I guess if you could just elaborate him why you think it's environmental as opposed to more broadly maybe some loss of market share, because when we look at competitors that are quite a bit bigger than Willis I guess in Reinsurance we are still seeing organic hold up reasonably well. So if you could just elaborate on why what gives you confidence that it's environmental at this point. Thanks.","John Haley","Yes so I think Reinsurance is a -- it's an interesting one. If we look at North America which is where we have experienced, I think, some of the biggest headwinds, we actually have exceeded our new business targets so far this year. So the new business part of it has gone relatively well. What has hurt us is A; there has been some of the existing clients are buying less reinsurance and so we've seen that occur partly because people are buying less reinsurance, partly because mergers have actually just taken, just cut the market in total, and then we've also seen, we've had a couple of clients that have restructured things, some of the reinsurance programs, which have led to revenues being shifted to different years. And we've seen that on a couple of big ones that have had a material impact on our results.","When we look at it overall the Reinsurance, it does tend to be a little lumpy from year to year when we compare our results to we were looking at one of our big competitors the other day and they were minus 4% last year and they are plus 1% this year. So we had a better 2015 and a little bit lower 2016. I think we tend to look maybe at a little bit longer trends than just a year or so. But when we look at it we fundamentally are encouraged by the fact that the new business efforts have been strong even in North America and, in fact, have exceeded targets. And that is what makes us think going into 2017 we are well placed.","Ryan Tunis","Okay and I guess one thought I had is the legacy Towers risk business that you guys kept when you sold the old Reinsurance business to JLT, have there been any revenue dissynergies in that business from I guess now bringing Willis Re back into the fold? Has there been softness do you think there that's at all related to merger, and how big is that revenue base for the legacy Towers risk business? Thanks.","John Haley","Yes, so I think no, there haven't been -- certainly there's no net revenue dissynergies and I don't think there have been really any revenue dissynergies to speak of. Interestingly enough, I referred in the script to businesses spontaneously working together. And I think it's the Reinsurance and the RCS business which have actually led the way in terms of doing that. So our Reinsurance folks have reached out to the RCS folks, have been adopting some of their models, have been using them in joint client presentations. And we've seen getting some synergies across business lines. Probably the poster child for that right now is our Reinsurance and our RCS folks. So we don't see a big difference there. Roger, what is the number on the size?","Roger Millay","I think with RCS is what $275 million, $300 million, something like that? That neighborhood.","Ryan Tunis","Okay. Thanks for your answers.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from a line of Quentin McMillan with KBW. Your line is open, please go ahead.","Quentin McMillan","I think one of the things, and I know you gave a lot of organic color that is confusing people, is just the change from what you saw as of September 29 at the Investor Day on the organic growth and the lowering of that. You were at 2% to 3%, you go to 2%. It's not a huge change but really just want to know what changed in the last 30 days and is that also related to your decision to change leadership at Corporate Risk & Broking post the Investor Day?","John Haley","So I'll let Roger talk about the numbers and how we got to that because it is a mix of a lot of different things. But let me just address the leadership changes. As we were looking out as to what we need to deliver in 2017 and 2018 I became focused on making sure I had the team that I had the most confidence in to deliver those results. And I made the changes to put that team in place. And so it wasn't anything specific about just one quarter, it was a matter of identifying the team that I felt the most confidence in.","Roger Millay","I would just say on the guidance question that even though Analyst Day was at the end of September, as you probably know in the CRB business there can be some big transactions that may or may not happen at the end of the quarter and in our forecasts, our internal forecasts which advise guidance, we had anticipated some larger transactions that would generate meaningful revenue for us and ultimately they did not come in by the end of the quarter. So CRB was the biggest piece of the miss in driving the reduction.","Quentin McMillan","That would sort of imply that the fourth quarter should be very strong because those contracts would have just rolled into the fourth quarter, correct?","Roger Millay","There are items that we hope for the third quarter that we now expect in the fourth quarter.","Quentin McMillan","And just shifting to the free cash flow, your 2018 guidance of 1.3 to 1.4, I just wanted to clarify one expectation for that. At the Analyst Day you guys did break out the $10, $10 EPS, you get there from 2.5% top-line growth, 25% EBITDA and 8 million decrease in shares. Is the free cash flow $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion number based on those same expectations or are there any differences in how you get to that free cash flow expectation?","Roger Millay","They are based on the same level and they are based on our belief at this point that free cash flow while balance sheet items go in there and there will be puts and takes year to year, but over time that free cash flow should fall into the range of adjusted net income. So the adjusted net income underlying $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion is consistent with the $10, $10 plus that we've talked about. And the $1.3 billion so, and it's to the exit rate of 2018 into 2019.","Quentin McMillan","Meaning you will finish 2018 with $1.35 billion or a roundabout in free cash flow?","Roger Millay","Well no, so the difference, so the big reduction or detractor from free cash today are all the restructuring and integration costs. We don't get out from under those until the end of 2018. So that's why, so the $1.3 billion to one $4 billion is saying, look, if you are running at a $10, $10 level for adjusted EPS, adjusted net income that underlies that and you are out from under the restructuring and integration costs then you\u2019re at $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion.","Quentin McMillan","Okay, so the reported number will be lower but adjusted for the restructuring it should be that number? Okay. Thanks very much, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Mark Marcon","I\u2019m just wondering if the some of the headwinds in CRB and IRR don\u2019t really abate, and let\u2019s say that revenue ends up being a little bit lower than the 2.5% in terms of getting to the 2018 target, how much room for adjustment? It seems like you have lots of different levers to pull in order to be able to still get to the 10, 10. Can you just talk about that a little bit?","John Haley","Yeah, I think I will let Roger will probably have some things to add to that, but I think, Mark, if you remember that slide we had from Analyst Day, one of the points of that was to show that there were a number of different levers, that if you grew at 2.5% then you had a 25% tax rate and you reduced 8 million shares you could get the 10, 10. If you grew it 4.5% then you had a 25% tax rate and you only reduced by if you\u2019ve got 2 million or 4 million shares you could still get the 10, 10.","So what we were trying to illustrate is we did have a number of levers to pull. We tended to focus in that one on even at a relatively low growth rate we could still get to 10, 10 if we were buying back enough shares. but in addition to that we could, we didn\u2019t factor in what happens if our tax rate is better than we had suggested, for example, so we have a couple of different levers that we could pull.","Mark Marcon","Great. And then.","John Haley","Roger, do you want to?","Roger Millay","Yeah, just I will just add maybe another element of context, which is look every year one of the things we do, I would say, pretty thoughtfully is step back and say what are our best opportunities? As you said Mark, and I agree and John went through it, we do have a number of levers and we will continue to do that relative to shareholder value in general but then the specific targets that we\u2019ve set out. That\u2019s generally how we meet our commitments is adjusting with the times, finding the levers and executing on them.","Mark Marcon","Great. And then could you talk a little bit about some of the things that you think Todd and Carl will end up doing a little bit differently? I know it\u2019s early, obviously, but just in broad strokes here were some of the reasons behind the changes and some of the different executional elements that might go into reaccelerating growth in those areas.","John Haley","Well, so first of all, when Dominic indicated his intention to leave at the end of the year, we had to find a replacement for running IRR. And I think one of the things that we especially like about Carl, he had run the investment line of business for both Watson Wyatt and Towers Watson as part when he was running that, he was part of a leadership team in that segment. And at the time it included both Risk, Consulting & Software and the Reinsurance business that we had at Towers Watson. So Carl has some background in all three of those areas. I think the background he has in investment will serve him well in understanding the Capital Markets part of the business, also. Carl is one of the smartest people we have in the organization, and I think he will be a quick study on the other parts of the business too. So we liked his background. We like the fact that he has been involved with delivering high revenue growth in the areas he's been in, and he understands the importance of generating profitable revenue growth. So he was I think a very good fit for that.","In terms of CRB and North America, as I mentioned in the script one of the things that I thought we needed more of a perspective on at the operating committee was our brokers. And by moving Todd who has a brokerage background and then putting Joe Gunn in charge of North America, we have increased some of that perspective on the operating committee and I think that will be very helpful. Both Todd and Joe I think are hard charging folks who understand what we need to do to build up the brokerage business in North America. And I think that's going to be one of their key focuses in the short run. And as I said earlier, I do think that this is a business that we probably have over complicated our structure a little bit, and I do think some streamlining is probably called for.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Kai Pan","Good morning. Thank you. On your buybacks $300 million this year plus dividends probably close to $500 million and you have free cash flow generation about $650 million this year. I just wonder going forward was the free cash flow generation will be mostly used for shareholder returns?","Roger Millay","I think that one as we've said before we love to balance those two. We think certainly this year we are leaning to share repurchase. Returning cash to shareholders is very important to us and we think is appropriate at this point. And we are in the process right now of formulating our plans once we are complete with the $300 million. And I think in the short term we will be highlighting where we come out of that.","John Haley","But just as a matter of philosophy I think shareholder returns are what we probably see is the highest priority.","Kai Pan","Good. And then I just have a quick numbers question. On your presentation at Investor Day you mentioned that the integration cost will be about $150 million to $175 million in 2016. I'm assuming that will be mostly to achieve the $100 million to $125 million of cost synergy. Then you have about $100 million each year in 2017 and 2018. I just wonder are those additional restructuring costs and what kind of savings could coming from that?","Roger Millay","So there are various activities and I think we might have referred to this at Investor Day. Some of the actions that you take are short term and, I don't know, low-hanging fruit or whatever but very targeted and happened in the first year. Then some like things that require, let's say, combining systems, so finance and HR systems and the related technology, that's a multiyear project. So the benefits come in gradually and later in the integration period. Something like real estate, as well. While we have overlapping real estate it's best to execute those combinations when leases are closer to co-terminus. And so it's those kind of things that extend into '17 and '18, bigger process and technology changes and the real estate.","Kai Pan","Do you expect to generate additional cost savings over time beyond the $100 million to $125 million outlined.","Roger Millay","The 100 to 125 anticipated all those changes that I referred to.","Kai Pan","Okay. So the total cost is about $375 million, for the saving about $100 million to $125 million?","Roger Millay","Right. That's right.","Kai Pan","That sounds bigger than the normal restructuring cost of about 1.25 times.","Roger Millay","Yes, I mean some of it is, again, because you look at a project like an ERP project. There are some big changes that we're making as part of restructuring. Some of the real estate activities are quite expensive. So it's more than headcount-driven changes. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Brian Meredith","A couple of questions. Roger, I was hoping to focus a little more on the expense side. Do you have an organic expense growth number on a year-over-year basis? If you factor out Gras Savoye what were expenses up on a year-over-year basis?","Roger Millay","Yes, I think it's about -- well, actually I don't have a year-to-date number. But I think for the full year we're anticipating organic expense growth in the neighborhood of the level of organic revenue growth. Pretty close.","Brian Meredith","Pretty close to it. Got you. Then on the OIP program, still on track to achieve the $230 million of cumulative savings in 2016? And then on that, how much do you think is flowing to the bottom line at this point?","Roger Millay","Well, the second question gets a little complicated but relative to all that's going on in the Company. But we are on track for the savings and the savings are realized. There's a very disciplined process to track both the exits as well as then how that relates to the additional folks that are added in Mumbai or elsewhere in the service centers. So those costs are quote, unquote dropping to the bottom line. Of course, as a result of both the shortfall in revenues versus what we expected and the plans that had been built for the year relative to that business momentum, that has certainly challenged our ability to show net margin expansion as a result of the savings that are going on, which is really I wanted to highlight that sequential cost momentum item that I talked about in my script. So while right now you see in the adjusted operating margin a little bit of increase it's not at all what you would expect based on the savings we are seeing in OIP plus merger. But we have been adjusting our expense levels all year as the year went by and we are now starting to see the results of that. In this 2017 planning period we continue to emphasize that, so we have our eye on the prize and we think we are starting to see the kinds of results financially that will lead to margin expansion, but we are not seeing it yet.","Brian Meredith","And the weaker-than-expected organic revenue growth, is it changing any of your thoughts as to how much needs to be reinvested back in the business to get that organic revenue growth going and maybe less falling to the bottom line of the OIP and the integration expenses?","Roger Millay","I will comment on the idea of investments and John may have a comment or two, as well. I think, and it's why we cite the shortfall to revenues. I think there are areas in the Company; I would say specifically the legacy Willis International business where there had been tremendous success I guess over the last few years at least in growing revenues organically. Certainly as they had targeted that and anticipated that it would continue they did have plans of continuing to add resources and invest relative to that momentum. It certainly has halted here this year. So we have been in the process of both pulling back what had been identified let's say as targeted investment initiatives but also pulling back the momentum of cost growth relative to prior organic growth momentum. So it's been a major discussion item. Again, it's a major planning item and we are pushing that hard to make sure that where we are investing it's in places where there's good visibility getting a payback. If there isn't then we are not going to do it.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open, please go ahead.","Elyse Greenspan","First off, is the currency impact that you guys are now, last quarter I think it changed to a $0.14 tailwind for the full year in terms of the EPS impact. What are you now expecting in terms of currency? I see the exchange rates you provided in guidance moved a little bit. And then also what was the currency impact on earnings in the third quarter versus what you are expecting for the fourth quarter?","Roger Millay","I think overall, so year to date the FX impact on EPS is now $0.11. I will say that relative to the $0.14 I don\u2019t think we had all of the hedging impacts in that $0.14. So the $0.11 is a refined number, and there was only a couple of cents in the third quarter.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, so we will see most of the currency benefit at that point.","Roger Millay","Negative, yes, headwind.","John Haley","There was a couple cent headwind in the third quarter, just to be clear.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. And the tailwind will be in the fourth quarter?","Roger Millay","No. I don\u2019t know that we have the guidance in the guidance what the FX impact would be. We can follow up with you on that.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, that would be great. And then just in terms of I guess you guys there was an earlier question in terms of some compensation changes that were variable comps this year given publicly the weaker organic. I mean how are you guys thinking about that in terms of just retention overall? There's been some high-level departures from legacy Willis organization that you guys have seen over the past year. So how are you balancing I guess may be lower comp this year versus your desire to want to retain most of the employees that you have on the platform now versus potentially seeing additional departures of people you might potentially not want to lose?","John Haley","Yeah, I mean, look I think we do have a pay for performance culture and we do pay people for results and I think we want to continue to do that. I think the people who are performing well will get compensated well, so we are not really too worried about that and I think we think we have the right kind of programs in place to incent the right kind of performance.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, that\u2019s great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Hughes with SunTrust. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Mark Hughes","Thank you very much. I think you had mentioned last quarter that the adoption rate for exchanges was accelerating in the middle market, larger companies are a little slow to adopt. Your language at least in terms of the growth you expect 4Q to be a little more moderate. How are you seeing the development of that market now?","John Haley","Yeah, so I don\u2019t think we see the market developing really any differently. I think the point about the quarter four is just that for all of us in the Exchange business quarter four is the quarter where we are all implementing. January 1 is when all the activity occurs, and so we are all focused on implementing and there is not as much effort on the sales then. We will have all of the open enrollment season for Medicare is from October to December. The folks who have are with employers that have a calendar year plan, which is most of them, all of that enrollment occurs during this fourth quarter. So it wasn't reflecting anything different about the market, just saying that most of our attention is on enrollment now.","Mark Hughes","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Josh Shanker","Yeah, thank you for taking my question. I just want to follow-up a little bit on again on the management. When we watched the Analyst Day on 9-30 I sort of assumed that Tim Wright and Dominic Casserley were the authors of the plan that was articulated for the traditional insurance brokerage type segment. Maybe that's an incorrect assumption to have. And given that we've seen 2% to 4% growth among your peers and probably about negative 2% at Willis, maybe the management change makes sense. I'm trying to figure out who's the author of the new strategy and why should we think that's going to work?","John Haley","I think the strategy that we presented at Analyst Day was one that reflected really input from the whole operating committee and where we thought we were going. And I don't think no strategy is ever just one person doing that. So I think there was a group that were focused on that and, frankly, as I said Dominic indicated his intent to leave, and so we did have to find somebody to replace him. The other changes that I made were really more about putting in place what I felt was the team that was best able to execute in 2017 and beyond given the strategy that we had already developed.","Josh Shanker","Did you already know these changes would be made at the Investor Day but it was too early to let us know that?","John Haley","No, if I had known the changes were going to be made I would have made them.","Josh Shanker","Okay. And the 2% organic growth for 2016 implies about 6% in the fourth quarter, without the JLT settlement you are at flat growth through nine months. It seems like a big haul to get 6% in the back half of the year. How confident are you on the 2% number?","Roger Millay","You are saying 6% in the fourth quarter to get that? That's not correct. Remember the 2%, this is total revenue growth so it does include the JLT settlement.","Josh Shanker","Yes, I can go through the math excluding I think you need about 8%, I get flat without JLT maybe 60 bps of growth with the JLT settlement. Maybe my math is wrong but I think it's going to be you are confident on the 2%, I guess?","A - Roger Millay","This is organic constant currency, remember. But, yes, the 2% based on the forecast and, of course, you have the segment guidance as well, so you don't find anything in there that's 6% growth.","John Haley","We are talking about growth for the Company as a whole.","Josh Shanker","Yes, I guess I will run the numbers again. I'm not quite there but that might be my bad math. I apologize.","John Haley","I think we have that right, Josh. But we can follow up with you.","John Haley","I think we are probably going to have to end this now. So thanks very much everyone for joining us this morning. And I look forward to talking with you at our fourth quarter earnings call in February.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Rich Keefe, Director of Investor Relations at Willis Towers Watson. Sir, you may begin.","Rich Keefe","Good morning. Welcome to the Willis Towers Watson earnings call. On the call with me today are John Haley, Willis Towers Watson's Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Burwell, our Chief Financial Officer. Please refer to our website for the press release and supplemental information that we issued earlier today. Today's call is being recorded. Some in the comments in today's call, we constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995.","These forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today and the Company undertakes no obligation to update these statements. For a more detailed discussion of these and other risk factors, investor should review the forward-looking statements section of the earnings press release issued this morning.

For reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures as well as other information regarding these measures, please refer to the most recent earnings release and other materials in the Investor Relations section of the Company's website. After our prepared remarks, we'll open the conference call for your questions.","Now, I'll turn the call over to John Haley.","John Haley","Thanks, Rich, and good morning everyone. Today, we'll review our results for the fourth quarter of 2018 and for the full year, and then we'll provide a brief commentary on the outlook for 2019. Before discussing the 2018 financial results, I'd like to reflect on our journey since the merger. The fourth quarter of 2018 marked the end of Willis Towers Watson integration activities. Over the course for the last 3 years, we faced many challenges and I'm extremely proud of the progress we've made.","Our success is evident in the financial results. We executed on our synergy goals for margin expansion for revenue growth and for lowering tax rate, and we nearly doubled our free cash flow in 2018. In short, we made a commitment to create long-term shareholders value and we delivered. I believe with our continuing focus on servicing clients and strategic investments in innovation, we're well positioned to deliver sustainable growth into the future.","I'm also honored that Willis Towers Watson was recently included on Bloomberg's 2019 Gender Equality Index as it demonstrates our commitment to equality and advancing women into workplace. Gender equality essential at Willis Towers Watson wired commitment to inclusion diversity as we stride to attract retain and develop the very best talent to best serve our clients. This year at the World Economic Forum at Davos, Willis Towers Watson was a co-sponsor of Bloomberg-wide the year ahead Davos even where Julie Gebauer, Head of Human Capital and Benefits spoke about the value of broadening perspective as part of the gender equality conversation.","Participating in the World Economic Forum was an exciting opportunity for us to share our perspective on critical topics like the future of work, inclusion and diversity, climate finance and cyber risk. It's clear that we're entering in area that will revolutionize the way we work and the way we think about inclusiveness. As trusted advisors and thought leaders in our increasingly socially conscious world, we're well positioned to help our clients and colleagues keep pace with the transition.","Now let's turn to our results. Just as a reminder, as of January 1, 2018, we adopted the new accounting standard ASC 606. A detailed prescription of the impact of ASC 606 will be provided in our Form 10-K filings and detailed explanations of how the new standard impacted our performance and the presentation of our financial statements has been provided in our earnings release this morning. I will first report the results using the prior accounting standard excluding the impact of the new accounting standard.","Based on the prior accounting standard without the impact of ASC 606, reported revenue for the fourth quarter was $2.1 billion, up 3% as compared to the prior year fourth quarter and up 5% on a constant currency basis and up 6% on an organic basis. Reported revenue included $49 million of negative currency movement. We experienced growth on an organic basis across all of our segments for the quarter.","Net income was $174 million, down 31% for the fourth quarter as compared to $253 million on net income in the prior year fourth quarter, which included a one-time tax benefit from tax reform. Adjusted EBITDA was $525 million or 24.5% of revenue as compared to the prior year adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $184 million or 23.3% of revenue, representing an 8% increase on an adjusted EBITDA dollar basis and 120 basis points of margin improvement.","For the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $1.29 and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.40. Overall, it was a good quarter. We grew revenue and earnings per share and had adjusted EBITDA margin performance.","Now turning to the results based on ASC 606 or the new accounting standard. Reported revenues for the fourth quarter were $2.4 billion. Net income for the fourth quarter was $383 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $774 million or 32.6% of revenue. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $2.89 and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $4.","Now let's look at each of the segments in more detail. To provide clear comparability with prior periods, all commentary regarding the results of our segments will be based on the prior accounting standard and reflect revenues on a constant currency basis unless specifically stated otherwise. Segment margins are calculated using segment revenues and exclude unallocated corporate costs such as the amortization of intangibles, restructuring costs, and certain transaction and integration expenses resulting for mergers and acquisitions as well as other items which we consider non-core to our operating results.","The segment results include discretionary compensation. For the fourth quarter, total segment revenues grew 5% on both the constant currency basis and on an organic basis. Human Capital and Benefits or HCB had a solid quarter with 4% constant currency in organic growth as compared to the prior year fourth quarter. The solid performance extended across all our businesses in this segment. We had the strongest growth in our health and benefits business with revenue increasing by 7% as compared to the prior year fourth quarter. The growth is primarily a result of solid growth in North America driven by increased advisory work and growth in our specialty products.","In addition, we experienced continued momentum outside North America related to global benefit management appointments as well as increases in local and regional market share. Talent and rewards fourth quarter revenue increased by 7%, as compared to the prior year fourth quarter. The net growth was primarily due to strong market demand for compensation surveys globally and for advisory work in North America, Western Europe and International. As expected, the retirement business experience nominal growth, compared to the prior year fourth quarter. A lower level of de-risking projects like bulk lump sums in North America was more than offset by growth in Great Britain related to more favorable pricing on consulting projects and growth in international from strong project activity in Asia.","Our Technology and Administration Solutions, or TAS revenue grew moderately compared to the prior year fourth quarter with increased revenues in Germany from new client implementations. The operating margin for the HCB segment was 24%, an increase of 3% from the prior year fourth quarter. Revenue growth and discipline expense management contributed to the margin growth. Now turn to the HCB results including the impact of the new revenue standard. The HCB segment had revenues of $843 million and then operating margin of 30%.","Now let's look at Corporate Risk & Broking, or CRB, which had a revenue increase of 5% on both a constant currency in organic basis as compared to the prior year fourth quarter. North America's revenue grew by 7% in the fourth quarter with strong results across all lines of business. International Western Europe and Great Britain and each contributed 4% revenue growth. International continued its momentum, driven primarily by new business wins in Asia and Latin America. Great Britain in Western Europe generated several new business wins in construction, energy and claims management.","CRB revenues were $812 million with an operating margin of 30% as compared to a 27% operating margin in the prior year fourth quarter. The margin expanded due to the top line performance coupled with continued cost management efforts. Now turning to the CRB results including the impacted of new revenue standard. For the quarter CRB had revenues of $816 million and an operating margin of 29%. We continue to be optimistic about the momentum in our CRB business going forward.","Turning to Investment Risk and Reinsurance or IRR, revenue for the fourth quarter increased 5% to $297 million on a constant currency basis and increased 8% on an organic basis as compared to the prior year fourth quarter. Operating margins were negative 1% a slight improvement versus the same period last year. This was driven by revenue growth in the reinsurance, insurance consulting and technology, investment in wholesale businesses which also delivered mid-single digit growth or better.","Reinsurance had strong growth primarily driven by net new business performance in North America, while the insurance consulting and technology growth was driven by technology sales and EMEA and consulting project activity in the Americas. Investment grew due to new client wins and continued growth in delegated investment services. Wholesale growth was driven mainly through the specialty business unit. Over the fourth quarter 2018 margin expanded due to the robust revenue growth for the quarter.","Now turning to the IRR results including the impact of the new revenue standard, IRR had revenues of $280 million and an operating margin of 2%. We continue to feel very positive about the momentum of the IRR business in 2019. Revenues for the BDA segment increased by 8% from the prior year fourth quarter driven by increased enrollments, our individual marketplace revenues increased by 5%, while the remaining businesses in this segment generated 11% growth led by benefits outsourcing. Increased membership and new clients drove the revenue increase and benefits outsourcing while the group marketplace business continue to grow primarily due to new clients and customized active exchange projects.","So let me turn to the 2019 enrollments. As we mentioned in our previous earnings call, enrollment continued to look stronger in the mid-market and large market space. We added about 300,000 lives during the 2019 enrollment period. The individual marketplace exchange enrollment seasonality has been shifting as the business matures. We're seeing enrollment spreads more evenly throughout the year due to off-cycle enrollments in agents and a more modest increase in enrollments during the fall enrollment season. To that end, we expect to enroll another 55,000 to 65,000 retirees during 2019 via off-cycle enrollments and agents.","The BDA Segment had revenues of $209 million with the 28% operating margin up 5% as compared to the prior year fourth quarter. The expansion in margin was a result of the strong revenue growth as well as our ability to continue to scale these businesses. The BDA segment reflecting the new revenue standard had revenue of $390 million and an operating margin of 61%. The primary driver of this difference is due to the effect of the revenue accounting standard and individual marketplace.","These revenues must now be recognized at the date of placement rather than pro rating than starting at their effective date. So under the new standard, the majority of the revenue generated by annual enrollment activity in the fall is now recognized immediately, whereas under the old standard this revenue would have started to be recognized in January 2018 on a pro rata basis throughout the year. So, this change results in higher revenue recognition in the fourth quarter of the calendar year under the new standard.","In summary, I'm very pleased with our progress. We produced strong earnings growth in the fourth quarter, and for the full year, we have strong revenue growth by a meaningful margin expansion and significant adjusted EPS growth all while continuing to invest in our future and return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. I'd like to thank all of our colleagues for their unwavering commitment to delivering outstanding service and also our clients for their continued support at Willis Towers Watson.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Mike.","Mike Burwell","Thanks, John, and good morning to everyone. Thanks to all of you for joining us. I'd like to add my thanks and congratulations to all our colleagues for their efforts and contributions to our strong finish and our overall financial performance in 2018, and thank our clients as well for their continued support. My comments around our 2018 results will discuss our results without the impact of ASC 606 unless otherwise stated in order to assist with comparability over the prior year periods. Now, let's turn to the financial overview.","Let me first discuss income from operations. Income from operations for the fourth quarter was 210 million or 9.8% of revenue, up 163% from the prior year fourth quarter income from operations of 80 million or 3.8% of revenue. Adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter was 390 million or 18.2% of revenue up 5% from a prior year fourth quarter adjusted operating income of 370 million or 17.8% of revenue.","Income from operations for the full year 2018 was 907 million or 10.5% of revenue, up 76% from the same period in the prior year of 516 million or 6.3% of revenue. Adjusted operating income for the full year of 2018 was 1.6 billion or 19.1% of revenue and up 9% as compared to the same period in the prior year in which adjusted operating income was 1.5 billion or 18.4% of revenue.","Now let me turn to EPS or earnings per share. For the fourth quarter of 2018 and '17, our diluted EPS was $1.29 and $1.84 respectively. The year-over-year decline and diluted EPS was due to the inclusion of aforementioned one-time tax benefit in the comparable period, which was incurred in connection with the U.S. tax reform. For the fourth quarter of 2018, our adjusted EPS was up 9% to $2.40 per share, as compared to 2.21 per share in the prior year fourth quarter.","For the full year 2018 and '17, diluted EPS was $5.87 and $4.18, respectively. For a full year 2018, adjusted EPS was about 21% to $10.33 per share versus $8.51 per share and the same period in the prior year. Under the new revenue recognition standard, our diluted EPS was $2.89 for the quarter and $5.27 for the full year 2018. Our adjusted EPS was $4 per share for the quarter and $9.73 for the full year.","Moving to taxes. I'd like to provide you with some additional insight into our U.S. GAAP and adjusted tax rates. Without the impact of ASC 606, the U.S. GAAP tax rate for the fourth quarter was 19.9%, as compared to negative 221.4% for the prior year fourth quarter. As a reminder, with respect to our fourth quarter prior year rate, we had booked at one-time discrete net tax benefit from U.S. tax reform in the prior year, which results in a significantly lower U.S. GAAP tax rate for both Q4 '17 and for the full year 2017.","Our adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was 20.9%, a slight increase from the 20.6% rate in the prior year fourth quarter. For the full year, the U.S. GAAP tax rate was 16.2% for 2018 and the adjusted tax rate was 19.4%, which was slightly lower than our guided adjusted tax rate of 20% 21%.","Moving to the balance sheet, we continue to have a strong financial position. For the full year 2018 without the impact of the new revenue standard, our full year free cash flow was 1.1 billion, an increase of 508 million or 90% compared to the prior year. Including the impact of the revenue standard, our free cash flow was $1 billion, an increase of 81% compared to the same period in the prior year.","Balance sheet position continues to strengthen. During the year, we successfully issued $1 billion in senior notes to help with the efficiency of our capital structure, provide additional financial flexibility. Moreover as a result of our increased profitability our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio decreased to 2.1 times at fiscal year-end 2018 from 2.4 times at the end of the prior year, beginning of the prior year.","In terms of the capital allocation, we repurchased approximately 201 million shares during the fourth quarter and 602 million for the full year since the merger we have repurchased or retired approximately 12.3 million shares and paid approximately $784 million in dividends.","Now that we summarize last year's performance, let's take a look ahead to our guidance for 2019. Having moved pass initial adoption year for the new revenue standard, we will no longer report our financial results based on both the old accounting standard and the ASC 606 accounting standard. Starting in 2019, all our financial results we reported based solely on the ASC 606 standard. Importantly, the 2019 guidance we will provide to you today is based on the ASC 606 rules.","For the Company we expect organic revenue growth of around 4%. Our non-cash pension income which is classified with other income in that line is expected to decline due primarily to decline in returns on planned assets. We provided some further guidance on how to think about other income in that line in our supplemental materials. We're changing our margin guidance to focus on adjusted operating margins so investors can get a better sense of our core margin performance going forward. We expect our full year 2019 adjusted operating income margin to be around 20%.","Pertaining to tax, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be around 22% for fiscal year 2019. Excluding any potential discrete items compared to 19.4 in 2018. This increased stance from change in related effects the tax reform legislation. We continue to evaluate the impact of tax reform on our effective tax rate including the effect of new taxes associated with computations for changes resulting from update interpretations and assumptions issued by the taxing authorities. As a result, the effective tax rate is subject to volatility and will continue to be updated as more analysis and information becomes available. We will continue to look at tax finding strategies which may lower the rate beyond this year's guided rate.","We expect another year of strong free cash flow. We're changing the way we categorize our long term free cash flow growth expectations to indicate a longer term view. In general we expect free cash flow to grow 15% or greater in each year over the next three year period measured from our 605 amounts. And our guidance assumes average currency rates of $1.29 to the pound and $1.14 to the euro. Assuming exchange rates remain at the current level, we will expect FX to be a headwind to adjusted EPS for 2019 by approximately $0.10 per share and we expect the majority of this impact in the first quarter.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share is projected to be in line with the range of $10.60 to $10.85. this guidance includes the impact from expected headwind item to adjusted diluted earnings per share such as currency with the $0.10 reduction, lower non-cash pension income around $0.36 reduction and the higher adjusted tax rate in 2019 of around $0.35 reduction. Excluding these items, our expected adjusted EPS growth for 2019 will be at the double digit adjusted EPS growth rate which we have provided as a long term growth objective.","In summary, we were pleased with our 2018 results and continued momentum in to 2019. There is a lot of opportunity ahead and we remain focused on driving execution.","So before I turn the call back to John, I want to remind you this year, we'll be hosting an Analyst Day in Washington DC on March 22nd, 2019, and we look forward to seeing you there.","John Haley","Okay. Thanks, Mike, and now we'll take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Kai Pan","My first question. Just want to make sure the $60 reduction in other income line for 2019, would that be just one-off as you guys going forward, the level of other income will be lower?","Mike Burwell","Yes, based on '19 that's we think, it's reasonable amount that we would think that would be a similar line item, but that kind of range Kai in terms of thinking about the number going forward.","Kai Pan","And then, John for the organic growth guidance 4%, this year did 5%. Just wonder, if anything sort of in your mind that could be headwind into 2019?","John Haley","Well, I think if you look, I think generally the industry as a whole is projecting growth around 4% and we're saying, we think, we'll grow as fast as our competitors if not faster. That's how we have look 4%. We did very well in 2019 and we expect to -- I mean in 2018, we expect to continue to build on that in 2019, nothing special that we built into that.","Kai Pan","One more, it's just last one a larger picture question. Looking back last three years, you had $10.33 achieved over deliver your 10.10 target. So John looking next 2 years, you've extended your contracts for another 2 years through 2020. There are two part question. Number one is that, what will you be focusing on in the next 2 years? Number two, you have a new stock unit awards, are they tied to specific performance like 10th and targets for the past 2 years?","John Haley","So, let me answer that first -- the second part of the question first. The new stock awards will -- the way we did one-time mega grant of the 3 years was special. And the particular set of metrics we used there was that -- we're focused more on just total shareholder return for the new awards. So over the next 2 years, I think the story of the last 3 years was really bringing the two firms together. We had some synergy goals we wanted to get in terms of revenue. We had some efficiency goals we wanted to get in terms of lowering our overall costs.","We had some tax savings we wanted to get. I think we want to continue to press in all three of those areas. But I think even more what we want to focus on is bringing Willis Towers Watson together and getting the synergies across all of our operations. So as I said, in 2018, we grew as fast as our competitors are a little bit faster when we look on an organic basis against that. And we want to build off of that in 2019 and 2020. I just one of the things that from a financial perspective, one of the main focuses we're going to have is growing our free cash flow. And as Mike referenced in his remarks, we expect that for the short to medium term, we should be able to grow free cash flow by 15% a year. And that's one of the key new metrics we're focusing on.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Greg Peters","I guess, John, just to build on your last answer when you're talking about free cash flow. I was hoping maybe you could spend a minute and sort of give us some of the components that you would expect near term and longer term to drive free cash flow growth because it's clearly growing at a faster cliff than your earnings per share guidance by suggest. And embedded in that, I'm curious if you could give us an update on some of the pieces of the puzzle like DSOs?","John Haley","Well, yes. I think so. First of all, profit is something that we expect to be growing significantly over the years. And one of the things to notice is that, Mike referenced some of the headwind we have from lower pension income though what that means is, we actually are getting more free cash flow as a larger percentage of our profit that we're getting there. So, that's going to be helping us. We have no integration cost going forward. We're going to be focusing on our working capital. And we are -- we successfully lowered our DSOs this year, and we're going to continue to press on that in coming years, Greg.","Greg Peters","And just to build on that answer. Can you talk about the balance between investing in your operations and extracting margin improvement? It seems like many of your peers are talking about investing in things like InsurTech and other initiatives to help drive improved efficiency, and of course that's an upfront expense?","John Haley","Yes. I mean, we've actually referenced this on some of the calls over the last couple of years, but the single largest investments we have as a company are in InsurTech. We're continuing to push on this -- in this area and then others, we have a lot of work we do on that already. We consider ourselves one of the leaders in this area and it's going to continue to be an important part of what we do.","Greg Peters","And my second question and the last question I have is just around the organic revenue guidance. And I was wondering if you could, and I know you don't want to get nail down to specific guidance by segment, but I'm wondering if you could give us a sense or the some sort of feel for how the different segments might perform in this upcoming year?","John Haley","Well, I think one of the things that we feel much more confident in giving some overall guidance for the Company the further you break it down, the more likely it is to be. We just don't have as much visibility into less little. I think we feel pretty good about the guidance at the Company level. And that's why we're trying to stick to that. I would note though that all of our segments grew this year and we expect all of our segments to grow again next year.","Operator","Next question is from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Your line is open.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","I just want a couple of things, I just wanted to jump into, and Mike maybe you can just, give us just a little bit more detail on the pension stuff. I had to jump back and forth on the call, so I might have missed that. But the reason why you have this hit is because lower expected return on assets and that's something that we should expect and just to go forward basis. Is that correct?","Mike Burwell","Well, some of -- no if you look at -- we have obviously -- we have an extra actuary. And in actuarial services that we provide to many times, we obviously provide that to ourselves in terms of going through that determination is no secret in terms of some of the assets performance that happened last year in 2018. And that had a direct impact in terms of what the returns would be for us going forward and in calculating that actual evaluation. So really that's the direct piece of it.","John Haley","Maybe I just make it, maybe just make a couple comments quickly on that, Shlomo. So first of all, markets tanked in December, so we just have a lot less pension assets at the end of December when we do the measurement. Interestingly enough during the same time, you might have thought that the interest rates would be going up, but in fact, they went the longer term rates just a little bit. So, our liabilities increased at the same time that our assets were going down. We are a mark-to-market company. So we don't smooth the assets. So if you look at companies that smooth the asset performance over the years, they can hit a little bit by some of the drop that we experienced in the fourth quarter, but they're offsetting that by maybe some increases from prior year. So, it's not as big a difference, the companies that mark-to-market see bigger differences year-to-year.","Mike Burwell","And the cash implications, this is nominal, it's very small.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","So, it's really a fourth quarter of event that impacted that and we could see that turning around next year this year as well. The same way it went down this year could go up next year.","Mike Burwell","Let me just say, if we have measured the assets at the end of January, we would add a different results.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay, okay. And then on the free cash flow side, did you make the litigation settlement in 2018 or is that still coming in 2019?","Mike Burwell","That's still coming we hope in 2019.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","And just one of the things that I'm looking at just by step back with a lot less integration impact and really, if you go ahead and peel out the fact that the pension stuff is non-cash. Seems to be having a little bit faster free cash flow growth and because the margin is underlying margin is continuing to expand, you're continuing to work on the working capital and went to business know? Without the cash cost from the integration, shouldn't you be getting faster growth in that, certainly in the near-term?","Mike Burwell","Well, I mean, one thing to keep in mind is that we do have, we are expecting to pay the 120 million, as you said in 2019. And so, we're not trying to -- we're not saying adjust for the 120 million. We're saying we'll get 15% minimum.","John Haley","Minimum or plus. Minimum will be the 15% Shlomo.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","So, 15% including the hit of 120 million.","Mike Burwell","Including the hit of 120 million. Yes.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Got it. Got it. And then is there if you could just talk a little holistically, the organic growth in the businesses as you said been basically in line to ahead of peers recently. Is there some any reason to expect any difference going forward? Do you feel comfortable with some of the changes that you need over the last several years in leadership and the trajectory of the brokerage business that you should be able to achieve then on a go forward basis?","John Haley","Yes. I feel great about the -- I feel great about the leadership we have in place from the operating committee on down. I think we have terrific leaders across -- really across all of our segments and geographies. I'm very optimistic about what we can achieve and I think there's -- every year has its own issues that you have to deal with, but frankly in some way some of the hardest things are behind us.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay, great. If I could just squeeze a last one in, just on capital allocation, historically, the legacy Watson Wyatt and then Towers Watson business has always been very -- hit a conservative posture on debt, you wanted a lot of powder dry for acquisitions. Is it the way we should think about it going forward or should we expect the Company might step up some of their share repurchase activity?","John Haley","Well, I think what we would be looking at is share repurchase. We looking at about $800 million or so that we should have available that we could use for acquisitions, if we found some really great acquisitions, we wanted to do. If we didn't do that, we'll repurchase shares.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Baird. Your line is open.","Mark Marcon","I was wondering, if you can just talk about a couple of things. John, you had mentioned, one of the organizational goals on a go-forward basis is this to continue to improve the way that the organization works together. I'm wondering if you can just talk about some of the -- how you're viewing like the internal alignment, the incentives, the culture, what are some of the major goals that you have over the next two years that you would -- that could actually be observable from the outside or that people on the inside should certainly see in terms of a change in terms of the way of operating?","John Haley","So, I think certainly from the inside, we'll see -- we -- as we go to market and this is particularly in the US in talking to some of our -- some of the large companies going to market with our integrated proposition has led to us penetrating, in particular the CRB market in companies that we traditionally have not worked for. I mean, just in the fourth quarter -- in the December November-December timeframe. We had a couple of the large organizations that we won the CRB work for. I think that, that integrated approach-and it couldn't have occurred without both the CRB and some of the other parts of the organization working together.","So, I think we'll start to see that pay off. That will be more visible to people inside, but I think outside, you'll probably see it in continued growth in our large market in CRB, in North America in particular. I think we're increasingly seeing chances to work together between our insurance, consulting, and technology operation and reinsurance and those took off right away. Working together, increasingly we are seeing the tools and analytics that we have available from ICT, we're introducing them into CRB and bringing them together. And in response to an earlier question, I talked about in InsurTech -- a lot of what we do in ICT is really on the InsurTech forefront there and so we expect to see some of that coming in.","Mark Marcon","And then two more questions if I may. Just with regards to the segment growth, you mentioned the overall 4% organic revenue growth, maybe without being very specific about the specific expectations. Could you just talk about rank ordering from strongest to perhaps most modest in terms of what your revenue growth expectations are among the four major segments? And then also where are you investing the most and then the last question is from Mike. Just can you give a little bit more specific in terms of the DSOs and what the goal is there and how we should think about the EBITDA, the free cash flow conversion? Thank you.","John Haley","Okay. Thanks Mark. So, let me start off and say, from the segments I think the earnings growth rate is actually reasonably consistent across -- all of the segments, I think BDA is a segment that we talked about -- we're having the great growth in the new enrollments. But, of course that's also a segment with when you're selling to retirees there there's a mortality element that you have to take into account too, so you lose some of your customers every year. And some of the premiums that we got when we first enrolled people only last for a certain number of years, so they fade off too.","So, my point is I think BDA has been by far the fastest growing of our segments over the last couple of years; we'll see that more in the same pack I think with the rest of them. And at a broad brush, 30,000 foot level, they all look more like -- all look about the same as the Company overall. I think IRRs is the one that probably has the most volatility, within segments, we'll see things like health and benefits, which I think will be very fast growing, but then that could be offset by other parts. So, the 4% is probably not a bad thing to think about for all the segments. In terms of what did we -- excuse me?","Mark Marcon","Which one would you invest in the most?","John Haley","So, yes. So, the ones we're investing in, I think -- we're investing in Health & Benefits that's an area that, as I said is incredibly fast growing. We are investing in IRR and in CRB also. And in lot of ways we're investing in IRR and CRB are through the -- some of the InsurTech or some of the ICT materials that we're doing. The two largest investments that we have in the Company are InsurTech around that Invesco that we announced last year and then also the AMX for the asset management exchange is an area we're investing in.","So, those are some of the areas that we're investing in for big growth. I should also mention though there are areas that are -- that may not have large growth that it still pays for us to invest in to make sure that we can maintain our market share or to make sure that we can improve our efficiency and grow, and so retirement for example, would be a case like that where we continue to invest in that because it's a great business to be in.","Mike Burwell","Great. And then on the DSO question, I mean obviously you saw the improvement in working free cash flow that we commented on in our prepared remarks and we targeted five-day reduction last year and we're looking at similar number to continue to drive that kind of improvement going into this next year. So, as we said, really kind of focused on 15% or better in terms of free cash flow growth and that's what we're really targeting and obviously DSO is a big part of that in terms of really looking at working capital -- overall in working capital management.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Mark Hughes with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Mark Hughes","Yes. Thank you. Good morning. The CRB growth of 7% in North America seems like a very strong number. You had alluded to some new business wins that came through kind of an integrated approach. How much of that 7% would you -- was there any timing benefit there or could you quantify how much might have come through revenue synergies this quarter?","John Haley","No, because we don't actually record them or break them down, so we don't even have that data that we can ascribe we've got this win because of synergies. We've got this win for a different reason. So, some of these -- these just happened to be big name companies, so there is some anecdotal evidence about that. But I would say there wasn't anything special about timing. We had -- I mean, one of the things I'd mention is we had a really good fourth quarter in 2017 and so our growth in this fourth quarter in 2018 was I think all the more impressive because it was off a strong quarter there. But, we had areas like construction, which is a traditional strength of ours that was very strong in the fourth quarter this year, but really, particularly in North America this wasn't across the board -- good result.","Mark Hughes","And then, the share repurchase activity, how should we think about the total share count in 2019? Are you just going to be repurchasing issued shares and so hold steady or you're going to make progress on reducing the share count?","John Haley","I think as I said in response to, I think it was Shlomo's question or Mark's question about the $800 million, we expect to spend about $800 million. If we did no acquisitions, we would use the whole $800 million to repurchase shares that would probably -- that would lower the share count. If we do some acquisitions that could eat into that, so we expect that we would do at least half, if not more of that in a share repurchase though.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Zaremski with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Michael Zaremski","I know there's been a lot of talk on free cash flow, but I apologize I'm going to come back to it again, given the -- I think expectations were for free cash flow to grow by closer to 25%. So, maybe you can kind of talk to the long-term goal of maybe CapEx as a percent of revenues, is that what's keeping free cash flow from growing further because you're looking at making more investments or is it maybe the -- I think you alluded to the interest rates declining at the end of the year and so, it's the pension contribution maybe both? If you can kind of talk to why the gap between free cash flow on operating income levels, this isn't closing as fast as people expected.","John Haley","I don't think we had any guidance of 25% increase in free cash flow.","Michael Zaremski","I just want to get your consensus sorry, on Bloomberg.","John Haley","I don't know. We think 15% per year is a pretty good result. So...","Mike Burwell","In some years it will be much higher, in some years lower and we're excluding the view that there will be that settlement happening in 2019 is most likely -- I mean that, that will happen in 2019 on Stanford litigation that we have outstanding, obviously you see the integration costs go away and on top of that basic so five number and we see free cash flow growing at a minimum of 15%, if not greater, but some years will be higher, some years will be lower and so I think 15% is a pretty good target to have.","Michael Zaremski","Okay, that's fair. My follow-up and last question is when you think about organic growth and margins for 2019, in past quarters, your results have sometimes been a little bit more volatile than peers, I know the new accounting was sometimes tough to digest, so I'm just curious are there any tough comps or nuanced seasonality you think we should be aware of as we tweak our models for 2019?","Mike Burwell","I don't think so. No.","Operator","Our next question is from Joseph Kinar with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Joseph Kinar","So question I guess on going back to free cash flow. Looking at the 15% or more guidance for 2019 in growth, I think you said that you still expect five -- extracting by five days of DSO in 2019, so I think that gets about $100 million, so would the remainder just be to the EBITDA growth, am I thinking about it correctly?","Mike Burwell","I mean, that's -- look at some combination of what -- we did not get into that specific.","John Haley","We haven't broken it down that specifically.","Joseph Kinar","Okay. But it is correct to think of the $100 million roughly of the 15% improvement coming from DSO improvement?","Mike Burwell","Yes. I mean, I think we had a similar kind of target last year and that's where we're putting a similar type of improvement. Last year, I mean, so that's a similar year-on-year kind of improvement and we had five days targeted out.","John Haley","But again, we didn't break it down that specifically.","Joseph Kinar","Okay. And do you think that improving of DSO by five days a year as -- should we expect that to start slowing down in the out years or is that a reasonable number to think about for the foreseeable future?","Mike Burwell","Yes. I still would just come back to that 15%, in terms of target and some combination of, of all those things profits, working capital management, managing -- how we manage overall cash flow. So, I mean, we're targeting 15% and a combination of all those.","Joseph Kinar","Okay.","John Haley","I mean, look, I think we do think we can continue to get DSO improvements in each of the coming years. They may not be as much in one-year as the other. But we are -- we do think eventually it will slow down as we get closer to what our goal is, but we think there is at least several more years of improvement we can get.","Joseph Kinar","Okay. And then on EBITDA, I think in the past you had said that 25.5% was kind before for 2019, but then clearly you've had a little bit of a change in the other income now on the one hand, on the other hand I'm assuming you have a little more clarity on potential other drivers for EBITDA improvement. How should we think of EBITDA, guidance outlook thoughts for 2019?","Mike Burwell","Yes, we're really not giving guidance on EBITDA that's why we thought it was more appropriate to really focus on operating income, which really focuses on the operations overall and then improvement. So you really take out that pension volatility that we had touched on earlier in our comments.","John Haley","But, if you think about that the adjusted operating margin was I think, it was 18.4% in 2017 and 19.1% for this year and we're saying we're going to be close to 20% for next year. So, we're expecting to continue to improve our margins significantly.","Joseph Kinar","Okay. And one last quick one, the $60 million decrease in other income in 2019, that's compared to 2018's $250 million right, not the adjusted $283 million?","Mike Burwell","So just -- can you repeat the question back just to make sure I got it.","Joseph Kinar","Sure. You're talking about a $60 million decrease in other income net in 2019. I just wanted to confirm that, that $60 million decrease is off of other income net of $250 million for full year 2018 not off of the adjusted other income of $283 income?","Mike Burwell","That's correct. You're correct.","Operator","Our next question is from Meyer Shields with KBW. Your line is open.","Meyer Shields","Great, thanks. So one quick modeling question, with regard to unallocated expenses, should the full year 2018 run rate of about $75 million a quarter, is that a good base next year?","Mike Burwell","Yes. I mean, we're really not giving any further guidance on that number. I mean really focused on operating income, in terms of the target number and really focused on those margin improvements that John mentioned earlier there is really the way we're thinking about it.","Meyer Shields","Okay, sure enough. I was hoping you could give us just some update on certainly reinsurance demand, whether we're talking about 1:1 renewals overall whether you're seeing a -- I'm sorry a notable change in demand for reinsurance among seasons?","Mike Burwell","Yes, I mean we have -- we are definitely seeing strong demand for reinsurance. Overall consistent with what we've seen in the marketplace, and so that business has been very strong for us and performed well.","John Haley","Yes. And I think if you look at it, you'll see -- as our competitors are reporting too, I think everybody said reinsurance is stronger than it was -- last year there's some growth in that and we participated in that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Elyse Greenspan","I just have some follow-up questions, I guess mostly related to some of the topics you've addressed on but, are you guys going away from that free cash flow target that was 75% to 80% of adjusted EBITDA. And just looking at it on an annual growth level now or it's still the longer-term target if you continue to grow 15% a year, that you will get to that 75% to 80% level?","John Haley","Yes, I think Elyse the reason we are focusing on the growth so much is a, we think that's probably more helpful to people. The problem with the 75% to 80% is that, it depends on what portion, say things like pension income are of your total income. And so, rather than adjust the target each year as the pension income fluctuates up or down, we just thought we'd focus on the growth, we thought that'd be more meaningful for market participants also.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. And then, in terms of going back, we kind of really adjust the pension income impact, but you guys had pointed to really that 25.5% level, so is the right way to think about it for those of us that were thinking you would get to that EBITDA margin, which I know we're not talking about operating margin in 2019. Is it all that for -- if not for December, and the impact of the markets that the pension income would have gone the other direction and then we would still -- we will be talking about 25.5%. I think some folks are just trying to reconcile comments about the margin improvement that you guys gave last quarter on an EBITDA basis with the guidance laid out today?","John Haley","Yes, I think that's a fair comment. I mean that's a fair conclusion.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. And then on the unallocated expense line, that's pretty variable as well, ticked up in the fourth quarter, if you can just comment on what drove that? And then, in your guidance for 2019, are you assuming unallocated net as kind of flat on a year-over-year basis for every quarter?","Mike Burwell","Yes, I mean what you see in that unallocated line item is corporate costs that aren't allocated back to the business such as Brexit, just would be an example that we saw happen -- and activities happening in the fourth quarter GPD, all kinds of activities that were happening in terms of that improvement. And we're really not giving any guidance Elyse, as it relates to that line item going forward as we're really focused as I say, going forward on operating income and operating income improvement.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, and then my last question on buybacks, so tying together some of the numbers you gave, it seems like there is $800 million in a bucket call for acquisitions\/repurchases. Can you just talk about with your -- where your stock is trading, I would think that you would still want to put more dollars toward repurchase and how you kind of counterbalance that against what return deals might have to hit for you to take that bucket and use it toward M&A as opposed to buybacks?","John Haley","Sure. I mean, look, every time, every time we look at the deal, one of the things we consider is, this is money that we could be using to buyback our own stock and we think our stock is attractively priced for those people buying it.","And so, we think it's a good deal, right now. It's something we know more about. So, when we consider an acquisition, we probably have to have a somewhat higher expected return there, just given that we could go and purchase our own shares. We take that into account every time we look at it, a potential acquisition.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, thank you for the colour.","Operator","And our next question is from Adam Klauber with William Blair. Your line is open.","Adam Klauber","On acquisitions, do you expect to be more aggressive that you have more cash and will there be more bolt-on or would you look at actually new areas to go into?","John Haley","So I think, we would be -- let me answer it this way, historically both Willis and Towers Watson were active in looking at acquisitions and growing that way. And during the last three years, as we've been bringing together three companies Willis and Towers Watson and Gras Savoye, we've rightly had to focus our energies on that integration and not much at all on potential acquisitions. We feel that we're in a really good operating place right now and we can go back to our historical look at acquisitions.","So, the reason I wanted to put it in is I want to be careful when I say we're aggressive. I don't think we're going to be out there and being super aggressive acquirers necessarily. But, we'll certainly be a lot more aggressive than we have been in the last three years and I think it will look like the, the pre-2016. So, that's how we feel about that. We think that there is a number of -- there are areas where there are capabilities that would be hard for us to build on our own and we should be looking for acquisitions there's always things like that we're looking at, but we'd be open to lots of different sized deals.","Adam Klauber","And just one more follow-up, as far as restructuring charges, how much cash went out the door in 2018 and what's your expectation in 2019?","Mike Burwell","Yes, so the cash that went out the door in 2018 was roughly $160 million and 2019 we're expecting zero.","Adam Klauber","Okay. So, that should be a plus free cash rate?","Mike Burwell","Yes. I think, just coming back though as we kind of touched on free cash flow. You got -- we're going to grow it at minimum 15% over the next year. You got -- most likely the settlement of Stanford will happen next year, you'll have that coming back into it. So, you know -- and we're looking at a baseline off the 605 free cash flow number, so that's in terms of thinking about it going forward, so...","Operator","Thank you.","John Haley","Okay. Thanks everyone for joining us this morning and I look forward to seeing all of you in March.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.

Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Willis Towers Watson Earnings Call. On the call today, with me on the call today are John Haley, Willis Towers Watson\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Burwell, our Chief Financial Officer.","Please refer to our website for the press release issued earlier today.

Today, we\u2019ll review our results for the third quarter of 2017 and discuss the outlook for the remainder of 2017. However, before I get to the results this morning, I\u2019d like to acknowledge those who\u2019ve been impacted by any of the recent tragedies that have been experienced around the world. On behalf of all the Willis Towers Watson colleagues, I extend our heartfelt condolences to those who lost loved ones in the hurricanes, flooding, earthquakes, fires, landslides and the horrific events in Las Vegas and New York. Our thoughts are also with those who lost their homes and businesses and continue to deal with these life-changing events. A number of our own colleagues were also impacted by these events. Our thoughts are with them during this time of recovery.","I also want to thank all of our colleagues for their swift action to help our clients before, during and in the aftermath of all of these events, with a special acknowledgment to our brokerage colleagues. Before the storms hit, our brokers were able to run proprietary models, which provided a cone of uncertainty to our clients, so they could focus resources on the locations which were most at risk. We were providing these updates five to six times a day. We contacted our clients with claim and contact data ahead of the storms and for those who were in the vicinity of the wildfires in California. Our forensic teams were out in full force within hours, and many more of our colleagues were called into the field to support them. Not only are our teams working with the carriers to try to expedite claim assessment and payment, but they\u2019re also trying to minimize losses after the fact and get our clients back on their feet as quickly as possible.","One example of this commitment came in the aftermath of Irma. A Willis Towers Watson broker worked with the carrier to track down a generator, so additional damage to a client\u2019s facility could be prevented. Even as many of our own colleagues were impacted by these events and were out of pocket, our commitment to our clients was and remains steadfast. Contingency plans were implemented to ensure our clients in the impacted areas had a point of contact. The collaboration and support among all of our colleagues exemplified Willis Towers Watson values. It\u2019s especially clear that in times like this, the commitment to our clients goes well beyond just securing an insurance policy.","Now I\u2019d like to move on to our third quarter results. Reported revenues for the quarter were $1.9 billion, up 4% as compared to the prior year third quarter and up 4% on both the constant-currency and organic basis. Reported revenues included $12 million of positive currency movement. We observed growth in all of our segments and regions for the quarter. Net loss for the quarter was $54 million, as compared to the prior year third quarter net loss of $31 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was up 17% and was $322 million, or 17.4% of total revenues, as compared to the prior year third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $275 million, or 15.5% of total revenues. For the quarter, diluted loss per share was $0.40 and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.12. Currency fluctuations net of hedging had no impact on the adjusted diluted EPS.","Now let\u2019s look at each of the segments in more detail. As a reminder, beginning in 2017, we made certain changes that affected our segment results. These changes were detailed in the Form 8-K, we filed with the SEC on April 7, 2017. All of the revenue results discussed in the segment detail and guidance reflect commissions and fees constant currency, unless specifically stated otherwise.","Our segment margins are calculated using total segment revenues and are before consideration of unallocated corporate cost, such as amortization of intangibles, restructuring cost and certain transaction and integration expenses, resulting from mergers and acquisition. The segment results include discretionary compensation.","Total segment commissions and fees grew 3% on a constant-currency basis and 4% on an organic basis. Human Capital & Benefits, or HCB, commissions and fees growth was 2% and organic growth was 3%, as compared to the prior year third quarter. Our Technology and Administration Solutions, or TAS, revenues increased by almost 30%. All regions had strong growth, as we continued to implement new clients and provided additional support to existing clients in Great Britain with respect to the legislative changes.","Health and Benefits commissions and fees growth was 2%, contributing to the year-to-date growth of 8%. This quarter\u2019s results were driven by the major increase in new global benefit appointments. North America\u2019s large market also continued to see strong growth in both project work and product sales, and middle market revenues grew modestly. Notably, these results were partially offset, as international revenues decreased due to the sale of our Global Wealth Solutions business.","On an organic basis, international grew by 16%. Talent and Rewards commissions and fees grew 1%, primarily due to strong software sales, increased project work related to corporate transactions and growth in compensation surveys. This growth was somewhat offset by lower demand in the rewards advisory business.","As expected, retirement commissions and fees were down by 2%. The lower demand for Bulk Lump Sum work in North America and a decline in special projects in Western Europe were partially offset by very strong growth in Great Britain. The growth in Great Britain was related to pension legislation and continued demand for derisking services.","International also had strong growth, in large part due to our acquisition of Russell\u2019s actuarial business, earlier this year. The operating margin for the HCB segment was 19%, an increase of 1% from the prior year third quarter. Revenue growth in disciplined expense management contributed to the margin growth. Overall, we continued to have a very positive outlook for the HCB business in 2017.","Now turning to Corporate Risk and Broking, or CRB. Constant currency and organic commissions and fees were up 4% as compared to the prior year third quarter. North America CRB had solid growth of 4%, driven by increased new business and strong retention in all regions. International had 15% growth as a result of increased new recurring business as well as excellent retention driven by Russia, South Africa and Asia, offset by softness in Latin America. Western Europe had solid growth led by Sweden and Benelux. Great Britain commissions and fees declined by about 1%, as a result of declines in transport and a strong comparable from the prior year. Client retention was approximately 92% this quarter.","On a side note, I\u2019d like to say how pleased I am with the progress the management team and all of our colleagues have made over the last few quarters. To see the growth in North America is a very positive sign. Not only do we have the management and regional market structure finalized, but I believe this is a turning point for the segment as exhibited by our results this quarter. The job of our leadership certainly doesn\u2019t end with the restructuring. Moving forward, the business will be managed in a continuous improving environment or what we call business as usual.","The CRB segment had an 8% operating margin, flat to the prior year third quarter. The third quarter margin remained flat despite the revenue shortfall in Great Britain. We\u2019re very pleased with the momentum in our CRB business globally.","Now to Investment, Risk and Reinsurance, or IRR. Constant currency and organic commissions and fees increased 2% as compared to the prior year third quarter. As a reminder, the Reinsurance line of business represents Treaty-based Reinsurance only. The Facultative Reinsurance results are captured in the CRB segment. Insurance, Consulting and Technology, or ICT, formally called Risk, Consulting and Software, lead the growth for the segment as a result of strong software sales, Reinsurance commissions and fees growth was flat as a result of positive timing in previous quarters and continued pricing pressure on renewals. However, overall renewals increased as a result of higher returns on U.S. investment income. Investment commission and fees were flat but revenues increased as a result of increased performance fees.","Wholesale, Securities and Max Matthiessen grew slightly due to an increase in performance fees and new business as well as positive timing on some contracting. Commissions and fees were offset by a decline in the portfolio in underwriting business, driven by a loss of profit commissions following the Atlantic hurricanes, the cancellation of a contract and the divestiture of a number of our small programs in the portfolio.","For the quarter, the Investment, Risk & Reinsurance segment had a 12% operating margin, flat to the prior year third quarter. We continue to feel very positive about the momentum of the IRR business for 2017. Not only is the core business doing well, but we\u2019re excited about some of the innovation taking place. For example -- well, I guess, one prominent example is the development of the Asset Management Exchange, or AMX. This exchange is a more efficient way for institutional investors and investment managers to transact with one another. It offers investors a smarter, easier and less expensive way to access their preferred investment managers by cutting the time needed and the expense occurred in operational tasks, like negotiating contracts, while at the same time, introducing an extra layer of risk monitoring. It also provides many of the same efficiencies for investment managers and it reduces their compliance burden while opening up a marketplace for a potentially new business. AMX is currently available in the UK, in Ireland and Australia and has only been operational for eight months. We already have more than $2 billion of assets on the exchange and are getting great traction in adding both investors and investment managers.","So last, we\u2019ve changed the name of Exchange Solutions to Benefit, Delivery and Administration, or BDA. Commissions and fees for BDA increased by 11% from the prior year third quarter. Driven by increased enrollment at our Individual Marketplace, which was formerly known as the Retiree and Access Exchanges. The Individual Marketplace commissions and fees increased by 9%. The rest of the segment increased by 15%. Increased membership and new clients drove the revenue increase in our Group Marketplace, and that was what was formerly known as the active employee exchange. The Health and Welfare in North America, pension outsourcing business continued to grow, primarily due to new clients and customized Active Exchange projects.","So let me turn to the 2018 enrollments. As we mentioned in our previous earnings calls, we have six large clients with about 150,000 total lives that have committed for the 2018 enrollment period in our Group Marketplace. The mid-market sales season is winding down, and it won\u2019t be finalized really until later this month, but we expect to have enrolled approximately 35,000 lives by the end of December 2017. As we mentioned in our previous call, the Individual Marketplace exchange enrollment process is changing as the business matures. Enrollments will be spread more evenly throughout the year, so that while we may have 70,000 to 80,000 retirees enrolled during 2018, only about 30,000 are scheduled to enroll for January 1, 2018. The BDA segment had a 20% operating margin, as compared to 14% in the prior year third quarter. The Individual Marketplace business was primarily responsible for the increase in margin, as our seasonal staffing models were aligned with the expected pacing of enrollments during the year. While there are elements of this business, which continue to evolve, we like the direction the business is taking and continued to be optimistic about the long-term growth of the BDA business.","So moving on to our merger synergy objectives in the Operational Improvement Program, or OIP. As we\u2019ve discussed in past calls, we surpassed our tax rate objective of obtaining a 25% tax rate by the end of calendar 2017, and we\u2019re on track to achieve the net $125 million in cost synergies when we exit 2018. All savings initiatives will be completed and project management resources and costs will be eliminated as of this December 31, 2017. We expect to meet our savings goals of $95 million, and this is an important driver in achieving our 25% adjusted EBITDA margin.","Our merger objectives also identified three specific areas of revenue synergies: Global Health solutions: the U.S. mid-market exchange; and large market P&C. We\u2019ve already achieved nearly 60% of our three year Global Health solutions synergy sales goals. The average sale size has increased over 2016, and the sales pipeline continues to be quite strong. We\u2019re extremely pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made in this service offering. The mid-market sales exchange process for the January 2018, enrollment implementations is winding down, and unlike the large market sales, we expect to see a decrease in our year-over-year sales. The sales pipeline, that remain strong, but we\u2019ve seen clients delaying decisions, and we think this may be related to the long-running ACA debate. Now the ACA [technical difficulty] impact our clients, but we seem to experience a pause whenever there\u2019s debate around healthcare legislation. We continue to believe their significant potential for the mid-market exchange business and that we continue to be focused on its growth.","Finally turning to the P&C synergies. We\u2019ve won almost 40 assignments in the large market. As discussed in the last earnings call, most of the wins are generating modest revenue, but we have a strong pipeline, are adding key resources and continue to enhance our marketing strategies. Overall, we like the momentum in the large market space.","So I\u2019d like to thank all of our clients for placing their trust in our company to assist them with important risk and human capital issues. I also want to thank our colleagues for their continued client focus, collaboration engagement and to congratulate everyone on a very good quarter.","I\u2019m also pleased to introduce Mike Burwell, our new CFO. For those of you who\u2019ve not seen the press release announcing Mike\u2019s appointment, he has extensive experience in accounting, finance, M&A and organizational transformation. We couldn\u2019t possibly have asked for a better fit for Willis Towers Watson, and I couldn\u2019t be happier to have Mike as part of the team. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike.","Mike Burwell","Thanks, John. Thanks very much for those kind words, and good morning to everyone. I\u2019m very excited to be here as well. I\u2019m looking forward to executing the role of CFO, working with our board, John and the entire leadership team as well as our 41,000 colleagues around the world here at Willis Towers Watson, as we look to deliver 2018 merger objectives and share our long-term vision well beyond next year.","So now for some additional insight into our financial results. Income from operations for the quarter was 41 million, or 2.2% of revenues. The prior year third quarter operating income was 1 million, or 0.1% of total revenues. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was 287 million or 15.5% of total revenues, an increase of 18% over the prior year quarter, adjusted operating income of 243 million or 13.7% of total revenues. The key drivers were strong revenue growth and prudent expense management.","I\u2019ll also like to touch base on taxes. I\u2019ll like to provide you with some additional insight, as it relates to our U.S. GAAP and adjusted tax rates. U.S. GAAP tax rate for the quarter was negative 53%, and the adjusted tax rate was 32.1%. The negative 53% U.S. GAAP tax rate is primarily a result of tax expense associated with the discrete tax item recorded in the third quarter regarding an internal tax restructuring. The adjusted tax rate of 32.1% is a result of our seasonality in our earnings. We continue to reiterate our 2017 adjusted tax rate guidance of 23% to 24% for the entire year. Included in other expense, income line -- on our income statement is $10 million loss on the sale of our Global Wealth Solutions business. This line item also includes the impact of our currency hedging program.","Moving on to our balance sheet. We continue to have a very strong financial position. This quarter, we repurchased approximately $166 million of Willis Towers Watson stock, bringing the total for the year to $462 million. As it was discussed in our Form 10-Q, we also settled the shareholder appraisal lawsuit related to the Willis-Towers merger, this past quarter. As part of the settlement, we paid approximately $211 million to settle the shareholder lawsuit, which resulted in the cancellation of more than 1.4 million shares. This cancellation had the same impact as a buyback and then -- that reduced the number of outstanding shares. As of September 30, 2017, the remaining stock repurchase authority was $671 million. The canceled shares related to litigation are also excluded from the share buyback authority. As you may recall, our expectation was to buy back about $0.5 billion of shares for 2017. Through September 30, we\u2019ve spent $669 million in stock buybacks, which includes the cancellation of shares relating to the settlement on the shareholder litigation.","Free cash flow for the first nine months of 2017 was $317 million, a decrease from $470 million for the same period in the prior year. The year-over-year variance was related to an increase in days sales outstanding, specifically in the southern part of United States; our capital spending cost in the prior year for our increase in integration efforts; the interest charges and cost related to the shareholder appraisal settlement; and the 2017 bonus payments. As we mentioned in our last earnings call, on a year-to-date basis, we paid out full year of bonuses in March 2017, as compared to a partial bonus payments related to the timing of the merger in 2016.","One additional note regarding the shareholder appraisal settlement. If we consider the total settlement of $211 million, which included the $33 million consisting of statutory interest and other charges, we were able to cancel the shares at approximately $150 per share, a discount from the current market pricing. The fourth quarter is generally a seasonally strong free cash generator for us, and we will continue to focus on enhancing free cash flow as we wind down fiscal of 2017.","Now let\u2019s review our guidance for 2017 for Willis Towers Watson. We now expect constant currency revenue growth for 2017 to be around 3%. We continue to expect adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the 23% to 24% range for the entire year. For segment revenues, we continue to expect low single-digit constant currency commissions and fees growth for HCB and CRB. IRR commissions and fees are expected to be in the range of low to mid-single-digit growth. Benefits, Delivery and Administration expects to have commissions and fee growth of approximately 10%.","Before moving on to the rest of the guidance, I\u2019d like to address the potential of pricing increases in the market. We\u2019ll be issuing our Marketplace Realities annual report for North American insurance buyers shortly. This report, which is based on carrier discussions and update loss -- updated loss projections, states that we expect to see rate increases in the property CAT and property CAT with loss products. I\u2019d highlight that the rate increases in a couple of products in an otherwise expansive market is not an indicator of an overall hardening market or that Willis Towers Watson will benefit from these increases in any meaningful way. There are many variables to assess, such as client reactions and carrier competition, to fully understand the impact to our future results.","Now moving on to transaction integration expenses. We had projected integration expenses of approximately $200 million earlier this year. We\u2019re now expecting this to approach $240 million for 2017 due to the $33 million transaction expense incurred related to the shareholder appraisal settlement. We continue to expect the adjusted tax rate to be 23% to 24% for the full year, adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $8.36 to $8.51. Again, annual guidance assumes average currency exchange rates of $1.28 to the pound and $1.13 to the euro. We expect approximately $10 million of expense associated with our currency hedging programs in the fourth quarter. This expense flows through other expense income below the income from operations line. The hedging program excludes the potential impact for balance sheet movements.","Before I turn the call back to John, I\u2019d like to address plans to communicate how the forthcoming revenue recognition standards will impact our results. We anticipate filing an 8-K and hosting a call to review the changes later this year. Consistent with transition requirements, we plan to report our results in parallel with our current methodology and under that the new guidelines, for all 4 quarters of 2018. This will allow the investment community to track changes in the quarter. There\u2019ll be no need to recalibrate our 2018 merger objectives.","Additionally, we\u2019ll be hosting Analyst Day on March 16, 2018. I also look forward to meeting our analysts and investors in the following months.","I\u2019ll turn it back to John.","John Haley","Okay, thanks very much, Mike. And now we\u2019ll take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Greg Peters from Raymond James.","Greg Peters","I wanted to follow up on your comments around the margin improvement -- the operating margin, or lack thereof, of improvement in CRB. As we look forward to future quarters, is there any seasonality around the expected rate of improvement in adjusted EBITDA or operating margins?","John Haley","I don\u2019t know, Greg. We have -- We certainly have seasonality in the revenues overall through the quarters. Seasonality in the margin improvement, I think, is probably a little less pronounced than that. So we\u2019ll be looking to -- in some ways, some of those -- the margin improvements are a lot like the tax rate, where we focus on the annual result as opposed to its distribution among the quarters too much.","Greg Peters","Right. Well, and I -- and I\u2019ve observed, if I just look at the adjusted EBITDA on a year-to-date basis, there\u2019s only a 60 basis point improvement. And I would\u2019ve expected to track a little bit higher than that, but it\u2019s in line with your guidance.","John Haley","Yes.","Greg Peters","Maybe you can came at it from a different way. I know you\u2019ve established 25% adjusted EBITDA margin as, sort of, your longer-term target. And I think some of the integration savings are expected to be fully realized when you exit 2018. So, can you provide us some perspective on that longer-term target? And where you are in that process?","John Haley","Yes. So I think I\u2019ll make a couple comments and Mike may want to weigh in on this too. But -- look, a lot of the -- as you know, we\u2019re winding down OIP now. And we\u2019ve had some of our -- I referenced the $95 million in savings, we expected from OIP -- or the $95 million we spent for some of the savings to come in, and I think we\u2019ll probably get a little less than half of that flowing through to margins. But we see some of that has come in already, but actually a big chunk of that will be coming in, in 2018. So we\u2019ll see some of the savings that\u2019ll continue to come in there. I think overall though, as we look at the -- we\u2019ll come out with our guidance for 2018 on the next call, but there\u2019s nothing that we\u2019ve seen that makes us back off our 25% EBITDA for the next year. Mike, do you want to...","Mike Burwell","Yes, I would just add, John. I mean, if you look at through quarter, you see the reduction in salaries and benefits overall. You see it in terms of other cost reductions, that are happening. Uniquely, it\u2019s offset, obviously, by inflation that\u2019s come into place, but you\u2019re seeing that overall improvement happening. So I think that glide path, there\u2019s nothing there right now that tells us -- that suggests to us that we shouldn\u2019t meet that EBITDA margin of 25% by the end of 2018.","Greg Peters","So that, John, just to clarify, the 25% target was by the end of 2018. It wasn\u2019t for the full year, I believe?","John Haley","That\u2019s correct. Yes.","Mike Burwell","That\u2019s correct.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dave Styblo from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Dave Styblo","Just come back on organic growth, you guys had a strong quarter, 4%. I think, it was better than the 3%, what the industry were looking for. And to come back on the margin, I guess, I would\u2019ve expected margins to be a little bit better and outperform on that side. A couple of the areas I know, Greg was just asking about CRB seemed not to have the uplift that we would\u2019ve thought and the same thing in IRR, where margins were up nicely year-over-year in the first and -- first quarter and second quarter, if you adjust for JLT, but the third quarter margins in IRR were actually down if you back out the $7 million of higher interest and other income. So, just curious to understand again, why we didn\u2019t see more leverage in the business, was there a timing aspect and then as you go forward and realize more of these synergies, should we expect more of that future flow of -- through in the fourth quarter, as you exit the year? Or when you talk about exiting this year, is the impact more as you get into 2018?","Mike Burwell","Yes, I mean, I -- we\u2019re continuing to see the directional improvement happening overall. We definitely see IRR having higher revenues in the first half of the year and in terms of what those numbers actually drive to. And I\u2019ve -- you see pretty good EBITDA growth overall in terms of the numbers themselves. So look, we\u2019d always love more, but we feel pretty good about with the numbers are.","Dave Styblo","Mike, maybe, as you are stepping into the seat, I just -- I\u2019m curious to hear what your mandate is? What are the top three or four priorities that you\u2019re working through? And maybe some early takes of what you\u2019ve observed so far being in the CFO seat.","Mike Burwell","Well, I mean, the mandates aren\u2019t different than the objectives that John has laid out in -- from previously, in terms of execution on that and executing in the CFO role. I\u2019ve been really frankly pleased with the depth and breadth of the people that exist at Willis Towers Watson. The individual leaders of individual business segments are very strong individuals, and my impressions of them and their ability to be able to drive and lead us to the objectives that we\u2019ve put forth, I\u2019ve felt a lot of confidence in them, and I really look forward to working with them. So I\u2019ve been even more pleased then I went through the interview process in terms of interacting with people and what that means. And I think, I\u2019ll go back to what John said at the outset of this call, when he talked about colleagues and what they do for our clients, and how they help and work with each other. I mean, the culture at Willis Towers Watson is one about serving clients, and ultimately, that\u2019s what it\u2019s about and I\u2019ve been truly impressed with how people have serviced and worked with their clients and the various stakeholders that we have overall. So I guess, my initial views, like I am continuing to formulate in terms of what those specifically mean, but I\u2019ve been very impressed that -- I was just starting week four here in terms of being here at Willis Towers Watson.","Dave Styblo","Okay. And then lastly, just on the portfolio itself, it sounds like you guys made a little bit of pruning a couple of divestitures at least. If you go forward, how much more trimming or reshaping of the portfolio do you think you have to go? And as you look forward to M&A opportunities, are there things in the pipeline that look very attractive to you guys? Or do you have more of a bias towards buyback, as you just want to continue to work on integrating the two businesses and not get distracted by another other deal, potentially?","Mike Burwell","Yes, I mean, I think, as we said in the press release, overall, I mean, we\u2019ll continue to look at the portfolio where things -- whether they make the right strategic alignment for us or not. But we don\u2019t see anything big or imminent that\u2019s there in terms of our overall thinking. But we will continue to refine and align our strategies and look at assets that make sense. We\u2019ll equally look at as you\u2019ve seen throughout the year, look at acquisitions where they make sense to be niche businesses and tie back into it. Really, our focus is continue to deliver, what we\u2019ve put forth in our integration efforts and synergies, going forward. So that\u2019s my thoughts, John, anything you\u2019d add to that?","John Haley","No. I think that\u2019s right. I think, look, this has been a relatively complex merger, and this is required all of our time and attention during this first couple of years. We always said that in the longer run, we thought M&A would be a part of it and I think we\u2019re at the point now where we could potentially contemplate some things, but we are still mostly focused on just making this merger as successful as we can. Let me just make a one quick point too, about -- I think, as we talk about the margins, I mean, I think, one of the things we looked at is the 17% increase in EBITDA. So we\u2019re pretty excited about the margins we had overall. There are some things that happened underneath this thing as to how things get allocated. So for example, I think with the aggressive line integration last year, we didn\u2019t allocate a lot of corporate expenses to them, and we had them in other places. This year, we\u2019re allocating corporate expenses to them. So it\u2019s makes the margins is CRB look a little bit worse, but we are really focused on the overall 17% increase in EBITDA. We have a next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Kai Pan","And first, congrats to Mike for the new role. My first question is, sort of, if you\u2019re looking back a year ago where you have your Analyst Day, you layout like three like drivers for your 10-10 target in 2018. How do you feel like a year later, your confidence level in each of those?","John Haley","Yes. So I think, if you look at our EBITDA, the 25%, getting to that by the end of 2018. That\u2019s still something that we are -- that\u2019s just something that we\u2019re continuing to drive towards. And as I said it, that\u2019s not anything that we\u2019ve been backing off there. We talked about share repurchase also, and I think we talked about share repurchase between -- somewhere between 2 million and 8 million, or something like that. So far, we\u2019ve repurchased I think through September 30, 4.8 million -- 4.7 million, 4.8 million, somewhere around there. So we\u2019re well into where we\u2019d intended to be there. We look at the revenue growth, and we were looking at revenue growth figures between -- somewhere between 2.5% and 4.5% or so, or something like that. And we\u2019re now delivering solid margin growth in the 3% to 4% for each quarter. ","So I think, as we look at all of those, we still have work -- we have not yet put together our 2018 guidance on the specific things, but when we look at the different targets we\u2019ve been setting ourselves -- oh, and finally, the other one, of course, was the tax rate, but as we talked about, you\u2019ve already gotten to where we wanted to there. We look at all these things, and we say, we feel some confidence that we can attack these and get to where we want to be.","Kai Pan","Okay, that\u2019s great. My follow-up question is on your free cash flow. I think you\u2019re talking about in the past of getting to that $1.3 billion run rate by the end of 2018. I just wonder, as your free cash will grow, how do you allocate then in term of the buybacks and maybe on the deleverage side or acquisitions and also on the buybacks, as your stock has appreciated quite a bit so far this year? And do you think it\u2019s still attractive return for you guys to continue to the buybacks?","John Haley","Yes, so I think, look we had talked about wanting to maintain a low investor grade rating -- investment grade rating. And so I think, we\u2019ll continue to do that. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see -- we\u2019re not anticipating to do significant deleveraging or anything there. But to keep that -- but to be solidly in that low investment grade rating, that\u2019ll free up a lot of our free cash flow for other purposes. We -- as we said earlier, well, we\u2019ve been looking at potential acquisitions and we\u2019ll continue to do that. When we model it there, we still find our stock to be an attractive use of our cash and buying that back. And so we have to balance all of those. But I wouldn\u2019t -- I think, unless something unusual were to come along, I wouldn\u2019t expect to see any significant decline in our buying back shares, and I think, we\u2019d continue to use most of our free cash flow for that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","John, is there anything that was pulled forward into the third quarter or anything that was unusual in terms of the 4% organic growth? And what I\u2019m driving at over here is the organic -- the growth guidance was nudged up from like 2% to 3% to 3%, but you\u2019ve grown 3% plus, I think, a little bit in the first half of the year, now 4%, and is there any reason, why you shouldn\u2019t be above 3% for the whole year?","John Haley","No, I think, look, we -- Shlomo, we had 3%, I guess, for the whole fourth quarter here, and we did 4% -- we had 2% to 3%, I guess, for the fourth quarter, and we did 4% and we nudged it up to 3%. We\u2019re not trying to fine tune this all that much beyond that, but somewhere around 3%, we think sounds reasonable.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay, that\u2019s fair. And then can you just give us a little bit of a free cash flow walk just talking about some of the, maybe, onetime items in the year to date. I think you talked about the $211 million on the settlement, but are there other thing we should talk about in terms of getting a good baseline in 2018, as we think about the exit 2019 -- excuse me, 2017 as we talk about the exit 2019 target of somewhere around $1.3 billion?","John Haley","Sure, I\u2019ll get a -- I think I\u2019ll turn it over to Mike, Shlomo, to take you through that but actually [best] before I move on to that, I might mention something from your previous question, which triggered a thought that the third quarter of 2017 is an unusual quarter for Willis Towers Watson, in that there\u2019s nothing unusual about it. This is the first time that we don\u2019t have some really big distorting event in either our current quarter or the quarter a year ago or something like that. And so when you asked about things being pulled forward or something, I mean there\u2019s always the little things around the margin. But by and large, it\u2019s a relatively clean quarter, and we couldn\u2019t be happier about that.","Mike Burwell","Yes, and coming back on your free cash flow question, Shlomo, I mean, we still believe there\u2019s nothing that\u2019s changing our mind in terms of looking at the \u201818 target we\u2019re had out there at $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion, free cash looking out through the end of \u201818. If you look specifically at \u201817 or this quarter, what the difference is -- as referenced in my comments, one is, really looking at bonus payments. So this year we had a full year of bonus payments where in the prior year, we only had a partial year of those bonus payments. We did see a DSO rise in the current quarter, and I referenced the southern part of the United States, but as you relate to certain parts of the hurricane and some of those disasters impacted the processing and payment abilities of certain of our clients and customers and stakeholders to get that money in, and we believe that we\u2019ll see that return here in the fourth quarter, and equally we had integration spending happening as a key driver as you see in the numbers for the fourth quarter. So those are their principal things or the primary things that were really driving that change in free cash flow.","Operator","Your next question comes from James Naklicki from Citi.","James Naklicki","Just a follow-up on the last question there. So on the free cash flow, the $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, just to clarify that, is that a 2018 number or is that an exit 2018 number? And then, my second question -- well, I guess, you can answer that one and then we\u2019ll go in the that -- so then I have a follow-up.","Mike Burwell","That there is a 2018 number.","James Naklicki","And looking at the business, you just restructured it. You are our selling new business again. Then I look at the organic growth rates, it\u2019s been 3% to 4% this year. Is that, sort of, what should we -- we should expect from the company in the future, or do you think it could actually improve from there?","Mike Burwell","Yes, I mean I, obviously -- I\u2019m excited about the prospects of what you see happening in the marketplace and with clients or customers, but John, I\u2019ll defer to your thoughts.","John Haley","Yes, I mean, look, I think, if we look at our overall businesses that we\u2019re in, we think that probably about 3% is what the market is growing at. Now, as we go through the different segments and the different lines of business, you can see that they all have their own individual growth rates. But probably about 3% is right for the organization as a whole. We\u2019ve been focused on making sure we\u2019re growing at least as fast as the market, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve accomplished this year. We were slightly ahead, I think, this year with that. But in the long run, we won\u2019t be satisfied with just growing at the market, we want to be growing faster than that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Elyse Greenspan","So my first question, I guess, just a little bit more color on the CRB segment, the 4% growth was a nice pick up in the quarter. Can that level of growth continue from here? I mean, is that what you have embedded in, kind of, your 3% overall outlook, you just mentioned? And included within that question, you alluded to maybe not potentially seeing a benefit in your growth from the improving property and property CAT pricing. And maybe this is a more broader brokerage question as opposed to just CRB, can we get a breakdown of your business mix between commissions and fees just on the brokerage side of the business?","John Haley","Yes. So let\u2019s see, let me deal with the second one first. It\u2019s about 65% is the roughly commissions, right, I think?","Mike Burwell","Yes.","John Haley","That\u2019s not an exact number, Elyse, but it\u2019s roughly right.","Elyse Greenspan","Oh, and then on the...","John Haley","I\u2019m sorry, the first part of the -- the first question was?","Elyse Greenspan","The first question was just in terms of the CRB growth, the 4%?","John Haley","Growth, yes. Yes. Right, I mean, look, I think, I wouldn\u2019t want to take one quarter and say that\u2019s going to be exactly what we\u2019re going to be doing. But we\u2019ve been growing at about 3% or better this whole year, and I think that\u2019s what we think -- that\u2019s what we probably be planning for, for next year. And in the prior question, I said we want to be a company that\u2019s going to be growing above the market in the long run. But I think what we\u2019re focused now is making sure that we are solidly in it, that 3% area, year-after-year, and then we\u2019ll try to move on from that. The third quarter is probably our lowest quarter anyway, so I don\u2019t want read too much into that.","Elyse Greenspan","And then I have a tax question. So you guys alluded to achieving the tax saves associated with the merger. There is, obviously, some upcoming potential changes to the U.S. tax structure. So as the U.S. tax rate goes to 20% and interest deductibility is limited, how do you see that potential changes to the U.S. tax structure impacting Willis Towers Watson\u2019s overall tax rates and kind of the 23% to 24% rate that you guys are running at?","John Haley","Yes. So this is one of these things, Elyse, where the devil really is in the details. So I think, for example, when you say limits on interest deductibility, it depends very much on what those limits are, of how they do it -- as to how it would affect us. Here\u2019s what I think we could tell you, and probably what we would look at as the worst case, if the U.S. went to a 20% rate, and there were severe limits on interest deductibility, it could actually make our tax rate go up 1% or so. That\u2019s if we did nothing and presumably, we would be able to -- our current structures isn\u2019t the best and so we would be able to get back to where we were eventually or maybe even a little better. But if you get to the 20% rate and depending on how some other things are done, some particular details there, we could actually be better off. So we don\u2019t know for right now, we don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be a major impact to us one way or another, and certainly, whatever happens, we\u2019ll have to make sure that we have our taxes structured in the most-efficient tax planning we can.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, great. And then 1 more modeling question if I could ask. At unallocated expense line, there seems to be a lot of volatility on a quarterly basis. I believe earlier, you mentioned bringing some expenses down to the segments this year that maybe was not the case last year. Is that part of what we\u2019re seeing? Also, there was a benefit this Q3 that was higher than last Q3. Just some, kind of, direction of how we could think about modeling that line going forward and what should we expect in the fourth quarter? Does your guidance assume corporate -- if that line would see expenses about in line with last Q4, the 36 million?","John Haley","Okay. I mean, Mike is the expert on the expense line, so Mike I\u2019ll pass it over to you.","Mike Burwell","So the number for this quarter that you\u2019re reading, the 1 million in there is actually a benefit, and the benefit is principally related to bonus payments. So the segments have been charged the bonus amounts, and we have reversed a bit at the topside and, therefore, in the fourth quarter we\u2019ll reallocate that back out to the actual segments themselves. So actually, their margins have been a bit penalized because it hasn\u2019t been allocated fully out to them at this stage but that will get cleaned up. In the fourth quarter, I would expect a fairly small or modest number there on that line item because when we close the books out, everything has been allocated back out. And it\u2019s just a timing issue in terms of how things are actually done from a bookkeeping standpoint.","John Haley","But just to make it 100% clear, the margins at the organization level, at the whole company level are correct. What happens is, and we have some expenses that we don\u2019t -- that are too high for the segments essentially is what happens and to the extent they\u2019re too high, we just do that, we put that in the unallocated bucket and get back to the right ones.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Marcon from Baird. Your line is open.","Mark Marcon","Welcome, Mike. Just look forward to working with you. With regards to what is now called the DBA segment, how should we think about just the underlying savings that are being provided to the clients? Are they still seeing the same, sort of, savings on what was -- what used to be formerly called the Active Exchange? And how are you thinking about the prospects of those savings going forward? And should -- if there are in fact savings, shouldn\u2019t we continue to see growth in that area over time?","John Haley","Yes, I think the answer is that this is still an attractive business for the clients in that regard. We\u2019re seeing -- certainly on the active side we\u2019re seeing at least 5% I think for our clients there. Depending on what their particular configuration is and where they\u2019re coming from, the 5% to 15% is certainly in the range. But we\u2019re seeing at least 5%, so we\u2019re continuing to see larger increases for the retirees. That\u2019s still a very attractive proposition. So all of the financial advantages to -- and there\u2019s nothing that\u2019s happened that\u2019s changed the financial advantages to going to exchanges. And so it\u2019s one of the reasons why we said, despite the natural reticence of people to maybe make moves in the middle of a big debate about ACA or other potential healthcare legislation, we\u2019re pretty excited about the longer-run future of exchanges.","Mark Marcon","Great. And then if I could just get a little bit of clarification in terms of the intent with regards to the -- your question three within the press release, specifically about rate increases within Property & Casualty. Generally speaking, all other things being equal. If we get rate increases, that would typically be better for business, no?","John Haley","Oh, yes. If we get rate increases it would be better for business. I think the caution there is -- let me say this, rate increases will -- are like -- rate increases are in the first blush are likely to increase our commissions and fees. Now one thing that could happen is, of course, sometimes people might buy less insurance or buy less reinsurance if rates are higher, so you have to factor that potential behavior in there. The other thing we were saying is, you have to know which lines of business the rates increases are coming through to understand what the impact is on the company, and we just don\u2019t want to rush to any conclusions about that.","Mark Marcon","Sure. And so you, just to clarify the intent of the comment. It\u2019s basically in order to make sure that people don\u2019t get ahead of themselves but at the end of the day, it\u2019s hard to imagine how this wouldn\u2019t be positive.","John Haley","Well, yes. I mean, yes, yes, Mark, although there\u2019s a -- potentially a lot of capital sitting on the sidelines that -- alternative capital that could flow into the market. And certainly, in 2006, after the big events in 2005, we saw an enormous influx of alternative capital. So I just -- I think anybody can who tells you they know what\u2019s going to happen for sure is that -- the one thing you can be sure is they probably don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jay Cohen from Bank of America.","Jay Cohen","Yes. Most of my questions were answered. Just one follow-up from the Elyse\u2019s question on the unallocated. You kind of explained what happened this quarter, but looking forward, can you give us any guidance, should it be a positive number, a negative number, or should we just assume zero for that line?","John Haley","Yes. I would say that assuming zero, I think the most important thing for this though to recognize is that, if for 1 reason or another, we\u2019ve been accruing expenses inside a segment that is too large or too small, then we\u2019re trying it up, so that we get to the right thing for the organization. And so at the organizational level, it\u2019s -- it doesn\u2019t matter whether we put it in the segments and we have unallocated at 0 or whether we charge it in the segments and then reverse it in unallocated, it -- you\u2019re getting to the right number.","Jay Cohen","That makes sense. Really from a modeling standpoint, it makes sense to put the 0, and if it is different than 0, there\u2019s an offset somewhere else, probably.","John Haley","Exactly.","Mike Burwell","Exactly.","Jay Cohen","That\u2019s great. And then the other question, benefits delivery. The margin there increased pretty significantly, year-over-year. Anything unusual happening in that number or hurting the year-ago quarter?","John Haley","No. I think there\u2019s two aspects to that. And we have always said that when -- in the times when growth slows, then we would see an increase in margins, and so what happens is, we had more folks that we were enrolling January 1 of 2017, than we\u2019re expecting to enroll January 1 of 2018. So that means, we needed more benefits -- benefit colleagues to be taking the phone calls in the last quarter of 2016 than we do the last quarter of 2017. So the expenses are a bit more favorable. In addition, as you may recall, we really beefed up the thing last year to make sure we were addressing some performance issues we had there in terms of handling the rights volume of calls. So we probably had a little bit of an extra spend there, but those two things are doing it. But it\u2019s a natural consequence to that. One of the other things I mentioned in the script was that in 2018, we expect to see a more even distribution. So we\u2019re not seeing as many of the enrollments occurring exactly on January 1, 2018. As we get that distributed throughout the year, it gives us better expense management.","Operator","Your next question comes from Adam Klauber with William Blair.","Adam Klauber","HCB had a good quarter. I think you said Global Wealth -- the sale of Global Wealth and also retirement solutions were drag on that business. What would\u2019ve been organic or underlying growth, excluding those drags for HCB? ","John Haley","Oh boy, I -- do we have that write-off in? Just 1 second.","Adam Klauber","Sure.","John Haley","About 3%.","Adam Klauber","Okay, okay. And I think you mentioned, in that division, the technology delivery did very, very well. Could you go in more detail, what was driving that?","John Haley","Well, we\u2019ve been our -- our TAS is basically -- its benefits, administration, operation and I think we\u2019ve been talking about this for a number of quarters now. We\u2019ve just had a fantastic record of winning there, and the team does a terrific job in servicing their clients and we\u2019ve been -- we\u2019ve just continued to add lots of new clients.","Adam Klauber","So those -- as we think those revenues if you\u2019re adding new clients today, we should see those clients continue to add to revenues next quarter, next quarter, if I am correct, is that right?","John Haley","Yes, that\u2019s correct.","Operator","I would now like to turn the conference back to John Haley.","John Haley","Okay. Thanks very much for joining us today, everyone, and I look forward to talking to you at our fourth quarter earnings call in February.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference.

Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to John Haley.","John Haley","Thank you, Aida, and good morning, everyone. Today, we\u2019ll review our results for the second quarter of 2017 and discuss outlook for the remainder of 2017. Reported revenues for the quarter were $1.95 billion, that\u2019s flat as compared to the prior year second quarter, up 2% on both a constant currency and organic basis. Adjusted revenues for the quarter declined 1% as compared to the prior year second quarter, but were up 1% on both the constant currency and organic basis. Reported and adjusted revenues include $43 million of negative currency movement. As a reminder, adjusted revenues for the second quarter of 2016 include $26 million of revenue, which was not recognized as GAAP revenue due to purchase accounting rules. The second quarter of 2016 was the last quarter for such adjustments.","As a reminder, the $41 million settlement we received from JLT for the Fine Arts and Jewelry business was included in the second quarter 2016 revenues. In the second quarter of 2017, we received $6 million in settlement payments, primarily related to the loss of a team in South Florida.","As we mentioned in the first quarter, revenues were positively impacted due to the timing of the Easter holiday, timing of renewals and work that derived from regulatory changes. Therefore, in reviewing the results, our six month results more accurately reflect the business momentum. For the first half of 2017, reported total revenue growth was 2% as compared to the same period in the prior year, and up 4% on both the constant currency and organic basis. Adjusted revenues for the first half of 2017 increased 1% as compared to the same period in the prior year, up 3% on both a constant currency and organic basis. Adjusted revenues for the first half of a 2016 include $58 million of revenue not recognized due to purchase accounting rules. Reported and adjusted revenues include $93 million of negative currency movement for the first half of the year.","Net income for the quarter was $41 million as compared to the prior year's second quarter net income of $76 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $387 million or 19.8% of revenues as compared to the prior year second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $406 million or 20.6% of adjusted revenues. Net income for the first half of 2017 was $393 million as compared to the same period and the prior year net income of $321 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the first half of 2017 was $1.10 or -- sorry, $1.1 billion or 25.6% of revenues as compared to the first half in the prior year adjusted EBITDA of $1.08 billion or 25.4% of adjusted revenues.","As a reminder, the first quarter is seasonally strong and margin is seasonally lower in subsequent quarters. As expected, the second quarter margin came in softer than the first. In addition to the seasonality, the 2016 JLT settlement negatively impacted margin comparison by 2 percentage points. While the second quarter margin enhancement may be masked somewhat by the JLT settlement, we're very pleased with our efforts this quarter with expense management.","For the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $0.24 and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.45. Currency fluctuations net of hedging had a negative impact of $0.06 on adjusted diluted EPS.","Before moving on to the segment results, I'd like to provide an update on 3 areas of integration: revenue synergies, cost synergies and tax savings. I'll start with revenue synergies. Our merger objective identified 3 specific areas of revenue synergies: global health solutions, the U.S. REIT market exchange and large market P&C. We've already achieved approximately 46% of our 3-year global health solutions synergies sales goal, and the sales pipeline continues to be robust. Integrated global management of employee health benefits brings a clear value-add to our clients, and that is showing through in the results of our sales effort. It's still a bit early to make any conclusions on the mid-market exchange progress as the sales season continues into November. However, we have a strong sales pipeline as we see the interest in the mid-market maintaining the momentum we experienced last year.","Finally, we've won 18 large company P&C broker assignments in the first half of this year. We've been refining our marketing strategy into a more targeted approach and are pleased with the number of wins we've had to date. Our win rates in the large market are somewhat higher than the mid-market, but there are fewer proposals in the large market. While the initial wins are generating modest revenues, we feel positive about the development of key relationships, which we hope to expand on in an effort to help us achieve our long-term growth objectives.","As we mentioned previously, we surpassed our original goal of a 25% adjusted tax rate a full year ahead of schedule. Our 2017 guidance anticipated achieving $30 million in merger-related savings. We continue to feel confident in achieving our 2017 savings objective and the overall savings goal of $125 million as we exit 2018.","Now turning to the Operational Improvement Program or OIP. We continue to anticipate generating an additional $95 million of savings as we exit 2017. Most of the benefits associated with the saving program will impact 2018, and many of these programs are weighted to the second half of 2017. The program remains on track to be completed at the end of 2017. We continue to see progress in driving OIP and merger-related savings to the bottom line, but cost in margin management will remain a priority.","Now let's look at each of the segments in more detail. As a reminder, beginning in 2017, we made certain changes that affected our segment results. These changes were detailed in the Form 8-K we filed with the SEC on April 7, 2017. For the quarter, total segment constant currency commissions and fees grew 2%. Constant currency commissions and fees for Human Capital & Benefits increased 1%; Corporate Risk and Broking increased 1%; Investment, Risk & Reinsurance increased 3%; and Exchange Solutions increased 15%. All of the revenue results discussed in the segment detail and guidance reflect commission and fees constant currency, unless specifically stated otherwise.","So turning to Human Capital & Benefits or HCB. Commissions and fees constant currency growth was 1% and organic growth was flat. For the first half of the year, on an organic basis, HCB commissions and fees growth was 3%. As I mentioned earlier, due to the timing of Easter and early renewals, comparing the first half results year-over-year is a better indicator of business momentum than quarter-over-quarter.","Retirement commissions and fees were down by 2%. Great Britain experienced strong growth this quarter, however, was offset by declines in Western Europe due to the timing of Easter and in North America, as a result of lower demand for both lump-sum projects. The growth in Great Britain was a result of increased actuarial project demand, primarily work relating to legislative changes.","Talent and Rewards commissions and fees were down 1%, primarily due to a decline in new business in North America with an overall increase of commissions and fees in the three other regions. As we discussed in our previous earnings call, the implementation of our new organizational structure and restructuring impeded our market focus at the end of last year. We're still on track to generate growth as the year progresses and have already seen progress in our new business efforts, with steady increases in our pipeline each month.","Health and Benefits have a strong commission and fee growth as a result of increased service to large market clients in North America, implementation and expansion of our global benefit management for multi-national clients and strong client retention in new business outside North America. Notably, timing of renewals in France and Spain created some softness in Western Europe for the quarter, though the year-to-date growth was nearly double-digit.","Technology and Administration Solutions or TAS continue to produce strong results globally as we on boarded new clients in Great Britain and Western Europe and provided additional support to existing clients with respect to the UK legislative changes I mentioned earlier. As a side note, HCB revenues included a $5 million settlement related to the departure of Health and Benefits Brokerage teams. As you may recall, the company recognizes brokerage team settlements as revenues, which are included in adjusted earnings. We continue to have a positive outlook for the HCB business in 2017.","Now, turning to Corporate Risk and Broking or CRB. Constant currency and organic commissions and fees were up 1% as compared to the prior year. For the first half of the year, CRB grew 2%. Commissions and fees growth was led by Great Britain, with wins in transportation, financial lines and natural resources. Western Europe up had solid growth, primarily led by Ireland and Iberia. Additionally, international experienced solid growth in Asia and Latin America, but experienced some softness related to the accelerated timing of policy placements and renewals in the first quarter due to regulatory changes. Commissions and fees declined in North America as a result of several large, onetime projects booked in 2016 as well as unfavorable rate and risk exposure changes.","New business levels continued to grow as expected, and client retention stayed strong. We continue to be optimistic about the momentum in our CRB business going forward as we expected North American revenues to build in the second half of the year.","Now to Investment, Risk & Reinsurance. Constant currency and organic commissions and fees increased 3% as compared to the prior year quarter. As a reminder, the Reinsurance line of business represents premiums based reinsurance only. The facultative reinsurance results are captured in the CRB segment. Reinsurance commissions and fees growth was a result of strong new business in international and favorable timing in specialty and in North America. Wholesale was soft in the second quarter due to the timing of renewals booked in the first quarter, which had been booked in the second quarter in the prior year. For the first half of 2017, wholesale commissions and fees grew by 4%.","Risk Consulting and Software or RCS also experienced strong growth as a result of greater demand for project work in EMEA and software sales. Investment commissions and fees increased as a result of new delegated investment clients and increased performance fees. Max Matthiessen delivered strong growth due to higher performance fees as a result of new business and a more robust European equity market.","As a reminder, we received a onetime $41 million settlement for the fine arts and jewelry business in the second quarter of 2016. As expected, we had a decline in total segment revenues due to this large onetime event. This also enhanced the second quarter 2016 segment margin by 8 percentage points. We continue to feel very positive about the momentum of the IRR business for 2017.","And lastly, Exchange Solutions. Commissions and fees increased by 15% from the prior year. Driven by increased enrollments, our retiree and access exchange revenue increased 14%, and the rest of the segment increased 17%. Increased membership and new clients drove the revenue increase in our active employee exchange. The Health and Welfare in North American Pension Outsourcing business continue to grow, primarily due to new clients and customized active exchange projects. As the active exchange market evolves, we\u2019re seeing the work we do for our clients split between the exchange and the administration teams, as well as all our health and benefits lob.","As large companies make the initial move to exchanges for health benefit delivery, they\u2019re opting for a more customized approach. The benefits administration group is currently more effective at providing this customization, as our outsourcing clients have unique requirements. As we move towards the 2018 enrollment period, it will become increasingly difficult to separate active exchange revenues from administration revenues and H&B revenues as we see these three groups working in collaboration with each other.","Our 2018 active sales pipeline continues to look strong in both the mid-market and large market. As we mentioned in our previous earnings call, we have 6 large clients with about 150,000 total lives that have committed for the 2018 enrollment period and 1 large client committed for the 2019 enrollment period. The mid-market sales season will not be finalized until early November. Our channel brokers are keeping pace with prior year sales. The retiree exchange enrollment process is changing somewhat for 2018. We're seeing enrollments more evenly spread throughout the year, with a slight bump in enrollments in the fall of 2017, and the sales season is continuing as some larger companies are contemplating off-cycle enrollments.","We're also seeing an impact from the current health care debate, and yet there are some clients who have held off this year until there is more clarity. Now while ACA doesn't generally impact Medicare retirees, it has a significant impact on the pre-65 retirees, and many companies are looking for a coordinated solution for both groups. We continue to be optimistic about the long-term growth of this business.","So I'm excited to see the progress we've made in building Willis Towers Watson, not only evidenced by our first half results, but with the commitment of our colleagues as well. We recently received the results of our employee engagement survey, and I was most impressed with a couple of factors. First, the response rate was higher than we'd anticipated. This, alone, highlights to me that we have strong colleague engagement across the globe. Second, we scored very well in the areas that are key to our long-term success, such as positive responses relating to colleagues who are proud to be part of Willis Towers Watson, strong alignment to our values, colleagues who believe in our commitment to inclusion, having an environment where we value differences and colleagues who feel supported by their managers. We've also identified areas that need more focus as we work through our company's evolution and integration, but we now have a clear roadmap to move forward.","I'm extremely proud of our colleagues, all 42,000, who've been instrumental in creating Willis Towers Watson. We've been given a unique opportunity to build an organization which reflects our values and a strong client commitment and also provides distinctive, integrated market-leading solution. The changes we have experienced in the last 18 months have been significant. I believe the financial results for the first half of this year reflect the engagement and commitment of our colleagues. As we move forward through the integration process, we can now shift greater focus to the market and build on the fundamentals of a merger strategy, which we believe will create more value for our clients, colleagues and shareholders. Based on what we've accomplished in the first 18 months, I'm excited as I look forward to the progress we can make together in the next 18 months.","On a bittersweet note, this may be Roger's last conference call. And I say, maybe his last call, as Roger has been very gracious to remain flexible to ensure a smooth transition with a new CFO. Roger joined Watson Wyatt, a $2 billion company, just before the merger of equals that created Towers Watson. He played a key role in shaping that business and in enhancing the financial profile of the company. There were a host of acquisitions and mergers along the way. Perhaps, one of the most significant acquisitions, Extend Health, brought us the advent of the exchange business. Then, about 2 years ago, Roger was asked to take on the challenge of yet another merger of equals with the creation of Willis Towers Watson. As Roger retires from Willis Towers Watson, he leaves behind a $20 billion organization.","We've experienced a great deal of change in Roger's tenure as CFO, but some things have remained rocksteady, such as Roger's pragmatic counsel and his desire to win. I want to thank Roger for his many contributions, guidance and his partnership over the last several years and hope that he and Robin have a long, healthy and rewarding retirement.","Now I'll turn the call over to Roger.","Roger Millay","Well, thanks, John for those very nice, kind words. And good morning to everyone. Before getting to the results, I'd also like to comment on my retirement. I have had some of the best experiences of my career as CFO of Willis Towers Watson. It's really been an honor and a pleasure to work with a group of such bright and innovative people. And more importantly, people with such deep values and strong sense of commitment to their colleagues, clients and value creation. I've truly entered the challenges, the success and, most of all, the journey. Thank you for the opportunity to share in that experience.","As I leave Willis Towers Watson, I feel confident that the team will continue the journey to even greater heights. In addition, I\u2019ve really enjoyed the opportunity to participate in the capital markets and all the back and forth that entails, over time, and the relationships that were built as a result.","Now for our financial results. As a reminder, our segment margins are before consideration of unallocated corporate costs, such as amortization of intangibles, restructuring costs and certain integration expenses resulting from mergers and acquisitions. The segment results include discretionary compensation. Income from operations for the quarter was $124 million or 6.3% of revenues. The prior year second quarter operating income was $136 million or 7.0% of revenues. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $363 million or 18.6% of revenues, an increase over the prior year quarter adjusted operating income of $357 million or 18.1% of adjusted revenues.","The GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 16.8% and the adjusted tax rate was 29.1%. As we discussed last quarter, the first quarter tax rate is generally the lowest of the year. As expected, after reiterating our 2017 tax guidance of 23% to 24% in our last earnings call, we experienced a significant increase in the tax rate for the second quarter. Our first half tax rate is on plan. I would also like to address one point regarding the other expense and income line on our income statement. This quarter we had a $30 million expense on this line versus $6 million of income in Q2 '16. This variance is primarily due to a favorable balance sheet re-measurement in the prior year and greater operational FX hedging cost in 2017.","Before we discuss the segment operating margins, I'd like to remind you that we provided recast segment operating income with the prior periods in the Form 8-K we filed on April 7, 2017. Additionally, our segment margins are calculated using total segment revenues. In Q1, HCB, CRB and IRR all experienced very strong revenue performance, some of which was timing related, and the corresponding increase in operating margin. In Q2, these businesses had dampened margin results due to the Q1 timing factors as well as a very difficult Q2 2016 comparative in the case of IRR. Overall, these businesses continue to perform well in managing cost levels to drive margin enhancement.","For the second quarter, the operating margin for the HCB segment was 17%, flat to the prior year. Despite a drop in reported revenues, margins stayed level due to the restructuring which took place in late 2016 and general expense management. For the first half of 2017, operating margin was 28% as compared to 26% in the prior year. The CRB segment had a 16% operating margin, flat to the prior year. As a result of cost management, the second quarter margin remained flat despite the annual pay increases as of April 1 and planned phase in of expense allocations related to acquisitions.","For the first half in 2017, operating margin was 17% as compared with 16% in the prior year. For the quarter, the IRR segment had a 25% operating margin as compared to a 29% margin in the second quarter of 2016. As a reminder, the $41 million JLT settlement enhanced the IRR segment Q2, 2016 margin by 8 percentage points. Excluding the impact of the settlement, the 2017 margin would have been almost 4 points higher year-over-year. The first half 2017 operating margin was 36% as compared to 35% in the prior year, including the JLT settlement.","The Exchange Solutions segment had a 19% operating margin as compared to 22% in the prior year second quarter. The benefits administration business was primarily responsible for the decline in margin. As we prepare for the 2018 healthcare enrollment season and continue phasing in new clients, compensation expenses ramp up to prepare for the enrollment, and revenues are deferred until projects go live. The first half of 2017 operating margin was 20% as compared to 24% last year. This decline was anticipated as strong growth typically dampens operating margin on a temporary basis.","Moving to the balance sheet, we continue to have a strong financial position. In May, we issued $650 million -- a $650 million seven year note with a coupon of 3.60%. The proceeds were used to reduce the outstanding balance of the current revolving credit facility. Free cash flow for the first half of 2017 was $200 million an expected decrease from $344 million for the first half of the prior year. The decrease was driven by higher capital expenditures, changes in working capital and increased discretionary bonus payments. As a result of the merger, the legacy Towers Watson colleagues experienced a change in fiscal year, which resulted in a partial year payout of bonuses in 2016. We continue to focus on enhancing free cash flow in 2017.","This quarter, we repurchased approximately $140 million of Willis Towers Watson stock, bringing the total for the year to $296 million. As of June 30, 2017, the remaining stock repurchase authority was approximately $837 million.","Now let's review our guidance for 2017. We continue to expect constant currency revenue growth for the year to be in the 2% to 3% range. Constant currency and organic revenue will be closely aligned as we now have a full year comparative results for all of the 2015 acquisitions. This guidance includes the impact of the divestiture of the Charles Monat business, or Global Wealth Solutions, which closed in July.","We expect the adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the 23% to 24% range for the full year. As a reminder, the first quarter margin is seasonally high, and we expect seasonally lower margins as the year progresses. For segment revenues, we continue to expect low single-digit constant currency commissions and fees growth for HCB and CRB. We're increasing the IRR commissions and fees expectation to a range of low to mid-single-digit growth. Exchange Solutions should have commissions and fees growth of approximately 10%, with good growth in the benefits administration and the actives exchange, supplemented by moderated growth in retiree.","Integration costs are expected to approach $200 million for the year. The expected increase in cost related to enhancement of the global benefit solution platform, the cost of shareholder lawsuit related to the merger, and balance sheet provisions related to operational harmonization. We continue to expect the adjusted tax rate to be in the 23% to 24% range. As a reminder, there were some onetime discrete items in 2016 that will not be repeated in 2017. We expect the adjusted tax rate in the second half of the year to be similar to the Q2 '17 adjusted tax rate. In 2016, our discrete item benefits were concentrated in the second half of the year, so the third and fourth quarter tax rates of 2016 should not be considered a good benchmark for the second half of 2017.","Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $8.36 to $8.51. The guidance range has dropped by $0.04 due to the divestiture of the Global Wealth Solutions business, which was sold in July. Annual guidance assumes average currency exchange rates of $1.28 to the pound and $1.13 to the euro. We also expect approximately $20 million to $25 million of expense associated with our FX hedging programs in the second half of the year. This expense flows through other expense and income, below the income from operations line. The hedging program excludes the potential impact for balance sheet movements.","I believe the results for the first half of 2017 indicate the continued progress of our integration efforts and the ability of our colleagues to adapt to change. This is a testament to the strong collaboration of our colleagues and our unrelenting client focus. Every dynamic organization must adapt to ever-changing global markets, political and economic risks, and most importantly, for Willis Towers Watson, our clients' needs. As I've watched the integration progress and our ability to adapt to change becoming stronger and stronger with each quarter, it gives me great confidence in the long-term success of the company. I've been very proud to be part of this unique opportunity, and I wish all of our colleagues the best of luck and much success. And now I'll turn it back to John.","John Haley","Thanks, Roger. And now we'll take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James.","Greg Peters","Good morning. Before I begin with my two questions, congratulations on your retirement, Roger. Certainly enjoyed talking with you through the years.","Roger Millay","Great. Thank, Greg, and have enjoyed working with you as well, certainly.","Greg Peters","Obviously, there's a lot of questions I have around the release. But why don't I zero-in on to, John, in your comments, you mentioned, I think, $94 million, $95 million of OIP savings. Is that what you expect to fall for the bottom line or is that just a general savings? I know, in the past, we've been challenged to figure out how much of that actually falls to the bottom line?","John Haley","Yes. I think that's the amount of gross savings that we expect to come out of OIP, Greg. I think as Roger and I have talked about in the prior calls, one of our big focuses is to make sure that we get the bulk of that dropping to the bottom line. But we don't -- we don't have numbers for that until we get our 2018 guidance.","Roger Millay","Maybe, Greg, just to add to that, because as John alluded to, we're most focused on margins. So as we look at the first half of the year and the enhancement of operating -- adjusted operating margin, that's where we look to see if the savings, both for integration and for OIP, whether they're impacting the company, which is why I spent the time I did going through the first half margins.","John Haley","Yes. I mean, and just to maybe emphasize that, if you look at the first half margins, in HCB, it's up from 26% to 28%; CRB, it's up from 16% to 17%; IRR was up from the 31% to 32% range, without the JLT settlement to 36%; and Exchange Solutions was down a little bit due to growth from 24% to 20%. But we're seeing a lot of these things drop to the bottom line this year already and we expect to see that continue next year. But that's where our push is going to be.","Greg Peters","Right. And then as it relates to the OIP, is there savings that -- are you going to come when some of the reinvestments that were made previously expire and are not remade? Does that make sense to you?","John Haley","Yes, it does. I think -- we haven't actually gone back and examined all of the different reinvestments that were made with some of the OIP things. And so I think I don't want to make a blanket statement about how these things are going to be. I think one of the things that we're very much focused on going forward is making sure that we prioritize and rationalize all of the investments we have within the company. And we're embarking on some new investments today. We're consolidating some old ones and we're eliminating some old ones. And so, we're doing all of that and we expect them all to pay off in the future.","Roger Millay","And I think, also, just in our planning approach last year rather than go back and try and figure out history and make kind of tactical decisions based on what had happened in the past, we think that by putting emphasis, going forward, in the organization on margin enhancement, the prioritization process will naturally come out. If there were investments, two, three years ago that aren\u2019t paying off, that, that\u2019s where people will go to enhance margins. If those investments were working, then they\u2019ll go somewhere else. So, that\u2019s the \u2013 we thought the most productive approach.","Greg Peters","Thanks for that color. Now, my second question was just around tax. It is moving around a little bit and I know you cited two numbers: the 16.8% and the 29.1%. Can you give us some additional color around what\u2019s causing all the movements within the tax rate? And what sort of the long-term targets are?","Roger Millay","Yeah. So maybe, kind of do a macro thing first and then a little bit on the seasonality. So, we continue to view this kind of range that we\u2019ve talked about, 23% to 24% as being the landing point from a run rate, without any discrete items of where Willis Towers Watson began its life, so to speak. And last year, as you know, we came in a bit lower than that because of discrete benefits that we talked about last year and that I talked about in my remarks.","And so we particularly wanted to highlight this quarter that those discrete benefits last year came mostly in the second half of the year. So, when you step back from the tax rate, and if you\u2019d seen last year, without those discrete benefits, the first quarter, we expect going forward will be below mark for the adjusted tax rate. And then quarters two, three, and four will be higher. And it is kind of unfortunate the way the dynamics of the accounting work between the operating results and the adjusting items, but because the adjusting items are in higher tax locations, when you add those back, they add to the tax rate, so that\u2019s what you see between the GAAP rate and the adjusted rate. But also then, in periods of lower operating profitably, you get this big spike, so that\u2019s what you get in quarters two, three and four. So I think that\u2019s going to be the trend, and I think this year, it\u2019s looking like the quarter-to-quarter-to-quarter-to-quarter rates are going to be pretty true to that trend.","Charles Peters","And just on the follow-up on that point. When I think about -- push aside the first quarter estimate or results, when I think about the second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarter, how much variability will we see in the tax rate on a go-forward basis between those 3 quarters?","Roger Millay","So we would expect -- and this is without getting into predicting kind of plus or minus one point, or maybe even plus or minus two points, but the high 20s rate that we came in for the second quarter, we would expect to be in the higher 20s in the third quarter and fourth quarters as well. I mean and if you do the arithmetic for 23% to 24% versus where we are for the first half, that\u2019s what you get as well.","Greg Peters","Perfect. Thank you for your answer.","Roger Millay","Thanks, Greg.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of the Ryan Tunis from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Your line is open","Crystal Lu","This is Crystal Lu, in for Ryan. My first question is on the constant currency growth guidance. I think last quarter, you guided to the high end of the two to three full year revenue growth range. And you said that organic growth was expected to accelerate in the second half of the year. We've now achieved about 3% in the first half, but you still maintain the 2% to 3% guide. Are you no longer expecting that growth acceleration in the second half?","John Haley","No. I don't think -- we weren't saying anything different, I think, than what we've said in the first half of the year. So what we said after the first quarter was we maintained our guidance at 2% to 3%, and I think, then, in a question, somebody asked and we said \"Well, we're more likely to be at the high side of that.\" I think if you asked the question today, I'd say, \"Yes, we're more likely to be at the high side of that.\" We think our outlook is pretty much where it had been. Maybe it's even a little more positive after the whole strong first half. But we don't think there's anything that's calling for us to necessarily raise our guidance now, but we feel very encouraged by the results of the first half.","Crystal Lu","Okay, great. And then also, John, in your comments in the press release, you alluded to reaching the full potential. And we were just wondering if this full potential refers to achieving that $10 EPS 2018 target discussed before at the Investor Day, or it refers to some other metrics of the company?","John Haley","Yes, let me just pull up the press release here. So, I'm sorry, I just had to take a quick look at that to refresh my mind. When I was talking about that, I was actually talking about the much broader thing. And I think, as we talk to our colleagues and to our investors and our analysts, there's 2 things we focus on: one is, some of the short-term commitments that we made, relatively short-term commitments we made when we were trying to do the deal as to what we were going to work on, and those are around the synergies, those are around the -- achieving some of those results. And those have -- those are very important to us. We take commitments we make to our colleagues and to investors seriously, so we want to make sure we live up to them. But frankly, when we think about the vision of what we can create at Willis Towers Watson, and what we can do in the longer run, that's much greater than the short-term commitments, and that's what I was referring to in the press release.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Before I ask my questions, just to make a point of when you went through the litany of things you put Roger through over the last 10 years, you sounded like you just flat-out wore him out.","John Haley","Roger is shaking his head vigorously, yes.","Roger Millay","He's quite the task master, so...","Shlomo Rosenbaum","John, could you just talk a little bit more about the Corporate Risk & Broking. In North America, the commentary was the revenue was flat, you had tough comps year-on-year because of some projects. Could you just talk about, sometimes there's movement between quarters and then, sometimes there's a talk about what does it feel like you're growing at, just in the general sense? Can you make some commentary about that in North America?","John Haley","Yes, so I think, and Roger, you may want to add to this, too, but I think the -- we had a few really large projects that we had worked on last year in 2016 that we knew were not going to be repeating. And, let me just, we had\u2026","Roger Millay","There's some big real estate projects, and particularly, things in the Northeast.","John Haley","Particularly big things in the Northeast. And so in the second quarter of 2016, we had 6 accounts over $500,000 and it was a total revenue of nearly $4.6 million. And we knew that these were big projects that weren't necessarily going repeated, or well just weren't going to repeat. In quarter two, we have two accounts that are $1.8 million there. So there's a bit of a decline there. But if we just step back from those and look at the business overall, I think we're pretty optimistic about the rest of the business and what is going on there. So as I said in the script, we feel pretty good about the momentum in the CRB business going forward and in particular, I called out North America as a place where we expect the revenues to build in the second half of the year.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay. So you feel like you're in an upswing right now in what's it\u2019s called -- in CRB in North America in particular?","John Haley","Yes. I think that -- I do think that we've sort of passed an inflection point. I think 2016 was a tough year, overall, particularly for North America, but I think it's trending up this year. And again, remember, we did, overall CRB, we did grow by 2% for the first half of the year.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Great. And then you made a comment about the settlements, you had a loss in the team in South Florida. Was that a higher wave, a whole team? Where was it exactly? I don't usually hear about this coming out of your company.","John Haley","Yes, it was a whole team in South Florida here, and that was in -- gosh, I want to say the fall, maybe October of last year or something like that.","Roger Millay","And we had talked about that, I think, when people have asked us questions about some of the turnover and things like that. So it's nothing new from what we've talked about.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","But it's healthcare brokerage, it's not insurance brokerage?","Roger Millay","Well, it's a mix, but it was more.","John Haley","I mean, just, Shlomo, just to be clear about that, I think we did talk about that in some of the earnings call because we talked about the fact that we lost the people in that revenue.","Roger Millay","We have talked about that, a lot. Because it's the one area -- it's really the one specific thing that we've identified consistently that was a departure kind of out of the norm.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi. Good morning. My first question is on the margin side. So based on my math to hit the whirlwind or the 22% of your margin target for this year, you probably need to see about 130 basis points of margin improvement in the second half, I calculate around 90 ex-JLT in the first half of these year. So I guess what I'm trying to tie together is what's driving the margin improvement in the second half of the year? And also, what drove the unallocated net, that $9 million benefit that hit margins this quarter?","Roger Millay","Yes, so let me deal with the second one first. So when you look at the unallocated net, we typically will expect that to run at an expense level that's probably more in the range of what you see for the six month period. When you look at those numbers, it is more consistent six month over six month. The reason for the volatility between the first quarter and the second quarter is that we did have some movement between expenses booked at the corporate level in the first quarter that were then pushed out to the business, so released or created income in that non-operating line, and pushed out to the businesses, the segments in the second quarter.","So that\u2019s not a net impact to margins of the company, and something that you generally wouldn\u2019t expect to happen. We just had that movement this period between the first quarter and the second quarters. In terms of overall margins, and maybe just to go back to what we talked about with Greg\u2019s question. So I think the clearest way to look at the margin management success of the company is to look at operating margins. And if you step back from first half operating margins, our operating margin was up some 50 basis points, 60 basis points by itself. But then, if you adjust for the fine arts and jewelry settlement, that will give you another 100 basis points or so, or actually, I think it was up 70 basis points without that. So you have about 170 basis points of operating margin improvement without fine arts and jewelry, which was not operating last year, so you do have to back that out.","So, I think that\u2019s the best indicator of our margin momentum. I think when you look at EBITDA margin, it is complicated this quarter because of this FX related hit that we took for intercompany and balance sheet items which does bounce around, but it\u2019s non-operating in nature. So, I think you have to back that out, and that's why I think operating margin is a clear indicator. So, we think we\u2019re on track. As you've said, we've maintained the guidance. In our plans, we think the second half is achievable, the organization is very focused on it, I think, John talked about some of the segment progress, you can see everybody's focused, I think.","Elyse Greenspan","So just a follow-up to that. So as you think about the second half margin improvement, it seems like depending upon what level of OIP savings do essentially fall to the bottom line, that\u2019s more of a 2018 margin benefit based off of your comments during previously in the call. So I guess, there could be some benefit from merger savings, but you see yourself hitting your full year margin goal just by greater margins throughout all of your segments, is that how you think about it?","Roger Millay","Yeah. I mean, I think it\u2019s the whole company, is in the game. So it\u2019s not just the segments, but it\u2019s also all the functional areas, which you might recall, that\u2019s where a lot of the integration activities are happening. So, it is by creating plans and managing the plans throughout the company to enhance margins. I mean, that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to steadily get there over the next 18 months.","Elyse Greenspan","And then my second question, I just want to follow up on one of the questions earlier on the call. I mean, you guys are leaving the organic growth outlook unchanged, but the half year itself probably seems to be, is at the high end. So, as you look to the pipeline and you get a feel for the business that should be coming over the next quarter, next couple of quarters, I\u2019m just finding, why not just raise the target today to enforce the momentum that you\u2019re seeing, or do you -- is there some timing or shifts that might cause you to come in below that 3% in the second half of the year?","John Haley","No, I mean, look, I think we had a very strong first half. We still feel pretty confident about what we're going to achieve. But I think -- we don't want to keep on, when we do well, raise the target until we make sure at some point, we don't hit it. So I mean, that's just not the game we're interested in playing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon from R. W. Baird.","Q - Mark Marcon","Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. Roger, it's been a pleasure working with you, congratulations and best wishes. Wondering if you can talk a little bit about the Exchange Solutions business? It sounds like it's evolving. How should we think about the margin profile, longer term, within that business as we end up having a bigger merger between what we used to think of as exchange -- pure exchange versus the benefits administration?","Roger Millay","John, you probably have some thoughts on this, maybe I'll start. I mean I don't think there's been any change in how we view where Exchange Solutions should be. They should be at least at the overall average margin targets of the company, if not with growth, leveraging -- it is more of an operating type business than the administration and related exchanges areas, so as scale is built, with the opportunity, at some point, to have above average company margins.","John Haley","Yes. I think that's right, Roger. And look, this is a business that is really in its infancy. And so there's a lot of cross currents that are occurring right now. We feel pretty good about being able to operate in what's a very high-growth business. We feel very good about being -- operate at a reasonable margin now. But we do think that when this builds scale and the market comes down, we are going to have an opportunity to achieve even higher margins.","Mark Marcon","Great. And then with IRR, you took up the guidance for the growth for the year. Can you comment on specific -- the specific areas that you're seeing the improved trends in? And then, separate from that, can you just discuss any sort of very specific timing issues that somebody should consider as it relates to just a very near-term Q3 outlook relative to Q4, if there's any particular items that we should be adjusting or incorporating into our estimates? Thank you.","Roger Millay","Yes, sure, maybe just a comment from me first, and that maybe John will have something to add on. I think when you look across IRR, broadly, as John went through in his script remarks, you're seeing just better performance year-over-year in most of that segment. And reinsurance is performing well, the risk consulting business is performing well, and the investment business is performing well. So taking up the guidance just as a reflection both of first half performance as well as the expectation that trends will be better through the year than they were last year. John?","John Haley","Yes, I think, to your second question, Mark, there's really nothing we see that are big flows between quarter three and quarter four at this time, so nothing to report there.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, please note that this call will be ending at 10:00 o\u2019clock a.m. It\u2019s a hard stop. Your next question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel from Janney.","Bob Glasspiegel","Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. Cash flow, up nicely for six months was down in the second quarter, 41% versus 76% I calculate. I assume the legal settlement a year ago drove that. This is a relatively thin quarter typically for cash flow. Anything big pushes and shoves in the numbers? And where are you on sort of pension cash expenses for the year in your expectations versus last year?","Roger Millay","Yes, so for pension specifically, I think there was roughly $250 million of outflow last year and we think it's going to be a bit below $200 million this year. Overall kind of puts and takes in the first half cash flows, we do have some absorption from working capital in the first half. You see that in the cash flow statement. We have a bid in CapEx, so I think we've talked about this in the past, but you would expect during integration to have a bit of a bump up in capital expenditures as a result of the big IT consolidation projects we have, as well as the big real estate projects, and you're starting to see that more in the first half of this year.","And then, as I mentioned in my remarks, you also have an impact from the bonus payments year-over-year. so a bit more cash going out this year because of the half year only payment to the Legacy Towers Watson folks last year.","Bob Glasspiegel","How much above normal would you say your IT CapEx for restructuring is running?","Roger Millay","So CapEx was $20 million over last year. I mean, I don't know if I should call last year a fairly normal year, but we didn't have a lot because the CapEx projects themselves take a while to -- they tend to be more complex type areas. So that's probably the best benchmark that we have about how much in the first half was above normal.","John Haley","Okay, thanks very much, everyone, for joining us this morning. And I look forward to talking to you at our third quarter earnings call in November.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's conference call.

Today we will review our results for the fourth quarter of 2016 and provide updated guidance for the full year of 2017. We will also provide consolidated full year 2016 and certain pro forma 2015 financial results.","Our segment results are presented based on the updated Willis Towers Watson structure. We provided historical Willis Towers Watson segment information in Form 8-K filed on July 14, 2016.","Now let\u2019s turn to our results which mark the end of our first year as Willis Towers Watson. Reported revenues for the quarter were $1.9 billion flat as compared to pro forma prior year revenues. This includes $74 million of negative currency movement on a pro forma basis.","For the quarter, revenues on an organic basis were up by 1%. Reported revenues for the year were $7.9 billion up 5% as compared to pro forma prior year revenues. Adjusted revenues for the year were $7.9 billion up 6% as compared to pro forma prior year revenues. This includes $202 million of negative currency on a pro forma basis. For the year, organic revenues were up by 2%.","Net income attributable to Willis Towers Watson for the quarter was $34 million as compared to the prior year pro forma net income of $66 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $419 million or 21.7% of revenues, as compared to the prior year pro forma adjusted EBITDA of $406 million, or 21.1% of revenues. We are pleased to see year-over-year margin enhancement, which is consistent with our goal.","Adjusted EBITDA for the year was $1.8 billion, or 22.3% of adjusted revenues, as compared to pro forma adjusted EBITDA for the prior year of $1.7 billion, or 22.5% of adjusted revenues.","For the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $0.25 and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.88. Currency fluctuations net of hedging had a positive impact of $0.19 on adjusted diluted EPS. For the year, diluted earnings per share were $2.26, and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $7.96. Currency fluctuations net of hedging had a positive impact of $0.08 on adjusted diluted EPS.","Before moving on to the segment results, I\u2019d like to highlight the progress made in 2016 and provide an update on three areas of integration, revenue synergies, cost synergies, and tax savings. Reflecting on our first year as Willis Towers Watson, we\u2019ve accomplished a great deal in relatively short amount of time. We\u2019ve developed integrated market offerings for our stated revenue synergies. We\u2019ve also taken steps to enhance our profitability margins with OIP, our business restructuring program and cost synergies.","Finally, we\u2019ve also refined our focus of financial discipline for long-term growth and enhanced our focus on business fundamentals. The impact of the benefits from the revenue synergies and cost programs will grow in 2017, and we feel we\u2019ve made very good progress against all of our objectives.","So let me highlight some of these accomplishments in more detail. I\u2019ll start with the revenue synergies. As I mentioned in the previous earnings call, the 2016 revenue synergies were about 5% to 10% of our stated 2018 revenue synergy targets. So while they are may only a small portion of the overall goal, we\u2019re very pleased with the efforts and achieving and in some cases surpassing our 2016 revenue synergies sale goals.","Our merger objective identified three specific areas of revenue synergies, Global Health Solutions, the U.S. mid-market exchange, and large market property and casualty. Let\u2019s start with Global Health Solutions. During 2016, we won 23 global or regional projects valued at over $18 million, and 120 were smaller single country projects for an additional $5 million.","Turning to the U.S. mid-market exchange synergies, we added about 75,000 employees, which will provide approximately $15 million annually. Lastly, we surpassed the 2016 P&C revenue synergy goal with placements of almost 30 accounts representing eight different industries for approximately $12 million.","On the tax front, we suppressed our original goal of 25% adjusted tax rate, a full year ahead of schedule. The 2016 merger related cost savings guidance was estimated at $20 million of savings in calendar 2016. And I\u2019m pleased to report that we ended the year with almost $40 million of savings.","We feel very confident in meeting our 2018 cost savings objectives of $100 billion to $125 billion. Through the efforts of the operational improvement program or OIP, we saved approximately $89 million during 2016. We anticipate additional savings of $95 million as we exit 2017. The OIP program is expected to be completed at the end of 2017.","In addition to the OIP program, we initiated a business restructuring program during the third quarter of 2016, which was completed in the fourth quarter. The restructuring impacted approximately 450 positions across all segments, which cost approximately $50 million, the majority of this cost was incurred in the fourth quarter. We\u2019re very focused in delivering on our various cost initiatives, the OIP cost related merger synergies and business restructuring to drive improved margins in 2017.","Now, let\u2019s look at each of the segments in more detail. For the quarter, total reportable segment constant currency commissions and fees growth was 3%. Constant currency commissions and fees for Human Capital and Benefits were flat, Corporate Risk and Broking increased 6%, Investment, Risk and Reinsurance decreased 3%, and Exchange Solutions increased 21%. All of the revenue results discussed in the segment detail and guidance reflect commissions and fees constant currency, unless specifically stated otherwise.","Turning to Human Capital and Benefits or HCB. HCB commission and fee growth was flat. On an organic basis commissions and fees decreased 2%. The HCB segment experienced the largest impact of the business restructuring effort. More than 325 positions were eliminated. This restructuring was intended to create better alignment with client expectations and market demand, and also to improve our leverage model.","However, given the size of this initiative in the HCB segment, we experienced more business disruption in this segment than in any of the others. Retirement commissions and fees were down as a result of a decrease in actuarial fees, partly offset by new pension administration client fees, the business restructuring impacted almost 160 positions mainly in Europe and the U.S.","Demand for consulting assignments was down in the Netherlands and we\u2019re in an off cycle period of pension negotiations in the UK, which typically occur every three years. There was also less data related project work associated with bulk lump sums than anticipated. Talent and Rewards commissions and fees were down primarily due to a decline in executive compensation in Reward and Talent and Communication work in North America.","The restructuring impacted over 100 positions in Talent and Rewards. We saw fewer transaction related projects and uncertainty on regulatory and economic conditions in advance of the U.S. November elections. Healthcare consulting continued to see commission and fee growth, primarily as a result of new business one outside of the North American region.","Technology and Administration Solutions or TAS continued to produce strong results due to the new clients. We continue to have a positive outlook for the HCB business in 2017 and expect momentum to build during the year.","Turning to Corporate Risk and Broking or CRV; commissions and fees grew 6% from the prior year, as a result of the Gras Savoye acquisition. On an organic basis, commissions and fees were flat. Revenue increased in all regions except for North America. Great Britain\u2019s revenue increased due to growth in construction, retail and aerospace; Western Europe grew as a result of Gras Savoye in the Affinity business in Northern Europe.","International revenues increased as a result of Gras Savoye. A slight rebound in the Venezuela and Brazil P&C businesses was offset by continued softness in Asia and Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa.","Revenue declined in North America as a result of less new business. We expect the general pricing trends to continue into 2017, but we also expect that we will gain momentum as we move into the second half of the calendar year.","Now to Investment, Risk and Reinsurance; commissions and fees were down by 3% for the quarter. Organic commissions and fees declined 3%, primarily due to a decline in reinsurance and portfolio and underwriting services. The reinsurance line of business represents tree based reinsurance only. The Facultative Reinsurance results are captured in the CRB segment.","North America reinsurance and specialty revenue growth was more than offset by revenue declines in the international region and in portfolio and underwriting services due to weakness in underlying premiums and profit sharing programs and certain contracts, as well as rate competition. The fourth quarter is seasonally the softest quarter of the calendar year for IRR.","We continue to see wholesale delivering solid results from Miller. Investment experience growth as a result of increased performance fees in the delegated investment services business. We\u2019re targeting growth for the IRR business in 2017. While the overall environment may not be changing dramatically, prior year comparables or soft and the sales pipeline is more robust in certain lines of business.","Lastly, Exchange Solutions finished up the year with another outstanding quarter with commissions and fees of $174 million, an increase of 21%. Driven by record enrollments, our Retiree and Access Exchange revenues increased 34%, and the rest of the segment increased 9%.","Increased membership in new clients drove the revenue increases. Our health and welfare and North American pension outsourcing business is continue to grow primarily as a result of the new business one over the last two years, which added almost 400,000 lives. We had a very successful exchange enrollment season.","As a reminder, revenues are generally recognized as the healthcare plans become effective, which is January first for most of our enrolments. Revenues are recognized on a prorated basis through the calendar year. We enrolled approximately 110,000 retirees and more than 250,000 total lives on the active exchange, our biggest active enrolment ever. Approximately 65% of the active enrolments run the liaison platform and the balance were enrolled on our large company platform.","We continue to find that first year savings are between 5% and 15%. Now most of our clients\u2019 targeted savings of 5% to 8% as they custom configure their plan design. That equates to a first year savings of approximately $500 per employee.","Our 2017 sales pipeline continues to look strong, especially in the mid-market. Large companies continue to be more deliberate in their decision making process, but we have four large clients that have already committed for the 2018 enrollment period. We expect the mid-market to continue adopt at a faster pace than the large companies. We anticipate the revenue growth to slow a little bit in 2017, but continue to feel good about the momentum of this business in the long-term.","Perhaps, one of the most important developments of 2016 was confirmation of the merger rationale. While the 2016 revenue performance may not fully reflect our integration in sales efforts the commitment I see from our colleagues throughout the organization and the steps we\u2019ve taken to build the framework for long-term success gives me great confidence in achieving our merger objectives. We still have a lot of hard work ahead of us, but the momentum continues to build.","Most important, we have to keep focusing on our clients carry forward the financial disciplines initiated in 2016 and continue to work collaboratively as we build and improve our go-to-market strategies. I\u2019d like to conclude my comments today by thanking all of our colleagues for their hard work over this last year. I\u2019m looking forward to reporting on our future success.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Roger.","Roger Millay","Thanks, John, and good morning everyone. I\u2019d like to add my thanks to our colleagues around the globe for all their efforts during 2016. As we take a step back and consider the progress we\u2019ve made in just 12 months, bringing together 40,000 colleagues from three legacy companies in over 140 countries. It\u2019s really quite an accomplishment. While we still have a couple of years to complete our integration, the actions required in the first year of building a new organization and culture are the hardest and most sensitive.","There\u2019s simply a lot of change to absorb. It took a lot of collaboration and commitment to get us where we are today, and as we turned into our second year, I saw the necessary foundation for ultimate success building in the right direction.","Now for the financial results; as a reminder our segment margins are before consideration of unallocated corporate costs such as amortization of intangibles, restructuring costs, and certain integration expenses resulting from mergers and acquisitions. The segment results include discretionary compensation. Income from operations for the quarter was $88 million, or 4.6% of revenues.","The prior year fourth quarter pro forma operating income was $131 million, or 6.8% of pro forma revenues. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $374 million or 19.4% of revenues and the prior year quarter pro forma adjusted operating income was $377 million or 19.6% of pro forma revenues.","As we highlighted earlier, revenue pressure and seasonality related to Gras Savoye impacted the fourth quarter margin. Income from operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $551 million, or 7% of revenues. The prior year pro forma operating income was $765 million, or 10.2% of revenues.","Adjusted operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016, was $1.6 billion or 20.4% of adjusted revenues and the prior year pro forma adjusted operating income was $1.5 billion, or 20.2% of pro forma revenues. The GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 3% and the adjusted tax rate was 19%. For 2016 the GAAP tax rate was 3% and the adjusted tax rate was 21%.","Before we discuss the segment operating results, I\u2019d like to remind you that we provided recast segment operating income for the prior periods in the Form 8-K we filed on July 14, 2016.","Additionally, our segment margins are calculated using total segment revenues. For the fourth quarter, the operating margin for the Human Capital and Benefits segment or HCB was 20% as compared to pro forma 21% in 2015. As expected, the 2016 margin trended lower due to the Gras Savoye margin being lower than the Company average. Revenue performance also impacted margin.","For the year ended December 31, 2016, the HCB segment operating margin was 21% as compared to pro forma 22% in 2015. For the fourth quarter, the CRB business or Corporate Risk and Broking had a 32% operating margin as compared to a pro forma 33% in the prior year fourth quarter.","Western Europe, as a result of Gras Savoye seasonality and lower margin profile, drove the margin down. Operating margin was 21% for both the year ended December 31, 2016, and pro forma 2015. For the quarter, the investment risk and reinsurance segment or IRR had a 1% operating margin as compared to pro forma negative 3% in the prior year fourth quarter.","The margin improvement was from investment, RCS and wholesale. IRR experiences a seasonally low operating margin in the fourth quarter primarily driven by the timing of revenue in reinsurance. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the IRR segment operating margin inclusive of the JLT legal settlement was 21% as compared to pro forma 19% in 2015.","For the quarter, the exchange solutions segment had an 8% operating margin as compared to a pro forma 10% margin in the prior year fourth quarter. TAS and Retiree and Access Exchanges led the segment with 23% and 18% operating margins respectively as we continued to invest in the active exchange. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Exchange Solutions segment operating margin was 16% as compared to 11% pro forma in the prior year.","Moving to the balance sheet, we continue to have a strong financial position. Free cash flow was $288 million in the fourth quarter and $745 million for the year ended 2016. This was almost $100 million greater than our original expectation as noted during our Analyst Day. We continue to focus on enhancing free cash flow in 2017.","This stronger free cash flow provided the capital to repurchase approximately $400 million of Willis Towers Watson stock in 2016 rather than the previously announced $300 million we had initially targeted. In November we increased our share repurchase plan by $1 billion and anticipate a total repurchase of about $0.5 billion for 2017.","On February 2017, the Willis Towers Watson Board of Directors approved a 10% increase to the regular quarterly cash dividend which will now be $0.53 per common share per quarter. This is targeted to maintain the payout ratio of approximately 25%.","Now let\u2019s review our guidance for fiscal year 2017. In fiscal 2017 we are expecting constant currency revenue growth to be in the 2% to 3% range. Constant currency and organic revenue will be aligned as we now have a full year of results for all of the 2015 acquisitions.","We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of 23% to 24%. We continue to drive our business improvement and cost-reduction programs and expect to demonstrate clear momentum in 2017 toward our goal of a 25% adjusted EBITDA margin. For segment revenues, we are expecting low single-digit constant currency commissions and fees growth for HCB, CRB and IRR.","As we put a year of integration and restructuring focus behind us, we expect to see gradual growth enhancement in these businesses as the year goes on. Exchange Solutions revenue growth is expected to slow to around 10% due to stabilization of the retiree enrollments.","As we\u2019ve mentioned previously, the retiree enrollments will be episodic from year-to-year depending on the timing of large clients joining the exchange. While we continue to expect the actives exchange growth to be very strong, the enrollment base is still relatively small.","As of 2017, we\u2019re aligning the Max Matisson business from HCB to IRR and the fine arts and jewelry team from IRR to CRB. In addition, we are harmonizing corporate expense allocation methodologies. The changes made for 2017 will have an impact on year-over-year segment margins.","Given these changes, we will not be providing segment margin guidance in 2017. You will continue to see the segment margin results each quarter and we plan to file a year-over-year comparison prior to our first quarter earnings.","The 2017 adjusted tax rate is expected to be 23% to 24%. The tax rate is expected to increase from 2016 due to one-time discrete items which will not repeat in 2017. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $8.40 to $8.55. Guidance assumes average currency exchange rates of $1.25 to pound and $1.08 to the euro.","We expect to generate approximately $30 million in merger cost synergies in 2017 and incur approximately $180 million of expense for integration related items. We are making good progress on the cost synergies and expect to achieve the high end of our 2018 savings goal of $100 million to $125 million.","Integration expenses and restructuring costs will continue to be adjusted from our GAAP measures. As John mentioned earlier, we expect to save approximately $95 million from OIP in 2017, the final year of the program, and plan to spend approximately $140 million. The OIP restructuring will continue to be adjusted from GAAP measures.","Finally depreciation is expected to be approximately $175 million to $195 million and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $250 million. As we have been discussing, 2016 was a year of building a new organization; new way to address our clients\u2019 needs; and developing strong focus on financial management. I think we\u2019ve succeeded in building this foundation and I expect to see our financial performance momentum grow in 2017.","Now I\u2019ll hand it back to John.","John Haley","Thanks, Roger. And now we\u2019ll take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Ryan Tunis","Hey thanks. I guess, just following up on the segment outlooks for brokerage and for HRB next year, it sounded like low single-digit organic expense growth which implies a decent amount of acceleration from what we\u2019ve seen year-to-date especially on the brokerage side.","I guess, looking back at 2016, you talked a little bit about the revenue synergies. How much do you think revenue dissynergies may have impacted that comp? Because I\u2019m trying to bridge from where we\u2019ve been in corporate risk and broking in IRR which has been zero to subzero to getting that to low single digits. Thanks.","John Haley","Okay, Roger may want to add to this, but I would say I think revenue synergies did not play any significant of fact that all. Frankly, we didn\u2019t really see any revenue dissynergies really across the Company. I think the reason for the revenue growth being off in 2016 was really reflected in a distraction that we had that took people \u2013 had them more internally focused than it should have been, didn\u2019t have the best go-to-market operation that we could have had and it distracted from our new business efforts. But I don\u2019t think revenue dissynergies were anything that really added to that.","Ryan Tunis","Okay and then my follow-up, I guess, is just on thinking about 2% to 3% organic growth this year, and I guess, looking out to 2018 thinking about the $10 number; do you think you need acceleration off the 2% to 3% in 2018 to be able to hit that or are we still thinking that capital management and organic expense management can produce those type of results even if we are still sort of in a 2% to 3% organic growth environment? Thanks.","John Haley","Yes. So I think I would say this with regard to the $10 number, when you think about the various components that we had to get there. One of them was certainly revenue growth. Really we thought 3% plus was we needed to get to that to be achieving $10. The other items were our tax rate getting to 25% or better and I think we\u2019ve got a check next to that. Our share repurchase, actually, if you think about last year, in the beginning of the year we said we were going to try to be \u2013 purchase $200 million worth of shares last year.","And then midway through, we said we\u2019d like to get to $300 million; we ended up purchasing $400 million. So we feel good about what we were able to accomplish there. As Roger said, we expect to buy back at least $500 million worth of shares this year, so that\u2019s in place as to where we want to be; and we will continue to buy shares back in 2018 also probably at a higher clip than we have in 2017.","And then we want to get the expense savings and the margin enhancement; and we referenced a couple of times some of the OIP savings that we expect to get coming out of 2017. So we\u2019re on board for almost all the things. We just see we have to get the revenue growth up a little bit but we are focused right now on getting to the 2% to 3% level for 2017 and we think that will give us a good base to improve that going into 2018.","Ryan Tunis","Okay and then just lastly, I guess, in the retirement business, if you could just help us understand the macro sensitivity of that just given the move higher run rates, the new administration. It sounds like a lot of the slowdown there was less actuarial work, lump sum, but it sounded like it was maybe being replaced with pension administration. How should we think about that if interest rates are sort of where they are, continuing to rise? Is that an area where you are going to continue to see kind of sluggish organic growth? Thanks.","John Haley","Yes, I think overall that\u2019s right. We\u2019ve had some of our competitors have reported and when you look at our retirement revenue growth, it\u2019s almost identical to there\u2019s so maybe that\u2019s not so surprising. Now on top of it though, we had the restructuring program which was largely focused on retirement. When I was younger, I used to think you could put these restructuring programs in place and not lose any revenue in the short run, but I\u2019ve learned from experience that is not the case.","So the fact that we had retirement slow down a little bit was not a particular surprise here. That happened but we think \u2013 we love the restructuring we did. We think it positions us extraordinarily well for the future, so that was clearly the right thing to do. So that hurt us a little bit in the fourth quarter, but as I said, even then we still came out right at the same level as our competitors; so we feel good about this going into 2017. When we look at the outlook for 2017, I think the thing that we would most focus on is this is probably likely \u2013 it\u2019s never, you can never tell at this stage in the year.","But this is probably likely to be a slower growth for bulk lump sum work \u2013 a real slowdown in bulk lump sum work compared to other years. Now bulk lump sum work, it varies. I mean, I think 2013 it was $28 million; 2014, I think it was over $75 million, I think it was around $77 million or something; it\u2019s been just under $50 million 2015 and 2016. We think it\u2019s going to go down substantially in 2017. But bulk lump sum is granular; one of the reasons we think it will probably go down is because we are likely to see several rate increases during the year.","It\u2019s not the absolute level; it\u2019s the arbitrage between what you can pay out the lump sum at and what you are recording it at as the accounting expense. So 2017 might be a low year for bulk lump sums; in the end though, that may just mean that there is more work in 2018. We see this as you\u2019ve got to look at it on a multi-year cycle.","Ryan Tunis","That\u2019s helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sarah DeWitt with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Sarah DeWitt","Hi, good morning. Just looking at the margin in the quarter, could you talk about how you see the margin expansion given the low organic growth and just walk us through how much came from OIP dropping to the bottom line versus integration savings versus if there was any FX-margin benefit?","Roger Millay","Sure Sarah. Hi. We think again maybe just to step back to the margin trends for the year and we\u2019ve been watching all the elements closely quarter-to-quarter and as we said in the third quarter we saw probably about a few percentage points in sequential drop in expenses and that sort of trend continued into the fourth quarter. And really we think it\u2019s the combination as John and I both referred to in our remarks.","It\u2019s the combination of continuing to push across the board on the savings initiatives which now you mentioned two of the elements and the third element is the business restructuring, so all of those kicking in, along with just the financial discipline that we are employing throughout the Company. So margin comes gradually and last time we said we weren\u2019t sure that we saw all those efforts flow through, but I think this time you are seeing it; so I think those were the drivers.","Sarah DeWitt","Okay great. Thanks. And then separately, I\u2019d be interested to get your thoughts on some of the macro issues post the U.S. election. If the U.S. tax rate fell to 20% but there was no interest deduction, what would that mean for Willis Towers Watson\u2019s earnings? And then also, would you be impacted by border adjustment at all since you\u2019re domiciled outside the U.S. Would your services be considered an import?","John Haley","So I think just generally on the taxes, it\u2019s two points. One is it depends very much on the details of how these things are structured as to how we could do that. Depending on exactly what\u2019s in there we could get a slight benefit; we could see our taxes even increase depending on what the details of that are. I think whatever we see, anything we have modeled, it is still within us achieving our 2018 goals of being at the 25% or less so nothing that would impact that. I think, and by the way all of the modeling we have done is sort of a worst-case because it\u2019s a steady-state assuming we don\u2019t make any changes in response to new tax legislation which we wouldn\u2019t do.","So overall, we don\u2019t \u2013 we see any changes as being relatively modest. It actually is possible under certain scenarios for our tax rate to go up, but it doesn\u2019t go up that much. I think how a border-adjusted tax applies to services, the short answer is nobody knows.","Sarah DeWitt","Okay great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters with Raymond James. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Greg Peters","Good morning, thank you for the call. My first question is \u2013 centers around your comments around the Exchange Solutions segment. You talked about a global, a slowdown or a normalization in that business. Perhaps you could provide some additional color on that?","John Haley","Yes, sure. So, let me just mention Greg what\u2019s really going on here. The biggest part of the business we have right now is the retiree part of the business. And the retiree part of the business we\u2019ve been very fortunate. We\u2019ve gotten almost all of the really big cases that have gone on to the exchanges. We won almost every one of them. But there\u2019s, at some point you run out of, there\u2019s fewer and fewer of those big ones to go out.","And so we did our largest client ever, we implemented last year. And of course that\u2019s what led to the big enrollments we have for this year and the big revenue growth. We don\u2019t have a similar really big one that we are implementing this year. We\u2019re still going to get up to 110,000 retirees because we are getting a lot of them; but the one client that accounted for I think it was 140,000, 145,000 retirees last year.","So 110,000 is still a great result, but it doesn\u2019t make up for that one big client; so we\u2019re seeing that so down a little bit. I think what I would point to, and as Roger said, the active exchange is a smaller piece of the business. In the long run that\u2019s what we expect to be by far the dominant part of the business. Our growth rate was terrific there the last year, we really added a lot of folks. We\u2019ve already got four big clients signed up for 2018; so we are very enthusiastic about that, but that\u2019s a small part of the piece that\u2019s having that high growth rate.","Greg Peters","Thank you. And I know you have already commented in some other answers about the legacy OIP program, but if we could just step back and from a big picture perspective, I know periodically last year you expressed some frustration about the ability for these savings actually to fall to the bottom line. And perhaps now that you have a year under your belt you could provide some updated perspective on the legacy OIP program and what you think might be impactful as we think about 2017 and 2018?","John Haley","Let me make just two quick comments and then I\u2019ll turn it over Roger who I know will want to provide some more color. But I think we were \u2013 I think frustrated is the right word, that it was we had these good savings we were getting in OIP and for one reason or another they weren\u2019t dropping to the bottom line. And I think one of the things we said to the analyst and investor community was we were actually going to be focused less on what the top-line savings in OIP were, but really how are we going to be getting margin improvement? Are we going to be seeing things falling through there? In the last quarter Roger talked about our sequential expenses being down and I think he said at that time, this is too early for us to say this is a real trend and we will wait and see what happens in the fourth quarter.","And as he just mentioned in his prepared remarks, I think the fourth quarter has come in and we have said, okay they are down again and we are seeing margin improvement. So we feel like that kind of a focus is paying off and we are seeing some results there. We\u2019re still not exactly where we would like to be, but I think we have seen parts of the operation, I think in Great Britain there was enthusiastic adoption of the OIP program, and we\u2019ve seen it have a very positive effect on margins there. So I think one of the things we want to do is take some of the learnings from that and apply them worldwide. Roger, maybe you want to add?","Roger Millay","The only thing John I would add to that is again refer to probably one of the changes in our remarks this time and that we both talked about financial discipline. And I think it fits what John said about our emphasis earlier in the year internally and externally just shifting more to really thinking about value or thinking on a more focused basis about value creation through margin enhancement in these programs.","And it really seems, as we ended 2016, that was showing through in the financials. It\u2019s something that we emphasized in the budget process really challenging ourselves to find the levers, to see the enhancement as we go forward and know how we had to manage different parts of the business to make sure margin came through as a result of those cost programs. And I think the results now, as John said, are showing through in the margin line; so it bodes well I think for 2017.","Greg Peters","Thank you for your answers.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Kai Pan","Thank you and good morning. Just wanted to drill down a little bit specific on the cost savings the three buckets there. I just want to make sure you mentioned that the integration savings will be $30 million in 2017 and $95 million from the OIP program and how much of that will drop to the bottom line? And also you have the business restructuring in HCB segment. How much savings will that be in 2017?","Roger Millay","Yes. I\u2019d say in terms of the individual amounts and consistent with what we just talked about on the last question, the drive here is to achieve a margin improvement. So we came in with 22.3%, I think we said EBITDA margin for 2016. We are guiding to 23% to 24%, so if you take the $30 million, plus the $95 million, plus some I don\u2019t know tens of millions of dollars, I don\u2019t have the specific number in front of me for the business restructuring, that\u2019s what\u2019s really driving the overall margin improvement which is in that range, based on the range we gave you of around 100 basis points. Again without specifying by individual program, that\u2019s margin improvement obviously of somewhere around $80 million.","Kai Pan","Okay that\u2019s assuming there\u2019s no \u2013 constant top line right?","John Haley","Well actually we have \u2013 the reason we don\u2019t have every last dollar in there is because there\u2019s some cost on the top line.","Kai Pan","Okay great and my second question on the sort of free cash flow side, you guided about $500 million buyback in 2017. If you add about $300 million for the dividends, that\u2019s $800 million. That\u2019s pretty much the same free cash flow in 2016. I just wonder is there\u2013 either there is no growth in free cash flow or you plan to use part of free cash flow for other purposes?","Roger Millay","Yes. I mean, I think in general now that we are using round of hundreds of millions of dollars here, you are doing the numbers correctly. There are some other payments going out. We do have related to some past acquisitions some payouts of contingent consideration, so that\u2019s a little bit of an add to what you mentioned. But in general, we are circling call it available free cash, I don\u2019t know that anybody really uses that term, but maybe we made it up here. We are looking to target available free cash to pay back in share repurchases. That\u2019s roughly what we\u2019re trying to communicate.","Kai Pan","Any plans as far as would acquisition be a focus here or not?","John Haley","We would never want to rule out if there\u2019s some really attractive acquisition, but I think at the moment we think we\u2019re going to be hard put to find something that\u2019s more attractive than buying our own stock.","Kai Pan","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Adam Klauber with William Blair. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Adam Klauber","Hi, in the North American U.S. brokerage operation in 2016, did the level producers\u2013 was it pretty much flat, did it grow or did it decline? And how are you thinking about the level of producers in North America in 2017?","John Haley","Yes. The level of producers was lower at the end of 2016 than it was at the beginning. There\u2019s a number of moving pieces that occurred there. One is that we have some smaller accounts that we have transferred over to \u2013 we\u2019ve sort of sold some operations or we\u2019ve transferred them over under some agreements we have to some other operations and we lose some producers when we do that. We had some retirements. We had some folks who moved from producer to non-producer status where they are still managing clients but they are doing it in a different way. We did have some turnover among the producers.","So we did have fewer producers at the end than at the beginning. At the end of the day, I think the turnover rate was about what \u2013 the voluntary turnover rate was about what we would have expected. I think going forward for 2017 we\u2019d expect to see an increase in the number of producers. We expect to have more producers at the end of the year than we have now.","Adam Klauber","Okay great and one follow-up. I\u2019m not sure if you said it, but how is organic running as a wholesale business and again do you expect that in 2017 to be better than the other parts of IRR?","Roger Millay","Yes, the wholesale business led by Miller was up in 2016 and we expect continued steady growth performance.","Adam Klauber","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Mark Marcon","Good morning. Nice to see the progress. I was wondering if you could just talk about a few things. One, you did a great job in terms of outlining the area of revenue synergies that you ended up seeing in 2016. I\u2019m wondering if you can talk a little bit about the targeted revenue synergies that you would have at the highest point in your list and the highest aspirations for, for 2017 and 2018.","John Haley","Well, we have, so I think \u2013 let me just mention something about the revenue synergies too Mark. When I went through them, the revenue synergies are the run rate that we were expecting to get from selling these things. It\u2019s not the revenue synergies that necessarily occurred in the year. So for example, when I talked about the Exchange Solutions and the revenue synergies from the mid-market, we sell to mid-market. For the most part, they are going to be implementing January 1 that we\u2019re getting. So the ones we sold in 2016, we\u2019re getting the revenue in 2017","Mark Marcon","I fully appreciate that.","John Haley","But it\u2019s not revenue that you would have seen there. Likewise, even for like the large-company P&C, most of those were sold in the second half of the year and so you haven\u2019t seen much of the revenue increases there. So when we come to this as to where we\u2019d expect to be, I think generally we were, as I said, the revenue synergies, we expect it to be about 5% to 10% of what the ultimate run-rate goal was for the end of 2018; we expected to be there at the end of 2016. It\u2019s probably between about a third and 40% is where we would expect to be at the end of 2017.","Mark Marcon","That is great. And then can you just talk about the Exchange Solutions in terms of what you ended up seeing there with the four large clients that you\u2019ve got on the active exchange coming on in 2018? Any way to size that in terms of number of lives or scope and how you would think the momentum would build with those four getting announced?","John Haley","I think, we don\u2019t have an exact figure to give right now. I\u2019d say it will be over 100,000 for those lives for those four clients we have there. I think one or two of them we even talked about potentially whether they might decide to adopt in January 1, 2017, and I think, as we worked with them, it became clear that because of all the things they had to pull together as well as what we could have done, we probably could have adopted for January 1, 2017. But I think they wanted to make sure they had everything going well and we now have a very good plan with them.","So we found that encouraging. I think it fits with the general theme that the larger companies, it\u2019s a longer time talking about it; it\u2019s more planning. Their organizations are more complex; I think they are more risk-averse about doing it, so you need to build in a longer process for that. But frankly, we feel very good about the enrollment season we had for what we\u2019re implementing for January 1, 2017, and we think this gives us a lot of momentum heading into 2018.","Mark Marcon","Great and if I can squeeze in two more. One would just basically be with regards to the uncertainty around the ACA, how would you expect that to end up impacting your healthcare consulting business here in the U.S.? And the second question would be totally different, but on the CRB side; when we think about Todd taking over and the recent fine-tuning of the management team under him, how\u2019s that \u2013 how do you expect just from a cultural perspective the adoption of a pay-for-performance kind of culture to translate to retention and performance? Thank you.","John Haley","Yes, thanks. The first one on the ACA, I mean, frankly ACA doesn\u2019t impact our typical client all that much. We, when we deal with it in the exchanges, we only deal with it in a few limited circumstances. When we deal with it in our consulting, some of our clients that have lower-paid folks that they don\u2019t want to provide healthcare coverage for or have a lot of part-time workers or something, it comes into it, but it\u2019s not the biggest part of what our \u2013 it\u2019s not a very large part at all of what our consulting does.","So I think in general, changes there won\u2019t have a significant impact on our healthcare consulting business. Who knows maybe we\u2019ll get a few more questions about things. In the CRB business, I think one of the things I know you didn\u2019t get a chance to see Todd and Carl in person at Analyst Day, but you did get a chance to hear them over the phone. I think they are both individuals who really understand the segments that they are working with and leading.","I think Todd commands great respect throughout the organization. I think people appreciate the fact that he has a long background in brokerage. I think they believe in his vision of the future, so I\u2019m as excited as can be to have him rolling out his program and leading that operation.","Mark Marcon","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Elyse Greenspan","Yes, a few questions. First off, in your 2017 guidance are you including any impact from currency?","Roger Millay","Well, the guidance is based on the rates that I stated in my remarks. I think it was $1.24 for the pound and $1.08 for the euro. I think, I believe that\u2019s what we said.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay do you know what would that translate to just in bottom line in terms of EPS?","Roger Millay","Yes, I really don\u2019t have specific numbers. There isn\u2019t a huge impact for us EPS-wise with changes to the pound and the euro because we do have in the legacy businesses one of them was net in the P&L, net long pound; the other was net short pound. We do have profitability in the Euro so a little more exposure there, but big movements don\u2019t drive a lot of \u2013 or movements don\u2019t drive a big impact on EPS.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay and then in terms of the fourth quarter margins, I know on the last call we had mentioned there potentially being a lower level of incentive comp just as the revenue was you guys said a little bit lower than you would have expected for this year. Does that have an impact on the fourth quarter margins?","Roger Millay","Certainly, we do have a pay-for-performance system and we update that as the year goes on. There would have been a little bit of an impact in the fourth quarter, but not something that was a big driver.","John Haley","Not anything that was way out of whack, and in fact in, for the year we came in right in our range; we say in between 30% and 35% sort of our net operating income and we came right in there.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay and then in terms of the margin outlook for 2017, I know you guys, you did go through the components of the OIP and the merger-related savings that you expect to see fall to the bottom line, do you expect to see that even? I mean will we see more of the OIP savings fall to the bottom line within your Q1 margins, just how do you think about the projection of that kind of as we move through 2017?","Roger Millay","I think there is, in this being the last year of OIP and I think there is a push of getting all the possible activity done by the end of 2017. So I think OIP impact this year will be a little bit back-end loaded in the year. I think the cost savings from the merger cost savings, probably pretty even. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s \u2013 I can\u2019t think of a big kind of driver of early or late of any of those programs. The restructuring savings from the business of course occurred in the second half of 2016. So we will have the biggest impact on margins in the first half of the year.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay great and one more question if I may. Does your guidance for IRR assume a return to growth just within the reinsurance component of that segment in 2017? Or how are you thinking about the outlook for the reinsurance business?","Roger Millay","I think in our outlook the reinsurance business was roughly flat in the outlook.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. That\u2019s great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you and, due to time, this does conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. John Haley for any further remarks.","John Haley","Okay. Thanks very much everybody and we look forward to talking with you after our next quarter, our first quarter earnings call in May.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect.

Welcome to the Willis Towers Watson Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Please refer to our website for the press release and supplemental information that was issued earlier today. Today's call is being recorded and will be available for the next three months on our website.","Some of the comments in today's call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995.

Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today and the company undertakes no obligation to update these statements unless required by law.","For a more detailed discussion of these and other risk factors, investors should review the forward-looking statements section of the earnings press release issued this morning, as well as other disclosures in our recent Form 10-K and other Willis Towers Watson SEC filings.","During the call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures as well as other information regarding these measures, please refer to the most recent earnings release and other materials in the Investor Relations section of the company's website.","I will now turn the call over to John Haley, Willis Towers Watson's Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.","John Haley","Thank you very much, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter earnings call. With me here today is: Mike Burwell, our Chief Financial Officer; and Rich Keefe, our Head of Investor Relations. Today we'll review our results for the fourth quarter and for the full year ended December 31, 2019. Then we'll provide a brief commentary on the outlook for 2020.","So as I look back on the last year, I think that our results were largely positive. We increased revenue, we improved margins and we generated an impressive return for our shareholders. That said, we have more work to do to improve free cash flow and we remain focused on executing against our strategy.","So before diving into the fourth quarter results, I'd like to take a moment to update you on some exciting activity that's already occurred this year. Two weeks ago, Willis Towers Watson returned to Davos to participate in the World Economic Forum.","Now in our second year as a strategic partner of the World Economic Forum, our delegates convened to address areas of strategic importance to our business, including climate risk, the future of work, inclusion and diversity and cybersecurity.","Quite a few members of our delegation led sessions during the week at Davos. I took part in sessions that continue the work of the coalition for climate resilient investment, a cooperative initiative which we introduced last quarter. We also launched a new offering Climate Quantified which helps organizations to quantify how they will be affected by the climate change trajectory and the effects of mitigation with climate adequate and resilient solutions.","We also co-sponsored Bloomberg Live: The Year Ahead Davos event where Julie Gebauer Head of Human Capital & Benefits spoke on organizational sustainability. Adam Garrard, our Head of Corporate Risk & Broking in our international geography participated in a session on Advancing Cyber Resilience For Critical Infrastructure. Carl Hess, the Head of Investment Risk and Reinsurance joined the Friends of Ocean Action Community session on increasing the role of the ocean to address some of the United Nation's global sustainable development goals.","All told, the company had a great lineup of events and speakers across Davos in addition to numerous client meetings. We were encouraged by the experience and are excited to play, a proactive role within the global community that is working to build a more cohesive and sustainable future.","Now let's turn to our fourth quarter 2019 results. For the fourth quarter of 2019, we continue to deliver solid financial performance with 14% overall constant currency growth, 6% organic revenue growth and 270 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion.","Likewise, we had revenue and operating margin growth in each of our business segments again this quarter. This marks the sixth consecutive quarter in which we've generated organic revenue growth of 5% or greater along with improved margins.","Our fourth quarter results reflect our efforts to constantly challenge ourselves and to deliver more. Reported revenue for the fourth quarter was $2.7 billion, up 13% as compared to the prior year fourth quarter, up 14% on a constant currency basis and up 6% on an organic basis. Reported revenue included $22 million of negative currency movements.","Net income was $551 million, up 44% for the fourth quarter as compared to $383 million of net income in the prior year fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $930 million as compared to the prior year fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $774 million representing a 20% increase.","For the quarter diluted earnings per share were $4.18, an increase of 45% compared to the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $4.90. Reported revenue for full year of 2019 increased 6% as compared to the same period in the prior year increased 9% on a constant currency basis and was up 5% on an organic basis.","Now let's look at each of the segments in more detail. To provide clear comparability with prior periods, all commentary regarding the results of our segments will be on an organic basis, unless specifically stated otherwise.","Segment margins are calculated using segment revenues and they exclude unallocated corporate costs. Such as amortization of intangibles, certain transaction and integration expenses resulting from mergers and acquisitions, as well as other items which we consider non-core to our operating results. The segment results do include discretionary compensation.","Revenue for Human Capital & Benefits or HCB was up 4% on an organic and constant currency basis compared to the fourth quarter of the prior year. For the full year of 2019, HCB revenues grew 4% organically.","The Health & Benefits business grew 10% this quarter. New business and product revenue continued to drive revenue expansion in North America. While our increasing market share and global benefit management appointments and new local and regional wins contributed to the growth in other geographies.","Health & Benefits revenue growth was also aided by the lower revenue comparable in the prior year fourth quarter. The prior year results reflect the impact of adopting the new standard, ASC 606, which resulted in certain revenue not being recognized.","Retirement revenue increased 1% this quarter, primarily driven by continued momentum in the steady flow of bulk lump sum activity as the market for pension risk transfer remained attractive to plan sponsors in North America.","Increased demand for consulting and advisory work in North America and international contributed to revenue growth in both Talent and Rewards and Technology and Administration solutions.","HCB's operating margin improved by 20 basis points compared to the prior year fourth quarter and improved by 130 basis points for the full year. As a trusted partner to our clients HCB combines data analytics, strategic insight and brokerage and technology solutions to address our clients' most complex workforce and benefits challenges.","Our takeaways from Davos reinforced areas we had already prioritized. Re-skilling in response to technology advances, enhancing diversity and inclusion as part of sustainability and leveraging AI to enhance the employee experience and improve well-being.","As HCB's results indicate, we believe this segment is well positioned to address these issues and provide solutions that keep pace with our clients' evolving needs, and therefore continue growing profitability.","Now let's look at Corporate Risk & Broking or CRB, which had a revenue increase of 9% on an organic and constant currency basis as compared to the prior year fourth quarter. For the full year of 2019, CRB revenues grew 6% organically.","North America revenues grew by 11% in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of new business and improved retention. The international regions revenues climbed 13% as compared to the prior year. There was notably strong performance in construction and natural resources in Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa.","These results reflect the benefit of some one-time non-recurring placements. Western Europe contributed 5% growth with the growth driven by strong new business in Iberia France. Great Britain had 6% revenue growth driven by new business in aerospace and FINEX.","CRB revenue was $877 million, with an operating margin of 30% as compared to a 29% operating margin in the prior year fourth quarter. The margin expanded due to top line performance coupled with continued cost management efforts. We're pleased with the CRB top line growth for the year as well as the margin expansion for the quarter and the overall year.","CRB continues to make solid progress toward profitable growth, and we feel good about the long-term prospects of this business. The World Economic Forum Global Risks report 2019 ranked cyber attacks among the top five global risks, developing cybersecurity and resilience is critical to support socioeconomic growth.","We believe our CRB business has established itself as one of the world's trusted experts in helping leaders adapt the right strategies to cover their cyber exposure. As cyber attacks continue to rise we stand ready to help clients defend their innovations and build a more secure digital network world.","Turning to Investment Risk & Reinsurance or IRR, revenue for the quarter was $314 million, an increase of 12% on an organic basis and 14% on a constant currency basis as compared to the prior year fourth quarter with meaningful growth across our core businesses.","For the full year of 2019, IRR revenues grew 7% organically. Reinsurance with growth of 19%, continue to lead the segment through a combination of net new business along with a strong retention ratio across most lines and regions.","Insurance Consulting and Technology grew by 10% from technology product sales and growth in project revenue. Investment revenue increased 9% with continued expansion of the delegated investment services portfolio.","On an organic basis, wholesale revenue increased by 15% driven by growth across the book. Overall, the wholesale business was up 24%, including the results from Miller's acquisition of Alston Gayler. Our Max Matthiessen business grew 3%, primarily from increased commission revenues.","IRR's operating margin grew 700 basis points to 9% in the fourth quarter compared to 2% in the prior year fourth quarter. Top line growth and greater operating leverage both contributed to the segment's margin improvement. Overall, we are pleased with the financial results of our IRR businesses.","Revenues for the Benefits Delivery and Administration segment or BDA increased by 53% from the prior year fourth quarter on a constant currency basis. On an organic basis, revenue grew 3% compared to the prior year fourth quarter.","BDA's expanded mid and large market client base and increased project work resulted in the segment's growth. We continue to see strong demand for benefits outsourcing core service offerings resulting in several new client wins.","For the full year of 2019, BDA revenue grew 4% organically. BDA's operating margin was 52% compared to 61% in the prior year fourth quarter due to the inclusion of TRANZACT in the current year. BDA's operating margin improved from 19% to 24% for the full year. TRANZACT's revenue growth exceeded our expectations. We're encouraged by TRANZACT's performance and we continue to be excited about our joint trajectory, as this business continues to gain momentum.","So in closing, we delivered another solid financial performance for the fourth quarter and for the full year. I also want to take a moment to recognize the hard work of our colleagues around the world and extend our appreciation for the work they've done this past year and for their steadfast dedication to providing top-notch client service.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Mike.","Mike Burwell","Thanks, John, and good morning to everyone. Thanks to all of you for joining us. I'd also like to thank our colleagues for all their efforts and our clients for their continued support and trust in us.","So, now, let's turn to our financial overview. Let me first discuss income from operations. Income from operations for the fourth quarter was $687 million or 25.5% of revenue, up 570 basis points from the prior year fourth quarter of $470 million, or 19.8% of revenue. Adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter was $809 million, or 30.1% of revenue, up 270 basis points from the prior year of $650 million, or 27.4% of revenue.","Income from operations for the full year 2019 was $1.3 billion or 14.7% of revenue, up 520 basis points over the prior year of $809 million or 9.5% of revenue. Adjusted operating income for the full year of 2019 was $1.8 billion or 20.3% of revenue and up 220 basis points from the prior year of $1.5 billion, or 18.1% of revenue. It should be noted that 30 basis points of our margin improvement in fiscal year 2019 was driven by TRANZACT, related to the timing of the purchase.","Now let me turn to EPS, or earnings per share. For the fourth quarters of 2019 and 2018, our diluted EPS was $4.18 and $2.89 respectively. For the fourth quarter of 2019, our adjusted EPS was up 23% to $4.90 per share, as compared to $4 per share in the prior year fourth quarter. For the full years 2019 and 2018, diluted EPS was $8.02 and $5.27 respectively. For the full year 2019, adjusted EPS was up 13%, to $10.96 per share versus $9.73 per share in the prior year.","Foreign currency caused a decrease in our consolidated revenue of $22 million for the quarter compared to the prior year fourth quarter, with a $0.05 headwind to adjusted diluted earnings per share this quarter. Foreign currency caused a decrease in our consolidated revenue of $192 million for the full year 2019 as compared to the prior year, with a $0.16 headwind to adjusted diluted earnings per share overall for the year.","Moving to taxes. I'd like to provide you with some additional insight into our U.S. GAAP and adjusted tax rates. Our U.S. GAAP tax rate for the fourth quarter was 18.3% as compared to 19.7% for the prior year fourth quarter. Our adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was 19.4%, a decrease from 20.4% rate in the prior year fourth quarter. Our adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter is lower than the prior year due to one-time discrete tax benefits.","Full year, the U.S. GAAP tax rate was 18.8% for 2019 as compared to 16% for the prior year, while the adjusted tax rate was 20.3% compared to 19.5% for the prior year. Excluding discrete items, our adjusted tax rate for the full year was approximately 21%. We will give forward guidance around our tax rate. We do not project discrete items which can be positive and\/or negative.","Moving to the balance sheet. We continue to have a strong financial position. As a reminder, in the first quarter, we implemented a new lease accounting standard. This result had no material impact to our operating income, but did result in increase in liabilities on our balance sheet, which are largely offset by a corresponding increase in assets. The gross-up totaled approximately $1.5 billion.","Our balance sheet position continues to strengthen. During the year, we successfully issued a $1 billion in senior notes offering to help with the efficiency of our capital structure and provide additional financial flexibility. Total debt at the end of 2019 was $5.6 billion compared with $5.9 billion at the end of the third quarter.","Our term loan commitment resulting from TRANZACT acquisition had a $295 million balance as of the end of the year, down from $463 million as of the third quarter and we had no borrowings at year-end under our revolving credit facility. Our next debt maturities due date is July 2020.","Lastly, full year free cash flow was $835 million, a decrease of $185 million compared to the prior year of $1.2 million. The year-over-year decline in free cash flow is primarily due to higher cash tax payments of $130 million, resulting from the U.S. and global tax reform, unfavorable working capital changes particularly in accounts receivable and negative cash flows of TRANZACT.","In terms of capital allocation for the full year of 2019, we repurchased approximately $150 million in Willis Towers Watson stock and paid approximately $329 million in dividends. We remain committed to deleveraging in the near term, returning our leverage ratio to historic levels, improving our free cash flow position.","Now that we summarize last year's performance, let's look ahead to our guidance for fiscal year 2020. Turning to revenue. For the company, we expect organic revenue growth of around 4% to 5% and 6% to 7% on an overall constant currency basis for 2020. Our non-cash pension income, which is classified within other income net line, is expected to improve by approximately $50 million, due primarily to improved returns on planned assets.","Pertaining to tax, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be around 20% for fiscal year 2020, excluding any potential discrete items. Annual guidance assumes, average currency rate of $1.31 to the pound and $1.11 to the euro.","Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect FX to be a headwind to adjusted EPS by 2020, by approximately $0.10 per share. And we expect most of this impact in the first quarter. ","Adjusted diluted earnings per share, projected to be in line with the range of $11.80 to $12.10. This guidance includes the impact from the expected headwind items to adjusted diluted earnings per share, such as the currency of $0.10.","Finally, we expect free cash flow to be around $1 billion, which assumes the Stanford settlement will no longer be subject to further appeal. And we will make approximately $120 million payment, in 2020.","In summary, we've seen good acceleration of revenue growth. And positive operating leverage this quarter, I'm pleased with the results and the continued momentum of our businesses. There is still a lot of opportunity ahead of us. And we remain focused on executing on our strategy.","So before I turn the call back to John, I do want to mention, this year we'll be hosting an Investor Day, in Washington D.C. on March 20. And we look forward to seeing you there. So now I'll turn the call back over to you John.","John Haley","Okay. Thanks Mike. And with that, I'd like to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Your line is now open.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Hi. Good morning. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Hey! Mike, you guys are doing such a good job in improving the organic growth rate of the various businesses. But the free cash flow is just really a sore point.","And -- could you just comment on, what is exactly the issue? And how should we be thinking about that? What's -- where are you falling so far behind? And how should we think about that for 2020? What changes are happening that are going to kind of impact the company a lot more than what we've seen over the last year?","Mike Burwell","Sure. Thanks for the question, Shlomo. I guess first is, obviously to your point we're working very hard on it. We're not pleased with the outcome, in terms of where we landed for the current year. But here's what we're doing about it.","One is that we have tied variable compensation to the top 500 people in the company, to the established goals that we have. And that has been implemented. Equally that's true for the operating committee of the organization.","Additionally, we are in the process of implementing a contract management and cash management system to manage contract terms more directly and consistently. And we've established a contracted cash task force with individuals that are 100% dedicated to focus on improved and sustainable performance in the area. So we're very focused on it. I guess is the bottom line.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","And is there any like one specific thing? Is it a matter of just like communication with the customers? Is it -- in other words is, there a few items that you can point to that are saying \"Hey! This is just where things are not getting done?\"","Mike Burwell","I would tell you, we look at the entirety of the process Shlomo and from top to bottom. So, every area we can see that there's areas for improvement. Obviously, we've made some progress. But we'll look at it as a totality of the process itself. And are not leaving any stones unturned in terms of going after it.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay, great. And then, Hey! John, can you talk a little bit more about what's going on with TRANZACT. You said that, it had better revenue growth than expected. Can you just give us, a little bit more commentary about what you expect from this company over the next year? And the general trends that you're seeing in that business?","John Haley","Yeah. So I think, look Shlomo, when we bought TRANZACT, we expected this to be at least for the short to medium-term, a relatively high-growth business. And we had a business case I think where it was going to grow in excess of 20%.","That's the basis, we did the deal on. And we thought there was even a possibility that revenue growth could get to 30% or even 35% in the first year. We actually passed -- surpassed all those; we grew by over 50%.","And it has been -- our TRANZACT colleagues have just done a terrific job of gearing up and taking on all these -- this additional revenue. Our Medicare Advantage grew by about 94%, so very good growth there. And what's probably the most important part of that market.","We expect that -- we still have this expectation that, we're going to continue to see this to be a high-growth business for the short to medium-term. And even though we have a pretty tough comparable and a base we're building on. We're still expecting to see over 20% growth for the, next several years.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay, great. Okay. There's one, more housekeeping, Mike, what is the currency impact on a dollar basis, expected in 2020? You noted like, $0.10 on the EPS. But if I were to look it on revenue, is there a number you guys have embedded in the guidance?","Mike Burwell","It's very nominal, Shlomo. This is really on expenses. I mean it's really small on revenue.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters of Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Greg Peters","Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. First up on organic. For the fourth quarter, you posted some pretty impressive results especially in CRB. And I know you provided guidance for next year around organic. Is there anything unusual to what happened in the fourth quarter? Any specific items you can call out to help us get a sense of why it was so strong?","John Haley","I think our folks really worked hard with clients and delivered in the fourth quarter. I did call out we had some one-time projects in construction and natural resources which were a big help to that. And that's actually the nature of construction and natural resources projects tend to be more episodic than in some of the others. So, we had a couple of those.","But frankly Greg when you look at it our growth was really pretty much across the Board. It wasn't like we just had one area that was way ahead of all the others, they all performed I think at the top of what we might have expected.","Greg Peters","Yes. Can I pivot to the guidance on the operating margin for fiscal year 2020, you're guiding to an operating margin of around 20.5% and I think that's just a 20 basis point improvement over 2019. It seems like there's better opportunities especially with the growth you're posting. Can you walk us through why you're not anticipating better margin expansion?","Mike Burwell","Sure Greg. So, as I said in my prepared remarks, when you look at TRANZACT for fiscal year 2019 it really had about a 30 basis points improvement so -- and we had originally targeted being around 20%. And so when you normalize that that gets you more like 20% and then if you looked at 20.5% and we've talked about 50 to 70 basis points on an annual basis in terms of what that improvement would look like, that's really what we're targeting on a normalized basis in terms of thinking about it.","Greg Peters","Got it. That makes sense. And then can we pivot to BDA ex-TRANZACT because it looks like the business slowed down maybe the legacy exchanges business or -- can you give us some color there?","John Haley","Yes. I mean I think BDA is one we've been talking about for a while now that with the tremendous success we've had penetrating that market over the years, there's still opportunities left ,but the opportunities tend to be more a few mega opportunities that are episodic now. And so we're not surprised.","The sales cycle on these large ones take some time and we're continuing to work on them. So, we'll see some years where we have a big jump up, but I don't think you're going to see the steady growth because you don't have the same pipeline of clients there. It's one of the reasons why we're really focused now on our technology and operations to make sure we maintain our market leadership as the go-to marketplace for the retiree medical.","Greg Peters","Got it. Listen I realize you're not going to make some announcement regarding management on this conference call, but it feels like when we get to the end of this year, there's going to be some retirements. And can you give us an idea of when you expect the Board and the company to announce when the -- who the next lineup of executives are going to be running some of the businesses?","John Haley","Sure. So, look as -- you're right, we're not in a position to provide any real details right now, but let me tell you this. The Willis Towers Watson Board of Directors, of course, they're the ones who lead the succession process for the role of CEO. And the Board acting through the governance committee is actively engaged in the whole succession planning process. And this isn't something that has happened this year or last year or even just the year before. This has been a multi-year thinking about what our talent is and how we bring them along and how we develop them.","And so the Board and the governance committee have been regularly involved in that. They meet with me and our Head of Human Resources on a regular basis. We've engaged a third-party to make sure we have an outside look at the experience and attributes of our candidates.","Our expectation is that we will name a new CEO in the second half of this year. So, we're going to make sure we have enough time to allow an orderly transition. But other than that, that's pretty much all I can say at the moment.","Greg Peters","Great. Thanks for your answers John.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Pardon me, Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo, your line is now open. Please check your mute button.","John Haley","We're not hearing anything. Could we maybe move on and come back to Elyse in a little bit.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon from Baird. Your line is now open.","Mark Marcon","Good morning. And thanks for taking my questions. First of all, on CRB within North America really good performance, how sustainable is that? And what are the specific areas of strength? And to what extent is \u2013 how big could the cyber opportunity be?","John Haley","Yeah. Let me just and Mike may want to weigh in on this. I mean, look the CRB in North America grew I think at 11% in the fourth quarter, 11% is a real big number. But they had very good growth even throughout the year not as high as 11% but still a very good growth throughout the year. I think when you talk to folks in the industry, generally, the middle market in particular in North America is one that people are focused on and it's one of our relative strength.","So we feel pretty good about that. I mean, I know when we talked about our projections for this year. There was some question of whether our revenue growth projection is more modest. And what we said was, we prefer to budget on a more modest basis, but we thought we would make sure we grew as fast as the market or faster. And I think we've delivered on that. And that's pretty much the expectation, I think we have going forward. I think cyber is something, where there is fantastic opportunity long run. I think that's going to require the market developing the right kind of policies and the right kind of solutions for clients. I don't think the market is there yet, but I think we're moving towards that. And as we do, it'll be a tremendous opportunity.","Mark Marcon","Great. And then when we take a look at the overall guidance for 2020 in terms of the 4% to 5% organic growth, you mentioned TRANZACT should continue to grow at least 20% plus year-over-year. So that will drive that segment. For the other segments, are we taking the same sort of general stance in terms of generally assuming 4% to 5% growth for each of those and then we'll lock it up as the year goes on, or how should we think about that?","John Haley","Yeah. No. We \u2013 look we \u2013 obviously, we don't disclose our \u2013 we don't get into all the details of how we do it. But Mark, when we build our overall growth for the company we do it segment by segment almost line of business by line of business. So we go through and we do think for example, I mean and just as one clear thing, CRB is going to grow faster than Retirement. We just pretty much know that. So we build the models that way but \u2013 and then we just give a revenue growth for the company.","Mark Marcon","Terrific. And then a question for Mike. Just on the free cash flow. Can you disaggregate the impact of TRANZACT relative to the DSOs? And what the major source of improvement for next year is going to be in terms of whether it's TRANZACT normalizing or the goal for DSOs?","Mike Burwell","Yeah. So Mark, as it relates to TRANZACT, I mean, when we looked at TRANZACT we originally did the diligence and understood TRANZACT. With the revenue growth rates it was having we knew there will be some level of cash implications to it or a drag, if you will, but it was minor. But given the growth rates that we had it turned a bit more significant because of the build of what we had to do for across the Board and in licensed agents, investments, et cetera to make sure that we could satisfy what we saw as the market demand. And our team there I think did a wonderful job in making sure that they were well positioned to be able to take advantage of that growth.","So I think that's the one issue as it relates to TRANZACT. I think as it relates to our receivables we just saw it build a bit more. And as I said earlier, I was really looking at the \u2013 from contracting and how we set up the contracts to ultimately how we collect that cash. So contracted cash from a process standpoint we're very focused on it. So we did see that receivables build. And so we're very focused on improving that going forward. So hopefully that gives you some further insight.","John Haley","Yeah. And maybe I could just mention that Mark when you \u2013 when we think about this we had the \u2013 we had TRANZACT and as Mike said when we first did it we had the deal cost for TRANZACT and we knew we would have some sort of impact just from financing the growth there. We thought well we're not going to bother updating our forecast for that. It turned out the growth was bigger than we expected and it became a more sizable number as a result of that.","I think the tax payments were a surprise to us the cash tax payments being than what we had projected. And that's one of the things that I think Mike has done a good job of putting in a much better forecasting system for this coming year so that we won't have those kind of surprises, but that \u2013 a better forecasting system, which we needed because clearly we missed some things. And then also we were focused on improving our cash collection, but we were focused on improving it without having the right kind of incentives built in to our whole compensation system. And the fact that, we're now building these right kind of incentives and I think some very significant incentives into improving our cash collection gives us a lot more confidence going into this year.","Mark Marcon","Thank you very much. I appreciate the long-term efficacy of your incentive planning. It always work. Thanks.","John Haley","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from Citi. Your line is now open.","Suneet Kamath","Thanks. I just wanted to go back to the free cash flow for a second. Just -- I think last quarter you guys were pretty optimistic about the $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion and obviously as you said came in below that. So -- and maybe just to answer it but I just want to clarify I mean what was the surprise? Was it the cash taxes or was it TRANZACT? Obviously something happened just towards the end of the year and I just want to make sure I'm clear on what that was?","John Haley","Yeah. I mean, I think we actually lowered our cash forecast last year from the $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion down to what $900 million to $1.1 billion we had said it would be. So we -- excuse me. We kept -- we said $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. Okay lovely. We were concerned about where it would come I guess anyway. But the -- look we had -- the TRANZACT was bigger than we thought. We had the cash taxes and the cash taxes were about $130 million higher. And so we knew that was going to be weighing on us to begin with. And then we had the decline in receivables though was something that we did not expect. But that was something that was a surprise to us.","Mike Burwell","And I would only add to your comments John. I mean, we always know the fourth quarter is an outsized quarter for us just in terms of timing. So when we sat there at the end of the third quarter, we knew exactly where we had stood. We knew what we had done in the prior year fourth quarter. These couple of points that John just raised influenced it. But frankly we were worried about working capital build. And that's why we took the guidance down at the end of the third quarter. And in fact that's what we saw actually really build in receivables.","And so that's really the -- one of the improvements that we're looking at is really driving that improvement in working capital. Obviously the driver is coming back to free cash flow. We've seen some reduction in CapEx. We, obviously, know operating income is a big driver of it. And obviously working capital and that's the area that from a process standpoint again go back to from contracting to make sure we are looking at our terms at the beginning until the ultimate cash collection process is really where we're going. And as John referenced, I would not underestimate what this means going forward in terms of the incentives we put in place -- are putting in place throughout the organization.","Suneet Kamath","Makes sense. And I guess if we look at 2020 your cash flow guidance would imply something like I don't know high-teens growth in free cash flow. Are you still guiding to longer term that growth rate to be around 15%?","John Haley","Well, we're sort of laser focused on what we're going to do for next year right now. But I would say if you look at us where we're growing our guidance of $1 billion is after we anticipate paying the Stanford settlement too. So it's closer to a 30% to 35% growth in free cash flow.","Suneet Kamath","Got it. And then just lastly on the capital management or capital return outlook for 2020. I'm assuming you're going to continue to target double-digit growth in dividends. But any color in terms of what you're expecting for share repurchases?","Mike Burwell","Yeah. So as you know given the acquisition of TRANZACT, last year we really had nominal share repurchases, which were really just to manage so that we weren't dilutive as it relates to our employee benefit programs and we would anticipate doing that again as we think about 2020. Additionally when you look at our dividend payments, $350 million to $370 million kind of range that are there. And then equally then you got to look at it and say we've committed to paying our debt down related to TRANZACT as I referenced.","If you look at our current debt-to-EBITDA ratios, we're more in the 2.4% range and we're looking to get closer to 2.0%. So that will really be where we're looking to deploy capital at least as we look at 2020.","Suneet Kamath","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Elyse Greenspan","Thank you. Good morning. My first question going back to the margin discussion, I understand from one of the earlier questions you pointed to kind of neutralizing for TRANZACT right and then still being within that 50% to 70% target. But I guess I'm more thinking about the segments and just conceptually maybe you don't want to guide to a certain level. But I thought the goal was to improve CRB? I know there's a delta between where you guys are and where some of your peers are running in their brokerage business. So does like -- does this operating margin guide assume that there is going to be underlying margin improvement in CRB and perhaps also in IRR HCB and it's just offset by the accounting impact of when that TRANZACT deal comes on?","John Haley","Well, I mean I think -- so Elyse just like we do the revenue growth in response to Mark Marcon's question I was saying, we project our revenue growth line of business by line of business and then build that up to company here and the revenue growth is not the same across all of them. We project our margin line of business by line of business. And certainly we see more opportunities for margin improvement in CRB where we're trailing some of our peers in terms of what we have been saying, retirement where we're ahead of our peers. So those are reflected in our projections, yes.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, great. And then, as we think about free cash flow for 2020, I just kind of want to understand the seasonality. I'm not sure if you guys have a sense of the timing of the Stanford litigation? And I know typically cash flow is weak in the first quarter?","And then also is there any seasonalities that guide? And then another part of that question would be does the 2020 free cash flow guide imply that a pretty sure TRANZACT is negative from a free cash flow perspective? Does it take that drag into account?","John Haley","It does take the TRANZACT drag into account. So, I start with that. I think Stanford, it seems like it's at a place where we should be able to pay up. But we've thought for a couple of years now we would be able to pay it, and the court system drags things on longer than we had thought. We don't have a particular time when we're estimating it during the year. But we will alert you when we've made the payment.","And then, clearly there's a lot of seasonality. Our cash flow is highly skewed towards the second half of the year. We have tax payments tend to come in the first quarter. We have our bonus payments in the first or second quarter. And so, we have a lot of cash strain in the beginning of the year.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, that's helpful. And my last question is on leverage. You guys have obviously been managing down your leverage and to close the TRANZACT acquisition. Does the -- I just kind of want to get a sense of the interest expense expected with the guide? Does it -- are you going to pay down more of your leverage as we move through 2020?","Mike Burwell","Yeah. So Elyse, the game plan is to do that. And we're looking to do that as part of our capital deployment. So you should continue to see. And as you've seen us do from the third quarter to the fourth quarter in terms of that reduction, you're going to continue to see that over the first half of 2020 in terms of us really addressing that outstanding balance, which will obviously have the corollary effect to interest expense.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Yaron Kinar","Good morning. A couple more on free cash flow. First the TRANZACT, considering that it is a -- still in start up mode still growing very rapidly. How long do you see that as being a cash drag for the business?","Mike Burwell","I mean, we continue to see is -- with those kinds of growth rates that are there Yaron which we projected out over the next four to five years, we're continuing to see that. But we only -- look from a cash standpoint, we only see it about a year out in terms of -- so with growth rates, we see over the five years we really see the cash side of that equation really starting to go only a year or so in terms of its drag on cash.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. And then, on the DSO side and maybe coming back to the seasonality question earlier, I would think that a lot of the contracts got renewed at the very end of the year or the very beginning of the year. So, I would think that a lot of the contract changes in language with regards to DSO would be in place by the first quarter of 2020. And the variable comp adjustment that you've made is also probably in place already. Shouldn't there be a little bit of an offset to the regular seasonality just by a lift from DSO in the first quarter?","Mike Burwell","Yeah. I mean we've got a lot of factors in that first quarter. As you rightly said, I mean we were tacking all the contractual terms that we have to be in place. We're aligning it from a variable compensation standpoint. But we also have the bonus payments. We have tax payments and those amounts that come in there. And candidly, we're looking to make sure we meet what we're saying we've put out there in terms of expectations around.","So, that's the game plan. I understand what the logic where you're going, but we see the first half of the year being more of a use of cash and really see it, and if you look back historically in the company you really see it build over the second half of the year with the fourth quarter being outsized in terms of cash coming in.","John Haley","And I would just point out that the changes to the variable compensation plan, which are -- I mean we've discussed with the Board and the comp committee, they won't be formally put in place until the end of this month at our Board meeting, but we've discussed making these changes with them. So, we'll have those in there, but they weren't in last year. And so, we'll see the impact from them in this year. But I would hesitate to ascribe any effect to them from last year.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. And then, my other question is just going to the HCB margins. I think if we adjust out the accounting catch up the ASC 606, margins actually declined by about 50 basis points year-over-year in this quarter. So a, is my math roughly right? And b, if it is what caused that decline considering that organic growth was actually up?","Mike Burwell","Yeah. I mean your calculation -- your math calculation seems maybe a little high just in terms of how you calculate it. We didn't have it quite that way. So, it may be a flat to slight decline really is kind of how we've looked at it, Yaron. So, that would be our thoughts in terms of the numbers just to give you that feedback.","Yaron Kinar","And what would have caused that decline?","John Haley","Well, there is a bit of a portfolio shift. Retirement which is the most profitable is growing slower than some of the others.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Hughes from SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Mark Hughes","Yeah. Thank you. Good morning. Has there been any change in your write-off of receivables? Any change in bad debt trends?","Mike Burwell","No. Actually we've been going after that. So it hasn't been if anything we've been really making progress on collecting some of the older stuff that we've had in terms of dealing with it, so no, no change in policy, no accounting change and nothing that way.","Mark Hughes","Is it fair to think that the faster organic growth in the cash drag it's just really two sides of the same coin that you're you've got more receivables in the business, because you're growing the top line faster. Does that make sense?","Mike Burwell","Yeah. I mean, you look at it on a year-over-year basis. I mean at the beginning of December 2018 and how it rolled into January of 2019 in comparison to December of 2019 and how it rolls into 2020, there's definitely some element of that. And so it's difficult to absolutely quantify it. But I think to your point, yes, I think that there's some portion of that.","Mark Hughes","And then finally IRR, you really had an acceleration this quarter especially thinking relative to Q3, how much of that carries over into 2020?","Mike Burwell","Yes. There's definitely multi-year arrangements that are included in there and there is definitely an impact that's there. But the other thing, I guess, I'd just point out our Reinsurance business in particular was very strong as well as our Investment business as John commented in his opening comments there. I mean, overall -- so yes, there is some impact to that.","John Haley","But I mean I think if you think back to a year or two ago when particularly Insurance, Consulting and Technology Investments were slow growing and we said we thought we like the future outlook for them. And I think we're seeing that come to fruition this year. So we like where they were positioned in 2019. We feel good about them going forward.","I'm not sure they're going to grow as fast as they did in the quarter of 2019. But we like our positioning and we like our growth prospects there. And I think we feel the same way about Reinsurance. Look the whole Reinsurance market was very positive. We're very strong in the fourth quarter. We think we grew as fast as anybody else or faster. And so we feel good about that. And we think we'll perform well against the market in the future.","Mark Hughes","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields from KBW. Your line is now open.","Meyer Shields ","Great. Thanks. I was hoping to start with some maybe guidance on how much margin headwind you expect in 2020 from the inclusion of TRANZACT, I guess earlier quarters?","John Haley","So we think that's probably about what 1% or something like that?","Mike Burwell","Yeah. Yeah. Yes 1%.","John Haley","1%.","Meyer Shields ","So 1% margin drag?","Mike Burwell","Yeah.","John Haley","Yeah.","Mike Burwell","Yeah. Just a reminder back -- remember we acquired TRANZACT in July of 2019, right? And you go back from that acquisition you had five months of revenue and five months of expense. Obviously, we're going to have it for a full year as we look into 2020.","Meyer Shields","Right. Now I understand and I'm thinking that that's actually very good news because it implies better underlying margin expansion. Can you give us a sense in terms of the nonrecurring CRB items in the fourth quarter just magnitude?","Mike Burwell","Yes, we really don't disclose the individual deals or the -- those particular aspects to it.","John Haley","And then the problem with doing that too is there -- when there's a couple of notable ones we note them. They say, oh, those are big ones, but there might be a lot of other smaller ones and we just don't have a system aggregating them.","Meyer Shields","Yeah. That make sense. All right. Thanks so much.","John Haley","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Your line is now open. ","Mike Zaremski","Hey, good morning. I guess starting with a question on free cash flow. Our pension cash contributions or maybe CapEx are those slight year-over-year headwinds?","Mike Burwell","No, no we don't see that way. As we look at next year we don't see that Mike. No. We see them in a reasonable...","John Haley","About the same, yes.","Mike Burwell","Same, yes.","Mike Zaremski","Okay. And if I just think about the organic growth outlook would you kind of categorize organic growth is kind of being more of a tailwind in recent quarters and kind of going into 2020? And also remind us will TRANZACT's growth eventually move into the calculation in the back half of 2020?","Mike Burwell","Yes. So starting with your last question first. Yes, TRANZACT, I mean as soon as we get to same-store sales then we will include it in there from an organic growth standpoint. In terms of your question about tailwinds on organic growth, yes in certain of our business if you look at -- we've seen some pricing. So if you look back to our marketplace realities report that we put out most recent one in November 2019 you definitely continue to see price in the marketplace continues to be a tailwind, but equally obviously we got to do the right thing for our customers and clients and thinking through that. But we have seen some pricing tailwind come through that.","And if you look at our organic growth rates we've been right at the market and we look at our peers in terms of what we've been growing at. So when we put out there for organic growth rate for the current year we had 4% to 5% and we build our budgets and we've been pretty consistent around it looking at 4% in terms of how we're more skewed that way in terms of how we think about it. But we're being realistic in recognizing the tailwinds that we see out there. So that's why we went with 4% and 5%.","John Haley","Yes. And the only other thing I'd add to that is that pricing is only one part of the equation for us in the revenue because as prices go up people buy less of it. And so it's the net that is what we're trying to solve for.","Mike Zaremski","And I guess, just lastly to follow up to that. Can you remind us what roughly of your -- on the insurance side of the business the breakdown of commission versus fee?","Mike Burwell","Yes. Mike we really haven't disclosed that. So I appreciate the question, but we really haven't given that information.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome from Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. ","Paul Newsome","Good morning. Just one question left. Does the cash flow change that we had in 2019 and I guess perhaps here in 2020, does that have an impact on the speed at which you're going to be deleveraging the -- over the course of this year?","Mike Burwell","Yes. I mean what -- in a sense that -- we kind of know where the patterns have been I guess we said a couple -- responding to a couple of earlier questions. In that, we obviously pay bonuses -- cash bonuses. At the end of the first quarter, we have tax payments. We have some real outflows of cash. But then we start to see a build through the rest of the year. And the intent is obviously to really deal with that term loan that's out there over the first half of the year or by the end of the second quarter.","Paul Newsome","Okay. So the term loan should be done by the end of this -- hopefully by the end of the first year?","Mike Burwell","Yes. It's a one-year term loan. So...","Paul Newsome","Got it. Appreciate it. Thank you very much.","Mike Burwell","No problem.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS. Your line is now open.","Brian Meredith","Yeah. Thanks. I just have one or two quick ones here left. One just curious, if I look at the TRANZACT margins and just the impact on margins overall, if I kind of look at on a pro forma basis, is TRANZACT assuming you have a full year 2020 and it was full year 2019, is it accretive to the BDA margins and overall company margins, or is it kind of dilutive or in line? I understand that the pressure exist from timing perspective, how it's going to hurt 2020?","Mike Burwell","Yeah. So when we look at the full-year, it will be accretive overall. Again, just going back, when you look at and we talked about this in terms of where the margins ended up in the fourth quarter, we're actually down for BDA overall. And that being down was although TRANZACT has very good margins and we're very pleased with their margins, but you only had five months of expenses and five months of revenue that was included in there. And so the margin was a bit higher and we've normalized that as we think about fiscal year 2020. But to your first question, it is absolutely accretive and we're very excited about -- with that growth and what we're going to see.","John Haley","But accretive but lower percentage margins.","Mike Burwell","Margins.","John Haley","So the TRANZACT margins, when we bring TRANZACT in, it adds to the dollars of earnings we have, but it's a lower percentage.","Brian Meredith","Okay. So it's a lower operating margin percentage. I got you.","John Haley","Exactly.","Brian Meredith","Yes. Got you. And I was wondering if there's any difference like seasonality of TRANZACT versus the rest of your BDA business?","John Haley","Not that different compared to our regular exchange business. Our regular exchange business is a little less seasonal than TRANZACT but not...","Mike Burwell","Not that much.","John Haley","World's apart.","Brian Meredith","Okay. That's helpful. And lastly, I just want to follow-up on Mike's question. Just want to confirm here that in your guidance, you have nothing assumed for kind of improving organic revenue growth in IRR business or the brokerage business CRB business for pricing in the commercialized marketplace?","John Haley","Well, yes, we do. We do have something in there.","Mike Burwell","Yes.","Brian Meredith","And how much roughly? And is it consistent with...","John Haley","We don't go into -- we don't do that. We're saying we want to do things by line of business in this segment.","Mike Burwell","And that's how we build it up, but that's not how we...","John Haley","Yeah, we build it up. And that was an answer I made to an earlier question. We do build up our things by differentially by segment in terms of revenue growth and in terms of margins. So it's -- that's clearly impacted.","Brian Meredith","Got you. Got you. Very helpful. Thank you. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to John Haley for closing remarks.","John Haley","Okay.

Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to John Haley.","John Haley","Thank you, Aida. Good morning, everyone. Today, we\u2019ll review our results for the first quarter of 2017 and discuss the 2017 outlook.","Reported revenues for the first quarter were $2.32 billion, up 4% as compared to the prior-year first quarter. Adjusted revenues for the quarter were up 2% as compared to the prior-year first quarter. Reported and adjusted revenues include $50 million of negative currency movement. As a reminder, adjusted revenues for 2016 include $32 million of revenue not recognized due to purchase accounting rules for the prior-year first quarter. There were no adjustments made to revenue for the first quarter of 2017.","For the quarter, adjusted revenues on an organic basis were up by 5%. Net income for the quarter was $352 million as compared to the prior-year first quarter net income of $245 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $708 million or 30.5% of revenues as compared to the prior-year first quarter adjusted EBITDA of $671 million or 29.6% of adjusted revenues.","We\u2019re pleased to see year-over-year margin enhancement consistent with our goal. This is a testament to the work the team has done over the past year to both drive growth and drive the benefit of our cost-savings initiatives to the profit line.","As a reminder, the first quarter is seasonally high, and while we are on track for our full year margin enhancement goal, margin in subsequent quarters is expected to be seasonally lower.","For the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $2.50 and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $3.71. Currency fluctuations, net of hedging, had a negative impact of $0.10 on adjusted diluted EPS.","Before moving on to the segment results, I\u2019d like to provide an update on three areas of integration: revenue synergies, cost synergies and tax savings. So I\u2019ll start with revenue synergies. Our merger objective identified three specific areas of revenue synergies: global health solutions, the U.S. midmarket exchange and large market P&C. It\u2019s early in the sales season for both the global and U.S. midmarket health care solutions to provide a lot of color around the sales process. However, we currently have a larger pipeline in our global health care solutions than this time last year, and are very pleased with the health care exchange activity in the U.S. midmarket.","Finally, we won 8 large-company broker assignments this past quarter. These wins continue to produce moderate revenues, but we feel very positive about the progress we\u2019re making in developing key relationships and refining our marketing strategies in the U.S. large market P&C space.","As mentioned previously, we surpassed our original goal of a 25% adjusted tax rate, a full year ahead of schedule. We\u2019ve already had a number of questions on President Trump\u2019s proposed tax plan. The current tax plan lacks details and we\u2019ll need to wait until the treasury drafts legislation to better understand its impact.","Our 2017 guidance anticipated achieving $30 million in merger-related savings. We recognized more than $10 million in savings in the first quarter of 2017. We continue to feel very confident in meeting our 2017 savings objectives and achieving the $125 million 2018 savings goal.","Now turning to the Operational Improvement Program or OIP. We\u2019ve saved $12 million year-over-year through the first quarter on a run rate goal of $95 million as we exit 2017. This program remains on track to be completed at the end of 2017.","We\u2019ve made good progress in driving OIP and merger-related savings to the bottom line. However, our focus on cost management remains a priority as this is a key factor for obtaining our 2017 and 2018 margin goals.","One last note before turning to the segment results. I\u2019d like to make a comment regarding the announcement made last month that our U.K. brokerage subsidiary, Willis Limited, is under investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority for possible agreements or concerted practices in the aviation broking sector. The aviation broking business contributes less than $100 million in annual revenue to our company. We are cooperating with the FCA but beyond that, we are not in a position to comment on the status of the investigation.","Now let\u2019s look at each of the segments in more detail. As a reminder, beginning in 2017, we made certain changes that affected our segment results. These changes were detailed in the Form 8-K we filed with the SEC on April 7, 2017.","For the quarter, total reportable segment constant currency commissions and fees growth was 5%. Constant currency commissions and fees for Human Capital & Benefits increased 5%, Corporate Risk & Broking increased 3%, Investment, Risk & Reinsurance increased 5% and Exchange Solutions increased 10%. All of the revenue results discussed in the segment detail and guidance reflect commissions and fees constant currency, unless specifically stated otherwise.","Turning to Human Capital & Benefits or HCB. HCB commissions and fees constant currency and organic growth was 5%. Retirement commissions and fees were up 3% as a result of increased actuarial project demand, primarily due to legislative changes in Great Britain and additional project work in Western Europe, along with the timing of the Easter holidays in both of these geographies.","The Easter holidays were observed in the first quarter of 2016 but in the second quarter of this year. So we expect our second quarter to be somewhat softer than the first.","North America also experienced revenue growth as a result of the continued phase in and of new pension administration clients.","Talent and Rewards commissions and fees were down, primarily due to a decline in new business in North America and Great Britain. As discussed in the previous earnings call, implementation of our new organizational structure and restructuring took place during 2016, requiring internal focus in the second half of the year. However, with the restructuring behind us, we have additional market facing resources and a renewed focus on clients and sales. We expect to build towards growth as the year progresses.","Health care consulting had strong commission and fee growth as a result of strong demand in the midmarket and large market globally. France and Spain placed a number of policies in the first quarter of 2017 that would have normally been placed later in the year, so we may see some softening later in the year. Technology and Administration Solutions or TAS continue to produce strong results due to new clients in the U.K. legislative changes I discussed earlier.","We continue to have a positive outlook for the HCB business in 2017, but expect momentum to slow in the second quarter due to the timing issues mentioned above. We expect commission and fee momentum will then build in the second half of the year.","Turning to Corporate Risk & Broking or CRB, constant currency and organic commissions and fees grew 3% from the prior year. Commissions and fees [increased] in all regions, except for North America. The international region led with strong performance primarily due to strong client retention levels and new business wins. The region\u2019s performance was also helped by regulatory changes which brought business forward into the first quarter. We also experienced solid growth in many of our Asian operations as a result of new business.","Great Britain\u2019s commissions and fees increased due to growth in Construction. As you may recall, both international and Great Britain had low comparables in the first quarter of 2016 as the result of the cancellation of a large energy project. Western Europe grew as a result of retention in new business growth in Southern Europe and most notably, strong new business wins in France. Revenues declined in North America as a result of softness in new business and strong comparables in quarter one of 2016. Client retention stayed strong.","The quarter results were helped by the timing of revenue into Q1 and we may experience a slowdown in growth rates in the second quarter. However, we continue to be optimistic about the momentum in our CRB business going forward. The investments we\u2019re making today, coupled with our analytical approach, will create a powerful proposition to help our clients manage their risks.","Now to Investment, Risk & Reinsurance. Constant currency and organic commissions and fees increased 5% as compared to the prior-year quarter. The reinsurance line of business represents treaty-based reinsurance only. The facultative reinsurance results are captured in the CRB segment. Reinsurance commissions and fees growth was the result of growth in international and specialty, offset by some softness in North America, which was in line with expectations. International benefit by positive timing of policy placement in specialty grew as a result of new business. Wholesale delivered growth as renewals were stronger than expected and a significant policy renewed in the first quarter of this fiscal year as compared to the second quarter of 2016.","Risk Consulting and Software or RCS also experienced strong growth as the result of a greater demand for project work. We\u2019re now seeing traction from the hiring we\u2019ve done over the last 12 months and our updated marketing strategy.","Investment commissions and fees increased as a result of increased performance fees and new wins in the delegated investment services business. While the advisory business grew this quarter, we anticipate a secular decline for these services, but offsetting this decline is an increased demand for delegated services. Max Mathiessen delivered strong growth due to higher performance fees as a result of a more robust European equity market and an increase in new business.","We continue to feel good about the IRR business for 2017, but expect commissions and fees growth will moderate in the second quarter due to the positive timing related to the reinsurance and wholesale business. We also expect a decline in total segment revenues due to the fine arts and jewelry team settlement received in the second quarter of 2016.","As a reminder, we received a onetime $40 million settlement, which was included in other revenues. This not only provides a very difficult revenue comparable, but the second quarter 2016 segment operating margin was enhanced by 8 percentage points.","Lastly, Exchange Solutions commissions and fees increased by 10% from the prior year, driven by increased enrollments, our Retiree and Access Exchanges revenue increased 6%. The rest of the segment increased 16%.","Increased membership and new clients drove the revenue increase in our active employee exchange. The health and welfare and North American pension outsourcing business continue to grow, primarily due to new clients and special projects related to the ACA reporting requirements. Our 2017 sales pipeline continues to look strong especially in the midmarket. For the active exchanges, we also have 6 large clients with about 150,000 total lives that have already committed for the 2018 enrollment period and one large client committed for the 2019 enrollment period. However, we expect the midmarket to continue to adopt at a faster pace than the large companies. We continue to be optimistic about the long-term growth of this business.","As you all know by now, Roger Millay will be retiring in October. So I\u2019ll provide my official congratulations to Roger next quarter. But I\u2019d like to say that Willis Towers Watson has been extremely fortunate to have Roger\u2019s experience and influence during the most crucial period of the merger. We\u2019re clearly seeing the impact of his leadership in these first quarter results.","I also want to thank all of our colleagues who have worked so hard for the last year during some of the most difficult actions we had to undertake in this merger. I hope all of our colleagues are excited as I am about the great results this quarter. The quarter was strong across many lines of businesses and while we benefited from some timing issues, our first quarter results should give us all a clear perspective of the strength and potential of the organization we envisioned as we created Willis Towers Watson.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Roger.","Roger Millay","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Before getting to the results, I\u2019d like to congratulate John on his 40 years with the company. His accomplishments are too numerous to list here, but one fact really stands out. John took the helm as CEO of a private financially troubled company with a value of $120 million, almost 20 years ago. Since then, he\u2019s been masterfully creating shareholder value. He brought Watson Wyatt public, making it the first human resources consulting firm to do so, successfully led the creation of Towers Watson through a merger of equals and, ultimately, helped to create and lead Willis Towers Watson, which now stands at a market value of over $18 billion. John, I hope your next 40 years are as successful as your first 40.","I also want to add my thanks and congratulations to all of our colleagues for producing a really great quarter. A lot of work has gone into this merger and integration. And much of the hardest blocking and tackling was accomplished last year. We built the initial foundation for strong financial discipline which will help us obtain our margin enhancement, growth \u2013 revenue growth and shareholder value creation objectives.","Clearly, there continues to be work to do over the next two years, and we should expect some bumps in the road as we manage through the integration period. However, with the collaboration and the client commitment I\u2019ve experienced firsthand from our colleagues, I\u2019m confident in the long-term success of Willis Towers Watson.","Now for our financial results. As a reminder, our segment margins are before consideration of unallocated corporate costs such as amortization of intangibles, restructuring costs and certain integration expenses resulting from mergers and acquisitions. The segment results include discretionary compensation.","Income from operations for the quarter was $463 million or 20% of revenues. The prior-year first quarter operating income was $326 million or 14.6% of revenues.","Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $681 million or 29.4% of revenues, and the prior-year quarter adjusted operating income was $646 million or 28.5% of adjusted revenues. Our momentum toward clear, consistent and sustainable profit margin growth continues. We like this trend.","There was a $20 million increase in E&O expense during the first quarter of 2017. About half of this increase related to an expected settlement of one of the matters discussed in our SEC filings. The settlement will be discussed in more detail in our upcoming 10-Q filing.","The GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 11.6% and the adjusted tax rate was 15.6%. The lower adjusted tax rate quarter-over-quarter, contributed approximately $0.15 to the adjusted EPS.","The first quarter generally produces the lowest tax rate for the year. The change in stock based compensation accounting policies added $0.01 to adjusted EPS.","Before we discuss the segment operating margins, I\u2019d like to remind you that we provided recast segment operating income for the prior periods in the Form 8-K we filed on April 7, 2017. Additionally, our segment margins are calculated using total segment revenues.","For the first quarter, the operating margin for the HCB segment was 37% compared to 34% in 2016. Margin enhancement was due to revenue growth, the restructuring which took place in late 2016 and general expense management.","CRB had a 19% operating margin has compared to 17% in the prior-year first quarter. Revenue growth accounted for the increase in margin.","For the quarter, Investment, Risk & Reinsurance had a 44% margin as compared to a 40% operating margin in the prior-year first quarter. The margin improvement resulted from increased revenues and expense management.","Exchange Solutions had a 21% margin compared to 26% last year. Retiree and Access Exchanges and TAS led the segment with 37% and 23% operating margins, respectively. But both businesses experienced a drop in quarter-over-quarter margins. We invested resources into the retiree business to bring up service levels and as we phase in new clients in TAS, we often see a short-term decrease in margin.","Moving to the balance sheet. We continue to have a strong financial position. During the quarter, the company refinanced its $800 million revolving credit facility and $218 million associated term loan, both due in 2018, with a new $1.25 billion revolving credit facility maturing in 2022. Additionally, $394 million of the 6.2% notes matured in March 2017. The note repayment was financed using the new revolver as well.","Assuming favorable market conditions, we expect to launch new long-term financing in the second quarter of this year. We plan to use the proceeds to reduce the outstanding balance of the current revolving credit facility.","Free cash flow was $33 million in the first quarter, a decrease from $71 million in the prior-year first quarter. The decrease is primarily due to the full year payment of discretionary bonuses versus a half-year in 2016 for the former Towers Watson colleagues. We continue to focus on enhancing free cash flow in 2017.","This quarter, we repurchased approximately $156 million of Willis Towers Watson stock. As of the end of the first quarter, the remaining stock repurchase authority was more than $975 million.","Now let\u2019s review our guidance for 2017. In fiscal 2017, we continue to expect constant currency revenue growth to be in the 2% to 3% range. Constant currency and organic revenue will be closely aligned as we now have a full year of results for all of the 2015 acquisitions. However, we\u2019ve closed on two smaller transactions: the acquisition of the remaining shares of OAAGC in France and the acquisition of a small defined benefit group in Australia, which are not expected to be material to the overall 2017 guidance.","We expect the adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the 23% to 24% range for the full year. As a reminder, the first quarter margin is seasonally high, and we expect seasonally lower margins as the year progresses.","For segment revenues, we continue to expect low single-digit constant currency commissions and fees growth for HCB, CRB and IRR. Exchange Solutions should have commission and fee growth of approximately 10% with continued retiree growth, enhanced with good growth in TAS and the actives exchange. As a reminder, while we enrolled a record number of employees in the actives exchange, the revenues in this line of business are underweight compared to the retiree revenues.","We continue to expect the adjusted tax rate to be in the 23% to 24% range. As a reminder, there were some onetime discrete items in 2016 that will not be repeated in 2017.","Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $8.40 to $8.55. Guidance assumes average currency exchange rates of $1.25 to the pound, and $1.08 to the euro.","As I mentioned in the last call, 2016 was a year of building a new organization and developing a new focus on financial management. I believe the first quarter of fiscal 2017 shows that we built a foundation for financial success. And while we still have some hurdles to cross as we continue our integration efforts, I remain very optimistic about our long-term prospects.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it back to John.","John Haley","Thanks, Roger. Now, we\u2019ll take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Hi, good morning and thank you very much for taking my questions. John, it looks like a good quarter, a strong organic growth of 5% organic constant currency. There was a decent amount of commentary about some of the timing items. And just for us to get a sense as to what the underlying growth in the improvement over there, do you have a way to kind of tell us what it either quantitatively you\u2019ve calculated what it would be if you\u2019d normalize for some of those items or just your own gut sense, was this 4% organic, 3% organic? Or how should we look at it in terms of, if I would normalize for some of the timing? And then how should we think about that for the second quarter?","John Haley","Yes. So I think, Shlomo, as we think about this \u2013 so let me just say, first of all, we feel very confident. We had out there the guidance for the year of the 2% to 3%. And we look at this first quarter and we say, we think clearly we\u2019re on line to hit the 2% to 3% growth rate for the whole year. And in fact, if anything, we\u2019d expected to be at the higher end of that, rather than the lower end of that. So that\u2019s just about the overall. To the extent that timing affected things, it\u2019s \u2013 we haven\u2019t done an exact calculation of all of these, but it\u2019s probably, it makes it look like a more 4% quarter \u2013 in the 3% to 4% range somewhere there, as opposed to 5%. So I think as we \u2013 one of the reasons that we love this quarter because we talked about the first quarter being a time where we wanted to establish that the sort of turnaround that we had seen in the fourth quarter of 2016, that, that was really an inflection point. We like what this shows. We\u2019re just not ready to raise our guidance for the year yet though, simply because we think there was a little bit of timing that affected things.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Thanks. And then for my follow-up. Can you just give us a little bit more detail on what\u2019s going on in CRB in North America? That\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s been a focus to try and improve the growth over there. That was still \u2013 sounded like it was a negative. Maybe you can talk a little bit more about pipeline or just where it feels like you are? And what we should expect for the balance of the year based on at least what you seeing now?","John Haley","Yes. As we said, for North America, we did see strong client retention levels. But the new business was not as robust as we would have liked. We are \u2013 we think we\u2019re \u2013 it had a tough comparison last year. You may remember last year, in the first quarter, North America was plus 4%. And so as we look at that, we have a tough comparable compared to that, the rest of the year was much lower for North America. We expect that, we have been repositioning our strategy, we\u2019ve repositioned some management. We feel very good about some of the new folks we\u2019re bringing on here. So we expect to see some growth as we get into the latter half of the year.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next session comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Crystal Lu","This Crystal Lu in for Ryan. My first question is also just kind of around that organic growth timing. How far in advance did you know about the possible impact of the timing? And also, what are the impacts of the restructuring efforts on the organic this quarter?","John Haley","And so I think we knew about it as it occurred. I mean, that\u2019s - this was unanticipated bring forward a thing, so we didn\u2019t know about it. The only thing we might have known a little bit about was Easter. We had some sense that it would probably be a better quarter because of that. But most of the other things were just things that occurred. I\u2019m sorry, what was your second question?","Crystal Lu","Just around the restructuring impact on the organic as well.","John Haley","Roger, do you want to handle that?","Roger Millay","Well, sure. I think the main point that we referenced in the script was around the restructuring in Talent Rewards. And I think as John remarked in his script, we anticipate that as the year goes by, that impact will fade.","Crystal Lu","Okay. And then also on the organic expenses, I saw that the total segment expenses came down around 80 basis points year-over-year. Can you kind of help us think about the impacts of FX? And also, I guess just anything else that might have helped that organic expense number come down.","Roger Millay","I think as you point out, so certainly, foreign exchange would have an impact there. But also, again, the restructuring was a result of \u2013 were resulted in expenses being lower year-over-year. So it was the combination of those two things.","Crystal Lu","Okay. Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Mike Phillips","Yes, thanks. It\u2019s Mike Phillips in for Kai Pan. Can you talk about share repurchase? Your first quarter looked like it was pretty strong and I think you had got it to about $500 million for the full year. Is that still in place? And any seasonality for the rest of the year or any kind of stock level that would kind of impact that as we go forward for the rest of the year?","John Haley","Yes. So we continue to attentively look at the intersection of business results and related cash flow on our share repurchase program. And we\u2019re on track for the roughly $0.5 billion that we talked about. And we\u2019ll continue to monitor that through the year, but we\u2019re on track.","Mike Phillips","Okay, thanks. And then if you could just provide just a little more elaboration on just the restructuring integration progress in terms of expense savings for your targets and how that\u2019s looking. You mentioned in your commentary, but if you could elaborate a little more on that, again, just the restructuring integration for expense savings for the year?","Roger Millay","Yes. I\u2019ll lead, I guess, on that. So really, we\u2019re pleased to say that at this point, we\u2019re on track for all of our targets, as noted in the remarks. And there has been a lot of activity, but we\u2019re on track. So it\u2019s going well. And we\u2019ll continue, obviously, to monitor it closely.","Mike Phillips","Okay, great. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Klauber with William Blair. Your line is open.","Adam Klauber","Thanks. The \u2013 seems like throughout comments a number of divisions, the European businesses appear to be picking up. Is that true?","John Haley","Yes. We think we have very good momentum in Europe.","Adam Klauber","Okay. And that seems sustainable? Do you know? Again, you\u2019re seeing that throughout the first half?","John Haley","Well, we liked where the first quarter came out. And a number of our European businesses, a number of the countries were quite strong there. And so we would expect to see that \u2013 we\u2019d expect to see Europe have a good year.","Adam Klauber","Okay. And then on exchanges, we\u2019re hearing it\u2019s a pretty active selling season compared to last year. I guess, would you say that\u2019s true? And also you mentioned 150,000 lives in the larger active market. At this point, how does that compare to last year?","John Haley","It\u2019s the best large market sales we\u2019ve ever had.","Adam Klauber","Great. And how about the \u2013 is the selling season pretty active?","John Haley","Yes, I think the selling season is pretty active. I mean, I think one of the things, and this is particularly true of the large market, that you\u2019ll notice. You\u2019ll see, we have one large client that has committed to 01-01-2019 already. So the larger clients tend to have a longer timeframe from when they decide to go to when they implement. And that\u2019s because they\u2019re somewhat more complex and there\u2019s a lot more moving pieces in terms of doing them, but active sales season.","Adam Klauber","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","Mark Marcon","Good morning. First of all, I\u2019d just like to pass along my congratulations to Roger, it\u2019s been a pleasure working with you over the years.","Roger Millay","Thanks very much, Mark. Same to you.","Mark Marcon","Thanks. Can you talk a little bit more about what you\u2019re seeing on the midmarket in terms of the exchange business? And then I have a follow-up.","John Haley","So I think, Mark, we\u2019re seeing a more active midmarket. I mean, I think we see it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019ve seen a big growth in the number of clients last year. We saw a very large growth. We\u2019re seeing the same kind of thing occurring this year. I think the sales season for the midmarket as I was mentioning, it\u2019s just a longer sales season because there\u2019s a \u2013 we can \u2013 a midmarket client can decide to go later in the year, we can implement much faster than for the large company ones. But although we had this great growth, although we have this great results for the large market, we\u2019re still seeing much faster growth in the midmarket.","Mark Marcon","And are you seeing the full engagement of the Willis health insurance brokers in terms of facilitating that growth? Where would you say we are with regards to the level of execution relative to what you think the potential is?","John Haley","I would say that the major cause of the big increase in midmarket sales is in fact, the engagement that we have from the Willis side of the HCB. They\u2019ve been absolutely terrific in doing that.","Mark Marcon","Great. And then on a completely separate note, can you talk a little bit about where you think the bigger, the biggest incremental opportunities are for savings, among all the different cost programs that we have now on an annualized run-rate basis. You have so many, and we\u2019ve always seen some benefits, obviously. But kind of just lay them out.","Roger Millay","Yes, sure. And Mark, we don\u2019t necessarily rack and stack them in that sort of way. Maybe I\u2019ll just comment on things that are going to build momentum here this year. And one of the things you\u2019d note in John\u2019s remarks about the cost programs is increasing momentum, actually, in the second half of the year. And it\u2019s really the real estate activities as well as the technology activities that are building now and will be in execution mode as we end 2017 and begin 2018. So I think there\u2019s a lot of focus there right now.","Mark Marcon","Terrific, congratulations.","Roger Millay","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi, good morning. My first question is just on your margins. I guess, it\u2019s a two-part question. So you guys reaffirmed your guidance, but said Q1 is stronger than the other quarters. Is that in reference to the Q1 on margin in totality or the level of margin improvement you expect on a quarterly basis? And my second point on the margin front. As you guys saw 90 basis points of margin improvement in the quarter. If I look at the expense saves you gave, the merger savings and the OIP savings, I get about 100 basis points of margin just from your expense program. So I\u2019m a little surprised that a 5% organic that we\u2019re not seeing greater leverage on the margin front and more of margin improvement. If you can just talk to that as well?","Roger Millay","Sure. So relative, Elyse, to the seasonal patterns, we do have seasonality of margins. That is inherent in the business. So a strong seasonality of revenues in the first quarter, also reasonably strong in the fourth quarter. Those will tend to be higher margin quarters and the second and third, softer. The only thing I\u2019d say about what to expect in the pattern of margin enhancement that is of note and it came out in the script, that is the impact of the fine arts and jewelry settlement last year. So given that, that was in the GAAP earnings, that created a tough comparable for the second quarter, it really needs to be pulled out. So given that, we don\u2019t expect that same kind of growth in margin in the second quarter. I\u2019m sorry, can you repeat the second half of your question?","Elyse Greenspan","Yes. So the second part of the question, you guys reported 90 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion in the first quarter. If I add together the OIP savings that you alluded to in the quarter, the $12 million, plus $10 million of merger-related savings, the $22 million, gets me about 100 basis points of margin improvement from expense savings initiatives. So that would mean that there\u2019s actual margin contraction in your core business outside of just the savings coming to the bottom line. I\u2019m just a little bit surprised, if you saw 5% organic revenue growth in the quarter, a strong number. We\u2019ve seen other brokers expand their margins at a greater level, at a lower level of organic revenue.","Roger Millay","Yes. Thanks for that, sorry for blanking. But the thing I\u2019d point out relative to that question is \u2013 and it\u2019s really the reason we I pointed it out \u2013 the E&O related activity of about $20 million this quarter. So that really, it\u2019s all at one-time or whatever, episodic type expense that won\u2019t continue of that level. And that was again, driven largely by a particular settlement that we booked this quarter. So that really offset the savings, but won\u2019t repeat in the next few quarters.","Elyse Greenspan","And that comes out in the unallocated expense line?","Roger Millay","Yes, it does. Yes.","Elyse Greenspan","And then if I could also follow-up on the organic revenue growth in the quarter. So you guys reported a 5%, in response to an earlier question, you said maybe more in the 3% to 4% range, ex timing. Q1 is \u2013 when you write, when you book the majority of your revenue, strongest revenue quarter. So if you\u2019re thinking, if you\u2019re leaving your guidance at a 2% to 3%, my math will translate into something of about 1% organic growth over the next three quarters to hit that target. I understand the timing difference between the Q1 and the Q2. But if you are optimistic about the second of the year and some of the initiatives in some of your segments that you alluded to in the prepared remarks, why not raise on the organic growth outlook today?","Roger Millay","Well, again, and I think John might have alluded to it in some of his comments and he might want to make more here. But one, the timing, I would say, is of course, quite real here and there were specific transactions. And they did pull some of what otherwise would have been growth in the second quarter. And particularly, the specific transactions that John alluded to. So we\u2019re on track for the kind of overall momentum that we expected for the year. As John said, probably looking more towards the top of the range. And I haven\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t know yet, I think your 1% calculation might be to get to the bottom of the range. But we feel good about where we are and what we thought for the year, and it would be early to change that.","Operator","And I\u2019m showing no further questions at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to John Haley for any closing remarks.","John Haley","Okay. Great. Thanks very much, everyone, for joining us this morning, and I look forward to talking to you at our second quarter earnings call in August.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference.

Please go ahead.","John Haley","Okay, thanks very much. And good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our second quarter earnings call. Joining me here today is Mike Burwell, our Chief Financial Officer and Mitch Keith, Head of Investor Relations. Today we'll review our results for the second quarter and the first half of 2019 as well as update the outlook for the remainder of the year.","I'm pleased with our second quarter financial results and the continued momentum in our business. We generated strong organic top-line growth of 6% for the second quarter of 2019 and 160 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion.","This marks the fourth consecutive quarter in which we\u2019ve generated organic revenue growth of 5% or greater and improved margins. Likewise, we had revenue and operating margin growth in each of our business segments this quarter, reflecting solid demand for our solutions and services throughout our portfolio of businesses.","This has been an exciting and productive quarter for Willis Towers Watson, and as I reflect on our second quarter and the year-to-date results, I'm extremely pleased with the significant steps we've made to improve the company's growth profile and position the company for continued long-term growth.","In our core businesses, we've had great success driven by new business generation, strong retention rates and increased operating leverage across our core businesses.","On the acquisition front, I'm delighted to announce that we completed the TRANZACT acquisition yesterday and today we welcome over 1300 talented colleagues from TRANZACT to the Willis Towers Watson community.","There is tremendous energy and optimism around the benefits of this powerful combination. The TRANZACT acquisition rapidly accelerates Willis Towers Watson's direct-to-consumer us healthcare strategy and significantly strengthens Willis Towers Watson\u2019s growth profile in the healthcare space.","TRANZACT provides Willis Towers Watson with a true end to end consumer acquisition and engagement platform for healthcare, by adding scale, retail capabilities to our portfolio of expertise, and it significantly enhances our reach and agility in penetrating the expanse of the Medicare market.","Also, this strategic acquisition positions us for success in the unsubsidized individual consumer portion of the Medicare market space that we currently do not widely serve, and it opens up new service offering opportunities. Similarly, it allows us to efficiently and effectively capitalize on the secular trends that are currently driving growth in the Medicare space.","Together will have tremendous capacity with a licensed agent workforce of over 2000. Moreover, TRANZACT\u2019s leading edge digital technology capabilities and sales and marketing expertise, combined with Willis Towers Watson\u2019s scale and operational excellence further strengthens our position as the leader in the growing private Medicare marketplace.","Most important, we believe that this acquisition creates value for all stakeholders, for our clients and consumers, it broadens our client base so that we can help individuals and underserved markets navigate their healthcare options.","For our business partners, it will allow us to develop deeper collaborative relationships, especially with our carrier partners, as well as deliver greater volume. And for our shareholders, it creates both immediate accretion as well as significant long-term revenue and profitable growth opportunities.","In addition to TRANZACT, we'll continue to execute our broader growth strategies around innovation. We believe our investments in innovation have helped further enhance a business portfolio and improve the integrated value proposition we deliver to clients, as well as help us continue our leading position the areas in which we operate.","Innovation at Willis Towers Watson is an important element of what it is that we bring to life. To that end, we're continuing to invest in new innovative solutions as in recent years, we've introduced several specialty solutions, such as Life Site, AMX, Innovisk and Connected Risk Intelligence.","Building on this progress, we recently announced two initiatives that we've implemented that are targeted to create further organic and inorganic growth. The first is our launch of WTW strategic ventures, an initiative aimed at creating strategic growth opportunities by investing in emerging digital and technology enabled businesses across insurance, risk and human capital.","The second initiative includes the formation of a new growth board, which will increase the company's organic innovation efforts by supporting early stage ideas that have the potential to create new markets, new customer channels and new business models. Working together with our existing new venture investment committee the growth board will help to expand Willis Towers Watson's innovation pipeline.","WTW strategic ventures is core to the company's growth strategy by enhancing our capabilities to identify and develop strategic opportunities and alliances aimed at delivering tangible value to our clients.","These new initiatives will source investments and utilize relationships within the venture capital community, clients and industry connections to support innovation or inorganically and organically with the growth board to create new offerings in areas of strategic interest of the company.","Now let's move on to our second quarter 2019 results. Reported revenue for the second quarter was $2 billion, up 3% as compared to the prior year second quarter and up 6% on a constant currency and organic basis. Recorded revenue included $51 million of negative currency movement. Once again, this quarter, we experienced growth on both on organic basis across all of our segments.","Net income was $149 million, up 129% for the second quarter, as compared to the $65 million of net income in the prior year second quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $425 million, or 21% of revenue, as compared to the prior year adjusted EBITDA thought for the second quarter of $392 million, or 20% of revenue, representing an 8% increase on an adjusted dollar basis.","For the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $1.06, an increase of 141% compared to the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.78 reflecting an increase of 5% compared to prior year.","Overall, it was a solid quarter. We grew revenue and earnings per share and had enhanced adjusted EBITDA margin performance. For the first half of the year, we're very pleased with our financial results, reported revenue growth for the first half of 2019 was up 2% as compared to the same period in the prior year and up 5% on both the constant currency and organic basis. ","Adjusted EBITDA for the first half of 2019 was $1 billion or 23.5% of revenue, an increase from adjusted EBITDA of $949 million, or 22.2% of revenue for the same period of the prior year, representing an increase of 130 basis points in adjusted EBITDA margin over the same period in the prior year.","Now, let\u2019s look at each of the segments in some more detail. To provide clear comparability with prior periods, all commentary regarding the results of our segments will be on organic basis unless specifically stated otherwise.","Segment margins are calculated using segment revenues and they exclude unallocated corporate costs, such as amortization of intangibles, certain transaction and integration expenses resulting from M&A as well as other items which we consider non-core to our operating results. The segment results do include discretionary compensation.","Revenue for our largest segment, human capital and benefits, HCB was up 5% on an organic and constant currency basis, compared to the second quarter of the prior year. For the first half of the year, HCB revenues grew 4% organically.","The Health and Benefits business delivered another strong performance this quarter with revenue growth of 12%. New Business and product revenue continue to drive revenue expansion in North America, while our accelerating market share and global benefit management appointments contributed to the growth in other geographies. Health and Benefits revenue growth was also aided by the lower revenue comparable in the prior year\u2019s second quarter. The prior year results reflect the impact of adopting the new revenue standard ASC 606, which resulted in certain revenue not being recognized.","Talent and rewards revenue increased 5% as a result of increased advisory and survey work in North America and Great Britain, technology and administration solutions revenue increased 6%. This quarter, the growth was to build a new business activity primarily in Western Europe and Great Britain.","While most of HCB\u2019s businesses grew, we did experience a decline in retirement revenue of 1%. This is mainly as a result of the impact of a tough comparable from the prior year, which benefited from non-recurring project work.","HCBs operating margin improved by 200 basis points to 21% compared to the prior year second quarter. HCB has the services products and intellectual capital that match the many issues our clients are facing. HCB is anchored by a strength in core service offerings, and we remain confident in the segments ability to deliver growth well into the future.","Now let's look at corporate risk and broking or CRB, which had a revenue increase of 5% on a constant currency and organic basis as compared to the prior year\u2019s second quarter. For the first half of the year, CRB revenues grew 5% organically.","North America's revenue grew by 6% in the second quarter, primarily as a result of new business, the International regions revenue 0.8% compared to prior year. This growth was largely driven by new business wins and higher renewals in Central America and the Caribbean, as well as new business wins in Asia and Australasia.","Western Europe contributed 5% revenue growth, with the growth led by strongly renewals in Sweden, in addition and two business wins in large and mid-market accounts, in Iberia and France. Great Britain had 4% revenue growth predominantly from aerospace business, driven by satellite launches and transit activity.","CRB revenue was $690 million, with an operating margin of 15% as compared to a 14% operating margin in the prior year second quarter. The margin expanded due to the top line performance coupled with continued cost management efforts.","As a side note, I'd like to say how pleased I am with the progress the management team and all of our colleagues and CRB have made over the last year to see the steady top line growth and continued margin expansion is excellent and our outlook on our CRB business remains positive going forward.","Turning to investment risk and reinsurance or IRR, revenue for the second quarter increased 9% to $409 million on a constant currency basis and increased 8% on an organic basis as compared to the prior year\u2019s second quarter, with clear acceleration in all lines of business. For the first half of the year, IRR revenues grew 6% organically.","Reinsurance with growth of 10% continue to lead the segments growth through a combination of net new business and favorable renewals, insurance consulting and technology grew by 7% mainly from technology product sales, investment revenue increased 4%, with continued expansion of the delegated Investment Services portfolio. Assets under delegated management reached $135 billion at quarter end.","On an organic basis wholesale revenue increased by 11%, driven by growth in specialty and overall wholesale business was up 20%, including results from Miller's acquisition of Alston Gayler.","Our Max Matthiessen business grew 6% primarily from increased commission income. IRR had revenue of $409 million and an operating margin of 27% compared to 23% for the prior year second quarter. This improvement reflects top line growth alongside scaling of successful businesses. Overall, we continue to feel positive about the momentum of our IRR business for 2019.","Revenues for the BDA segment increased by 6% from the prior year\u2019s second quarter, primarily due to increasing membership counts and client base. Project work and out of scope services further enhance the segments revenue growth. Individual marketplace revenue returned to growth this quarter as seasonality for this business continues to shift, benefit outsourcing revenues grew 13% as a result of new client wins in special projects.","For the first half of the year, BDA revenue grew 8% organically. The BDA segment hit revenue by $126 million with a negative 20% operating margin, up approximately 600 basis points from the negative 26% in the prior year second quarter.","Top-line growth in greater operating leverage both contributed to the segments margin improvement. Our BDA offerings remain fundamental to our business growth engines of our enterprise strategy the addition of TRANZACT will further produce the growth, we\u2019re excited about the long-term growth potential of this business.","So, in summary I'm very pleased with our continued progress in the second quarter. We produced strong revenue growth meaningful margin expansion and adjusted EPS growth all will continue in invest in our future and return capital to shareholders through dividends. I\u2019d like to thank our 43,000 plus colleagues for their contributions, our talented colleagues and the way they serve clients recorded our long-term success and they delivered another quarter of strong results.","I continue to be inspired by their energy and passion for serving our clients and their unwavering dedication to creating a truly winning client experience. As we look forward into the remainder of 2019 and beyond our future remains bright.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike.","Mike Burwell","Thanks, John and I would like to add my congratulations to our colleagues for another good quarter as well as thank our clients for their continued support and trust in us.","As John mentioned, we\u2019re very excited about the completion of the TRANZACT acquisition. As this transaction shows Willis Towers Watson renewed focus on strategic M&A opportunities.","Our second quarter represented another positive result with strong organic revenue growth, robust margin expansion and underlying adjusted EPS growth. Now, I\u2019ll turn on to the overall detailed financial results.","Let me first discuss income from operations. Income from operations for the second quarter was $176 million or 8.6% of revenue, up 540 basis points from the prior year second quarter. Adjusted operating income for the second quarter was $299 million or 14.6% of revenue, up a 160 basis points from the prior year second quarter.","Let me turn to earnings per share or EPS, for the second quarter of 2019 and 2018 our diluted EPS was a $1.06 and $0.44 respectively. The prior year quarter was impacted by $0.55 of transaction integration expenses.","For the second quarter of 2019, our adjusted EPS was up 5% to a $1.78 per share as compared to a $1.70 per share in the prior year second quarter. Foreign currency caused the decrease our consolidated revenue of $51 million for the quarter compared to the prior year second quarter but had no impact to adjusted diluted earnings per share this quarter.","As previously guided, we were adversely impacted by decrease in non-cash pension income compared to the prior year, which resulted in year-over-year decline of 14% this quarter. Excluding the combined headwinds for reduced pension returns of $0.14 and higher taxes of $0.04 versus the prior year second quarter. Adjusted EPS growth was approximately 15%.","Talking about our effective tax rate, our U.S. GAAP tax rate for the second quarter was 19.7% versus 12.7% in the prior year second quarter. Our adjusted income tax rate for the second quarter was 21.4%, up from the 19.7% rate in the prior year second quarter. The increase in effective tax rate for the quarter compared to the prior year was primarily due to additional taxes on global intangible low tax income or GILTI.","We continue to evaluate the impact of global tax reform on our effective tax rate including effective new taxes associated with computations for changes resulting from update interpretations, thus assumptions issued by the various taxing authorities.","As a result of the effective tax rate subject to movements and we\u2019ll continue to update as more analysis and information becomes available.","Moving to the balance sheet. We continue to have a strong financial position. As a reminder in the first quarter, we implemented the new lease accounting standard, this result had no material impact on our operating income but did result in an increase in liabilities on our balance sheet which were largely offset by a corresponding increase in assets. The gross up totaled approximately $1.5 billion.","During the quarter, we generated $287 million of free cash flow bringing our year-to-date free cash flow to $183 million, a decrease from free cash flow of $254 million for the first half of the prior year. The year-over-year decline of free cash flow was due to higher compensation payments as well as some timing related to cash tax payments. We\u2019re expecting free cash flow to build over the remainder of 2019.","In May, our Board of Directors approved our quarterly cash dividend of $0.65 per share. In terms of capital allocation, we paid approximately $84 million in dividends and repurchased 51 million of Willis Towers Watson stock in second quarter of 2019.","Related to the TRANZACT acquisition, we have principally financed the purchase through debt. As part of the acquisition of TRANZACT, we have secured financing up to 1.1 billion in the form of a one-year unsecured term loan. We're committed to deleveraging in the near-term returning our leverage ratio to historic levels.","As we move ahead into the third quarter, I'd like to review our revised outlook. Willis Towers Watson is raising its 2019 guidance, primarily to reflect the acquisition of TRANZACT. For the company, we now expect constant currency revenue growth for 2019 to be in the range of 7% to 8% and organic revenue growth in the range from 4% to 5%.","Full year adjusted operating income margin expected to be around 20%. The adjusted effective tax rate is still expected to be around 22%. It's going to be a potential discrete item and we expect free cash flow growth of 50% or better.","Now, moving on to transaction integration expenses, we expect to incur between 20 million to 25 million of cost as a result of the TRANZACT acquisition primarily related to transaction costs associated with the deal. Foreign exchange was immaterial to adjust the EPA in the second quarter of 2019, but was $0.12 headwind to adjusted EPS in the first quarter of 2019.","We expect FX to be around $0.03 headwind adjusted - to adjusted EPS for the remainder of the year, resulting in an overall headwind of about $0.15 for the full year 2019. We are raising our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance to a range of $10.75 to $11.10 for the full year for 2019 versus our previous guidance of $10.60 to $10.85.","Overall, we delivered solid financial performance in the second quarter. I'm pleased with the results and the continued momentum of our businesses, there is still a lot of opportunity ahead. We remain focused on driving and making sure we execute.","And I'll turn the call back to you, John.","John Haley","Thanks, Mike. And with that, I'd like to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Slomo [ph] of Stifel. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, thank you very much for taking questions. Hey, John, it seems like you've had a pretty good run here for the last four quarters with really a good organic growth that is accelerated. And I don't usually ask this kind of question. But 4% to 5% organic growth does imply like you're expecting something else to decelerate from the first half of the year in the second half of the year.","But it seems like the momentum is pretty good. Is there just tougher comps it just I wanted to make sure you're 100% of ability to deliver. Can you just give us a little bit more of your outlook for the second half of the year in that context?","John Haley","Yes, sure. Thanks. Thanks, Slomo. I think we're not. We're not suggesting really that we think anything is going to decelerate here. I guess when we came out with the -- we initially had the 4% growth that we said we'd be at for the year. So, the first is -- the first half came in at five. And so, we said, well, we think we'll be 4 to 5.","When we first came out with the 4% growth, I know there were some of our competitors had some higher growth projections. And we said, well, the fact that workflow shouldn't be interpreted as we think we're going to grow slower than the market. And I would say the same thing here. We've just sort of taken the floor and raised it up front to reflect what happened in the first half. You shouldn't think we think we're going to grow slower than the market.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. And then do you mind just discussing a little bit about the operating environment in the UK, given the political situation in the Brexit items? It seems like, you know, there was some slowdown just in general in the UK in the first quarter, but it seems like things are seem a lot better right now, if you can just comment on that.","John Haley","Yes, I mean, our growth, we had some good growth in the UK, it was 4% this quarter. And we feel we feel pretty good about that. And in fact, actually, particularly of CRB, we were receiving some declines last year. So, we feel much better about that.","I think, you know, Brexit is still a bit of an uncertainty. We have done a lot of planning around Brexit ourselves, though. And we feel like we're prepared for that. And, so we'll have to see what happens. But we feel we're about as prepared as we could be.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Marcon of R. W. Baird. Your line is open.","Mark Marcon","Good morning and congrats on the strong progress that we continue to see. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the 3 different questions. One, free cash flow growth of 15%. How confident are you still in the ability to generate that for this year and then for the next few years? That's the first question.","John Haley","Okay. I think, Mike will take care of that.","Mike Burwell","So, thank you for the question Mark. Like prior years, we expect the second half the year to be seasonally stronger from a free cash flow standpoint. Now, during the first half the year we had higher compensation payments, as well as timing related to cash payments for income taxes, which had an adverse effect on our free cash flow.","But some of the last year, we knew coming into 2019 that we had to continue challenge around improving working capital and we're taking actions to improve free cash flow during the remainder of the year and specifically focused on working capital.","Mark Marcon","Great. And then can you talk a little bit about TRANZACT and how we should think about that, particularly as it relates to the fourth quarter? Obviously, that's the time when we get the enrollments and benefit from that?","Mike Burwell","Go ahead, John.","John Haley","Yes. I just say, look, we did raise our guidance, as Mike said, and that was mostly the result of TRANZACT, not a 100%. But in TRANZACT will most of the impact the TRANZACT by the overwhelming impact will be in the fourth quarter?","Mark Marcon","Can you just talk a little bit about the margin? I mean, obviously, seasonally high. So just from a modeling perspective, how we should think about it?","Mike Burwell","Yes, I mean, TRANZACT from a margin standpoint, we see it consistent with what we targeted for the overall company from a margin standpoint Mark, so we don't see it different.","Mark Marcon","Okay, great. And then the last thing, Mercer with JLT, yesterday there was some discussion about how their book was looking. I was wondering what you're seeing in terms of opportunities in terms of share gains as a result of that transaction, both in terms of people and business?","Mike Burwell","Yes, I think, we've seen our reinsurance business being very strong. John commented in his comments or prepared comments at 10% overall. And so, part of that's coming from continued wins and strong market conditions that we've seen out there. So, I think it's encapsulated in those in those numbers, Mark.","Mark Marcon","Terrific. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi, good morning. My first question goes back to the TRANZACT acquisition as well. When you guys announced this deal earlier this year. I know you had said that it would be accretive relative to earnings. But that was assuming no buyback. And so, you guys return to the market and didn't buy back some stock in the Q2, which seemed sooner. I think the new guys and mistreated expected. Can you just give us a thought around buybacks? And because you're now buying back share sooner. It does seem like the deal might be more accretive relative to your initial expectations.","Mike Burwell","Elyse, I mean, we've always said and maybe just to make sure that was understood previously that we would buy back shares to make sure, we manage dilution in regard to our benefit programs, to be in place, and that's what we've continue to do.","So, there is no different assumptions that that's been there. Obviously, we're very excited about TRANZACT and what we see that's going to do for us in the future. That's what we reflected and taking the earnings guidance up.","So, we're very excited about what TRANZACT brings to the company. And as John said, we welcome those colleagues to the company and we're very excited about it.","John Haley","But just to be clear going forward here. While we're basically paying down the debt for TRANZACT. The only stock buybacks will do will be anti-dilution ones.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, that's helpful. And then also on TRANZACT. Could you give us a sense of what their organic revenue growth has been through the first half of the year? I know when you guys announced the deal, you said, you were expecting 25% to 30% revenue growth. How does that compare to those expectations?","Mike Burwell","Yes, it's right in that range. So, we're very excited about it. Obviously, it's right spot into that range and maybe pushing the top end of it to be fair. I mean the market is very strong. We've seen that reflected overall and demand obviously, the big piece comes in the fourth quarter. But that's what we're seeing overall in terms of individuals. So, we've kind of put that 25% to 30% that we touched on over the next five years was what we're thinking about.","John Haley","And we see no reason to change that, that's still our expectation going forward.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. And then lastly on TRANZACT, the margins within your BDA segment are seasonally highest in the fourth quarter. Obviously, negative earnings through the first three quarters. So, I just want to get a sense of we're offsetting our models correctly. I'm assuming your updated guidance assuming TRANZACT follows that same seasonality. ","So, would report a loss to be margin dilutive for two months of the third quarter since it just closed and then be accretive to your margins in the fourth quarter? Am I thinking about that correctly? Or am I missing anything there and thinking about the guide and how to update for the next couple of quarters?","Mike Burwell","No. You've got it. That's right.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg Peters with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning, John. Good morning, Mike. This is this is Marcos calling in for Greg. I had a couple questions. First on HCB. You guys singled out the revenue that wasn't there last year. But I'm just curious if we were to back that revenue and last quarter. What would operating margin expansion look like this quarter?","Mike Burwell","It would be roughly about 2%.","Rich Keefe","It's Rich. Are you referring just HCB? What will be the margin? I think that's your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Yeah, you guys picked up 200 basis points or so this quarter. So, I'm just curious if that revenue were to be there last year? What would the pickup be this year?","Rich Keefe","Yeah, it's roughly flat.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. My second question is on free cash flow. And it's related a TRANZACT. If we understand it correctly, the MA and MS business is free cash flow negative the first two or three years. And you guys reiterated your free cash flow guidance. So, let's say if we were to buy TRANZACT, would that imply that free cash flow could be growing in the high teens over the next couple of years?","John Haley","The overall TRANZACT business is about -- it's not -- it's pretty much neutral. It's pretty close to zero. It's not a negative.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then Mike, can you just revisit your comments around pension? And that's all I have. Thanks guys.","Mike Burwell","So, on pension, if you remember we talked about, with the pension got valued at December 31, 2018, which obviously the market was way down at that point in time, this is still that, that portion of it. That obviously gave a headwind offsetting our pension income that we would have in the current year. And that's what we reflected in our results. Had we not had that amount included in there, it would have been roughly $23 million, that would that would have impacted those numbers had you taken that that out?","So, when you adjust for that that pension amount of that $0.14, and equally, you added back the headwind that we had on taxes, it sets our growth rate for the quarter would have been greater than approximately 15%. So that's what that's what I was trying to comment on.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Hughes of SunTrust. Your line is open.","Mark Hughes","Yeah, thank you very much. The quarterly revenue spread for TRANZACT. Is it's similar to the underlying BDA business?","Mike Burwell","Yes.","John Haley","Yes.","Mark Hughes","And then did you consider maybe stepping up your investment in TRANZACT and the call centers to accelerate growth seems like the market opportunity is quite strong. Do you maybe try to grab some share here early on?","Mike Burwell","When we think about it today, we have over 2000 agents that are in place. And obviously, the individuals may come through online, they may come through call centers, they're coming through various aspects of it. Clearly, we're seeing the market is strong and preparing for the annual enrollment period in the fourth quarter. And so, our combined team under Gene Wickes' leadership is really looking at and making sure we're well prepared, given the market dynamics that are in place and working with all the leaders associated with it.","So, we definitely see, opportunity, and we think we're well-prepared for it. And we feel good about the size of our organization to support that growth.","John Haley","I mean, I think that's the key. We think we're prepared to handle the growth that's out there. And so, we feel good.","Mark Hughes","Understood. And then my final question, is there any concentration among the carrier partners you work with, with TRANZACT? Do you or is there any goal of increasing the breadth of the carrier partners?","Mike Burwell","Look at it and will continue to evaluate it. I mean, you know, will do that with that leadership team. I mean, you want to be smart about, you know, doing anything when coming up to the annual enrolment period. I know. I mean, obviously, we just close the transaction yesterday. So, we'll continue I know Gene, and the team will evaluate that and, you know, all opportunities that are out there, and we'll consider, you know, what, what makes sense?","John Haley","Having said that, that we'd like to, we'd like the way things are set now. So, I wouldn't expect it now suddenly see any changes? Will it will always continue to evaluate it.","Mark Hughes","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Meyer Shields of KBW. Your line is open.","Meyer Shields","Great, thanks. Good morning. John, I'm hoping you could talk about the thought process underlying the changing exposure to incentive payments for the TRANZACT deal.","John Haley","Yes, so look, I think, from our standpoint, we had a -- we've got some certainty in the payments that we were making there. And, you know, we feel we feel pretty good about getting that because frankly, we're pretty bullish on TRANZACT. And so, we felt that -- we felt this serves us better doing that, and I think, as in all different cases, it has to be something that works for both sides. But I think the other side like the idea of getting some certainty and what they had to and so, we were able to come to an agreement on that, and we're delighted.","Meyer Shields","Okay, understood. Also, and maybe just question for Mike. Can, we get an update on the margin expansion initiatives specific to CRB?","Mike Burwell","Yes, I mean, I think if we went back to the last quarter phone call, we had, we had touched on a -- that we would consistently see improvement and CRB margins. And that's what we've can continue to see. So, we're up one point, and the current quarter. Todd, and the team, you know, are working on that. And, as I said, it is going to see some giant ramp ups just slow and steady and continue to see that progress. And I think that's what you're seeing in the 1% growth this quarter.","Meyer Shields","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Yaron Kinar of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Yaron Kinar","Thank you. Good morning. First question, just going back to the ASC 606 catch up. Can you quantify what the dollar impact was?","Mike Burwell","It was roughly 23 million.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. And then going roughly...","John Haley","It roughly offsets the pension.","Mike Burwell","Yes.","Yaron Kinar","Right. Okay. And in line what was part of guidance, I guess, for the quarter. Then on free cash flow, I guess on the previous question around 16% growth this year? I think I heard the kinds of the moving elements in the second half of the year, and I fully recognize that second half tends to be much larger. But can you confirm that you're still expecting 15% or greater growth this year?","Mike Burwell","That's what we're working towards we know, it's a challenge just like it was for us last year in terms of moving in that direction. We have the entire team, you know, very focused on it like we did similar to last year. But yes, it is a it is a challenge for us. And we recognize that. And that's going to work our tails off as a collective team. Just do everything we can to achieve that.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. And then finally, TRANZACT revenues. They will not be going through organic this coming year. Right. They there's they're going to come in through acquired.","Mike Burwell","That's correct.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. Thank you very much. Best of luck.","John Haley","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Meredith of UBS. Your line is open.","Brian Meredith","Yes, thanks. One quick numbers question and one more broader question. First, just quickly numbers, like the Stanford litigation payments that's still factored in free cash flow kind of guidance for this year.","Mike Burwell","Yes, as of right now it is, we're continuing to work on that. If that changes, we will update you.","John Haley","Yeah. By the way, the Stanford payment may occur this year, but it may not also.","Brian Meredith","Well I guess the question, would free cash flow growth be greater than the 15%, without Stanford?","Mike Burwell","Yeah, I mean, right now, we'd always looked at you had the integration costs, the rolling in, you had Stanford coming in there, you have a mix of things in there. We've always said, 15% was kind of where we were in, if we were lucky, we'd be better.","Brian Meredith","Got you. Terrific. And then just quickly, I'm just curious, you briefly talked a little bit about pricing, what you're seeing pricing and commercial insurance, great growth, obviously, in the wholesale Miller's, what impact are you seeing from a revenue perspective, from pricing, and perhaps maybe, do we see that potentially having a better impact going for particularly from Miller\u2019s as you start to see maybe capital freed-up at Lloyd's?","John Haley","Well, I think, look, we're -- this is a better environment, then we've had for a while. We've had these years of the rates going down, and now we're seeing most lines workers comp is probably one of the key examples, workers comp and international liability are the ones that where we're seeing rates going down, continuing.","But the rest of them, we're seeing some pricing uplift. And that's probably good news for the insurance industry, for a long-time insurance were really competing for market share by driving down prices, and they probably got this something that wasn't really that sustainable. And so that's why we're seeing some of these rate increases.","For us, it's one of the things we have to do in the face of some rate increases is see what we can do to get as good a bargain for our clients as possible. And sometimes that is that suggests moving in some business or looking for other alternatives, or maybe buying a little less insurance.","So, it's not clear we always get the effect of all the rates. And then sometimes only a portion of our businesses commission based a lot of it in fees also. So, it doesn't automatically flow through but when there's rate increases, generally it does tend to improve our results.","Brian Meredith","Great. Thanks for the answer.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Zaremski of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, this is actually Charlie on for Mike. Just one quick question. Can you guys talk about the mix of cyber business as far as the proportion of consulting versus broking and how this performance or trend in those businesses have been deferring or what trends you're seeing if they're similar? Thanks.","Mike Burwell","Yeah, I mean, obviously, cyber is been very strong. It's not a huge in terms of its aggregate size, most of it is been brokering and suddenly a brokering business, it's not to say we are doing some consulting, but the majority of it is in the brokering business.","And it continues to grow double digit type of numbers, but of a small base, but we continue to see that opportunity, as the marketplace is looking for that solution. And we continue to see that growing in the foreseeable future.","John Haley","I guess the only thing I'd add to that is that, and as Mike said, this is that we're at the beginning stages of this market really growing. But in addition to North America and Great Britain, we're now seeing some good growth in the emerging cyber insurance markets like Western Europe, Latin America and Southeast Asia.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And I have a follow-up with Slomo Rosenthal [ph] of Stifel. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, thank you for letting me back in. Hey, first one, I just want to ask Mike, if you could just help us out a little bit more on the TRANZACT acquisition just in terms of modeling, just because it seems like there's an outsize contribution in 2019 because you're going to have a really big fourth quarter, and not really get the losses that you would get for most of the rest of the year.","Would you be able to just kind of help us in terms of contribution that you're expecting in earnings, specifically from the acquisition? And if we were to have it for the whole year, what it would be so that we can kind of model this appropriately for 2020.","Mike Burwell","You know, I mean, Slomo, I think your premises is right, obviously, we're not having 12 months of expenses, for instance, we closed on July, the end of July here and would have that only that portion of expenses and obvious most of the revenue, as we touched on is coming through the AE, annual period.","We had said total growth at 7% to 8%. We said we're at 4% to 5% in terms of organic growth, obviously that\u2019s not the 100% number but it gives you a good direction to it. And most of that is coming in the fourth quarter in terms of what to be in place, and maybe Rich will follow back up with you with any further questions you may have.","John Haley","I mean the only other things Slomo, we're really not in a position to go through with a lot of detail as Mike is saying right now. But I would say this, and I think I mentioned this in response to an earlier question. Most of the earnings guidance, the earnings increase that we did for guidance that\u2019s almost all due to TRANZACT.","Unidentified Analyst","Alright I\u2019m going to follow up after wards also just to see if I can put that little bit out there. And then just one other.","John Haley","I recognized that it\u2019s a little difficult but as Mike said your premise is right, it\u2019s the money is made in the fourth quarter and the losses in the beginning. But we just don\u2019t really feel where the position to do that right now, that something we do 2020 guidance.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Just one last one John on following-up on mayors question on the renegotiation of the terms, do you feel like you can hold the sellers feet to the fire with or not being like normally down to like 17 million or so I mean it seems like the I understand that taking up the lower purchase price.","But why would -- if there is the same kind of confidence in your side -- is there was -- is there is on their side to execute the way that they would it's only 2020 target your talk about 18 months later it just seems interesting that there kind of reducing their almost their entire risk to that.","John Haley","I mean I would say two things, one is I think they did very, very well already on the TRANZACT acquisition and getting rid of that and if they have the money right away and some certainty around it then they can invest that and so, that gives them some other opportunities.","I mean you really have to ask them exactly why they wanted to do what they wanted to do. But for us TRANZACT was ahead of where we thought they would be, and we feel good about where they are and so it was something that we were happy to do that.","The management team to TRANZACT is still on the original deal that we had and the original incentives. So, we feel with them, with no change to the earn out we feel very good about that.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Elyse Greenspan","Just a few kinds of number related questions first of in terms of the [indiscernible] in HCB coming back. You got 23 million this quarter so is the assumption still that the reaming 25 million would come into third quarter?","John Haley","Almost all of it, yes. I mean that the vast majority.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then in terms of minority interest picked up to 11 million in the quarter, is the only that cause that to just tick up from where it had been trending and then what you know within that line item how should we think about modeling forward.","Mike Burwell","I mean what drove that was Miller specifically and I think that\u2019s the right, the model going forward and again if you want to give, Rich can give you some more thoughts on that that Miller was the main driver there.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay that\u2019s helpful and then in terms of couple of question on the BDA segment margin. So, first of on the legacy BDA before TRANZACT. You guys have shown I know obviously used the margins are negative in that segment for the first three quarters, but they've actually been trending better year-over-year less negative, would you expect that to continue in the third quarter on kind of the legacy BDA business and you still expect TRANZACT to about a 25% which is what you said when the deal is announced.","Mike Burwell","I mean at least just as it relates to the overall margins in BDA, we really got away from given any segment guidance we come and said overall that we get our operating income around 20% but we continue to focus on improvements in that business and the leadership team will continue to do that.","So, there is still opportunity there, but I put it in that particular context and your second question as it relates to TRANZACT what we see that is consistent with what we see for the overall company is in that type of range.","John Haley","And the only other thing maybe Elyse I would add to that is that we were looking to get margin improvement everywhere and then BDA is no different than that, 600 basis points is a lot. So, I wouldn't necessarily assume that we\u2019ll continue to get 600 basis points.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. I appreciate the color. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And this concludes the Q&A portion of today\u2019s conference. I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Mr. Haley for closing comments.","John Haley","Okay great thanks everyone for joining us this morning. And we look forward to updating you on our third quarter call in the fall. Have a good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day."],"22772":["Willis Towers Watson Plc (NASDAQ:WLTW) Q1 2016 Earnings Call May  6, 2016  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Aida Sukys - Head of Investor Relations","John Haley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Roger Millay - Chief Financial Officer","Analysts","Ryan Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","David Styblo - Jefferies","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co.","Tim McHugh - William Blair & Co.","Operator","Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to your Willis Towers Watson Q1 Fiscal Year 2016 Earnings Call.

Today, we'll review our results for the first quarter of 2016 and provide some guidance for the full year of 2016. We'll provide consolidated 2016 and certain pro forma 2015 financial results for this quarter. Our segment results for this quarter are presented based on the legacy Willis and Towers Watson structure. We anticipate providing consolidated segment results for the second quarter of 2016 during our August earnings call.","Before we review our first quarter 2016 results, I'd like to say how pleased I am to see the focus and excitement our colleagues have brought to the marketplace and the collaboration that's taking place at all levels of the organization.","I want to thank all of our colleagues for the spirit they've shown to-date and all of the hard work that's keeping us on point for achieving our long-term goals. We're pleased with how we performed this quarter. Reported revenues for the quarter were $2.2 billion, which includes $53 million of negative currency movement on a pro forma basis.","Despite the currency headwinds, adjusted revenues, which include $32 million of deferred revenues, were up 16% on a constant currency basis and 1% on an organic basis. Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $671 million or 29.6% of adjusted revenues. The prior year first quarter pro forma adjusted EBITDA was $579 million or 28.8%. The growth in adjusted EBITDA is primarily due to the acquisitions of Miller and Gras Savoye. Miller and Gras Savoye produced most of the profits in the first half of the calendar year.","Income from operations for the quarter was $326 million or 15% of revenue. The prior year first quarter pro forma operating income was $369 million or 18%. Adjusted income from operations for the quarter was $646 million or 28.5% of adjusted revenues, and for the prior year quarter, was $540 million or 26.8% on a pro forma basis. For the quarter, earnings per diluted share were $1.75 and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $3.41. Roger will address the adjusted EPS in more detail later in the call.","I'd also like to provide an update on three areas of integration, revenue synergies, cost synergies and tax savings. First, let's discuss the revenue synergies. We recently updated our revenue tracking tools and plan to have more detailed revenue synergy updates by the third quarter. However, as I travel to the various offices and see firsthand the collaborative sales efforts and hear about our market success, it's clear our colleagues are not waiting for a top-down integration mandate or reporting tools to go-to-market.","We're making very good inroads in the three areas of revenue synergies we've outlined in our previous communications, global healthcare solutions, the mid-market healthcare exchange and the U.S. large market P&C sector. We've won another three global healthcare solution clients and the pipeline looks very strong.","Turning to the mid-market exchange opportunities, we've won nine new clients for the 2017 enrollment season and continue to see the pipeline build. Lastly, in the U.S. P&C large company space, we were awarded all the P&C lines for a multi-billion dollar construction organization.","We're also seeing some success in areas we didn't fully appreciate prior to the merger. As an example, we were recently awarded the global P&C business for a large multi-national based outside of the U.S. The sales team incorporated the knowledge of the company from both legacy organizations, so then we could tailor a solution that was in alignment with the client's needs.","The client noted that our strong collaboration and the depth of our analytical capabilities set us apart from the competition and help us look at the prevailing risk and data issues from a very new and different perspective.","Within just four weeks of bringing Willis Towers Watson together, we were able to come together as a single global team and radically changed the way the client viewed Willis Towers Watson.","We also experienced a win recently with a French multinational in an area where we have no formal revenue synergy targets. Gras Savoye had a long-standing relationship with this client in healthcare, and property and casualty. Joining forces with the Gras Savoye relationship team was a team of talent and reward consultants, who were hired for pay grading project. This is a great example of a full array of services we can now provide our clients.","While these early wins may not have a significant and immediate financial impact, we're very pleased with the progress we've made towards our revenue synergies. These wins are further proof of the strong cultural alignment in the merged organizations and perhaps most importantly, these wins demonstrate that when we put client needs first and help them succeed, we will succeed. Seeing the overall level of sales activity we've had to date, I'm more confident than ever about our achieving our 2018 revenue synergy objectives.","Now, moving to the cost and tax synergies. We announced post-merger cost synergies of $100 million to $125 million and tax savings of approximately $75 million annually, with these objectives achievable over a three-year post-merger integration period. We budgeted $20 million in cost synergies for 2016 with an expected run rate of approximately $30 million of annualized savings and fully expect to meet our overall savings objectives by the end of 2018. We should ultimately exceed our tax goal of $75 million of annual tax savings.","As a side note, regarding the recently-issued Treasury rules, our outside advisers and tax group reviewed the Treasury regulations thoroughly and we feel confident these regulations will not impact our current or longer-term tax savings. I'd also like to address the legacy Willis operational improvement program or now what we'll refer to as the OIP. We continue to see this program as an important factor in achieving our 25% adjusted EBITDA margin objective by the end of 2018. We'll continue to provide color on the program and highlight savings, but we'll focus on the margin impact rather than the spread between revenue and expense growth.","Incremental savings from the OIP were approximately $94 million as compared to the first quarter of 2015. The momentum of continuing savings will be sustained throughout the year. We continue to be committed to saving $325 million by the end of 2017. This quarter, we incurred about $25 million of restructuring costs and overall will spend approximately $140 million in 2016. This program continues to be on track to meet all of its financial objectives.","One significant step taking place this month is the restructuring of mid and back-office colleagues in Great Britain. As a reminder, much of the program is focused on streamlining processes and moving office and administrative functions to lower-cost locations.","Great Britain was one of the first regions to adopt the OIP and now entering the last phase of the project. They're on track to obtain their saving goals on schedule and on budget. We continue to believe that the majority of the company OIP savings will drop to the bottom line and we're driving internal accountabilities to ensure that happens. We will have more detailed information on margin impact during our Analyst Day in September.","Now, I'll review the first quarter 2016 legacy Towers Watson segment results and outlook and Roger will provide the legacy Willis results and provide updated 2016 guidance for Willis Towers Watson. As we discuss segment margins or operating margins, please note the metrics include different items for each of the legacy companies.","The Willis margins include amortization, cash incentives and some of the restructuring costs, whereas Towers Watson margins exclude amortization of intangibles resulting from merger and acquisition costs and discretionary compensation.","Now, let's look at the performance as well as our revenue and margin expectations of each of legacy Towers Watson segments. On an overall constant currency basis, revenues in Benefits increased 1%, Exchange Solutions increased 57%, Risk and Financial Services decreased 4% and Talent and Rewards decreased 9%. All of the revenue results discussed in the segment detail and guidance will reflect constant currency unless specifically stated otherwise. So, let's look at each segment in more depth starting with Benefits.","For the quarter, the Benefits segment had revenues of $486 million, which represents a 1% increase as compared to a 5% pro forma revenue increase in the first quarter of 2015. Retirement revenues decreased by 2%, Health and Group Benefits revenues grew by 8%, and Technology and Administration Solution revenues were up 8%.","We don't anticipate any special demand for actuarial consulting services in 2016. Demand is expected to be good for healthcare consulting and technology and administration is expected to go live with many client implementations throughout the year, which will drive additional revenues. We expect Benefits 2016 revenue growth will be in the low-single-digit range. Benefits had an NOI margin of 36%, and we continue to expect this segment to be in the mid-30% range for calendar 2016.","Exchange Solutions had an outstanding quarter with revenues of $152 million, a pro forma increase of 57%. On an organic basis, the Exchange Solutions segment grew by 48%. Driven by record enrollments, our Retiree and Access Exchange revenues increased 47%, and the Other Exchange Solutions businesses increased 73% and 49% on an organic basis.","Increased enrollments and new client revenues drove the revenue increases. Our consumer-directed accounts practice also contributed approximately $9 million in revenue this quarter. We believe the increase in lives will continue to support good growth for the rest of 2016, but we don't expect much off-cycle work during the calendar year.","We have increased revenue growth expectations from low to mid-20% to a high 20% range for calendar year 2016. Exchange Solutions had a 30% NOI margin as compared to 21% in last year's first quarter. The Retiree and Access Exchanges line of business led the segment with a 48% NOI margin. For 2016, we expect the Exchange Solutions segment margin to be in the high teens. As a reminder, margins are seasonally higher in the first half of the calendar year as compared to the second half of the calendar year.","For the quarter, Risk and Financial Services had revenues of $144 million, a pro forma decline of 4%. Risk Consulting and Software revenues decreased 5% due to a softness in EMEA life consulting and a general softness in demand in the Americas. Investment revenue decreased by 2%, primarily driven by revenue declines in EMEA as demand softened for advisory services. The Risk and Financial Services segment is expected to have low-single-digit revenue growth for calendar year 2016.","We recently invested in senior marketing staff, and the pipeline appears to be greater than at this point last year. We anticipate the impact of our marketing investments to impact revenues in the second half of the year. In addition, the prior-year comparables for investment aren't as tough. Risk and Financial Services had a 23% NOI margin, and we expect to manage the business to achieve mid-20% margins.","Now, let's move on to Talent and Rewards, which had revenues of $124 million, down 9% on a pro forma constant currency basis and down 6% on a pro forma organic basis as compared to the prior-year quarter, which experienced 15% revenue growth. Executive Compensation revenues were down 1% as compared to 11% growth in the first quarter of calendar year 2015. Data surveys and technology revenues decreased by 15%. We saw a 4% decline on an organic basis as compared to a strong comparable of 9% revenue growth in the first quarter of calendar year 2015. As a reminder, we acquired Saville consulting and sold our HR Service Delivery business.","Rewards, Talent and Communication revenues decreased 9% as compared to 23% growth in the first quarter of calendar year 2015. Talent and Rewards had a 10% NOI margin for the quarter. The first half of the calendar year is generally soft for this segment. We see an overall decrease in the number of transactions in the market globally, and as a result, we anticipate this impacting the segment's top-line results. Given that, we're lowering our revenue outlook from a mid-single-digit constant currency revenue growth to a low- to mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2016 with margins in the mid-20% range.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Roger.","Roger Millay","Thanks, John, and good morning to everyone. I'd like to first reiterate John's comment on the great collaboration we're experiencing in Willis Towers Watson. The level of engagement I've seen from the operating committee members to colleagues around the globe has been tremendous. It really is an exciting time to be part of Willis Towers Watson, and based on the foundation being created now, I look forward to a very successful future.","Before moving to the performance of the legacy Willis segments, I'd like to add more color around John's comments regarding the adjusted diluted earnings per share for the first quarter. I'd also like to discuss a couple of noteworthy adjustments to earnings, which were highlighted in the press release today.","There were two significant positive impacts to adjusted diluted earnings per share. First, our adjusted tax rate came in at 19%, which was lower than our forecast due to the seasonal strength of our profitability this quarter. We expect higher tax rates in the coming quarters, particularly in those quarters with seasonally lower operating profit.","Second, our outstanding weighted average diluted share count came in lower than expected due to the merger closing four days into the quarter. This lowered our average diluted share count to approximately 136 million; the current outstanding diluted shares are approximately 138 million.","Now, let me turn to the reconciliation of segment operating income to income from operations, which was highlighted in our press release this morning. Most of these adjustments are self-explanatory, but I thought there were two items which perhaps needed some additional explanation.","First, amortization of $126 million represents the intangibles amortization, which is excluded from the legacy Towers Watson segment results. In addition to this, there is $35 million of amortization expense reported in the legacy Willis segment results. The reporting treatment will be uniform next quarter when we report on the consolidated Willis Towers Watson segments.","Second, as we've described in public filings, relevant parties have agreed in principle to settle the Stanford litigation for $120 million and seek a court-issued bar order against all Stanford-related claims. We recorded a $70 million provision in the December quarter based on the facts and circumstances at the time. The balance of $50 million was recorded in the first quarter once the settlement amount and terms were agreed. The settlement will need final court approval which, if granted, may take several quarters. This is still ongoing litigation, so we're not able to provide more detail beyond what we've already said in our public filings.","Now, let me turn to the legacy Willis segment performance. On an overall constant currency basis, commissions and fees, or C&F for International increased by 84%; North America increased 3%; Capital, Wholesale and Reinsurance increased by 14%; and Great Britain was flat. All of the C&F results discussed in the segment detail and guidance reflect constant currency unless specifically stated otherwise. Now, let's look at each of the legacy Willis segments in more depth.","Turning to Willis International. With the consolidation of Gras Savoye, which contributed $235 million to revenue in the quarter, the top line grew 84% from the prior year. Gras Savoye's contribution for the quarter was a bit ahead of plan. On an organic basis, International C&F declined by 5%. This was driven by weakness in Asia and a cancellation adjustment for a large national resources project. This cancellation was not related to the economic environment of the energy sector, but was political in nature. We continued to see strong growth in Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa. The segment's operating profit margin was 30% this quarter. Our outlook for organic C&F growth for the full year is in the mid-single-digit range with net operating margin in the low- to mid-teens range.","Willis North America had a nice start to the year with organic C&F growth of 4%. The segment saw strength in all of its core regions across a number of lines of business, most notably construction, financial institutions and FINEX despite modest pricing headwinds.","The Human Capital Practice also contributed mid-single-digit organic growth during the quarter. The segment's operating margin of 23% was modestly ahead of our expectations and highlights some of the strategic changes we've been making related to the operational improvement program. The outlook for Willis North America organic C&F growth continues to be in the low- to mid-single digits with a margin in the high teens.","Now turning to Willis Capital, Wholesale and Reinsurance. CW&R generated commissions and fees growth of 14%, driven primarily by the contributions of Miller Insurance Services, which contributed $49 million of C&F in the quarter.","Organic C&F declined 3%, primarily due to the year-over-year decline of our Fine Arts and Jewelry business as a result of the departure of the team of associates to JLT, for which we recently settled litigation as well as a strong comparable in the reinsurance business which benefited last year by an uplift of $6.5 million on a restructured account. CWR's operating margin was 46% as this segment's business is seasonally weighted towards the first half of the year. We expect reported growth to be in the low double digits, as Miller fully rolls on through the first half of the year.","Organic C&F growth is expected to be in the low-single-digit range in 2016, assuming we don't see any significant further deterioration of reinsurance rates. I should note that in our growth guidance for CWR on a commission and fees basis is lower than the total revenues guidance we provided previously. This results from the fact that the earlier guidance included the anticipated impact of the $40 million settlement with JLT, which will be recognized in the second quarter as other income in total revenues. This item will not be adjusted out of GAAP earnings consistent with the historic practice. We expect operating margin to be in the low 20% range.","Finally, Willis GB C&F growth was flat for the quarter. The cancellation adjustment for the large natural resources project mentioned earlier also impacted Willis GB. Organic C&F declined 2%. Excluding the impact of the natural resources project, organic growth would have been up approximately 2%. The segment's reported operating margin was 14%, modestly lower as compared to the prior year, driven by the project-related revenue decline and some one-time expense adjustments.","We continue to have a positive outlook for the business and these one-time revenue and expense events which occurred this quarter are not indicative of our future outlook. Our outlook for organic C&F growth is in the low single-digit range with margin in the high 20% range.","Moving to the balance sheet, we continue to have a strong financial position. We issued $1 billion of U.S. dollar notes in March, $450 million at 3.5% with a maturity date of September 2021 and $550 million at 4.4% with a maturity date of March 2026. We expect to go to the euro market for an additional $600 million to $800 million. Being in the market recently and finalizing the timing of our refinancing, we expect our interest charges to be approximately $200 million for the year 2016.","The proceeds from the dollar offering were used to repay our $300 million public note which matured in March, repay the $400 million U.S. dollar tranche of our one-year bank note and reduce the outstanding balance in our revolving credit facility.","Let me turn now to capital allocation. As we mentioned during the last earnings call, we expect to have a capital allocation approach focused on flexibility while maintaining an investment-grade rated balance sheet. On a Moody's basis, this equates to a threshold of approximately 3.5 times debt-to-EBITDA. Currently, our Moody's debt-to-EBITDA ratio is around 3.7 times. We expect this to self-correct over the next several quarters as our restructuring expenses decline, merger-related cost reduction programs are implemented and profits increase.","We believe we have several hundred million dollars of capital allocation flexibility for the second half of the year. As always, we will weigh the benefit of potential acquisitions versus repurchasing shares. We prefer to do good acquisitions and after that look to share buybacks, consistent with our commitment to maximizing shareholder returns.","Free cash flow was $70 million this quarter. Free cash flow is expected to generally improve through each consecutive quarter during the calendar year. This quarter we've paid approximately $500 million in incentive compensation which included the normal pay cycle for former Willis colleagues and a partial year bonus for former Towers Watson associates. Additionally, we contributed approximately $40 million to our defined benefit pension plans.","Now let's review our guidance for fiscal 2016. We'll continue to incur various merger and integration related costs. These costs will continue to be material as we work through the integration period and we expect them to be in approximately the $150 million to $170 million \u2013 I'm sorry, $175 million range for 2016. The level of spending will depend on how quickly we move through some of the integration activities.","Both deferred revenues and transaction integration related costs will be adjusted from our GAAP measures. In fiscal 2016, we continue to expect constant currency revenue growth to be in the low double-digits with the primary drivers being the Miller and Gras Savoye acquisitions. For purposes of segment guidance, we'll use commissions and fees which excludes other revenue. As noted previously, a legal settlement of approximately $40 million will be posted to other income in the second quarter.","As we guide to overall company performance, we'll use total revenues which includes fees and commissions and other revenues. We continue to expect organic revenue growth to be in the mid-single-digits, but based on the first quarter results, our expectations are a bit muted versus the beginning of the year.","Adjusted operating income margin is anticipated to be around 20%, an increase from our previous guidance of around 19.5%. In calendar 2015, adjusted operating income was 19.1%.The adjusted tax rate is expected to be in the 23% to 24% range. The current GAAP rate of approximately 7% is due to a number of factors, but the main driver is related to the valuation of intangibles as a result of purchase accounting. The amortization of the intangibles is somewhat front end loaded and the current GAAP rate will not be sustained over time.","We continue to expect adjusted EPS in the range of $7.70 to $7.95 based on average currency rates of $1.43 to the pound and $1.10 to the euro. While we've maintained our overall revenue growth projections, the first quarter has dampened the range of this growth. Our leadership team is aligned and committed to manage expenses as needed to achieve our 2016 adjusted EPS goal.","Once again, we have many moving pieces related to the merger and integration, but I'm extremely pleased with how things are progressing. Our intent is to continue to streamline reporting over the next several quarters and provide a clear line of sight to our operations and results.","Now I'll turn it back to John.","John Haley","Thanks, Roger. And now we'll take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ryan Tunis of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Ryan Tunis","Hey, thanks. Good morning. I guess just taking a step back, I mean your comment that your view on organic over the full year is a bit muted based on what you saw in the first quarter, just hoping you could talk a little bit about the areas looking out over the rest of the year, where your expectations may be a little bit muted relative to where they were.","Roger Millay","Yeah. I mean, certainly, as you look across the legacy segments of both firms, there were areas that came in a little bit softer and I think the legacy Towers Watson RFS segment is one of those pieces. As we mentioned, the Talent and Rewards business came in softer than we expected, and we're not seeing the kind of project activity that we saw there last year. And then International within legacy Willis and the CWR segment is a little bit softer. So I think those are all the areas that we're a little bit off where we expected. We do think that some of the elements there are timing in nature, so perhaps you might look at our guidance and be surprised that we're not a little bit more muted.","But we think that in Asia, we mentioned Asia and International, there were some deals that didn't come in, in the first quarter, but we see them coming in later in the year. And also, as I mentioned, there were, in a couple segments, there were some tougher comparables that don't repeat later in the year. So we think a little bit muted is the way to look at it.","Ryan Tunis","Okay. Thanks. And I just had a follow-up on the treasury action and the tax guidance. We saw the press release reiterating the $75 mill. I mean it seems like the \u2013 I also appreciate it's not really an inversion, but of the $75 mill, should we think about that predominantly coming from inter-company debt, or are there other \u2013 to what extent's the $75 mill dependent on the inter-company interest versus other forms of tax planning and just redomestication?","Roger Millay","Yeah. I think, broadly, we were focused on efficiency of capital structure and efficiency of inter-company arrangements as we structure the legal entity setup for the merger. We do have inter-company debt there of course, and that is one of the elements that drives our tax efficiencies. And we're mindful of other opportunities and continue to work on it. So \u2013 and I think as we mentioned in our press release and discussion a month or two ago, given that our merger was closed in January and the new treasury regulations came out in April, we're very comfortable with the sustainability of our structure and the tax synergies that we mentioned.","Ryan Tunis","Thanks for the answers.","Roger Millay","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Michael Nannizzi","Thanks so much. I guess just a follow-up on Ryan's question in a second on the regs. But just looking at overall organic, we can focus more on Willis for the moment. In margins, when I look at peers, margins are in the mid 20%s, organic growth has been running, you know, 3%, 4% here recently, so your organic was negative adjusting for items or flattish. Margins sound like you're kind of \u2013 if we take the International and North America, in the aggregate, looks like you're looking at mid-teens margins. Why is that? Because I would guess \u2013 obviously, those margins that you're talking about are excluding the operational improvement program and other adjustments. What is that delta and how should we think about what Willis can do to try and close that gap?","Roger Millay","Well, thanks, Michael. Look, I think this goes back to the overall merger strategy and setup and what we're implementing. I can't really comment on the margin gap that you just articulated, but it doesn't sound all that dissimilar to what we were thinking about when we set the 25% EBITDA margin target for the overall company.","We think there's opportunity there. We think that OIP is clearly a great asset to have as we move towards that target, and is producing real results. So we do think as you look at some comparables that there's opportunity to enhance margin, and we're on the case. So I think that's the margin piece.","I would say broadly, and maybe John wants to comment on this a little bit relative to our past experience, but when you look at the growth results here versus other players in the market, first, legacy Willis was moving the last couple years organically in that 3% to 4% range. There were some headwinds this quarter. Some of those were again timing in nature, including the pipeline adjustment that we talked about which was probably worth about 0.5 point of growth.","So I think you consider the overall merger activity and you look at comparables and I think, again, we're confident in improved growth, organic growth as we go through the year, and while \u2013 again, a little bit muted, we think we're in an okay place here as we start the year.","Michael Nannizzi","Okay; fine. That's helpful. I mean I guess when you --","John Haley","Yeah, Roger, I guess I would just \u2013 maybe just to follow-up just a little bit of what Roger said. When we look back as to where Willis had been over the last three years against our main competitor, Willis grew \u2013 the revenue growth was actually higher than our main competitors. We've outlined what we think are some of the specifics for why the growth was somewhat off this quarter, but we don't expect those to be continuing issues.","Michael Nannizzi","I see. I guess, I mean, I guess my question is sort of looking at sort of the base broker model and \u2013 I mean organic growth is certainly an ingredient for sustainable margin expansion. And so kind of looking at where you are now and given the growth just sort of worked against you and maybe the merger, some of the elements of the merger will ultimately sort of resolve themselves, but maybe there's a period of transition between.","I'm just trying to figure out how is that \u2013 and I get the overall EBITDA margins, but if I just look at International and North America which is comparable to the way others report sort of the brokerage or risk business, what is that gap and sort of who's the person, the enabler that's going to kind of drive the direction of that margin back towards that sort of peer group?","Roger Millay","Well, I mean, I guess I'll comment first. Look, I think that we're very committed to and very focused on our integration activities, completing the OIP program and driving to the 25% margin, and we believe that, that 25% margin is in the range of what we see competitors achieve. The team, the operating team and our overall leadership is aligned around that goal. So we will drive towards that goal through our businesses and through our operating leaders. And so I think, I mean I'm not sure exactly what you're getting at in your question, but I think it's the alignment. Again, it's observing what others can do in our market and the alignment with our business leaders that's going to achieve success here.","Michael Nannizzi","I'm not \u2013 I'm just asking. My question was just simply to not \u2013 it's just straightforward. It's just sort of looking at sort of where others with similar platforms are on a margin basis and sort of looking \u2013 so have you guys been trying to understand how we get from point A to point B, that's all. That was my own question. Okay. And then, as far as \u2013 just real quick on the amortization, Roger, you mentioned the Willis be \u2013 so should we then assume that starting in the second quarter, the amortization charge within Willis, that 35 million or the equivalent of that number in subsequent quarters, will be excluded from the operating income number? Is that kind of what you were implying?","Roger Millay","Yeah. That's exactly right. And again, I'll say I guess we feel your pain relative to the differences between the two legacy companies, so that's why we pointed out those numbers as we now move in the second quarter to the new segments and the way we'll talk about them on a consistent basis. All amortization of intangibles will be excluded from adjusted operating earnings. So exactly what you said. And we think that will provide much greater clarity year-to-year. You won't have that M&A impact of intangibles interfering with the clarity of how operating margins are moving. So...","Michael Nannizzi","Got it, great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Your line is open.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. John, one of the rationales for the merger was improving the Exchange Solutions trajectory, trajectory improved dramatically actually in the quarter from expectations. Could you talk a little bit more, was it participants that came in better, are you selling more services per client, what's going on over there?","John Haley","Yeah. So thanks, Shlomo. I think generally all things around Exchange Solutions were really looking pretty positive there. We did benefit from the biggest retiree client we'd ever implemented, and so that added a lot of lives. But we have now as of the middle of last year, we had \u2013 we were up to a little close to 1.2 million, just under 1.2 million of total covered lives, from you know 730,000 the year before. We'll be growing that again this year. So the lives are going up everywhere. We are seeing \u2013 we're beginning to see some of the increased selling in the midmarket that we had expected. It's still early days for that. And I mean I think when I went through the different revenue synergies I acknowledged, we're seeing these things for the Exchange Solutions and for some of the others, but it's still really early.","I mean most of those revenue synergies, we will see them in the back half of the three years, not in the end. I think the important thing from my viewpoint though is how quickly we're starting to at least see some of them come in and it's very encouraging for the long-term trend. I think \u2013 so it was really a confluence of different things, but on Exchange Solutions, we're delighted with just the growth in the retirees, in the actives and really across the board there.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Are you going to give us some forecast for this year or are we going to get that in June? I mean historically last few years you've been giving that for \u2013 when it was just Towers Watson.","John Haley","Yeah. Generally, we've been doing that. We'll probably do that Analyst Day is really when we're going to have some good numbers, Shlomo. That's what it's been the last year or two. And the problem as you know is that the selling season of course for the middle market runs throughout the year pretty much. But the larger part of the middle market and the large market, it's not over till really June or July or sometime there. So it's a while before we have really good information.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay. And then can you give a little bit more detail on the political item that resulted to large cancellation impacted both two units in Willis, how much was that in itself a factor of muting the growth? And I'm not sure if there's anything that you feel comfortable elaborating on that to get us a little more comfortable we're not going to see a recurrence of that.","John Haley","So let me just say this about that. As Roger said, it was \u2013 it probably knocked about a 0.5% off the growth rate. It was something -- it was sort of a one-time event that caused this we think, but we don't necessarily -- this is the kind of thing that we might even see this reversed in the remainder of the year. And so we're not banking on that, but that's not impossible.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay.","Roger Millay","It was about $10 million, Shlomo. So...","Shlomo Rosenbaum","In total for both units?","Roger Millay","Yes, split 50\/50 too.","John Haley","Yeah.","Roger Millay","Yeah.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","And then for the whole year, the impact would be expected to be $40 million?","Roger Millay","No, no, no. That \u2013 this is a separate matter.","John Haley","No, no. It's a one-time $10 million comp, no.","Roger Millay","Yeah. That \u2013 yeah.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","One-time $10 million. So it's 0.5% of...","John Haley","I mean that's the $10 million for the whole year, yes.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay. So the muted growth for the year is not specifically from \u2013 inordinate amount from this one contract?","John Haley","I think the muted growth is really a reflection of an overall mosaic of what's going on, and I think what Roger I think was trying to paint is a picture that looks like this, we have some specific items that we can see that caused some issues here and like the pipeline and so we see that. Whether \u2013 even if it doesn't come back, it's not going to be a repeat during the rest of the year, so we're sort of past that in some respects there. When we look at it, and you saw particularly when I was going through the legacy Towers Watson, we had some very tough comparables from a year ago. You saw a little bit of that when Roger was going through the legacy Willis things. The comparables get easier as we go through the year. So we're not saying that everything is going to pick up exactly to where it might have been. But overall, we're not feeling that downbeat about the growth. We think it'll be a little bit lower than we thought going into the year, but we're not \u2013 we're \u2013 it's not necessarily that far off.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","If you don't mind, just can you bridge for us what gets better in the second half? Because we're going from 1% growth to mid-single-digits which most people would think is 4% for the whole year or above. What gets a lot better? Is it just the comps get that much easier, and therefore, we have a lot better comps or is there something else in the numbers that are going to get better?","John Haley","I think partly the comps get better. I mean I think if you look at some of the \u2013 let me just give you one example. If you look at some of the bulk lump sum work that was very heavy in the first quarter of calendar 2015 and faded off somewhat in the remainder of the year.","Roger Millay","Yeah. I mean maybe, Shlomo, just a few other things that we might have mentioned, I think we're \u2013 we think that investment will do better the rest of the year than it did in the first quarter just based on the pipeline that we see. One of the things that I think we alluded to, we haven't really discussed in the Q&A here is the impact in Talent and Rewards of the sale of the human resource service delivery business, so we'll lap that at some point this year.","Talent and Rewards, I think the headline numbers make it look worse this quarter than it really is. And there \u2013 I guess John said, there are some tough comparables from projects they had going on at this time last year that we won't repeat. And then you do have again some of the timing things we mentioned before. So I think again we've gone through each of the business lines, looked at them closely and we do think that this kind of muted view of mid-single-digit organic growth is really what our momentum reflects at this point.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay. Thank you very much, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dave Styblo of Jefferies. Your line is open.","David Styblo","Hi there. Good morning and thanks for the questions. Maybe I'll move off organic growth for a minute and just talk a little bit more about EBITDA which I think did come in pretty strong, both on a dollar basis and the margin side. So can you maybe flesh out a little bit of what happened in there, what sort of cost synergies and why you're able to sort of keep a higher EBITDA despite the top line being a little bit more challenging right now? And then maybe how do we think about that trajectory going forward?","Roger Millay","Yeah. I mean I think, again the trajectory that we expect from an EBITDA margin point of view and I won't say necessarily every quarter, but given our focus, we expect gradually improving EBITDA margins. For this quarter particularly, one thing, and we mentioned it just briefly in the script that was a little bit stronger than our forecast and led to some of the margin enhancement again versus what we expected is Gras Savoye came in stronger in the first quarter than expected. Some of that was just due to some revenue accounting comparability between the two firms. So we haven't changed our view on the full year for Gras Savoye, and they're coming in nicely. But it did give some acceleration into the first quarter.","I think otherwise, OIP savings are flowing in. I think the team was attentive and you might recall if you follow both the legacy companies, there was cost activity going on as we entered the merger in both companies. And we're seeing a benefit of that, so I think otherwise there's disciplined operating activity going on.","I mean we did mention again and it is unfortunate with the project cancellation that we mentioned earlier, but when you look at the two parts of legacy Willis that were furthest advanced in the OIP program, both North America and GB are seeing a benefit now in their margins of OIP. Unfortunately in GB, because of the cancellation, it's not as visible as it otherwise would have been.","David Styblo","Okay. And maybe...","John Haley","And, Roger, just I guess the other \u2013 and to make sure we're clear about this that the \u2013 quarter one and quarter two to a lesser extent are seasonally strong for EBITDA, so \u2013 and for margins, and that's true in a lot of the legacy Willis segments. It's certainly true in the Exchange Solutions, which is quite heavily weighted that way. So, while we expect to have strong margin performance throughout the year, the strongest part of it is this first quarter and to a lesser extent the second quarter.","David Styblo","Sure. Okay. Maybe you can also talk about the OIP and are you sticking to sort of the gross savings target that was originally out there? I think it was $150 million \u2013 excuse me, $150 million for this year. If that's the holding, can you tell us what you expect the net savings to be because I think thus far sort of on the legacy Willis side we've seen the growth savings come, but a lot of it was being put back in. So I'm wondering when the inflection point comes where shareholders get a chance to see more of the return of those growth savings hit the bottom line.","John Haley","Yeah. So I think \u2013 look, the OIP is one of the single most important things we're focusing on right now is to make sure that those savings do indeed drop to the bottom line. And it's a \u2013 it's one of the major focuses of the operating committee, is to make sure that we see those go through. And we're going to be looking very, very carefully at any reinvestment and try to maximize the amount that drops through. We'll probably \u2013 I think I mentioned earlier, we'll be able to give you more color around that as \u2013 at the Analyst Day in September. But that is one of the two or three major focuses of the organization at this point.","David Styblo","Okay. And then, lastly, maybe getting back to your capital deployment plans, I know there was sort of a commitment to start to repurchase shares in the second half of this year. It sounds like maybe a little bit more balanced of keeping some dry powder for M&A. Can you talk about what sort of you expect your share repurchases to look like? I don't think at this point you have an authorization, so maybe you could remind me about that. And also, if you want to touch upon the free cash flow outlook, I think we were hoping to get a little bit more visibility on that as you think about things with the \u2013 not only for this year but going forward over the next couple of years as those one-time expenses roll off and what you think your underlying free cash flow power can be in a couple of years.","John Haley","Yeah. Okay. So thanks very much. Let me just start off addressing that. So, look, when we \u2013 we didn't mean to signal any change from anything we've said before. What Roger was saying is we expect to have a few hundred million dollars available in the second half of the year which is I think always what we had talked about. This formulation that we said that what we want to do is maximize shareholder return. Generally, if we can find a very attractive acquisition, that's the \u2013 that's probably the way we could do that best, and we would \u2013 we're always looking to do that.","But as a practical matter, there's no way we're going to do any kind of really major acquisition in the first year or year-and-a-half of this merger. We have work to do there, even a more modest acquisition. If there was something that was a unique property that if we didn't buy it now there wouldn't be an opportunity to buy one like that in the future, we might consider something like that. But in general, we're going to have higher standards for doing any acquisitions.","But our overall approach has always been acquisitions are first, but we have some high standards for doing that. So it's hard to find them. And then after that, we want to return the cash to shareholders. I think the \u2013 our free cash flow is going to be the major source of how we can do that, and we're looking to, in general, deploy a lot of our free cash flow over the coming years to be doing share repurchases.","We don't need any kind of a specific authorization from the board. We don't need any new authorization. We have about $500 million authorization that already exists. And so whatever we would be thinking about doing this year, we're already set for that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Kai Pan","Yes, good morning. Thank you. Most of my questions have been answered. I just want to touch upon the, so basically, senior management team as well as the producers on the ground, what's the employee morale through the integration process and what's the volunteer in turnover rates?","John Haley","Okay. So I think one of the things that has gratified the whole management team and the \u2013 and our boards, we're discussing with them is the very positive reaction we have had from our colleagues around the world to this merger. And I think unlike some other mergers I've been involved in, in the past where you're -- when you're buying firms where there's a lot of overlap, sometimes there's angst among folks as to what their position is going to be in the new organization. With Willis Towers Watson and the relatively limited overlap we had, we've seen I think more energy and excitement among colleagues at an earlier stage than we ever have before.","We are \u2013 we have been looking at our turnover statistics. There's nothing out of the ordinary. In fact, if anything, they're a little bit lower than I might have expected. I think that we expect that we'll see normal turnover. I was prepared for turnover, actually, especially maybe last year between announcement and the closing to be a little bit higher than usual. We did not see that, and I think that again goes back to the enthusiasm that our colleagues around the world have had for this.","Kai Pan","Okay. That's great. Last question. If you'd talk about what's the foreign currency exchange impact for the quarter as well as the potential Brexit potential impact on your business?","John Haley","Okay, Roger, do you want to start off with the currency impact?","Roger Millay","Well, yeah. I mean I think it was in the script that there was about $50 million, a little over $50 million of FX impact on the revenue line. I don't know that we gave an EPS impact, but it would be modest. And just to note going forward, you'll note that our guidance on FX is a little bit lower than where the pound and the euro are now. So there's probably a single digit from an EPS point of view, single-digit kind of sense, potential upside if rates stayed the way they are now.","Kai Pan","That's great. And then...","John Haley","And so I guess just on \u2013 sorry, I was going to answer on Brexit.","Kai Pan","Yeah.","John Haley","So just on that, I think, like everyone else, we're following the debate there. And there's \u2013 some people are concerned about the impact of some uncertainty in the UK, although I think the uncertainty leading up to the vote is probably as great as anything that they would see too. We see basically some cons and some pros. The London insurance market could see some premium declines accelerate. The insurance centers could move elsewhere. On the other hand, their added complexity in the marketplace is in general something that's good for consulting firms and for brokers. There would be issues around any \u2013 if people did move, wiggle entities or capital or staffing that would create opportunities for us, in particular it could benefit CRB and HCP. So I think there would be some \u2013 there would clearly be some short-term dislocations. We generally feel that when there are dislocations in the market, it favors companies that are agile and nimble and flexible and we like to think of ourselves that way.","Kai Pan","Great. Well, thank you so much for all the answers.","Roger Millay","Thank you.","Kai Pan","Thank you.","John Haley","Okay. We're going to take one more question.","Operator","And our last question comes from Tim McHugh of William Blair & Company. Your line is open.","Tim McHugh","All right, Thanks for squeezing me in there at the end. So just some, I guess numbers questions. The \u2013 kind of the other revenue part of Exchange you talked about has very strong growth, is that project revenue or is that kind of the addition of new clients, in other words, a recurring type of uplift that we saw in that piece of the business?","John Haley","Yeah. There's almost no real project revenue in Exchange Solutions. The \u2013 it comes from collecting the commissions or other fees paid for the employees, but there's not a lot of special project revenue at all.","Tim McHugh","Okay. I didn't know.","Roger Millay","Yeah, Tim, I just mentioned it's, to some extent maybe the main driver, the continuing success in health and welfare administration business and the new clients as we've been talking about over the last year or so.","John Haley","Yeah.","Tim McHugh","Okay. All right.","John Haley","Yeah. But again, that is \u2013 those are usually \u2013 Tim, those are like long-term deals where we'll sign up the client for a five-year deal or something like that, and every once in a while, if there's a big law change, that part of the business might have a \u2013 some special projects, but relatively rarely.","Tim McHugh","All right. That's why I was asking the question whether I didn't know if the ACA was driving...","John Haley","Yeah.","Tim McHugh","...a bunch of change orders or something like that. All right. And then you talked about the seasonality of the acquisitions here more on the legacy Willis side, can you help us at all then with the rest of the year? How much \u2013 just because we don't have the history there, I guess in terms of 2Q versus the second half as we think about those businesses, I guess how much maybe first half versus second half typically?","Roger Millay","I'm sorry, first half versus second half of?","Tim McHugh","For Gras Savoye more specifically?","John Haley","It's the Gras Savoye and the seasonality there, Roger.","Tim McHugh","Right.","Roger Millay","On revenues?","Tim McHugh","Yeah.","Roger Millay","Yeah, I think it's certainly over 50%, probably reasonably over 50% in the first half and pretty much all the profit is in the first half.","Tim McHugh","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. John Haley for closing remarks.","John Haley","Okay. Well, thanks everyone for joining us this morning, and I look forward to talking to you on the Willis Towers Watson Earnings Call in August. So long.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day."]}}
