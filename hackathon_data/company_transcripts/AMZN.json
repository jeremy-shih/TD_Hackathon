After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded.","For opening remarks, I'll be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.","Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.","Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2018 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2017.","Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 26, 2018 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.","During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.","Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.","Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict the demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.","With that, we'll move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","At this time, we will now open up the call for questions. Our first question comes from line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks so much for taking the question. Wanted to ask if you had any update on the state of the advertising business, sort of the state of conversations with advertisers? What product uptake you're seeing out in the marketplace? And sort of how that's looking now as we move out of 2017 and into 2018 broadly for the platform? Thanks so much.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Yes, sure, Eric. I would say advertising continues to be a bright spot both from a product standpoint and also financially. It continued to be a strong contributor to profitability in Q1. It's now a multibillion-dollar program. You can see the \u2013 in our supplemental revenue disclosure, it's in other revenue, and it's the majority of the other revenue in that line item.","So our philosophy there again is we're continuing to focus on finding valuable ways to make our advertising opportunities better for customers, showing them new products that they may not have seen otherwise and also for emerging and established brands, helping them to reach customers. I think the advertisers generally are all shapes and sizes, and their common theme is they all want to reach our customers generally to drive brand awareness, discovery and eventually purchase.","Before I go into the second question, I want to make a comment about the Prime program. The Prime program continues to drive great strength in our top line, as you've seen over the last few years actually. We continue to increase the value of Prime, including speed selection and digital entertainment options. We've been expanding FREE Same-Day Shipping and One-Day options. And our Two-Day shipping, it's now available on over 100 million items, up from 20 million as recently as 2014. And we continue to add digital benefits like Prime Video.","The value of Prime to customers has never been greater. And the cost is also high, as we pointed out especially with shipping options and digital benefits, we continue to see rises in costs. So effective May 11, we're going to increase the price of our U.S. annual plan from $99 to $119 for new members. The new price will apply to renewals starting on June 16.","Prime provides a unique combination of benefits, and we continue to invest in making this Prime program even more valuable for our members. As a reminder, we haven't increased the U.S. annual price of Prime since our single increase, which was in March of 2014.","Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.","Yeah. And, Eric, sorry to just go back to your initial question too, just to hop back on that, just wanted to remind folks that we mentioned this last quarter on the call. But on January 1, we adopted an accounting standard update that amended our revenue recognition policies.","So the net impact to revenue in the first quarter was not material, but I do want to highlight a few areas. As part of the adoption beginning in Q1, certain advertising services were classified as revenue rather than a reduction of costs of sales. So the impact of this change was an increase of $560 million to other revenue in Q1, which is \u2013 the other revenue is, of course, part of our supplemental sales disclosure.","So you'll see that other revenue, in total, increased 132% ex-FX year-over-year to about $2 billion in the first quarter. Again, $560 million is included in there, and the majority of that is \u2013 would be included in the North America segment.","As you look at the other supplemental line item, just a few items of note. The line item online stores revenue increased about 13%, ex-FX. Beginning in the first quarter, sales of apps, in-app content, and certain digital media content are now presented on a net revenue basis and included in third-party seller services revenue, rather than that online stores revenue. So in the first quarter, online stores revenue would have been higher, but for this new standard.","And then the line item, subscription services revenue, that increased about 56% ex-FX year-over-year. Prime memberships are included in that line. Again, beginning in the first quarter, we now recognize annual Prime membership revenue straight line over the 12-month period. Prior to 2018, we recognized this revenue over the 12-month period with more revenue allocated to the fourth quarter each year. So in Q1 of this year, subscription services revenue would have been lower, but for this new standard.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking my questions. So the first one on Prime, let me ask you this. As you think about your U.S. Prime penetration, there's some data that shows you're doing a very good job at capturing a lot of the middle to higher income households and now you're raising price. Talk about the tension point you need to solve to sort of reach some of the lower income households and even households that are not yet Prime. What are the main reasons why people in the U.S. are not signing on for Prime at this point?","And the second one on early learnings from the integration of Prime Now and Whole Foods, recognizing it's only in a few cities, what can you share about what you're seeing about purchase behavior, early learnings? And what are the main signposts you're watching as you determine how quickly to roll that out to more cities in the U.S. and hopefully, New York soon?","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Sure. On your first question about Prime penetration, without getting into any statistics on penetration and by country, I would say we do have other options for, if you'll notice, there's the monthly option, obviously provides more flexibility for people who want to try out Prime before committing to the annual plan. There's discounted student plans. There's also discounts for other groups. So, we do feel it's still the best deal in retail, and we just work to make it better and better each day.","The second thing you mentioned is a good example. So, the ability in 10 cities to get Prime Now deliveries of Whole Foods groceries is an added benefit for people in that market using Prime \u2013 those markets using Prime Now. So as far as the Whole Foods, specifically on the question of what we'll look at as far as expanding that grocery delivery, we're going to use the 10 cities as a test and see how customers respond, just like we always do, and make sure that our deliveries are great for those people, and then we'll announce expansion plans once we digest that, the feedback we get from customers.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. I was just wondering if you could give us a sense, the accelerating growth that we saw in the U.S. business in Q1, how much of that or how would you sort of segment that in terms of specific categories? Are there any specific categories that you would call out in terms of driving that?","And then, as we look at the like acceleration in the AWS business, any sense that you can give us in terms of what volumes or customer, you specifically call out sort of customer additions in some of your comments, what customer additions have looked like in terms of driving that business, particularly against sort of the comp against last year's price cuts?","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Sure. So first, with the \u2013 you've mentioned North America revenue growth, and you can calculate that with and without the impact of Whole Foods, I'm sure. But the general drivers continues to be Prime and the Prime flywheel. So we see strong customer demand, not only for the benefits that we associate with Prime, we're seeing better engagement with Prime benefits, especially digital benefits, and that is always good news for eventual sales of other things.","We're also selling more subscriptions, Amazon Music Unlimited, multiple Kindle Unlimited, there's a number of services. So there's different revenue streams that we see. So, not much more I can add by product line to North America. And I talk about AWS revenue, again, we're \u2013 we are accelerating. We've accelerated for the last two quarters. The FX-neutral growth was 48% in Q1, up from 44% on the same basis in Q4 and 42% in Q3. And now nearly a $22 billion run rate.","So what we're saying is just continued strong usage both by existing customers and signing new customers for \u2013 see increased pace of enterprise migrations as customers are having success with AWS and increasingly trying new services. We are seeing people move more and more of their workflows to AWS and at a faster pace. And customers are moving databases to AWS as Aurora continues to grow at a very rapid clip.","So stepping back, I would say, what is driving the growth, we believe, again, it's the value that we create for AWS customers. We have the functionality and pace of innovation that others don't. We have partner and ecosystem that others don't. And we have proven operational capability and security expertise that's highly valued to the AWS customer base.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Mark A. May - Citi Investment Research","Thank you. Some of the data that we've seen suggests that this year, the rate of growth in the build out of fulfillment centers and other parts of the retail logistics network as well as data centers, but more on the former, that rate of growth is slowing this year relative to last year and even the year before. I know that you guys go through periods of kind of heavy investment, then you grow into that capacity. But I just wonder if you could comment a little bit about where we are kind of in that ebb and flow of that cycle right now.","And in terms of the accounting change that Dave referenced earlier with regard to revenue going from cost of revenue to the other line, can you comment if that particular type of advertising, that trade dollars type of marketing, is that growing at a meaningfully different rate than the ad revenue that's already booked as revenue? Thanks.","Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.","Yeah, Mark, this is Dave. On that second question, we've not commented on the growth rate or given the prior year period, so not much we can say there. As I said, the $560 million, if you were to back that out and look at the sort of pre-existing advertised \u2013 or other revenue rather that was included in that line item, we'd be growing about 72%. But again, that's not in relation to the COGS portion.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","And on the question on capacity, \u2013 excuse me, cap \u2013 I'll address it as CapEx and capital leases, we're still seeing strong investment there. If I look at the quarterly trends, you're right, that this quarter was up 33% in isolation versus last year. I look back to last year's first quarter and we grew 82% year-over-year. So it was a particularly heavy quarter, particularly for investment in warehouses.","So if I step back on the trailing 12 months though, CapEx, which is predominantly tied to our fulfillment center network, is up 47%. That is above the Amazon fulfilled unit growth rate, but we combined the strength of the FBA program and the space requirements as we get into bigger and bigger products. That's a representative number for that period.","On the capital leases, which is a good proxy for the spend to support the AWS business, that's up 49% year-over-year on the trailing 12 months.","So again, usage rates continue to exceed the revenue growth rates. Usage rates are strong, but we also have a number of projects underway that seek to increase our efficiency of our data centers. So have a couple things at play there that hopefully keep that number closer to the revenue growth rate.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the question. Brian, you had significant operating income upside in 1Q and I think a better outlook for the second quarter than many expected. Can you just talk about the biggest factors that drove the delta relative to your 1Q guide? And is there any reason to think that you couldn't see similar leverage in the back half of the year? Thanks.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Sure. Yes, we came in well above our range that we had given of $300 million to $1 billion. I would attribute it primarily to a few things. First, the top-line growth was \u2013 continued to be strong coming out of Q4. We had great consumer business strength. We also had strong AWS revenue strength, where I already mentioned that we accelerated into the quarter, which is a different trend that we've seen recently. So customer adoption in AWS remained strong.","And when we hit the higher end of our range or just above our range on \u2013 with FX included, we generally see really good drop through on the incremental sales, given the fixed costs we have in fulfillment centers and data centers and quite frankly, people. So we saw great efficiencies at the higher level of revenue, and we're able to handle it. So that was generally very good financially.","We \u2013 at the time of guidance, we were concerned a bit about the high \u2013 relatively high inventory we had at year-end in space utilization. So we're still very full in our fulfillment centers. But we were able to correct that due to the high sales without having additional handling and transportation cost that you would normally see the reconfigure inventory locations. So that also helped and probably differential versus the guidance estimate.","And then, lastly, I would say, advertising continues to be a strong contributor to profitability and had strong results this quarter. As far as what that portends for future quarters, for now, I want to focus on Q2 and it's incorporated into our Q2 guidance. So we expect a lot of the strength areas to continue, consumer demand, AWS and advertising. We will definitely see higher investments as we move through the year. For example, video content spend will increase year-over-year, and we'll continue to hire, in particular, software engineers.","We'll have some costs in Q2 ahead of what's anticipated to be a Prime Day in early Q3. So \u2013 and then as you know, Q3 is generally a lower quarter due to all the work to get ready for holiday and the hiring of people and building teams. So, I won't go beyond Q2 at this point, but again, we're very happy with the customer reception we had in Q1 and then the income that, that drove.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks. Two questions. The $239 million in other income, what was that? And then could you just wax a little bit eloquently hopefully, on advertising revenue? And like how do you balance what are \u2013 what should be a monstrous amount of ad revenue opportunities, especially high profit, high margin ad revenue opportunities against an ideal or optimal consumer experience? These sponsored units I see in every search I do on Amazon seems great from an advertising perspective, but I sometimes wonder if it doesn't dilute the consumer experience. So just talk about how you balance that.","And then finally, as part of advertising, you've got also a heck of a lot inventory around all of that video, that Prime Video that you have that you don't allow \u2013 that you don't directly charge for, how do you think about that as an advertising revenue opportunity? Thank you.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Sure. Let me wax eloquently. Try to anyway. So let's start with the $239 million; that is essentially where attributable to warrants that we have in companies that we partnered with. We have transportation companies that we partnered with and other technology companies. As the stock market increased in Q1, a lot of these companies also went up. So that's where we book the gain on warrants that we have with \u2013 on investments. It's also \u2013 there was a good bit of FX gain due to the shift in currency and the weakening of the dollar. That showed up on a lot of lines on the P&L, but that one was positive.","On advertising, so let's step back a bit. It's now a multibillion-dollar program and growing very quickly. Our main goal here is to help customers discover new brands and products. So we show the sponsored products, we're trying to show people things they had maybe wouldn't have seen otherwise in their normal search results. So we're looking for a good balance here, as we said.","We want customers to get the benefit of the new brand and product discovery, and then we want to let sellers for both emerging and established brands, reach those customers. Those advertisers are of all shapes and sizes with the main goal of, again, trying to reach our customers whether it's to drive brand awareness, discovery or hopefully purchase.","So, we take the responsibility for that very seriously and are always balancing helpfulness of the advertising and try not to make it disruptive. But you're right, there are always pressures in that. We will come down on the side of the customer.","On your question on video advertising, yes, there may be opportunities over time to have more advertising in our Video, but we choose not to do that right now.","Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.","Yeah, I think the only thing I'd add to on that just related to Prime Video, as you may have seen in the announcement earlier today about the renewed agreement for the streaming partnership with Thursday Night Football. So we'll have 11 games in 2018 and 2019, be able to deliver that to over 100 million Prime members globally, which is a great continuation of the partnership we've had with the NFL.","We've done some things like the Prime Original Series All or Nothing; the third season's coming up soon, focused on the Dallas Cowboys. So that was one of our first forays in the live format that \u2013 one of the first forays in the live format where we had live ads and kind of, we're not only learning the technology, but learning to \u2013 learning that business. And I think we've been pleased with what we've seen so far obviously and look forward to the next few seasons with the NFL.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you. So I think, Brian, I had a question on your international shopping rollout, so I think this was recently announced. Where do you think you measure up versus some of the more local players where you might not have a direct presence in the country? And where do you think your value proposition lies? And presumably this is informed by users coming in from those regions where you don't really have an official site for people come in to buy stuff from you anyway. So, which regions or countries are accounting for most of the demand that you are seeing? Thank you.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Stephen, are you're still on? Can you elaborate more on the countries you're talking about, specifically?","Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","No, I'm just wondering, you already have a direct presence in some of the countries like China, Japan, et cetera, and the international shopping rollout presumably expands all that selection to most of the globe. So just wondering if you are seeing incremental demand, and where you might be seeing demand coming in from countries where you might not have a direct presence?","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Oh, on global store? Okay. Yes.","Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yeah.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Yeah. Sorry, I thought you meant some of our expansion countries. So, yeah, I don't have a lot to share on that today, but I think you hit on the main point, is selection and opportunities for sellers in \u2013 who are with us in different countries to reach buyers outside of their home country. So it's a great benefit for sellers, and it only works if it's a great benefit for customers on the other side.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Justin Post - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Yeah, thank you. I'd like to maybe dive into a couple of local recent overhangs. First, on shipping partners, just wondering how dependent are you on any shipping partner? And can you talk about any initiatives you've had to build out your own shipping network? I know in some countries that you might be over 50% of the stuff you're delivering. Could talk a little bit about dependency there?","And then secondly, on taxes, can you remind us what happened when Amazon started collecting taxes on your own items in various states? And just kind of overview of your view on collecting third-party sales \u2013 taxes from third parties in other states if that were to pass? Thank you.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Sure. Let me start with transportation. We have a great group of carriers that we use globally and you know who they are. But we're also growing our teams and capabilities to ensure that we can keep up with increased volume on our own, particularly around the holiday season. So that's driven a lot of our expansion of Amazon Logistics. It's driven the creation of sort centers. It's driven the purchase of airplanes to move product between points within our delivery network.","So we will continue to operate with this combination of external partners and internal capability. We like what we see so far with our Amazon Logistics capability. It's well over 50% in some countries, particularly the UK. It helps with again Prime Now and AmazonFresh and a lot of initiatives that we'll see, which again we mentioned the Prime Now is tied in with Whole Foods, now in 10 cities. So we think it's a core competency that we have and we need to have, and we'll continue to invest in that.","Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.","Yeah, and Justin, this is Dave, just on the sales tax piece. Today, on the first-party sales, we collect on our own products in all 45 states that have a state-imposed sales tax. On the 3T piece, we do collect on behalf of our sellers in two states, Washington State as of the first of this year, and then Pennsylvania turned on here on April 1.","So in terms of your question of sort of impact from the first-party piece that's been coming online, many of those states came on over a period of time to get to that 45 total, going back over many years. So yeah, nothing really more to add on that.","I think I would say we do continue to believe that the sales tax issue needs to be resolved at the federal level, and we're actively working with the states, with retailers and Congress to get federal legislation passed. We're not opposed to collecting sales tax within a constitution and permissible system that is both simple and applied evenhandedly.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg Melich with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question.","Gregory Scott Melich - MoffettNathanson LLC","Hi. Thanks. So I want to follow up on Prime a little bit. The fee increase, why now? I mean, we've been adding value for a long time, obviously shipping costs are going up. Why is now the right time to have that fee hike, especially since membership looks like the growth numbers are starting to slow?","And tied into that, there's a lot of Alexa mentioning in the release. Could you give us some uptake on the importance of Alexa and basically voice commerce, and so the metrics you get in terms of usage there and the flywheel? Thanks.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Sure. We always evaluate the price of Prime in all the countries we're in, and we're looking for creative ways to reach the customer. As I mentioned earlier, creation \u2013 or excuse me, monthly plans, student plans, et cetera.","So it's really nothing more than looking at the state of the program, the high benefits it's delivering. I mentioned that four years ago when we last increased the price of Prime, you could get 20 million products within two days. Today you could get over 100 million products within two days, and many, many, many products within one day, same day or two hours.","So there's all kinds of new features that we've continually added to the Prime program. It's much different than it was in 2014. This is a reflection of that, that's a better reflection of the cost value of the program.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from...","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Sorry go ahead.","Operator","Sorry go ahead. Our next question comes from John Blackledge with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.","John Blackledge - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. So the U.S. international revenue mix, ex-Whole Foods and ex-AWS looks about 64%, 36%. Given investments in the international markets would you envision international kind of closing the gap in the coming years? And what would be the key drivers of the mix shift getting closer to 50-50? Thank you.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Sure. Yeah I don't want to project relative proportions of the different segments, but what I can say is the international continues to see the same level of investment as we're seeing in North America or have seen in North America.","So when we add benefits, Prime benefits, we're probably adding them at an earlier stage of life in the Prime program internationally than we did in the U.S. So, they have different dynamics. We think at the end of the day customers behave the same globally and that they value low prices selection and great customer experience.","So, we'll continue to make these investments in Prime. We'll continue to expand selection, continue to build FBA programs so that it increases selection even more and builds great partnerships with sellers. We'll continue to accelerate shipping. We'll continue to lower prices.","And sorry, I cut out the last person [Technical Difficulty] (30:50-30:55) including Alexa, which we think has great stickiness with, in the home and I think creates a lot of value in the home and also allows you to access over time Amazon products better.","We'll continue to invest in India where we're seeing great progress with both sellers and also customers. And we like the momentum we've seen there. The Prime program started in the first year in India grew faster than any Prime program we've seen in other countries. We're adding local content in India, video content, excuse me. We're also adding other benefits, Prime benefits. We're rolling out devices there, and we're seeing Indian developers developing skills for Alexa, and Alexa is up, as you saw in the press release, to 40,000 [Technical Difficulty] (31:46-31:51). Yes, but it's \u2013 it is important to us that they all are still delighting customers and growing to the best of their ability.","Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.","Thanks Brian.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today\u2019s call is being recorded.","For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Sean Boyle. Please go ahead.","Sean Boyle","Hello and welcome to our Q3 2012 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.","The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management\u2019s views as of today, October 25, 2012 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today\u2019s press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today\u2019s conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.","During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You\u2019ll find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.","Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2011. Now, I will turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Szkutak","Thanks, Sean. I\u2019ll begin with comments on our third quarter financial results. Trailing 12 month operating cash flow increased 8% to $3.37 billion. Trailing 12 month free cash flow decreased 31% to $1.06 billion. Return on invested capital was 10%, down from 17%. ROIC trailing 12 month free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter end.","The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 469 million shares consistent with 469 million shares. Worldwide revenue grew 27% to $13.81 billion or 30% excluding the $348 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. We\u2019re grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers.","Media revenue increased to $4.6 billion, up 11% or 14% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $8.56 billion up 36% or 39% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 62% of worldwide sales, up from 58%.","Worldwide paid unit growth was 39%. Active customer accounts exceeded $188 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than $2 million. Seller units represented 41% of paid units.","Now, I\u2019ll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $10.32 billion or 74.7% of revenue compared with 76.5%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $3.26 billion or 23.6% of sales, up approximately 251 basis points year-over-year.","Fulfillment was $1.45 billion or 10.5% of revenue compared with 10%. Tech and content was $1.08 billion or 7.8% of revenue compared with 6.4%. Marketing was $524 million or 3.8% of revenue compared with 3.3%.","Now, I\u2019ll talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods we do not allocate the segments or stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 33% to $7.88 billion. Media revenue grew 15% to $2.22 billion. EGM revenue grew 39% to $5.06 billion, representing 64% of North America revenues, up from 61%. North America segment operating income increased to 102% to $291 million, a 3.7% operating margin.","In the International segment, revenue grew 20% to $5.92 billion, adjusting for the $347 million unfavorable foreign exchange impact revenue growth was 27%. Media revenue grew 7% to $2.38 billion or 12% excluding foreign exchange. And EGM revenue grew 30% to $3.5 billion or 39% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 59% of international revenues up from 54%.","International segment operating loss was $59 million, a 1% negative operating margin compared with income of $116 million. CSOI decreased 11% to $232 million or 1.7% of revenue, down approximately 71 basis points year-over-year, excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI decreased to 10%.","Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income or loss includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating loss was $28 million or 0.2% negative operating margin comparing with GAAP operating income of $79 million.","Our income tax expense was $83 million. GAAP net loss was $274 million or $0.60 per diluted share compared with net income of $63 million and $0.14 per diluted share.","Third quarter 2012 includes a loss of $169 million, $0.37 per diluted share related to our equity-method share of losses reported by LivingSocial, primarily attributable to its impairment charge of certain assets, including goodwill. As of the end of September the book value of our equity-method investment in LivingSocial was $94 million.","Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities decreased $1.08 billion year-over-year to $5.25 billion. Inventory increased 34% to $5.07 billion and inventory turns were 9.7, down from 10.8 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories.","Accounts payable increased 28% to $8.37 billion and accounts payable days increased to 75 from 72 in the prior year. Our Q3 2012 capital expenditures were $716 million.","The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.","I\u2019ll conclude my portion of today\u2019s call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we\u2019ve to-date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumption.","Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by factors including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It\u2019s not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.","As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance.","Our guidance further assumes that we don\u2019t conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments or settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they\u2019ve been recently.","For Q4 2012, we expect net sales of between $20.25 billion and $22.75 billion, a growth of between 16% and 31%. This guidance anticipates approximately 45 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates.","GAAP operating income or loss to be between $490 million loss to $310 million income compared to $260 million income in the prior year. This includes approximately $290 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.","We anticipate consolidated segment operating income or loss which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between a $200 million loss and $600 million income compared to $462 million income in the prior year period.","We expect capital expenditures for ongoing operations including capitalized software development to be approximately $0.9 billion to $1.0 billion. These anticipated investments are driven primarily by our expectations of continued business growth consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.","We expect additional capital expenditures of approximately $1.4 billion related to the purchase of our currently leased corporate office space as well as property for development of additional corporate office space located in Seattle, Washington. We remain head-sound focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.","Thanks. With that Sean, let\u2019s move to questions.","Sean Boyle","","Great. Thanks, Tom. Let\u2019s move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes form Scott Devitt, Morgan Stanley.","Scott Devitt - Morgan Stanley","","Hi. Thank you. Two please, if I could, Tom. First on international margin, I know some of that actually is affected by currency. I was wondering, if you could speak to the effect of currency that it\u2019s having on margin. And then secondly, what else is driving that down? I would anticipate China investment digital and Italy and Spain being contributors there?","Then secondly on shipping revenue up 44% year-over-year I was wondering if you could break that down between shipping revenue or more versus the revenue allocation of FBA? Thanks.","Tom Szkutak","To take the first part of your question Scott, as it relates to operating profit in international you have the big pieces correct. First one is, we\u2019re investing certainly very heavily in capacity and so you\u2019re seeing that both fulfillment and infrastructure capacity that\u2019s impacting our results there. In addition to that, we\u2019re investing in the number of new geographies.","We\u2019ve talked about Italy and Spain over the last several calls those are certainly having an impact. We\u2019re very excited about the opportunity that we have there, but certainly those are investments right now. China, as you also mentioned is creating a long-term opportunity for us, but certainly an investment and it is impacting that number.","In addition, one that I don\u2019t think you did mention was video content for international. We\u2019re investing heavily in video content through our subsidiary LOVEFiLM for Europe. So those are things that are the primary drivers of what you\u2019re seeing in operating income in international.","In terms of shipping revenue there is not a lot. I can help you, but there is a number of factors that go into that number. If you take a look at both, the shipping revenue and then the resulting net shipping cost of fuel, the net shipping cost is getting a little bit better. Over time it\u2019s getting closer and closer to customers with our RFC footprint. So those are some of things, but again a lot of dynamics that are certainly impacting that shipping revenue number.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of Citi.","Mark Mahaney - Citi","Great. Thanks. Any comments on the paid unit growth deceleration that seem to have been relatively significant, anything about the comp or any read into that? And secondly, given all the infrastructure investments you\u2019ve made, Tom you just mentioned some of the shipping efficiencies, you\u2019re also seeing fulfillment as a percentage of revenue kind of start narrowing a little bit. Do you think you\u2019ve reached a bit of a cyclical -- investment cyclical tipping point or am, I over reading into just one quarter? Thank you.","Tom Szkutak","In terms of the paid unit growth question, it was 39%. As you mentioned it was a deceleration from last quarter. Keep in mind still, the 39% growth is still growing at a faster rate than revenue, one.","Two, if you take a look at last year\u2019s unit growth in Q3, the 53% that we had, that was the second highest quarter that we\u2019ve had in growth rate in the last 10 years. So we are overlapping a very strong growth last quarter.","In terms of fulfillment expense, certainly as we\u2019ve talked about in the past few years, stepping up very heavily in 2010 and 2011, and \u201812 from a fulfillment standpoint, we\u2019ve just seen unprecedented growth. And we\u2019ve added a lot of capacity, in terms of where it will level off, we\u2019ll have to wait and see.","Right now, we\u2019re still experiencing very strong growth, with 30% growth on a local currency basis, 39% unit growth. So we\u2019re going to continue to invest where we need to and the fulfillment capacity we do have, we\u2019re going to make sure that we operate as efficiently as we can and get more efficient with that capacity over time.","Operator","And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs","Great. Thank you. I had a question about pop-up stores. It seems like a lot of people are jumping on the bandwagon there. And we\u2019ve been hearing stuff recently about Amazon trying to leverage those as a way to get closer to customers, and help facilitate shipping for the holiday season. I\u2019m just wondering if you could share with us your strategy there.","Tom Szkutak","Yeah. Could you elaborate on what you\u2019re referring to? I\u2019m sorry.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs","A pop-up store, meaning something that might only be open for between say, Black Friday and January 1st, a short-term store?","Tom Szkutak","The vast majority or the highest percentage of our revenue is certainly coming from our online sales. We do, in the case of Kindle are using physical world retailers as well, which we\u2019re very happy to do so. But again it\u2019s not really a driver of our business.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take a question now from Douglas Anmuth of J.P. Morgan.","Douglas Anmuth - J.P. Morgan","Thanks for taking the question. Tom, it\u2019s been nearly a year since you launched the First Fire devices. And I was hopping, you could give us a sense of how that cohort of users might be tracking, in terms of their buyer activity and in particular, how you\u2019re seeing them if they are over indexing in terms of media content consumption, Prime usage and overall purchasing? And how do you feel about that strategy now as you continue to tie upon into devices? Thanks.","Tom Szkutak","Maybe the best way to describe it would be, certainly we\u2019re seeing customers certainly purchasing a lot of content. We like the idea of selling our Kindle Fires and then being rewarded through purchases of content going forward. All that being said, even though we\u2019re rewarded with those sales, customers realize that we\u2019re going to make sure that we work on behalf of them to make sure that content is not only very wide but also at great prices.","And so, we continue to work with, to make sure that we can provide on customers behalf. But we\u2019re seeing a very good shopping patterns on all types of content with the selection that we have. We\u2019re seeing customers not only purchase content, we\u2019re seeing Prime customers certainly being active and watching our free content as well and that\u2019s working very well. So it\u2019s a great combination of things that are going on there in engagement with the device.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Youssef Squali of Cantor Fitzgerald.","Youssef Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald","Yeah. Thank you very much. I actually want to follow-up on the question that was just asked. So, intuitively, it really makes a lot of sense what it is that you\u2019re doing. But can you maybe just speak to the effectiveness of selling the device or all these devices is kind of near breakeven?","Maybe is there anticipate metric that you can point to help us understand the lifts you get either in terms of the frequency of buying or listing in average transaction value or anything that could kind of help us gauge from the outside the success of our strategy? And then second, maybe if you could just speak to the thinking behind your content costs related to your streaming service going forward, just how should we be thinking about it? Thank you.","Tom Szkutak","In terms of -- there is not a lot of specifics I can give you on a per device basis from a content standpoint in terms of what the purchasing patterns have been, but as I mentioned in the previous question, certainly customers are engaged in the device they are purchasing content. They all are also, in the case of video, they\u2019re purchasing content as well as watching free content.","In the case of books, they\u2019re purchasing books as well if they\u2019re Prime members. They\u2019re participating in free content. So those are things that are going very well. We like what we see there, which is why we continue to investment in that business, which is why you see the offerings, the very compelling offerings that we have out there right now. So those are things that you should expect us to do more of.","In terms of the content spend, if you\u2019re referring to the \u2013 it\u2019s related to Prime Instant Video, I think it\u2019s probably what you\u2019re referring to. We have added a lot of content. We like what we see so far. We\u2019ll continue to monitor it very carefully. You should expect us to add more content going forward.","We launched Prime, some number of years ago now and we had a little over 1 million items at launch. We then expanded that dramatically with many physical items. We\u2019re now offering digital items through Prime as well, most notably in, certainly in books and video and we\u2019re monitoring the performance very closely. But again, so far we\u2019re seeing great new subscribers coming out of these efforts and we like what we see so far.","Operator","And our next question comes from Brian Pitz of Jefferies.","Brian Pitz - Jefferies","Thanks. I know it\u2019s still early but, have you seen any noticeable impact from sales in states like California where they just started lighting you guys up on collecting sales tax?","Tom Szkutak","You\u2019re right. It is early. The only thing I could point to is, we collect in over -- either sales tax or equivalent value-added tax. We collect in over 50% of our revenue today. We have very good businesses in those states and geographies that we do that in long ago. That\u2019s all I can point to today.","Operator","Now, we\u2019ll take our next question from Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse.","Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse","So, good afternoon, guys. So revisiting the capacity and infrastructure question overseas, anything you can share in terms of the operating environment and what is required to get the package to the customer?","Over the longer term, are there any particular regions that you think may never reach the efficiency level, as you may currently see in your older geographies? Thank you.","Tom Szkutak","Actually, we feel very good about the investments we\u2019re making in fulfillment capacity. When I think about the types of investments that we\u2019re making in terms of predictability, certainly, I would consider the fulfillment capacity to be more of the running of the business type investments.","We have a lot of experience starting up new facilities, operating those efficiently and to the point where, as you know we\u2019ve extended that not only to offer that service for our retail business, we also offer that to sellers to fulfill by Amazon. So those are things that we feel. Certainly those investments we feel good about but, what you\u2019re seeing is certain just a very large ramp that we\u2019ve done starting in 2010 through now.","And you know it\u2019s one of these investments, we only make those investments where we absolutely need too. But in terms of deploying that capital is those resources, we feel very good about it.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Brian Nowak of Nomura.","Brian Nowak - Nomura","Hi. Thanks. I have two questions, please. Can you talk to what you saw throughout Europe? Did you see any weakening in the European markets throughout the quarter, and if so any comments on specific pockets or countries of weakness?","And then secondly, can you talk a little bit about social and kind of use of social networks like Pinterest? Do you feel comfortable working with other social networks to drive business to Amazon as you are now, or do you think over the long-term or time you like to have more end-to-end control over social e-commerce? Thanks.","Tom Szkutak","In terms of the euro piece, we\u2019re not breaking out any specific countries in terms of growth. But as you can see from the results, we grew 27% in international and local currency basis, which includes obviously our footprint in Europe as well as China and Japan.","So we feel the growth has been in the high-20s to low-30s over the past several quarters. Certainly, we\u2019re reading the same thing that you\u2019re reading in terms of the softness, hard to tell how much that\u2019s impacting us.","Again, when you look at 27% growth rates still think that\u2019s pretty solid and the environment, again hard to tell how much we\u2019re impacting -- impacted by that. In terms of social, we\u2019re certainly very looking at a lot of different ways to reach our customers and certainly that\u2019s an opportunity for us and something that our -- certainly our advertising and marketing teams are very conscious of and working on ways to best monetize those channels.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Ross Sandler of Deutsche Bank.","Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank","Hi. Great, guys. Just two quick questions. First is on Brazil, second on fulfillment. So you guys are hiring in Brazil for local content relationships for Kindle and some warehouse personnel. So how important do you view that market in terms of the retail business. When do you think you could be in Brazil with the retail presence?","And then the second question is fulfillment, as a growth -- as a percent of gross profit showed year-on-year leverage for the first time in like three years, so do you feel like you\u2019ve turned the corner on some of the capacity improvements or given the pace of new facility that you\u2019re putting in. Is there any reason why that would reverse back down again from here?","Tom Szkutak","In terms of the first question, we have a longstanding practice of not talking about what we might or might not do. Certainly, Brazil is an interesting geography as well as there are others. And we certainly export to Brazil today, but beyond that there\u2019s not a lot to talk to.","In terms of fulfillment, you are seeing a little bit of leverage in Q3 versus what we\u2019ve seen in the past few years. Again, it\u2019s one quarter, I wouldn\u2019t read too much into that at this stage. But certainly, we feel good about the footprint that we have. We feel good about a lot of the capacity that we\u2019ve added since 2010.","Some of that capacity going back is getting more productive than it had been. The challenging part is obviously we\u2019re layering on a sizable number of [FC] this year on top of that, that you\u2019re seeing the cost for. So, there is again the 19 that we\u2019ve announced today.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Mark Miller of William Blair.","Mark Miller - William Blair","Hi, good afternoon. Could you share what you\u2019ve learnt with the add-on program and the purchase rate you\u2019re seeing? And do you think over time you can have a meaningful expansion of smaller ticket items and can that effect the percent of orders that have multiple items in the shipment?","Tom Szkutak","In terms of add-ons, we\u2019re -- a goal is to try to make products available to customers that we aren\u2019t able to make available to before. And so it\u2019s very early, but that\u2019s the -- it\u2019s just one additional way that we can add selection for customers and be able to get it to customer profitably. So again, it\u2019s not much more towards than that.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go now to Herman Leung of Susquehanna.","Herman Leung - Susquehanna","Great. Thanks, guys. Two quick questions. I guess when you look into your holiday as you might go into the holiday season with your third-party inventory last year hitting sort of a bump with video games, as well as some of the Thailand floods. I was wondering what types of steps you guys are kind of doing to better prepare yourselves for holiday season that this upcoming holiday season?","And the second question is wondering, how we should think about the increasing cost -- shipping cost leverage as you go into 2013 with your distribution centers much closer and a higher percentage of FBA units? Thanks.","Tom Szkutak","In terms of holiday readiness, we feel very good. We\u2019re -- as you can see from our inventory at the end of Q3 it started, we\u2019re adding inventory getting ready for the holiday season that will happen throughout Q4. We\u2019re continuing trying to increase our in stock levels. So, you\u2019re certainly seeing some of that already in the numbers.","And we\u2019re very excited about getting ready for a great holiday season. And that\u2019s with our own retail inventory. Certainly, we haven\u2019t sellers, we\u2019re selling on a platform would be doing the same thing. And we\u2019re getting forward to have a great experience for customers during Q4.","In terms of shipping cost leverage, I think there is a great opportunity over a longer period of time in terms of providing what there would happen from a short-term leverage standpoint to be premature to that at this stage. But we can checking in future periods and talk more about that.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go now to Anthony DiClemente of Barclays.","Anthony DiClemente - Barclays","I have just one question. On the North America media segment just a modest deceleration. I would imagine that digital content sales and download to rent probably grew much faster than the growth rate of that segment. And so, I\u2019m just wondering if there is anything specifically that you can call out that was weighing that growth down in that segment, whether it\u2019s physical media or otherwise? Thanks.","Tom Szkutak","I think you\u2019ve characterized it correctly. Digital content is growing very fast. And it\u2019s reflected in the number that you see there, beyond that there is not a lot of call outs with the exception of. If you look back over the past five quarters, certainly the highest growth we\u2019ve had will be Q3 of 2011, which we\u2019re lapping.","So, that\u2019s the other factor. But again, very good growth on the digital media also keep in mind, that the growth of digital will also trail our device sales and given the new launches that we\u2019ve had recently that\u2019s -- that will be good for our digital content to going forward.","Operator","Now, we\u2019ll take a question from Michael Graham of Canaccord Adams.","Michael Graham - Canaccord Adams","Hi, good afternoon. Tom, last quarter you made a comment that same day delivery on a wide scale wasn\u2019t a goal. And since then, I\u2019ve got more anecdotal evidence of people getting a lot of same day delivery especially here in New York. There was some news from Wal-Mart that they were going to start shipping from their stores. So could you give us any updated thoughts or philosophy you might have around what\u2019s an appropriate amount of time to strive for to deliver to people?","And then as a quick follow-up to that, it seems like every quarter you\u2019re guiding to sort of 1% operating margins. And just wondering like is that a philosophical way that you\u2019re managing the business. Is there sort of an infinite number of things that you guys could spend on if you wanted to. And we should expect this sort of level going forward?","Tom Szkutak","In terms of same day delivery or delivery speed, we have just a tremendous amount of selection and what I was referring to last time was, I said, I talked about with a large amount of selection broadly to that certainly challenging to do same day everywhere, it\u2019s certainly a challenge from an economic standpoint.","That being said, we -- if you look back over the past several years, we have done -- added a lot of capacity. We\u2019re getting -- we have large FCs that are closer and closer to customers that has helped improve our delivery speed to customers and programs like Prime specifically has helped us get closer and closer to customers from a delivery speed standpoint.","So, what I would expect moving forward would be more the same. We\u2019re going to continue to improve the customer experience in every possible way we can, which includes getting closer to customers from a shipping standpoint. And we feel good about that and again, you\u2019ve seen improvements some in the past year and in the past several years and New York is one of those examples, where you\u2019re seeing certainly indoor shipments going in the same day in cases.","Operator","And our final question will come from Justin Post of Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","Justin Post - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Just thinking about this investment cycle, it\u2019s been like two years and a quarter and yet our revenues decelerating a little bit and free cash flow and margin trends are continuing to be down kind of down year-over-year. Can you just talk about, what you\u2019re seeing on the returns on the investments you\u2019ve been making over the last two years? And as far as like return on investment capital, is the profile of your returns changing over time as you think about history?","And then when can we start seeing kind of returns on this as far as revenues improving or kind of some of the financial ratios starting to turn. Can give us any thoughts on how you\u2019re thinking about that?","And then, just have a financial question. U.S. revenues for other were up 63% and then international was plus 15 for other and I think the difference is AWS. Is there any other big differences between the two geographies that we should think about? Thank you.","Tom Szkutak","In terms of return on invested capital beyond the total numbers, there is not any specifics that I can point to right now. But what I can tell you is, in terms of your profile if you think about the parts of our business. The retail business, I feel very good. We have a lot of experience in terms of getting greats returns for our shareowners.","We feel something that we have, again a lot of experience in. As we\u2019ve added new categories in particular geographies. Oftentimes, we\u2019ve already launched those in other geographies. So we\u2019re able to learn from the experiences we\u2019ve had to-date. So, we feel good about those. We have a great portion of our businesses. And our media business is converting to digital. So, we\u2019ve talked a lot about that. And feel very good about the opportunity that we have there, both in terms of making great devices as well as integrating content into those devices.","So, we feel good about that business and its growing very fast. In terms of our Web Services business that\u2019s a -- if you start with the core operation of that business. We\u2019ve been in that part of the business serving Amazon, the customer since inception. We\u2019ve added a lot of new services that have helped both Amazon internally, as well as external customers.","We like the characteristics of the potential ROIC potential of those of that business as well. Our third-party business continues to grow on our consumer business dramatically. And we like the ROIC potential of those. We\u2019re investing in a lot of new geographies, a few in the last couple of years, on top that China. China\u2019s you should think about that one has more of the long-term opportunity, something that we\u2019ve been investing in for several years, you shouldn\u2019t be expecting high returns on invested capital in the short run in that geography, but very exciting from a long-term perspective.","Italy and Spain, we\u2019re in an investment mode in those geographies. But again, those are more in line with some of the other geographies we\u2019re in, in terms of timeline for returns and feel very good about those. So, hopefully that gives you some picture of a little bit of the landscape and how we\u2019re thinking about ROICs.","Sean Boyle","Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q2 2018 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded.","For opening remarks, I'll be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead?","Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.","Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2018 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2017.","Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 26, 2018 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.","During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.","Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.","Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict the demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.","With that, we'll move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. Our first question comes from the line of Justin Post from Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Justin Post - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you. I guess, the standout metric of the quarter was the profitability and the margins. Both U.S. and International have improved year-over-year. Could you talk about (03:04) was it better than your expectations for the quarter? And then maybe reasons for the ad business to accelerate within the other line? Thank you.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Sure, yeah. Thanks, Justin. Yeah, for the quarter, so it was a strong quarter. We had \u2013 what I attribute it to is continued strength in our \u2013 some of our most profitable areas. AWS had its third consecutive quarter of accelerating growth, 49% FX-neutral growth. Advertising also had strong growth. Elsewhere we saw probably better than expected efficiencies in operations, our infrastructure costs, and generally all of our fixed costs.","You'll note that in the first half of the year capital leases were flat year-over-year, although we're up 20% for the full trailing 12 months, in the last 6 months it's been pretty flat as the team has really worked well to plan our data centers run our data centers more efficiently, even to meet again increasing usage at our customers; usage rates are exceeding our growth rate.","So that's what I would point to. Internationally, a lot of the same factors hold. I would say that, in addition to the operating efficiencies, advertising is also starting to make an impact on gross profit, although advertising is smaller in International segment than it's in North America, it's growing at a same rapid clip year-over-year.","Even while in International, we're continuing to invest in a lot of areas, we continue to frontload Prime benefits for the newer geographies, we continue to launch new countries as we launch Prime in Australia recently. We've launched devices in multiple countries, Echo and Alexa were launched in France. Echo Spot was launched in India and Japan in the last quarter. So continued \u2013 it's a mix of operating efficiencies as we grow, and then also continuing to invest on a lot of fronts.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Hey, maybe two things. Just a little bit of color on that unit growth, I think, it was 17%, any particular things to call out there as that would have stunted that growth or negatively limited? Or is that just kind of the new, new normal?","And then Brian, I'm sorry, you just talked better than expected efficiencies in operations, could I ask you to tease that out a little bit more, and a little more color particularly on the retail side of the business? Are there particular newfound efficiencies that are sustainable? Thanks a lot.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Sure. Let's start with unit growth. So I will note, we did a very strong unit growth rate last year in Q2, with 27%, so we're comping against that. As we look back on that, there were number of factors. I mean, in any quarter there can be product mix or ASP differentials which shift the unit growth figure, but if you also remember, we dropped our Super Saver Shipping threshold twice, the early part of last year from $49 to $35; and then down to $25.","So there was a bit of growth, particularly in lower ASP items from that, that we saw last year. So we're comping that. Another factor is digital content that moves to subscription. So Amazon Music and Kindle Unlimited, while they're very successful and it's a good transition, they just \u2013 the units do not count in this unit calculation.","So there's some things like that, that maybe obfuscate the numbers a bit, but we're really pleased with the retail growth. We think it's driven by again Prime, the Prime program, the engagement of Prime customers as well as increased selection, and particularly third-party selection.","On operations, if you look at probably the last 18 months, you're going to see a lot of different pace of increase in both infrastructure costs and capital costs, and the addition of fixed cost heads. So one thing that you'll notice is that, we've grown \u2013 we've stepped down our rate of growth of fixed head count, excluding the acquisitions we've grown 26% year-over-year at the end of June, on a trailing 12 month basis.","But 23% of that was in the second half of last year. So we are continuing to look at where we're investing head count. We're seeing a lot of our growth areas being fueled by head count that's moving within the company. There's a lot of movement of tech head count. And so there was less external hiring in the first half of this year. We don't think that, that's necessarily the long-term trend, but it certainly created a lot of operating efficiencies, and now we'll reset and evaluate where we need to still add people.","So I think the first half of the year could be a good test of where our cost structure is, coming off of the investment that leads up to the holiday. Last year, there was a lot of first half investment. If you look back on infrastructure and fixed head count that may be made that less pronounced. But this year it's a little more apparent.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to ask two, if I could. First, 3Q is typically a heavy fulfillment center build out period ahead of the holidays, and then lower utilization, but obviously your profit outlook is good. Can you just give us a sense of how you're thinking about FC build out and square footage increases this year?","And then, secondly a lot of excitement around the pharmacy opportunity with the acquisition of PillPack. Can you frame some of the strategic rationale there around the acquisition, and how that helps advance your efforts, and how we should think about integration going forward? Thanks.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Sure. On the fulfillment center capacity, I don't have a number for you, today. I'll probably clarify that at the end of next quarter as we head into holiday, but if you think back, the last two years, we've added square footage that's exceeded 30% growth, both in 2016 and 2017.","We anticipate it's going to be lower this year as we get some efficiencies off what we've built over the last few years, but I don't have a number for you today. I will say that, the majority of it is being put in service in the back-end of the year, just like in the last two years. But I'll \u2013 we'll clarify that next quarter.","On PillPack, yes, the deal of course hasn't closed, yet. We expect to close it in the second half of the year, so I'll limit my comments right now. But we're excited. I think the company has a really highly differentiated customer experience, and they've done a great job getting to the size and scale that they're at today. We think that, working together with them we can expand on that in the future.","They're like a lot of the other acquisitions we've done. Recently, we're looking for well-run companies with highly-differentiated customer experience, and a real sense of customer obsession that matches ours. So we think PillPack has got all those traits, and we look forward to the deal closing and working with them.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark May with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. On AWS, does the backlog there give you confidence in the ability for this business to continue to post the type of robust growth that you've seen of late? And on Alexa, now that you're reaching a meaningful number of Alexa users, I wondered if you could discuss a bit more about how Alexa is impacting retail business?","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Sure. Let me start with AWS. Yeah, we're very happy with the results we're seeing, and the backlog that we see, and the new contracts and new customers and the expansion of existing customer business that we see. Again, the business has accelerated the last three quarters, and we're seeing great signs in a number of areas.","We've added 800 new services and features so far this year; that's an accelerated pace from last year, which was a record year. We see customers have migrated more than 80,000 databases using the AWS Database Migration Service.","And customers are just branching out to a lot of new products from us. There are new areas like machine learning, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, serverless computing and database and analytics are really big. So we think that, when you look at it, why do people come to us? It's essentially set functionality and pace of innovation that we've demonstrated for multiple years. We've built a very strong partner and customer ecosystem. And frankly we've the most proven reliability of security and performance, and we've been at this longer than anyone else.","So again, we continue to deliver for customers. We continue to use feedback from customers to develop new services and features. The operating margin itself will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, a very strong performance this quarter. Obviously, part of that was in the capital leases being flat year-over-year, and the team's ability to really run the data centers at a higher efficiency.","Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.","Yeah. And I think, the second question was just related to how is Alexa impacting the business, overall. And \u2013 hey, this is Dave. I mean, I think, we're having a lot of success with devices and customers are enjoying those. We talked to coming out of Prime Day, had some good success and happy customers enjoying some of the devices there. So I think, that's a lot of \u2013 the focus now is really having a good and exciting roadmap of recent revises and more to come ahead, and getting those into customers' hands.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. Just on the AWS point, as you're seeing customers to AWS, you're adding new customers to AWS, can you give us a sense of sort of where you're seeing customers spend focus. How successful \u2013 you mentioned database, but what other areas you're potentially seeing as customers move up the stack with you and grow?","And then, you flagged the flat capital lease growth on a year-over-year basis. In the past when you've talked about the growth in CapEx and capital lease, you generally referred to trying to grow those numbers or that infrastructure growth overall more or less with the business. Is there some level of efficiency breakthrough that you've gotten there where that's no longer the case? Or is it a function of timing? How should we think about what that CapEx and capital lease spend signals about your expectations for growth?","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Sure. I would say it's just a demonstration of the very tight period where we \u2013 we've still added a lot, I mean, $4.6 billion is a lot of capital leases, but the rate of growth over last year is flat. So what I would say is, I'm not sure about the breakthrough element of it. We do spend a lot of time driving better efficiency in our data centers. We do see it; sometimes it is higher than other quarters. The starting point for our expectation would be, the usage growth would be very \u2013 that our growth in infrastructure costs would start with the growth in usage, which has been exceeding the revenue growth rate.","But we can drive more efficiently and we can sometimes bank the efficiencies of prior investments that we've made in other periods. So it will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. I would say last year in the first half was a pretty large investment area. I'll lump it in with capital expenditures, but in the first two quarters, Q1 of last year, it was 82% growth year-over-year in capital expenditures, Q2 was 67%.","This year, those numbers are 33% in Q1, and 1% in Q2. So it's a \u2013 there's a bit of timing at play here, but I think overall, in the longer-term, we certainly work to drive efficiency in both AWS infrastructure capability, and also in our warehouse networks.","I don't have on the other piece, on product detail, I don't have anything more for you. I would just say that, our growth is coming from customers that span from start-ups to enterprise customers to government agencies, and they start small and then they continue to build and shift their businesses to us, and many of them have gone \u2013 a large number have gone all-in on AWS, and have had a chance to lower their cost structures as a result. I'd count Amazon in that category, because on the consumer side of the business, we increasingly see infrastructure savings due to the conversion to AWS resources.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking my questions, I have two. The first one on the ad business, Brian, I was just wondering, could you give us some examples of some products you've had particular success with on the ad side? And I know you guys are always focused on removing customer friction points and solving pain points for customers, maybe talk to us about some of the still existing pain points for your advertiser customers you're looking to address with the advertising product?","And the second one, I know it's an accounting question, but we're going to be asked it a lot. On revenue accounting, can you just sort of walk us through any of the accounting changes that any of the revenue lines had in the current quarter because of the multiple accounting moving pieces? Thanks.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Yeah, let me give Dave a chance afterwards to talk about that piece, but I'll start with advertising. So conceptually stepping back, it's now a multi-billion dollar business for us. We're seeing strong adoption across a number of fronts. Amazon vendors, sellers, authors as well as third-party advertisers who want to reach Amazon customers.","So we have hundreds of thousands of emerging and established advertisers. And they're using our services to achieve their marketing goals to \u2013 whether that's to drive new brand awareness, discovery or ultimately purchase decisions on our site.","Pain points and improvements, I would say, our priorities include improving the usability of our tools for advertisers, helping make smarter recommendations for customers. Automating, we're doing a lot of work on automating the activities that the advertisers need to do, and continue to invent new products for those advertisers.","We also think measurement is going to be important so we're focused on our measurement capabilities, so advertisers understand what outcomes they're driving on our properties. And we think that we're uniquely positioned to show them the direct benefit of their advertising.","Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.","Yeah. And Brian, this is Dave. Just on the accounting piece, specifically to Q2, the impact of the Accounting Standards Update, revenue recognition changes we did starting in the first part of year, it's a $640 million increase to other revenue, specifically related to how we treat some of the advertising service.","So you remember as part of the adoption beginning in 2018, certainly the advertising services were classified as revenue rather than cost of sales. So $640 million more is in other revenue this second quarter. You'd see that in that line item, which is about $2.2 billion here in the second quarter.","In addition to that, some of the other factors I talked about last quarter, some of the treatment of gross to net changes in some sales of apps and app content, digital media costs, some of that shift created a headwind for online stores revenue. So that year-over-year growth rate for that line item would have been higher, but for that change.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks so much. Two questions if I can. On Whole Foods, any update on the integration of Whole Foods within the broader Prime ecosystem, the way in which you're tying those assets and customer bases together to sort of promote the flywheel that you've talked about a fair bit?","And Prime Now, any update on the scale of markets globally, and what you're learning as Prime Now continues to scale in terms of how users adopt the service, putting SKUs closer to prem what that does to the velocity of purchasing? Thank you so much.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Sure. So, it was a big quarter for Whole Foods and Prime. We launched additional savings for Prime members at Whole Foods. If you go to Whole Foods store or Whole Foods Market 365 store, you see a lot of yellow stickers for 10% discounts of hundreds of sale items. You also see deep discounts on selected popular products. So Prime members have adopted this benefit, it's one of the fastest rates we've ever seen for a Prime benefit, and they've already saved millions of dollars on everything from seasonal favorites to as I said popular daily sales.","So in addition, we've expanded grocery delivery to 20 cities so that's picking up steam. During the Prime Day, we had some unique deals for Prime customers at Whole Foods. Actually, the deals lasted for a week at Whole Foods. And people had, again the ability to see the benefit that Prime membership save incremental dollars, because of it at Whole Foods. And the Prime Rewards Visa Card, which gives you 5% off on all purchases has been applied to Whole Foods' purchases as well.","So that is the second wave, probably after the first wave where we talked in previous calls about initial price drops, putting lockers in the stores, selling some of the Whole Foods' products on the Amazon site, and other things. So the invention level is still really high. We think it's a big milestone this quarter to launch Prime benefits with Whole Foods, and we'll keep going, we'll see how that develops.","Prime Now, I guess, my comments are that, it's in 50 cities worldwide, it's across 9 countries. It is different than \u2013 we have multiple options for you in grocery delivery. We have the delivery services \u2013 so AmazonFresh and Prime Now which serve a certain need. We have a traditional grocery store now with Whole Foods, and then we have the combination of those two with home delivery, and we're using Prime Now or Whole Foods products through Prime Now to make those deliveries as well as the new kind of stores with Amazon Go that we're experimenting with. So lots of innovation, invention on that front as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Ross Sandler - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good evening. Hey guys, I had two questions. First is on the Music business. So I think, you said recently you had tens of millions of paying subscribers. So are those paying music listeners coming from Prime, and using the mobile app, or they coming in from Echo? Any color on what's driving that uptake and converting users into paid members?","Then the second question is, you mentioned efficiency gains in retail and the improvement in retail operating margin. If we look at International, it's still negative, but it's also improving pretty meaningfully, so can you parse where that improvement's coming from between India and the other emerging markets versus some of the more mature markets in Western Europe?","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Sure, let me start with that second question. So, yes, we have seen over the last few quarters, improved operating margins internationally. I would say in places like Europe and Japan, we're seeing many of the efficiencies I talked about earlier on fixed head count, operations costs, infrastructure costs, and also things like marketing working to be very efficient. I would also say that, although it's smaller internationally the impact of advertising is starting to show up more and more internationally. It's growing quite quickly just as it is in North America.","But you're right. We continue to invest. We're investing in India obviously, and have seen good traction there. We just passed our Fifth Year Anniversary \u2013 celebrated our Fifth Year Anniversary, as the most visited site in India. So we think there's a lot of great innovation that has continued to occur for Indian consumers and sellers, and that will continue.","But you're also seeing additional expansion. So we launched Prime in Australia; we're rolling devices out. We launched Echo and Alexa in France. The Echo Spot in India and Japan, and we announced that we're going to expand Echo and Alexa soon to Italy, Mexico and Spain. So I would say that we're continuing to frontload Prime benefits in the newer geographies. So that's one of the issues that we see with operating margin.","But we think it's the right thing to do. We are seeing strong traction in that front as well. We also like that the \u2013 on Prime Day, we were able to expand our list of countries that experience Prime Day; this year to Australia, Singapore, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. So we're very bullish on our International business. We do realize it's a period of investment and we're in different stages of growth in different countries.","Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.","Yeah, and this is Dave. Just quickly on Music, as you mentioned, tens of millions of paid customers are enjoying Amazon Music. When you look at the Amazon Music Unlimited subscription, it continues to grow very quickly. We've got those offerings in more than 30 countries now and the catalog there's tens of millions of songs, and a lot of rich playlists, personalized stations, those kinds of things.","Of course we started in Music with Prime Music, a little bit earlier in that space, and I think that's been a great way for Prime members to enjoy some of that catalog for free, and then as they enjoy that, be able to move into the Amazon Music Unlimited skill.","One of the great things that's also part of that, I think, you alluded to it is just Alexa, and one of the most popular features we see as you probably imagine for using those devices are just interacting with Alexa, wherever you may be is being able to listen to music. So that's proven to be a, I think, a good skill for folks to be able to enjoy in addition to a really kind of rich and growing Amazon skill set. We now have more than 45,000 skills available to customers.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Youssef Squali with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed with your question.","Youssef Squali - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you very much. On the new Supreme Court decision, you guys have been collecting state taxes in all 45 states where it's applicable for a 1P. And for a 3P, I think, it was in two states. Have you seen any slowdown to growth in these two states since you began collecting taxes? I think, you started maybe last 12 months or so.","When will you start collecting taxes in the rest of the country, and will you charge for it? Because my understanding is that, in those two states you do not collect or you do not charge to help these 3P sellers file taxes or collect state taxes. Thank you.","Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.","Yeah. Hey, Youssef this is Dave. So right now, as you mentioned 45 states that have state-imposed sales tax, first-party products we do our own collection on that. For 3P sellers right now, it's three states. So Washington State started as of January 1, Pennsylvania as of April 1, and most recently Oklahoma on July 1. So those are the ones where we're collecting and remitting. We haven't said \u2013 and to your second point we've not talked about any kind of trends. As you could imagine some of these are still really early days.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Jason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Given the focus in the press release about Alexa Voice Services, any thoughts about how you would monetize on third-party devices? And then just a follow up on Amazon Prime Video Channels, any plans to offer standard skinny bundles to become a cable replacement? Thanks.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Yeah, let me start with Alexa. So right now, our emphasis is around expanding the reach of Alexa and the usefulness. So as Dave mentioned, we're now up over 45,000 skills. We have a developer network of \u2013 that's expanded and we have over 13,000 smart home devices from 2,500 unique brands. You're seeing things like expansion into the hotel space where we're partnering with hotels to allow you to experience Alexa while you're traveling.","And you saw from the quote that was in our press release from Jeff, the number of Alexa-enabled devices has tripled in the past year, so \u2013 including some really large companies like Polk, Sonos, Acer, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, BMW, Ford, Toyota to name a few. So that's the biggest emphasis, is getting the expansion of Alexa to places where it can be useful. We also are developing new machine learning tools to help developers more easily build Alexa skills. We feel like we're getting great traction there.","So I think your original question was about monetization of Alexa, but right now the biggest thing we can do is to make it as useful as possible, and make devices that can use the skills.","Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.","Yeah, and then just on the second question. I mean, I can't speculate on what we might do in the future, but I'd say today, with Prime Channels, I think, we're really pleased with the growth we're seeing. We've seen some good channels come online over the last few quarters, and seen some good traction there. So we'll keep focusing on building out even better selection, because it's clear to us that customers want that option to be able to add that content as part of their Prime memberships.","Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.","Thanks for joining us today on the call and for your questions.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q4 2018 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded.","For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.","Dave Fildes","Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2018 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2017.","Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, January 31, 2019 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.","During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.","Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.","Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.","With that, we'll move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.","Justin Post","Great. Thank you. I guess I'll ask about units, 14% in the quarter, just, how do you feel about the overall unit growth here, given that the growth was higher last year in the 20s and do you think there are some investments you can make in other areas to kind of reaccelerate that going forward?","And then secondly, just if you could remind us or help us understand the Prime accounting change impact on subscription revenues in Q4? Thank you.","Brian Olsavsky","Take the subscription first.","Dave Fildes","Yeah. Hey, Justin, this is Dave. Just on the second question on the subscription services, we\u2019d said on the last call, you probably remember, related to the adoption of the accounting standards update and revenue recognition policies that was impacting our results in a number of areas in 2018. We\u2019d said we'd anticipated about 300 million lower sort of headwind to subscription services revenue due to the accounting change. So that's where we came out for the quarter. So you'll see that, we reported subscription services revenue increased 26% when you exclude FX. So the 300 million is certainly part of that decelerate -- the sequential deceleration in the growth rate in that line item.","Brian Olsavsky","Yeah. And on unit deceleration, I think the unit numbers more and more require some interpretation, because it doesn't include the -- some of our fastest growing areas, the things like, as Dave mentioned, subscription services, AWS, advertising, Whole Foods units are not in that number. So we don't focus as much on the number and we direct you more to the supplemental revenue guidance that breaks out the component parts. But in general, we feel good about the growth in the quarter. ","We think it was a, Q4 in particular was a great quarter for customers that retail, there is a lot of strength in the retail part of the businesses, the teams here had done a great job, planning, preparing and then executing on the quarter. AWS maintained a very strong growth rate and continued to deliver for customers. We had a great Reinvent Conference in the quarter. So we feel good about the growth in the quarter and also the total revenue and income.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.","Mark Mahaney","Thanks. Just comment a little bit on the international revenue outlook and any commentary on India and whether you think there's a material impact on your business?","Secondly, could you talk about advertising revenue, just qualitatively or quantitatively, how that's doing? And third, if I could, you spent a lot on marketing in the quarter, it's a real step up. Do you just want to talk about the ROI that you think you're getting on that marketing spend?","Brian Olsavsky","Sure, Mark. The first question is on India. Let me start with that. So we have incorporated into our guidance estimate, the best estimate we have for Q1 in India, however, there is much uncertainty as to what the impact of the government rule change is going to have on the e-commerce sector there. We remain committed to complying with all laws and regulations, we will, but we're evaluating the situation. Our main issue and our main concern is trying to minimize the impact to our customers and sellers in India. We've built our business around price selection and convenience. We don't think the changes help in those dimensions for both the customers in India and also the sellers.","Dave, why don\u2019t you talk about the advertising growth?","Dave Fildes","Yeah, yeah. I think I mean, we're continuing to -- there's a lot of focus on serving that customer set. One of the things we're trying to do is continually evolve our tools and the products to help that customer set agencies, advertisers, make sure they've got a variety of ways to meet their goals. Some of the things we've done more recently over the last few months or so is expanded sponsor brands, placements, some rolled out new campaign reports, so improved campaign manager features. So a number of -- there's a number of things beyond that, but features out there that are just going to, I think, make it easier for companies to grow with the ad tools and the ad services that we offer and we're continually excited about the opportunity there.","Brian Olsavsky","And then on your question of marketing, yes, the marketing percent of revenue was up 110 basis points year-over-year. This category also includes AWS sales and marketing and keep that in mind, because that's where a lot of our headcount investment is going. Headcount only grew 14% year-over-year, but the areas that were growing in that mix were things like technology teams, device areas, AWS, especially sales and marketing. So variable marketing was pretty consistent with prior periods and we feel good about our return on investment on the marketing, the variable marketing.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.","Doug Anmuth","Great. Thank you. I just wanted to follow up on India, just bigger picture, Brian, do the new policies change your view at all of the attractiveness or the potential of operating in India and how do you think about your investment strategy there in the near term? And then also just hoping you could talk about some of the impact in the US and UK from free shipping during the fourth quarter holidays?","Brian Olsavsky","Yeah. Really, we're still evaluating the situation in India. We feel very good about the long term prospects in India and doing a good job for both Indian customers and Indian sellers. The new regulations need to be interpreted, need to be -- need to make sure they don't have unintended consequences. And again, I don't think it's necessarily consistent with better price, better selection and better convenience for the Indian customer. So it's not all we can say on that topic right now. ","Dave Fildes","Yeah. And I think Doug, your second point was just around shipping, some of the shipping offers in the holiday. We did lower the free shipping threshold ahead in to the fourth quarter, so customers took advantage of that and that was a great offer for them in the holidays. Brian talked a little bit about it before, but pleased with the holiday season, both from sort of a first party side, but also sellers continuing to do well. As part of the holiday offering, we sold a number of record breaking number of Alexa devices as well and I think just in that shipping vein, really pleased with the continued engagement from Prime members, we had the most ever number of Prime members sign up this quarter than any quarter we've had. So really pleased with that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi.","Mark May","Thank you. When I try to back out the impact factors like Whole Foods, the advertising accounting change and other factors, what I see is stable and pretty healthy revenue growth for the retail segment, but a slowdown in Q4 from what seems to have been, in more recent quarters, meaningful gross margin expansion in the retail segment. Can you discuss what may have driven that and how to think about retail gross margins going forward?","And then somewhat separately, retail margins last year benefited from several factors, including more modest hiring and more modest growth in fulfillment center capacity, do you see these factors persisting this year? Thanks.","Dave Fildes","Yeah. Thank you. Let me start with that last part, because I think if we step back and put 2018 in perspective, there are some clear trends regarding our cost structure. Starting with fulfillment costs, so in the prior two years, 2016, and 2017, we had grown our square footage tied to fulfilment and shipping by greater than 30%. In 2018, that number grew by 15%. Certainly, unit demand was lower, but AFN or Amazon Fulfilled demand were, we\u2019ve combined FBA and retail, remained strong. So we had a banking, if you will, of some large expansions in the prior two years. Similarly on headcount, we grew headcount by 48% in 2016, 38% in 2017, if you exclude the acquisitions of Whole Foods and Souq, which drove the number up to closer to 68% I believe. Last year, we were at 14% growth. And so, there was a lot of leverage and a lot of, in a way, there was a lot of pre hiring in 2017 that we digested in 2018, while we still continue, in some areas, especially things like our core retail business and also G&A functions, but then we continue to invest again in the technology tied to AWS sales team to an AWS device area. So their groups are growing considerably higher than that 14%, but on total, the company grew 14%. ","And then on capital, especially infrastructure capital, if you use the capital lease slide as maybe an indicator for what we have invested into our AWS business to support infrastructure and global expansion, that number grew 10% last year, when it had grown 69% in 2017. So in a lot of ways, 2018 was about banking the efficiencies of investments in people, warehouses, infrastructure that we had put in place in 2016 and \u201917. So while we'll continue to concurrently drive growth and customer offering and Prime benefits, we certainly do take costs seriously and we will continue to work on operational efficiencies. I would expect these investments to increase relative to 2018 and we've reflected what we see so far in Q1 in our guidance.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.","Heath Terry","Great. Thank you. A little bit -- to dig a little bit deeper into the CapEx capital lease side of things, you guys have said in the past that generally you work to build in line with your expectations for guidance, so that you are trying not to over build or under build when thinking about your fulfilment in data center capacity. We saw that investment re-accelerate in the fourth quarter, after hitting the lows that you referenced in Q3. Anything to read into that about sort of what your expectations are for growth in those businesses, seeing that reacceleration after the deceleration that we saw over the course of at least the first three quarters of last year.","Brian Olsavsky","Yeah. I see total CapEx that was -- grew 33% in Q1, 1% in Q2, negative 1% in Q3 and then positive 17% in Q4, just the quarter itself. So there was, as you say, a bit of investment in Q4 relative to Q2 and Q3. I still think the 17% is a low number for us, when you talk about the -- supporting the AWS business that's still growing in a very high clip and a very strong and healthy growth in FBA and customer demand and our expansion into new countries, both with AWS and also with our core consumer business. So I am not prepared to give you the forecast for the year right now. I would say that, I would consider 2018 to be a lighter investment year and the lighter year for adding fixed headcount certainly compared to 2016 and 2017 we'll reveal that as we go through the year, but we've built into the first quarter what we expect in the first three months.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.","Brian Nowak","Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Just -- the first one is to go back to the fourth quarter gross margins. I think if we try to back out AWS, it looks like there was a little more gross margin pressure. Can you just talk to any of the puts and takes we should know about from a gross margin perspective in the fourth quarter and then that other line that I think includes the advertising business, can you just help us, any help at all on the growth of the advertising business or the impact of any of the accounting changes in the quarter? Thanks.","Brian Olsavsky","Yes. Sure. I\u2019m sorry I skipped over that gross margin question earlier, but yeah, gross margins were well up 180 basis points year-over-year, were not up as much as prior quarters. I would say the positive tailwinds still remain, AWS has strong growth of 46% on an FX neutral basis. Third party units continue to grow, advertising dollars continue to grow very well. Some of the headwinds, I would say, were outbound shipping cost, including the free shipping that we did, but mostly, it was the higher Amazon fulfilled units and the greater use of Amazon logistics. And I would also say retail was very strong. ","We had a, as I think Dave mentioned, the Echo Dot was the highest selling unit globally, so devices had very strong sales in the quarter. We discussed how we don't price devices to make money. We usually will expand our content, expanding our device and usage. There are a group of customers who use our devices and then we monetize that in different ways to commitment to Amazon and the video and everything else. So a bit of it was mix, but I would say this retail, which has a lower gross margin more because of the revenue treatment was stronger in Q4.","Dave Fildes","Yeah. And just on the other revenue piece, Brian, just to get back to the accounting side. We did adopt that revenue recognition standard in 2018 as I mentioned. As part of the adoption, certain advertising services were classified as revenue rather than a reduction of cost of sales. So specific to Q4, the impact of that change was an increase of approximately $1 billion to other revenue, so you will see that in the other revenue in total.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird.","Colin Sebastian","Thanks. I guess two for me as well. In the quarter, looking backwards, not considering India and the impact going forward, but the international growth accelerated, so I was curious any particular regions or product categories to call out, especially given some of the weakness in the UK? And then marketplace fees are changing in several categories, including Home Furnishings, health and beauty, curious what the strategy is there, I assume to expand selection, but is it also an indication of an increasing focus on those retail categories? Thanks.","Brian Olsavsky","Sure. Let me start with your second question. Obviously, third party sellers are an important part of our value proposition there. They\u2019ve had great success on our site, the -- more than half of our units sold are from third party sellers. So it's very important to us that we have the right business profile, both for Amazon and for the sellers. So we will always be evolving that, part of that involves changing fee structures, sometimes, adding new fees or subtracting old ones, part of it involves raising or lowering fees that sellers pay. So you're going to see this continually from us. We generally work to change the fees to make sure that the incentives are strong on both sides and we continue to have a healthy growth in third party.","On the international, on an FX neutral basis, the growth was 15% in Q3 and 19% in Q4. But last call, if you remember, I talked about the timing of Diwali and the impact that had on our growth rates. If we adjust for that and again Diwali had, took place primarily in Q4 this year and it was split between Q3 and Q4 last year. If we adjust for that, international growth is pretty flat Q3 to Q4.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank.","Lloyd Walmsley","Thanks. Two if I can. First, just on the advertising side, we hear a lot of positive feedback from customers, but also we hear suggestions of their supply constraints. So, how do you guys see inventory growth versus pricing growth as a driver in that business and are there things you can do to grow inventory?","And then secondly, there have been some reports, your Amazon shipping effort is kind of expanding beyond some test markets. So wondering if you can give us a sense for what you've seen in this test markets and how you think about expanding your shipping efforts on that productized basis going forward? Thanks.","Brian Olsavsky","Yeah. Lloyd, thanks for the questions. I'll take the advertising piece first. I mean, I think as I talked before, we're working on the improving usability of tools. I mean, our priorities in the space, that's certainly one of them looking for ways to make smarter recommendations, addressing the needs of brands, automating activities, incenting new products and I think in all those regards in those priorities, we think there's some good growth to continue to come both in advertising for on our own properties, but also potentially beyond, over the longer term, so, but even as we look for advertising opportunities on places like Amazon.com, we think there's a lot of opportunity and a lot of experimentation. I think we're learning and are a very data interested company and working with a lot of great brands to be able to develop better toolkits for them, understand what types of metrics they want to make them more successful based on what they're telling us.","Dave Fildes","Yeah. And on transportation, I assume you're just talking about our expansion of Amazon deliveries and Amazon logistics. Again, we have great partners in place for our business and support globally, what we do is add capacity where we feel we need to speed up service or ensure demand, particularly at peak. So we will continue to build out our DSP and flex and chip with Amazon programs. So during the quarter, it was a much bigger presence obviously year-over-year, so we're happy with that, both from a performance standpoint, the delivery estimate accuracy as we call it was very strong on our self-delivered products and also the cost profile is very good as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS.","Eric Sheridan","Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two if I can. One on the media side, has there been any step-up in terms of investments around media content to support your ambition with respect to Prime and the video. It's been a couple of years now since we got an update on rate of spend or how it might impact either historical periods or going forward periods, that would be number one.","And then number two, going back to Lloyd's question on the advertising front, how do you think about the video opportunity, you're moving beyond just branded opportunities or sponsored products search on your own properties and thinking about experimenting with over the top video or connected TV opportunities [indiscernible] going forward. Thanks so much.","Brian Olsavsky","Yeah. Let me start with video. We're not quantifying the Prime video spend today, but we do \u2013 it has been increasing. We expect it to increase even further in 2019. We're seeing a lot of again continued strong adoption and the usage and viewing and hours watched of our -- both our music and our seasoned video and music. And as a step back, it builds stronger Prime connectivity with our Prime members, at least, the higher membership renewal rates and higher overall engagement. And as we like, we see -- we continue to see that engagement growing. I would say that we've had some particular success in -- recently with 10 Golden Globe nominations and 3 Oscar nominations and Jack Ryan homecoming in season two of the [indiscernible] in particular, were very well received during the quarter.","Dave Fildes","Yeah. And then on your second question, just around advertising opportunities and around video, you may have seen it not that long ago, IMDB or Internet Movie Database, one of our subsidiaries, launched FreeDive, which is an ad supported free streaming video channel that's available in the US and it enables customers to watch TV shows and movies without purchasing a subscription. So ad supported, so that's available on the IMDB website with your laptop or personal computer on. I think it's definitely on the Fire TV devices as well is a great way to consume content. ","So I think excited about that, other opportunities we've been working with in ads, video for a bit longer period of time have been things like our sports offering, some of the live sports that we've done, things like Thursday Night Football, really like the success that we've seen on those and been learning from that and looking forward to pursuing more opportunities to engage and serve with customers with those types of video offers, but also take some opportunity to monetize with the advertising.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer.","Jason Helfstein","Thanks. Just two, so just can you comment, did advertising slow down relative to third quarter. One, you kind of adjusting for 606 and then secondly, was there any reallocation in segments between online and physical stores and if not any commentary why physical stores was down year-over-year? Thanks.","Brian Olsavsky","Yeah. Thanks, Jason for your questions. Let me start with the physical stores revenues. So physical stores decreased 3% year-over-year and this is primarily Whole Foods, but also includes our other stores, the Amazon Books stores, Amazon Go, Amazon 4 star. What happened in the quarter was we were lapping a period last year when we \u2013 we had purchased Whole Foods in Q3, as you remember of 2017. In Q4, we adjusted their fiscal calendar to link it up with Amazon's and it added about 5 days of revenue into Q4 of last year. So we're comping that year-over-year.","The second piece is that, the -- as you said, the online orders where people go to the Prime Now app and then order for delivery or pick up at Whole Foods stores does count or is counted in the online stores component of revenues. So if you adjust for those, with the Whole Foods growth year-over-year on an apples-to-apples basis was approximately 6%. Because of some of those, again, mostly the year-over-year accounting days, true up issue, it's showing up as negative 3% in physical stores.","Dave Fildes","Yeah. And then just on your second question around advertising, if you look at the other revenue, the growth rate decelerated some. So it's at 97%, still very strong, year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter in other revenue as I think you're aware, there are a number of components, but the largest by a good margin is the advertising revenue and we are comping a period of rapid growth in the prior year, so that is part of the factor there as you mentioned, but I\u2019d just reiterate, we're continuing to see quite strong adoption across Amazon\u2019s vendors, sellers, authors, all types of advertisers that are utilizing that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets.","Dan Salmon","Good afternoon, everyone. Brian, can we just return to your comment earlier about the increased use of Amazon logistics, not a surprise there, but just curious through the holiday season, any particular learnings that you can offer some color on and how you view the balance between using your own proprietary logistics versus third parties as you go into 2019?","And then just a quick follow-up, obviously the HQ2 news came out during the quarter, what would you highlight as maybe the most important next steps there and maybe some color on the feedback from that process, I would be interested to hear that as well? Thank you.","Brian Olsavsky","Yes, sure. So let\u2019s start with HQ2. Of course, in November, we announce we selected New York City and Northern Virginia and between the two cities, we will be investing $5 billion and creating more than 50000 jobs. We also announced a Operations Center of Excellence to be opened up in Nashville, which is about -- estimated to be about 5000 jobs. So right now, we're working through some next issues in both cities. We\u2019re looking forward to investing in New York and Northern Virginia and being a good community partner as well as Nashville. So not really much else to report at this time on that.","On your comment or question on transportation, we do continue to expand our Amazon logistics and delivery capability and it also matches up with our faster ship speed that we're seeing for Prime members as well. We added, of course, we have over 100 million items that customers would get within two days, but there's now over 3 million that will be delivered within one day or faster in 10,000 cities in town. So Amazon deliveries are a big part of that. Again, we have great third party partners as well in the transportation space. What we like about our ability to participate in transportation is that a lot of times, we can do it at the same cost or better and we like the cost profile of the two. ","We can also invest selectively because we have more perfect information we know where our demand is, we know where we're moving things between warehouses and sort centers and by not involving third parties all the time, we can find that we can extend our ship cut offs, or excuse me, our order cutoffs and we've done that over the last few years. So that's also another helpful side benefit for consumers when we are doing our own logistics, excuse me, transportation final delivery.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays.","Ross Sandler","So the AWS operating margins historically kind of move around a bit. Any color on what drove the decline sequentially from 3Q to 4Q? And then I guess going back to the investment catch up theme, it sounds like 2019 will be a little bit more aggressive push from you guys. Can you parse out whether you expect the pace of retail margin expansion that we're seeing in North America right now, is that going to continue and most of these investments are going to be in international and some of the stuff going on in India and any color on the North America operating margin trajectory? Thanks.","Brian Olsavsky","Yeah. Sure. Let me start with the AWS operating margin, as you called it out. That number will move around, we're very pleased with the 29.3% that we saw during the quarter. Of course, at any point in time, this business is going to be a combination of lowering prices, expanding geographically, adding people to build, especially tech teams and sales teams to build new and innovative products and staying very relevant and ahead of our customers\u2019 minds. And infrastructure, well again, it will balance between quarters a bit. ","Our capital lease expenditure in Q4 was a bit higher than the prior three quarters. That had slight impact on the operating margin, but again year-over-year, operating margins were up and were almost 280 basis points. We've said quite openly that this is going to bounce around. What we do is to create great value for the customer on one end and then work to minimize our cost of infrastructure and we're getting more and more creative around getting efficiency up and getting our cost of acquisition down.","Dave Fildes","Thanks for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations site at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon and look forward to talking with you again next quarter."],"999":["Amazon.com, Inc.

Also, today's call is being recorded.","For opening remarks, I'll be turning the conference over to the Director of Investor Relations, Phil Hardin. Please go ahead, sir.","Phil Hardin","Hello and welcome to our Q2 2014 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.","The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 24, 2014 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.","During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.","Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2013.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Szkutak","Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our second quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 18% to $5.33 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $1.04 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.29 billion. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth consisting of additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations and investments in technology infrastructure including Amazon Web Services.","Return on invested capital was 6%, up from 2%, ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter-ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 480 million shares compared with 474 million one year ago.","Worldwide revenue grew 23% to $19.34 billion or 22% excluding the $237 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. Media revenue increased to $4.84 billion, up 10% or 9% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $13.28 billion, up 27% or 26% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 69% of worldwide sales, up from 66%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 23%. Active customer accounts exceeded 250 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 41% of paid units.","Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $13.4 billion or 69.3% of revenue compared with 71.4%. Fulfillment, marketing, tech and content and G&A combined was $5.54 billion or 28.6% of sales, up approximately 260 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $2.28 billion or 11.8% of revenue compared with 11.2%. Tech and content was $2.02 billion or 10.4% of revenue compared with 9.1%. Marketing was $911 million or 4.7% of revenue compared with 4.1%.","Now I'll talk about our segment results. And consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 26% to $12 billion. Media revenue grew 13% to $2.46 billion or 14% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 29% to $8.37 billion, representing 70% of North America revenues, up from 68%. Other revenue grew 38% to $1.17 billion. North America segment operating income increased 7% to $438 million, a 3.7% operating margin.","In the international segment, revenue grew 18% to $7.34 billion. Excluding the $246 million year-over-year favorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 14%. Media revenue grew 7% to $2.38 billion or 4% excluding foreign exchange, and EGM revenue grew 25% to $4.91 billion or 20% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 67% of international revenues, up from 63%. International segment operating loss was $34 million compared to zero in the prior period.","CSOI decreased 1% to $404 million or 2.1% of revenue, down approximately 50 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange rate, CSOI decreased 9%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income or loss includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating loss was $15 million compared to operating income of $79 million in the prior-year period. Our income tax expense was $94 million, and this includes approximately $90 million of discrete tax items primarily attributable to audit-related developments. GAAP net loss was $126 million or $0.27 per diluted share compared with a net loss of $7 million and $0.02 per diluted share.","Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $523 million year-over-year to $7.99 billion. Inventory increased 23% to $6.64 billion, and inventory turns were 9.1, down from 9.4 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 16% to $10.46 billion and accounts payable days decreased to 71 from 73 in the prior year.","I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.","As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently.","For Q3 2014, we expect net sales of between $19.7 billion and $21.5 billion or growth of between 15% and 26%. This guidance anticipates approximately 120 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating loss to be between $810 million loss and a $410 million loss compared to a $25 million loss in the third quarter of 2013. This includes approximately $410 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.","We anticipate consolidated segment operating income or loss, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $400 million loss and zero compared to $267 million of income in the third quarter of 2013.","We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.","Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move to questions.","Phil Hardin","Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We'll hear first today from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein.","Carlos Kirjner - Bernstein","Tom, you mentioned in the past that China is an area of investments. Can you say a little bit about what are the main drivers of investment there, whether it's marketing pricing fulfillment? And how do you decide on any given year how much we invest in China, just given the size of the potential market and opportunity? And secondly, we saw a material deceleration in the North America other revenues. Was this primarily driven by AWS deceleration, and is this deceleration a meaningful contributor to the losses implied in your next quarter guidance?","Tom Szkutak","Yes, North America other includes a number of things including Amazon Web Services. Amazon Web Services is the largest part of North America other. As we talked about on last call, we had very substantial price reductions for customers starting in second quarter. They ranged from 28% to 51% depending on the service. But AWS continues to grow very strongly. In Q2, we had usage growth close to 90% year-over-year for the quarter. So the team is doing a fantastic job. And we put in some price reductions that were very substantial that are saving customers hundreds and millions of dollars over the next several months, as we mentioned 90 days ago.","But again, we love that business. It's doing great and we're very pleased to have the opportunity to invest in it. The team is innovating very quickly. In fact, so far year-to-date, they've released 250 significant service and features and that's at a pace that's much, much faster than last year's pace, which was faster than the year before. So again, they're continuing to innovate on behalf of customers. And so we're investing. And so that's certainly impacting both the pricing decisions we've made. They're certainly impacting the guidance. Also, the large amount of CapEx in infrastructure for that business is certainly impacting the guidance along with a number of other things across the business that we're investing in. But we're very pleased to do that.","In terms of China, we're continuing to invest on behalf of customers there, obviously trying to make the experience even better for customers in terms of improved in-stock levels. We've certainly added a lot of fulfillment capacity over time in China, and we're doing a lot of interesting things to better serve customers in China.","In terms of some of the other parts of your question, there's not much more I can add to that.","Operator","We'll hear next from Neil Doshi with CRT Capital.","Neil Doshi - CRT Capital","Tom, can you talk a little bit about the deceleration in the units? And then also, in terms of the third-party dollar, it looks like you're trending around 40%. For a while, it ticked up a little bit to 41%. And so if we adjust for digital, how should that trend be looking?","Tom Szkutak","In terms of unit growth, we had 23% unit growth year-over-year. It is down from last year's growth rate, but it's consistent with what we've seen recently including the last quarter. And in terms of the third-party units as a percentage of total units, you're right that's 41% this quarter. It's up about 100 basis points. And we're not breaking out the digital versus physical on that. But again, very strong third-party growth, a number of factors, but certainly FBA is helping third-party growth.","Operator","And we'll go next to Eric Sheridan with UBS.","Eric Sheridan - UBS","Looking through the expense lines, tech and content seem to have an upward pressure in the quarter. Why don't you maybe give a little more granularity on what was driving that upward pressure and whether that's sort of a new run rate of expense as we saw in the first half of this year?","Tom Szkutak","There's a number of things that are going into the tech and content line. But you're right we're the ones that I just mentioned, we are investing in various parts of the business, but certainly for Amazon Web Services, that's both from an infrastructure standpoint to support the very fast usage growth that we're experiencing. Again, we have usage growth close to 90% year-over-year in the second quarter for Web Services. In addition to that, over the past year, we've added thousands of people in Web Services. So again, ramping that up. And then across a number of different other investment areas, we continue to add great technical resources to do the things we're doing in digital and many other parts of the company. So again, we have a lot of opportunities to invest in, as you can see from a lot of the releases that we've had over the past 12 months, and you're certainly seeing that reflected in our actual results as well.","Operator","And next from JPMorgan, we'll go to Douglas Anmuth.","Kaizad Gotla - JPMorgan","This is Kaizad Gotla for Doug. I was wondering if you could just talk about the deceleration in your international EGM line. And then separately, now that you've had Prime price increases in effect for about three months, wondering if you could just talk about any changes you've seen in sign-ups or conversions there.","Tom Szkutak","In terms of international EGM, and this would really related to total international growth as well, we saw 18% growth on a dollar basis, 14% growth on a local currency growth basis. We're just down a little bit sequentially from what we saw in Q1. Obviously there's variability from quarter-to-quarter in each of the geographies that we operate in. One call-out which impacted certainly EGM and our total international growth rate is Japan. We saw on April 1st, the consumption tax was increased from 5% to 8%.","Leading up to that in the latter part of Q1, we certainly saw accelerated growth, so that was reflected in the Q1 results. In Q2, we saw some corresponding softness in Q2 following that. Hard to know how much was related to consumption growth, but certainly as you've probably read elsewhere that others are seeing that too. So it probably reflects the consumption tax increase. But if you take out Japan out of both Q1 and Q2, the growth rates on a local currency basis were very similar within approximately 100 basis points of each other.","In terms of Prime, Prime subscribers are growing very nicely year-over-year. In fact, we had more Prime subscribers in Q2 of this year than in Q2 of last year. So we're very pleased and we continue to get new subscribers as well as existing customers responding to the great value they're getting out of Prime.","Operator","And from Citi, we'll go to Mark May.","Mark May - Citi","Based on sort of what you've talked about in the disclosures around the price, the amount of the price decreases, the common sense would suggest that all if not most of the CSOI margin decline that you posted in Q2 year-on-year is related to the AWS price changes. And the common sense would also suggest that given the significant volume gains that you're seeing in that business that Q2 might be the most impacted quarter from that yet. The third quarter guidance suggests that it's having an even greater impact on Q3. Just wondering if you could help us think through that. Is there some timing issue related to the impact of that, or is there something else going on within the core retail business or maybe some other one-time items that might be impacting your Q3 outlook?","Tom Szkutak","We're not quantifying the impact of the price changes on our Q2 and Q3, but it is fair to say that it certainly did impact our Q2 results in a meaningful way. And that's reflected in the results that you're seeing. Another thing to keep in mind as you look out related to AWS is we're continuing to invest in that business. And with the great strong usage growth rates that we're seeing, we're also investing in CapEx and infrastructure to support that growth. So again, the team has done a fantastic job innovating on behalf of customers. And as I mentioned earlier, the new releases both from a service and feature perspective was about 250 year-to-date, which is at a pace that's much faster than we've seen over the last few years with very high bar, given all the innovation that's happened from that team in that space.","So again, there are certainly things that are impacting Q3 guidance. There's a number of other things. When you look at Q3, keep in mind if you look back over the last several years, we're getting ready for Q4 seasonal quarter. And when that happens, if you look back, certainly you've seen our CSOI usually has been at the lowest point for the year during Q3, particularly during these high growth years. And so we've announced that we're adding six net new fulfillment centers. And we've also announced that we'll have 15 or more sortation centers. The sortation centers help us get closer to customers, so that we can have fastest delivery speed as well as deliver on Sundays, which is a big deal for us in the US. So we're very pleased to be able to do that.","On top of that, other investment areas that are certainly impacting our Q3 guidance is we like what we see on the content side. So video content, for example, we're ramping up the spend from Q2 to Q3 significantly. And so it'll be also a significant growth year-over-year. Keep in mind we have two types of content. We have license content. We also have original content. A lot of you have probably seen a lot of the announcements that we've green-lighted a number of pilots. We're going to be in heavy production in those series that have been green-lit during Q3. We've also announced a number of pilots that will be in production on. And so that original content, it's a portion of our total content, will be over $100 million in Q3.","Just as a reminder, we do not capitalize that portion of our original content. Its expense is incurred. So that's over $100 million in Q3. And again, that's ramped up considerably both on a sequential and on a year-over-year basis.","Other areas that we're investing in, certainly with the launch of some new devices more recently over the past couple of quarters between Fire Phone and Fire TV and others, over time we've invested in devices. So that's certainly an area we're investing in. We're investing in a lot of different areas including geographic expansion. We talked about China on one of the earlier questions. But certainly India, we're investing very heavily. We're seeing some very positive results there. The team is doing a fantastic job. We're also investing in other geographies as well, Italy and Spain and others. So again, we're encouraged by just the sheer magnitude of opportunities we have and we're investing in those opportunities.","Operator","We'll move next to Brian Pitz with Jefferies.","Brian Pitz - Jefferies","First question on FBA. Any insights on the penetration of third-party sellers using FBA. Maybe you could comment just directionally? Is the number trending up or down? And separately, it's been less than a week, but can you comment on early feedback to Kindle Unlimited by customers and publishers? Do you expect this to be the model for digital book consumption in the future?","Tom Szkutak","In terms of FBA, it's doing great. I can't provide a specific percent. But it's really since the time we've launched continued to increase as a percentage of total third-party units. And so the service has done very well. The team continues to work on making it even better on behalf of sellers and customers.","In terms of Kindle Unlimited, it's very early, but we're extremely pleased with what we see. There's been a great reaction to it. And we're pleased to offer that to customers.","Operator","Moving next to Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.","Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs","You mentioned that you were happy with the results that you're seeing from the video content. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of sort of how that manifests itself, whether it's more Prime subscribers, whether it's more consumption of downloadable video content within the ecosystem. And then, Tom, to the extent that you're talking about sort of AWS volume increases on a year-over-year basis, can you give us a sense of how that may have trended over the course of the quarter as your AWS customers were able to sort of adapt to the price reduction in March?","Tom Szkutak","In terms of content, we've seen just more and more customers are streaming, more and more Prime members are streaming free content. We're seeing through our pipeline as customers join Prime, we're seeing that we have more and more customers taking free trials and then converting. Those customers are great customers. In addition to streaming free content, they have great purchasing patterns, doing a lot of cross-shopping on physical products as well as converting to paid digital video and other digital products as well. So we're very pleased with what we're seeing there. And when you look at the service that we have today, it's improved dramatically over the past 12 to 24 months. And we really think it's a great service and that's why we're investing in it.","In terms of AWS, there's not much I can help you with on that. But again, just to reiterate, we saw very strong growth during Q2 with usage growth rates close to 90% year-over-year for the quarter. And we're extremely happy with what we see there, and the team has done a fantastic job, continue to innovate on behalf of customers.","Operator","We'll hear next from John Blackledge with Cowen & Company.","John Blackledge - Cowen & Company","Just a couple of question, first on AWS. Just wondering your take on the competitive environment in public cloud, has it intensified over the past six to 12 months, just given the investments in AWS? How do you view AWS's competitive positioning? And then if you could just touch on the key drivers of EGM growth in North America, and are those the same drivers of growth internationally or are there different drivers North America versus international?","Tom Szkutak","They work hard to be able to afford lower prices for customers. That's something that is instilled in all of Amazon and something certainly is instilled in our Web Services team. And their folks on what they do best, which is innovating on behalf of customers, operating these services at the highest quality levels, and they continue to work on getting more efficient, so that we can have great prices for customers. And so that's a team that's focused and they're doing a great job.","In terms of EGM growth between North America and international, there's not a lot I can call out there. It has many different categories across many different geographies, many different ASINs both first party and third party. So it's hard to comment. The only thing I would call for attention is the comment I made earlier around international growth rates related to EGM, and that was the consumption tax increase in Japan that we saw a lead in Q1 where we saw very strong growth leading up to that point and it softened after the rates went into effect. But other than that, there's not a lot to call out.","Operator","We'll now go to Macquarie's Ben Schachter.","Ben Schachter - Macquarie","When you mentioned that AWS is growing 90% year-over-year, what exactly is growing 90%? Is it storage? Is it something else? And then on the phone itself, are there any key differences in how we should be thinking about that piece of hardware versus other hardware you've done in the past where Jeff has discussed the notion of potentially one to breakeven? And then just a follow-up on that. How are you modeling the impact of the phone on the P&L in 3Q? Is it going to be more or less than the original content initiative?","Tom Szkutak","In terms of AWS, it's really aggregation of usage across all of our services year-over-year. Think of it as almost a proxy similar to unit growth on our retail business. It's a proxy to say how fast the physical volume is growing. And so that's what it's a proxy for.","In terms of the phone, there's not a lot I can help you with on that. We're extremely pleased to get it in customers' hands. We think it's a premium product. You get a 32 gigabyte phone, premium product, one-year free subscription to Prime along with all the other features that I'm sure you've read about. So again, we're very pleased to get it to customers and start shipping. And customers have started to receive those today.","Operator","And from William Blair, we'll go to Mark Miller.","Mark Miller - William Blair","Many investments, it looks like where you are getting a return is in the gross margin. If I take out AWS, it looks like you're up nearly 200 basis points. What are the drivers of that e-commerce margin increase? Are you seeing it primarily on the first-party margin expansion? And if so, why? And how much is coming from third-party unit increase?","Tom Szkutak","We don't actually focus on total company gross margins because of the mix of the business. We focus more on operating profit and obviously ultimately free cash flow dollars. But in terms of things that would be impacting COGS as a percentage of revenue and that change, to be helpful, you mentioned AWS is certainly having an impact there. Our third-party business continues to have an impact there. We have offsets as we lower prices to customers, having an impact there. Just mix of various products and geographies has an impact on those results. Again, a large number of items that are impacting that.","Operator","And Justin Post with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch has our next question.","Justin Post - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Tom, there might be a little bit of a disconnect. When we see prior investment cycles such as distribution builds out or devices with, say, the Kindle reader, we did see an impact on units and accelerating growth in some of the categories. This time around, even investing for a couple of years and I guess we're not really seeing the acceleration. So maybe you could talk about what gives you confidence in investing in devices like the Fire TV and the phone and all the content you're doing? And are you seeing some underlying signs, let's say, activities picking up? Maybe you could walk through that.","Tom Szkutak","Just a couple of things to call out. One is when we look at our unit growth, you hear the 23% unit growth, keep in mind that there're parts of our business that are not included in that unit growth. So when we talk about investing in Web Services and the usage growing close to 90%, that number is not included in the 23%. So that's obviously a large investment area for us that we're excited about that is not included in that.","The other is think about the base of business that we have versus where we were just a few years ago. And so you've seen very strong growth on the base that we have. And we're excited to see that. When we look at the opportunities that we're investing in, in terms of video, you mentioned, we're seeing that certainly in the number of Prime members that are subscribing. And so that has some short-term impact, the great long-term impact as we retain those Prime members and as they start to do more cross-shopping over time. We have a lot of investment in front of that demand, if you will. So those are some of the things that I would call out to be try to be helpful.","Operator","We'll move now to Youssef Squali with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Youssef Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald","Going back to $100 million spend on the original content, you mentioned earlier as that part of the business grows, is there any reason to believe that the amount of spend on the originals will go down? The assumption here is it'll only go up. So is that $100 million a good level to work off of? And then going back to the Fire Phone, just trying to understand the strategy around the product longer term. Is it again just to try to further build the Amazon ecosystem with all the benefits or do you think this could be a cell phone of the business?","Tom Szkutak","In terms of the original content, we're not giving guidance on the numbers going forward and beyond Q3. We're very excited about what we see and the pilots we had and the series we had. And so we're very happy to green-light the series that we've talked about and released over the past few months. We're also happy you'll be seeing many new pilots. And so that's reflected in the over $100 million that I mentioned earlier. So we're extremely excited on behalf of customers to be able to do that, and we think that's a great thing to do. But in terms of what we do in terms of spend beyond Q3, can't comment on today.","In terms of the Fire Phone, we're very excited about it. You mentioned two different areas. One is can it exist on its own and whether it's part of our family, if you will, to help drive other usage. And the answer is we certainly think it can be both. So we think it could be a great product on its own. We're very excited to offer it to customers. It's very integrated into our various digital services including video and games and our app store and ebooks and certainly Prime music. So those are all very interesting things on behalf of customers. It's also a great way to do physical shopping as well. So again, it's certainly integrated into our business as well.","Operator","And Brian Nowak with SIG has our next question.","Brian Nowak - SIG","The first one is around CPG, consumer packaged goods, I was wondering, Tom, can you talk to us some learnings in CPG so far, what's working and what you think is still holding back faster CPG adoption? Do you think you need a same-day delivering offering at this point for CPG kind of given Google and even the traditional retailers push into that category? And then the second one, the close to 90% AWS usage growth, just help us understand a bit more, what did that number look like in 2013?","Tom Szkutak","Yeah, in terms of the usage growth, the business is growing very, very fast beyond the data point. There's not a lot I can help you with. In terms of CPG, and this really relates to many of our categories, we're working on behalf of customers to provide fast delivery. It's something that we've improved on over the years and we're going to continue to work on. There's a number of different things we're working on. One of the things that I mentioned early in the call is certainly sortation centers. That's an attempt on our side. We have in a small way and tested it and we've seen that it's a way to get product to customers even faster. So we're excited about that. It also helps deliver on Sunday, which we think is great too. So again, those are the things that we're working on as well as others to help customers get product faster. And we think that benefits CPG products as well other products.","Operator","We'll move next to Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.","Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets","I wanted to follow up on that William Blair question about gross margins only because I know you don't focus on and there're a lot of mix factors that you correctly pointed out. But that's a record high gross margin for you, 30.7%, ever. And it's in the context of a quarter in which AWS clearly came in because of the price cuts. And so there's something else that happened there that really caused that gross margin to gap up. Could you give us any color? I understand there're a lot of puts and takes in there. But something must have happened that was unusual to have that kind of result with a slowing down AWS contribution.","Tom Szkutak","We don't focus a lot on gross margin of the business. Obviously unusual product lines, we would look at gross margin. But across the business, we don't for the very reason you mentioned. There's a large mix impact. You have our Web Services business. You have our third-party business. You have the retail business. You have categories within retail. There's a whole host of things that would impact that. And so that's why we don't focus on a total company basis. Certainly on individual SKUs or ASINs, as we call them, we certainly would look at it. Individual sub-categories, we would certainly look at it internally. But from a total company perspective, given the mix effects, we think it's much more appropriate to look at operating profit and free cash flow.","Operator","And from ISI Group, we'll go to Greg Melich.","Greg Melich - ISI Group","Looked like revenue per active customer accelerated again this quarter, up over 5%. It was running closer to 2% to 3% last year. Could you help us understand what's driving that, whether it's Prime particularly, or any color on that? And when you gave the Prime numbers second quarter more sign-ups whether that was a grosser in that number?","Tom Szkutak","The Prime, it was a net number. So that's the net additions to total members. So again, we added net more Prime members in Q2 of this year versus Q2 last year, even with the price change. In terms of revenue per active customer, there's not a lot I can say there. A few things to think about, one is certainly Prime customers buy more than non-Prime customers. And we're seeing great growth on Prime. That's certainly having an impact on that number. And certainly there'll be other factors too. Our Web Services business would be included in the numerator that you're talking about as well. And so those are factors you should be thinking about. But again, the biggest factor would certainly be in terms of looking at our retail business, Prime is becoming much more meaningful. And that's also why we think about how do we make Prime better on behalf of those customers. We just like the long-term benefits that we see for those customers.","Operator","And our final question today will be from Colin Sebastian with Robert Baird & Company.","Colin Sebastian - Robert Baird & Company","One of your executives in the UK recently mentioned the company's goal of reaching 1 billion different products available for sale on the site. I wonder if there is an expansion in selection beyond what we've seen recently that could help accelerate growth. And related to that, are you still relatively agnostic in terms of the split between first and third-party unit sales?","Tom Szkutak","In terms of selection, I would say nothing is new here. We're going to continue to add unique selection. That's something that we've been working extremely hard day-in and day-out over many years. We have a great team of people working on that and trying to make sure we get a vast selection. So that's something that we're pleased about. In terms of the margins, they do approximate each other. Obviously there's some differences. Some of the third-party will be used products. And you shouldn't assume that a used product necessarily has the same contribution profit per unit as a new unit, things like that. But they're close approximates of those.","Phil Hardin","Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter.

You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.","Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we\u2019ve seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.","Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don\u2019t conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements. It\u2019s not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.","With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. [Operator Instructions]","Our first question is coming from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Brian Nowak","I have two. It looks like the overall retail business accelerated pretty nicely in the quarter. Maybe could you just talk about whether 24-hour shipping is in that? So which specific categories of consumption are you seeing really drive that acceleration? And then sort of the opposite question on AWS, which has slowed a little bit can you just talk about some of the puts and takes in the AWS revenue growth this quarter versus the prior Q? Thanks.","Brian Olsavsky","Sure, Brian. Thanks for your questions. Let me start with AWS. We feel this really strong quarter. We had a growth year-over-year in our run rate from $24 billion to $33 billion, so 37% growth. The $9 billion that we increased our run rate by was second only to Q4 of last year as far as our history. So as you can tell, we've been pretty transparent with our AWS revenue and income numbers we've been breaking it out for 2015 and we're very happy with the growth in absolute dollar terms and we're seeing a pick up from customers and their usage, their increased pace of enterprise migrations, increased adoption of our services especially our machine learning services. And continually again AWS is being chosen as a partner to many companies because of our leadership position both in technology, our vibrant partner ecosystem, and also the stronger security that we offer.","On your question about one-day, let me update you on that, because obviously that was a big topic of conversation last quarter and you can see that it's starting to show up in our results in Q2. So we are really pleased with the customer response to our growing one-day offering.","In Q2, we had a meaningful step up in the one-day shipments, primarily in North America. And volume -- one-day volume was accelerating throughout the quarter. The ops team did a fantastic job here, not only in being able to expand one-day selection and delivery capacity, but also preparing for and handling some very high volumes on Prime Day earlier in the month.","So we're in the middle of the journey here. We expect to see continued ramp of the one-day selection availability for the next few quarters both in North America and international. International was up slightly in Q2, but for the most part, the improvement in delivery speeds will be in future quarters there. On the cost side, we talked last time about $800 million estimate of transportation cost to supply one day, the additional one day in Q2. We were a little bit higher than that number in total cost.","We saw some additional transition costs in our warehouses. We saw some lower productivity as we were expanding rather quickly, both local capacity in the off-season also in our delivery networks.","We also saw some costs were moving -- buying more inventory and moving inventory around in our network to have it be closer to customers. And we built that not only that cost structure, but an accelerating cost penalty into our Q3 guidance that was released with our earnings today.","And as I said in other setting, we've seen this before. We have had large changes to our distribution and transportation network repeatedly in our history from going from media to a vast variety of different product lines hardlines non-sortable as we call them. The initial two-day Prime shipping offer that we launched many years ago, the great expansion of our network to include FBA merchants and capacity for them and more recently, the first steps to increase one-day and same day although on a much smaller scale.","So, it does create a shock to the system. We're working through that now. We expect we'll be working through that for a number of quarters, but when the dust settles, we will regain our cost efficiency over time. As far as you asked about specific product lines, nothing really to share there. We have seen lower ASP generally in Q2, higher unit growth versus revenue growth in North America and we could be that we're mixing into some lower ASP items as we launch one-day, but we haven't drawn that total conclusion yet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Heath Terry","Great. Thanks. Just wondering back on the AWS side of things, can you give us a sense of sort of what you're seeing from a volume perspective? Obviously, price is always a big component of growth in this, but just trying to understand whether or not you're seeing similar trends in terms of growth rate deceleration on the volume side of things.","And then to the extent that we're sort of thinking about the mix of either revenue or usage within that business. Are there any products or sort of product areas AI obviously being one that's been a major initiative for you that you're seeing particular either outside growth or under growth relative to the overall business that you would call out?","Brian Olsavsky","Yes, sure. On that second point, I'd say we're seeing a lot of increased adoption and machine learning services especially Amazon Sage Maker. We've had tens of thousands of customers who are now using AWS machine learning services and we'll continue to innovate on behalf of those customers.","We released more than 200 machine learning features and capabilities in 2018 alone in this area. Database is also a multibillion-dollar business propelled by Aurora. So we're seeing a lot of strength. We're seeing strong usage growth that outpaces revenue growth as usual increased pace of enterprise migrations.","So, I would say that on a percentage growth basis again on a dollar basis, it's going very strongly. On a percentage growth basis, we are lapping some very strong growth in the first half of last year. We were growing about 50% in the first half of last year. There's some particular unique customer volumes that were flowing through that some customers have really high usage tied to their businesses. But for the most part, we continue to grow usage and our expansion of our services with all of our customers. So very happy.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","Justin Post","Great. Couple of questions. I guess, the first question is just happens with the customer behavior when they do have one-day availability? I'm assuming units go up, but can you give us any details on what happens or a category that switches to one-day what happens?","And the second question, we've heard from some smaller checks that some of the smaller merchants are moving to 3P, not getting orders on the one piece side as much. Is there any change in your business there to really kind of focus more towards third-party from first-party? Thanks a lot.","Brian Olsavsky","Sure. No, we don't have category specifics to really share with you today on the move to one-day. I did say that generally in Q2 the unit volume was greater than revenue volume. So we did see some lower ASPs. But I think what you're saying is just a lot more products enter the consideration set for our customers.","So things that maybe they can't wait two days on, they can wait one day, and it lights up a whole separate usefulness for the Amazon site. I've noticed that personally myself that just -- with one-day shipments, it's here before you know it. So what categories that hits specifically, we'll have to see over time.","On your comment, I assume you meant vendors not merchants, but on the move from 1P to 3P, but no there shouldn't be -- I can't highlight anything related shifting in channel there, but I would say that we remain in different on whether -- we're focused on price convenience and selection for our customers. And whether product is a retail offering or third-party offering is not that important to us. As long as it's in stock, as long as it's priced competitively.","So, as you know our 3P selection has -- our 3P percent of units has been increasing over time and increased again in this quarter to 54% of units. We continue to invest very heavily in our systems both for retail vendors and also for third-party merchants invest billions of dollars a year on behalf of then making Amazon a better place for customers to buy and increasingly not only vendor sales, but also third-party merchant sales.","In particular on Prime Day, I think you'll see that we had -- over in the press release, we had more than $2 billion of products were bought from small and medium-sized businesses. So when we win, we win together with our vendor partners and also our seller partners.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Please proceed.","Jason Helfstein","Thanks. So in the release you made a comment about automotive and Alexa, anything you want to elaborate a little more that looks like that's a very interesting opportunity? And then with respect to India, there were two comments in the release, but anything you can comment on kind of getting past some of the issues that had impacted the business in the past? I know you're past that now. Thank you.","Brian Olsavsky","Yes. Let me start with India. So yes, continue to see growth in programs for both sellers -- for our sellers and delivery partners. In the last 18 months, we've doubled the number of paid Prime member, which we're very excited about. We've invested a lot in our global selling program, which helps Indian sellers not only reach customers in India, but also in other geographies around the world.","We started Amazon Flex in India, which helps our local partners to deliver packages, gives them jobs, grows our delivery capacity for sellers and increases our speed of delivery. So it's a win-win.","We've also introduced package-free shipment program in nine cities. This is going to be a big part of our shipment zero program, a vision to make all Amazon shipment net carbon zero.","On the government side, our engagement with the Indian government makes us optimistic about partnering and collaborating to seek a stable predicable policy that allow us to continue investing in our technology and infrastructure. And it also helps us to create jobs and scale local businesses.","So, we think there's a lot of shared purpose there and a good quarter where we're looking forward to the Diwali holiday this year. The events we have for Diwali were all in Q4 last year some of them are in Q3 this year based on the timing of the holiday. So, that's factored into our international \u2013 excuse me, our, revenue growth rate for the quarter.","Dave Fildes","Yes, Jason. This is Dave. Just quickly on the Alexa point and auto, Alexa is really a more and more place. I think the point you're probably referencing is, we're now seeing hundreds of third-party devices with Alexa built in. So that runs the gamut from smart thermostat and another smart home devices, headphones, but also vehicle.","So we've seen a lot of good partnerships and arrangements with companies like BMW and Mini and not just in the U.S., but in places like Europe as well. So a lot of this of course is just around the great power of Alexa and being able to offer even greater convenience and touch points where customers can interact with that and we're seeing a lot of good momentum with usage and how customers are interacting with Alexa.","But also when you look at the broader environment of third-party devices, devices that we're rolling out in all of those things it's -- we're seeing a lot of good momentum there. And I think it's underpinned by the fact that Alexa is always getting smarter and so customers are enjoying the benefit of that enhanced experience.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Youssef Squali with SunTrust. Please proceed.","Youssef Squali","Great. Thank you very much. Two quick questions for me please. Can you quantify the cost of one-day shipping to Q3 guidance kind of similarly to what you did into 4Q too with that $800 million? And if they plateau how should be thinking about it, as we map it out over the next several quarters?","And then you guys made a very intriguing acquisition, the Sizmek acquisition sometime back. I'm just wondering, how does it fit in the overall strategy? And is the idea to try to build may be a double click like-minded model, sorry using that platform? Thank you.","Brian Olsavsky","Hi, Youssef. Let me start your question on one-day. I'm not breaking out the specific cost this quarter as I did last year -- last quarter. Some of this is because it's very hard to pinpoint exactly the lines between one-day and other cost issues. So we're always working within a range. We're confidently we were near but just above our $800 million estimate in Q2.","And as I said, this is going to take multiple quarters to play out. We had a meaningful step up in North America in Q2 and it was accelerating through the quarter. We'll see more cost in Q3. We'll see about Q4 when we talk and everything we know about or anticipate about Q3 is built into our guidance.","So I wouldn't break out the dollar term. I will tell you at the end of the quarter kind of what we're seeing on cost and how it looks for Q4 as well. And the other thing I would point out on the trajectory is that, we're just getting started in international and most of that work is ahead of us although the speed that tick up a bit in Q1 -- excuse me Q2 but -- and will do even more so in Q3 in future quarters.","Dave Fildes","Yes. And then just on Sizmek quickly. We are excited to have acquired the Sizmek ad server and then Sizmek's dynamic creative optimization or DCO. Customers are going to be able to continue to use those proven products and services. We're invested in the long-term success of Sizmek. And again, Amazon advertising and Sizmek has many mutual customers, so we know how valued these prudent solutions are to the customer base.","So we're looking forward to work with that team and we'll share more updates as we invent and create new opportunities to serve advertisers in the future.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed. Sir, your line is live.","Mark Mahaney","Sorry about that. Hey Brian could you talk a little bit about the elasticity you're seeing -- you expect to see in international markets with the rollout of one-day? And I just -- the commentary in the press release about this acceleration from one-day, sounds great. It's a little surprising that you would see the reaction that quickly. But maybe this really is -- well you're obviously seeing it. You're confident you'll also see it as you roll out into international markets, if you could just comment on that? Thank you.","Brian Olsavsky","Sure. The -- of course the proportion of one-day shipments is higher in international to begin with in a lot of our countries. So we will -- we expect it to be very valuable to customers as we add selection into that one-day category. But we think the biggest elasticity is probably in North America where the standard has been 2-day shipping for Prime.","So yes, I would say, you're faced with the -- you see it every time you go to our site. It's automatically built in. You're surprised by the speed. It's not like you have to search one-day shipping specifically to find out what's available. It's growing and it's pervasive.","So I think what that does is, again it strengthens your purchase decision, it strengthens the need to not have to go elsewhere to buy a product because you need it quickly. So I think it's becomes a part of your routine. At least that's what we're seeing in North America. And we hope again as we build this capacity to more and more regions and more and more ZIP codes and adding more and more selection that everyone will see the same thing that we see already in major cities.","I do want to add one point though because when we talk about operating income in both in Q2 and Q3 and we talk about the cost and penalty of one-day, I would like to highlight there's some other investment areas that are certainly going on here. If you look at Q2, our marketing expense was up 48% year-over-year and that's a combination of a few things.","First, we're continuing to add our AWS sales and marketing teams. We see great opportunity there to help customers engage with our services and migrate to our products. So we continue to build out our sales force and our marketing programs. We're also adding more and more advertising as we roll out devices and Prime Video -- new Prime Video content in particular internationally.","So we're seeing higher marketing costs. We're also seeing a higher stock-based compensation expense. That was up 36% year-over-year. And you'll see that our headcount grew 13% year-over-year.","So when you look at some of our most quickly growing areas things like Alexa and AWS and also teams working on machine learning and other high-end technical projects, our technical headcount actually grew twice that rate or nearly twice that rate based on total headcount. So there's a lot of moving parts within our headcount number, but there's a very strong investment going on in AWS devices and videos in particular.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed.","Ross Sandler","Hey guys, just two questions. The North America retail acceleration was 3.5 points and you mentioned international is about one. So can we attribute the difference to one-day? Or was there other organic acceleration in North America happening aside from the move to one-day?","And then Brian related to that investing question, AWS operating margin came down a bit. I know they had a tough comp. But anything you would call out aside from the headcount stuff that you just mentioned that may have been lumpy in the quarter on AWS? Thanks.","Brian Olsavsky","Sure. Let me start with that second question. So yes -- sorry, the operating margin in AWS, just like the revenue rate it's such a rapidly growing business with different timing of investments and global expansion in investment in marketing and other infrastructure that is going to vary quarter-to-quarter.","We had a -- we've come off a period where if you remember last year we had less investment needed in infrastructure both for AWS and for Amazon in total. The -- I don't have the number directly in front of me, but anyway we grew finance leases, which is essentially our props for capital leases for infrastructure by 9% in Q1 and it was 10% all of last year coming off a year in 2017 where we had growth of 69%. So we had that dynamic.","Our trailing 12-month growth in that number is 21% after Q2. So it's stepped up from 9% to 21%. So we are starting to see as I mentioned in earlier calls that the investment will be stepping up in 2019, so started to see that in Q2. But the biggest, I would say the biggest impact in this operating profit was the addition of sales and marketing personnel in AWS and also to a lesser extent the stock-based compensation, which certainly hits across all of our businesses.","Your comment on revenue growth differential, I mean there's so many different factors going on in every country that's hard to compare North America to international. But I would say that we are attributing a good bit of the revenue growth acceleration from 17% in Q1 to 20% in Q2 to the rollout of one-day and the impact of that.","If there's other things, obviously, we continue to add selection and we have again lots of engagement points of customers through Prime Benefits and video and devices that certainly contribute to our revenue run rate in our retention of Prime members. But if we're going to point to one thing in Q1 that's different -- Q2 excuse me, that's different it was obviously the start of the -- and the step up in one-day shipments.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark May with Citi. Pleased proceed.","Mark May","Thanks for taking my question. I appreciate it. First I guess sort of an organizational question, but some of the feedback I've heard from the ecosystem is that it appears that the combination of the way Amazon's organized internally and just rapid growth in the ad business 1P, 3P that at times there are signs that kind of these teams internally are not always aligned and maybe that creates some issues.","And just wonder first do you generally agree with this? And if so, what is the company doing to kind of better optimize these increasingly related functions that maybe in the past haven't always been organized internally that way?","And then secondly in terms of subscription revenue where are we in terms of the benefit from the price increase announcement announced last year and rolled through to existing members throughout the last year and will this have any meaningful impacts in that lines growth say in Q3 of the back half of the year? Thanks.","Brian Olsavsky","Sure. So, I assume your first question is about the coordination of advertiser with teams that are interacting with vendors and sellers, perhaps is that what you meant?","Mark May","Exactly. Yes.","Brian Olsavsky","Okay. Yes, so, first, I'd say we're customer-focused first and primarily, but we need to have good coordination across our teams and we grow fast and we add new things. So, there's always learnings that we have that's why we say it's still day one here. But we're trying to minimize the negative impact on any vendor or seller out there.","So, I can't comment on any certain -- on exactly what issues you might be talking about. We have teams dedicated to the seller experience and the vendor experience and we think they do a good job of selling the whole suite of products including advertising -- with the advertising teams at Amazon.","But as you say they're separately run and they can meet at different points and sometimes at certain vendors perhaps that may get out of hand are get out of sync. But hopefully that is a temporary condition.","On subscription revenue, yes, we -- you remember we raised the price of Prime in the U.S. last June from $99 to $119. So, the largest impact -- favorable impact from that at least from a subscription revenue standpoint would have happened in the subsequent four quarters, less in Q2, more in Q3 through Q2 of this year.","So, yes, that will be a factor that we're comping for the next 12 months. Its offset by the growth in the Prime program itself and the expansion of Prime Benefits or the Prime program globally. You may see that -- may have seen we have launched Prime in United Arab Emirates this quarter. So, it's not something -- it's something we've certainly seen in the past with timing of price increases, but it's built into the Q3 guidance that I've given.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.","Colin Sebastian","Great. Thanks. I guess first up curious just a follow-up on the ASP comments if those were \u2013 if that shift within the same categories or just lower ASPs imply diversification into new categories. But my main question is just looking ahead of the holiday period given some of the moving parts and 3PL and shipping ecosystem and then of course with the transition to one-day, are you confident that there is enough capacity from your own first-party logistics as well as third-party partners to meet that seasonal demand and should we now expect a faster ramp in Amazon Air as the means to move cargo between fulfillment centers? Thanks.","Brian Olsavsky","Yes. So, I would say the first time we started discussing the rollout of one-day our first thoughts went to Q4 this year and our capability for holiday and as much as Q2 and Q3. So we are confident that we will have the ability to handle seasonal demand. We are working very hard to expand our one-day capacity, add carriers, add delivery partners at our own AMZL capability and have our partners expand their capabilities as well.","So we're feeling good about Q4. It's a little early to discuss that now, but we certainly had a really good test on Prime Day. It was the two biggest days we've ever had. A lot of good work went into Prime Day, a lot of benefit for customers, a lot of benefit for our selling partners, the small business merchants as well. So it was a good test for us.","And, sorry, your question on low ASP, I think we're still figuring that out a bit. I mean they -- what I'm reacting to is the high unit growth relative to good growth in revenue, but unit growth grew faster. I'm always a little vary to put too much into the unit growth number.","As I've talked in other quarters, it's a number that's excludes AWS subscription services, advertising and Whole Foods, which are some of the fastest growing areas and we also have \u2013 are actively selling subscription services like Kindle Unlimited and Amazon Music Unlimited, which can cannibalize unit sales. So there's a lot of moving parts, usually our headwinds to our unit growth number, but again happy with the 800 basis point quarter-over-quarter jump in that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed.","Brent Thill","Thanks. Brian just on the op income guide for the next quarter, it's significantly below where many of us are at. I'm curious if you could just talk to any changes around expenses and the success of one day just doubling down or can you just walk through what's transpires in the next quarter? Thank you.","Brian Olsavsky","Yes, sure. So again the biggest individual item is the one-day shipping. As I said earlier, we had a meaningful step up in shipments in Q2 versus Q1, but we're still on our way and Q3 will be a step up over Q2 in North America and we'll see more in international. So it's -- that increase in one-day shipping and all the associated cost of additional transportation and getting capacity in place. As I mentioned earlier new costs and things like expanding inventory, getting it closer to the customer.","Just a lot of things moving -- a lot of moving parts in the fulfillment center world right now and our transport networks. So that is the biggest individual contributor but as I mentioned in Q2's results, some of the investments in marketing, the step up in infrastructure spending that should continue.","We certainly have a lot of areas where we continue to invest not the least of which is our AWS business, devices, video, the global expansion of a lot of our Prime Benefits and things like stores and grocery delivery through Whole Foods, Prime Now and AmazonFresh.","So I would say, yes, we had -- as we've mentioned the last couple of calls, we had some lessening of expenses in some key areas last year, mostly tied to headcount growth, infrastructure and fulfillment capacity.","We expected a step up in 2019. We didn't see as much of it in Q1, mainly because of the timing of the seasonality of the year and getting things going. We\u2019re seeing more of it in Q2 and we'll see it through the remainder of the year.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question will come from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed.","Eric Sheridan","Thanks so much. Maybe a few small questions on the advertising side of the business if I can. How much of the advertising business would you be willing to say is driven by domestic sellers and domestic brands versus the international side?","Two, how do you think about the video ad revenue opportunity? We continue to hear from a lot of people in the advertising industry that you might be a bigger player in video advertising later this year or more into next year, how do you think about making investments against that possibility or even just possibility of being a driver in your platform overall? Thanks so much for the color guys.","Dave Fildes","Yes, Eric this is Dave. I think started with the video advertising that one focus areas for us is expanding our video and over the top offerings for brands. We've taken some steps with live sports and then IMDb TV, but we'll continue to do things like add more OTT video supply, just things like Amazon Publisher service integrations and simplifying access for third-party apps and add more inventory through things like Fire TV apps and IMDb TV. So some interesting areas that we're continue to put a lot of focus into.","Now the first part of your question, in terms of geographical mix, I mean, fair to assume that like a lot of our business, advertising in the North America segment is the bigger piece of that, but I think we're really excited about the international opportunity.","A lot of the tools that we've rolled out introduced in places like the United States aren't available in many of the international regions. And so, it's a matter of continuing to work with advertisers and brands and kind of buildup, not only awareness but just how those -- add things like sponsored products interact with customers and how they receive -- building up the things we talk about many times here around improving relevancy on each of those geographic websites is an important thing that we're measuring. So, expected to continue see us look for new ways to be able to roll that out.","Dave Fildes","Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website, at least through the end of the quarter.

Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we\u2019ve seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It\u2019s not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.","As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance.","Our guidance further assumes that we don\u2019t conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently.","For Q2 2014, we expect net sales of between $18.1 billion and $19.8 billion or growth of between 15% and 26%. This guidance anticipates approximately 160 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income or loss to be between $455 million loss and $55 million loss, compared to $79 million in income in the second quarter of 2013. This includes approximately $455 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.","We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between zero and $400 million, compared to $409 million in the second quarter of 2013.","We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience.

Let\u2019s move onto the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Absolutely, Mr. Fildes. (Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll hear first from Mark Miller with William Blair.","Mark R. Miller \u2013 William Blair & Co. LLC","","Hi Tom. I was hoping you could maybe just layout first, what do you think the main reasons are for the acceleration and growth here in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter. And then a specific question on Prime Pantry, it is one of motivations to get the customer on that program it might make get easier to convert them to Amazon Fresh. And if so, would you want to run this operation as a breakeven like you do with Kindle, to enable a bigger business, thanks.","Thomas J. Szkutak","","In terms of growth, we saw very solid growth, very good growth in Q1, up 23% on a local currency basis. North-America we saw a similar growth rates in Q1 as we saw in Q4 of last year as well as Q1 of last year all at 26%. And then international we saw the growth accelerate a little bit on a exchange adjusted basis from 15% to 18% from Q4 to Q1. But we really seen is we are pleased with the overall fundamentals we continue to add new customers and stocks continues to be healthy, third party unit is a percentage of units are above 40% still very strong FBA adoption, that continues to be strong around the world, continued to add new selection.","We saw strong growth in many different areas including Web Services, and so again a lot of different areas contributed to growth rate that we saw in Q1. In terms of Prime Pantry, we just think it\u2019s an exciting option for prime numbers that\u2019s available only to prime numbers, and so they can get their everyday non-bulk items in one box, and we think that\u2019s \u2013 its\u2019 interesting for customers and again it\u2019s great way that we can add the selection and have the selections for those customers.","Operator","Moving on to Aram Robinson with Wolfe Research.","Aram H. Rubinson \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, thanks for taking the question. On the famous drone interview that Jeff had with Charlie Rose, he said something that caught my attention, which was that every elasticity study that you do says that Amazon should be raising prices. I have two questions around that. The first is does that equation also work in reverse? Meaning that if higher questions don\u2019t dampen demand, does it also mean that lower prices don\u2019t stimulate demand like they used to?","Thomas J. Szkutak","In terms of pricing, we\u2019ve been very consistent. We want to offer great value to customers, and so I would work very hard to make sure that we can offer and afford to offer great prices for customers. And so, that\u2019s something that we\u2019ve been working on in the very hard over the years and that\u2019s certainly one of the reason why you\u2019ve seen the growth rates that we\u2019ve experienced a long with getting close to customers, from the shipping perspective make sure we have great in stocks and other service attributes.","In terms of price increases, we certainly have increased the price on Prime, but again that was after many years of not raising the price even though the cost of transportation costs certainly had gone up and the fact that we have certainly added a lot of selection going from little over 1 million items in the first year to over 20 million items. So it\u2019s still an incredibly great value for customers and that\u2019s why we did that.","So again, we\u2019re all about making sure we have great values for customers and we\u2019ll continue to that.","Aram H. Rubinson \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC","Okay thanks for that.","Operator","Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein has the next question.","Carlos Kirjner \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, thank you. I have two quick questions about AWS. First, I think everyone would agree that AWS is a vast opportunity. So given how large the opportunity is, why is it that you are not hiring more people, launching more products, and growing faster? What are the limiting factors for growth of AWS?","Second, you have a long history of cutting prices for a few specific AWS products, but you did something somewhat unusual in late March when you cut prices across EC2 and S3 products in one shot. Why did you only cut your prices after Google cut theirs? Thank you.","Thomas J. Szkutak",""," In terms of AWS, the team is doing a fantastic job. We are adding a lot of resources that we\u2019ve grown our employee-based there dramatically over the years and continue to add people there. And that\u2019s the way we\u2019ve been able to launch all the new services that we had over the past several years. And we continued the pace of acceleration in terms of new things that we\u2019re doing is increasing and we\u2019ve published a lot of statistics around that.","In terms of pricing, we think this is our 42nd pricing increase that we had in AWS. Sorry price decrease in AWS and we\u2019re very excited behalf of customers to be able to do that. The team works very hard to able to afford those lower prices and we\u2019re excited to do that. And so in terms of the timing of when we launched these price decreases, they come at different times and that happened to come in the presentation that we\u2019re giving around that time. So but again we\u2019re excited about the opportunity and we\u2019re continuing invest in that business, given the big opportunity that we have there.","Operator","Our next question will come from Ben Schachter with Macquarie.","Ben Schachter \u2013 Macquarie Capital, Inc.","","Can you walk us through the process on how you think about and how you model, how much you\u2019re willing to pay for exclusive content such as video or video game content. And another question, it looks fair for us to assume that the business model of the Kindle Fire TV is similar to what Bezos has said regarding selling other hardware roughly break even and then making money on the F consumer unit. Thanks.","Thomas J. Szkutak","","In terms of video content, the team does a very nice job of various modeling, certainly we are trying to estimate what the usages of those of all the content that we\u2019ve launched. And we have a number of different ways if you do that. We do have certainly for some of the content that we have been selling both in terms of physical format as well as selling on the transactional side. We certainly see what the \u2013 what those sales are, what those unit sales are. So we have that as a benchmark, we also have other models to look at that to help us guide to we think the usage that will be those.","But again the team has done a nice job and I am looking at different ways to model that. And I expect it will continue to refine that overtime as well.","Ben Schachter \u2013 Macquarie Capital, Inc.","And the Kindle Fire TV.","Thomas J. Szkutak","Yes, in terms of Fire TV, I can\u2019t talk about the economics of the device itself. But what I can say is it\u2019s very early and we are extremely pleased with what see and just the few weeks here and the team certainly made we think it\u2019s a killer product and where the team is very hard trying to keep buying stock in their product.","Operator","And City\u2019s Mark May have the next question.","Mark A. May \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Thank you. why don\u2019t you if noticed any change and sign ups or conversions in the few weeks here since you\u2019ve rolled out the prime price increase for new customers and if you could maybe comment on the what may have contributed to the deceleration and year\u2013on-year our growth and media sales in North America. Thanks.","Thomas J. Szkutak","In terms of prime, it\u2019s early but we are encouraged with what we see so far. Just over the last several weeks, our prime subscribers continue to grow week-over-week. New trials, the adoption of new trials again post the increase are growing very nicely. So those customers accepting new trials is growing very fast. We only have a few days of information related to conversion. And we are encouraged by what we see there.","So overall we are very encouraged and the reason why is the customers we believe are responding to just a great service. And so we are continuously being reminded that for customers in terms of the offering we have in the physical side as well as the offerings that we have in the digital side as well. So we are very encouraged there.","In terms of the North American media, we did see from a growth standpoint, it\u2019s 13%year-over-year for North American media that compares to 14% in Q1 of last year. It is down a little bit sequentially from Q4 \u2013 Q4 keep in mind we do have video games and video consoles in that number in Q4. And there is certainly number of different factors, but that certainly one that is impacting the Q4 numbers. And it\u2019s certainly seasonal as you would expect that there is some great launches of consoles in Q4 that are impacting that number.","Operator","","We\u2019ll now turn to Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.","Douglas T. Anmuth \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","","Great. Thanks for taking the question. Tom, I was just hoping you could give us your view on units growth and how you think about that going forward. How important of a metrics it is because we\u2019re seeing somewhat of a decoupling here as revenue and gross profit reaccelerated, but units obviously (indiscernible) as media came down. Can you talk a little bit about that? Thank you.","","Thomas J. Szkutak","Sure as you mentioned unit growth was actually decelerated a little bit from Q4 and also from last year with 23% year-over-year in Q1. One thing to keep in mind is that our web services business is growing at a faster rate. We don\u2019t incorporate any units from AWS in that metric. But overall, you\u2019re right we continue to \u2013 from a growth standpoint we had a small acceleration of growth from Q4 to Q1 from a revenue standpoint, again on local currency basis going from 22% to 23%, we are very pleased with the fundamentals that I talked about earlier that\u2019s impacting that growth rate. So again overall we are pleased and again we think that we see a nice growth rate, and third-party units as a percentage of total units is 40%, which was consistent with what we saw last year so, third-party growth continues to be very strong as well.","Operator","","Brian Nowak, SIG has the next question.","Brian T. Nowak - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thanks. I have two. The first one, just Tom to go back to the unit question, even if we exclude North America and international other from gross profit. Gross profit growth held in there pretty steady at 28%. Just kind of curious, is there anything that we should think about of why gross profit growth and unit growth is decoupling? And is unit growth a really good way to measure the health of the business? And then the second one is on international media. One of the factors you guys have flagged in the past holding down international media is more limited local language content. Can you just help us better quantify the difference in English language digital content compared to foreign language? And what steps are you taking to improve that?","Thomas J. Szkutak","","In terms of the \u2013 I\u2019ll take the second part of the question first about International media, the growth rate was 4% in the quarter and as I\u2019ve talked about in prior quarters, certainly one of the things that\u2019s happening is we see a conversion from physical to digital. And for example in North-America we are now selling North-America media. We are now selling more digital units than physical units. So over the past twelve months we sold more digital units than physical units.","We are not at that point yet in International and so certainly that\u2019s an opportunity for us as we look at growing International media. So again, it\u2019s certainly something that we are working very hard on and certainly a good opportunity for us. In terms of unit growth, it\u2019s certainly just one measure that we want to \u2013 that we\u2019ve thought has been helpful. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ve continued to provide it. It is just one metric, we have many different metrics that we are sharing. But that much more I can add to that but again it\u2019s a metric, was there a third part of the question.","Brian T. Nowak - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","","No I guess, just are there any other puts and takes we should think about in units as we go throughout the year where there are tough compares or easy compares in units from a digital unit perspective or anything?","Thomas J. Szkutak","","It\u2019s not that I can think of at the minute. But just keep in mind when you think about our revenue growth always be thinking about there\u2019s certainly a volume component. We have a third-party component, we have a mix component. We\u2019re continuously trading the lower prices for customers. All those factor into the revenue growth rates that you see into the revenue metrics that we provide to you.","Brian T. Nowak - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ll now hear from Brian Pitz with Jefferies.","Brian J. Pitz \u2013 Jefferies LLC","","Great, thanks. Regarding fulfillment, does it make sense for you to bring some of the components in-house? We\u2019ve been hearing talk of your own fulfillment network. Can you make any comments on this? And just to follow-up on your digital units point, can you comment on any impact of recent shifts in music and video consumption to subscription based models, from download to own on your media business? Is that having any impact? Thanks.","Thomas J. Szkutak","","In terms of fulfillment, there\u2019s not a lot I can comment on in terms of your specific question. What I would say though is we continue to work to be, as we have over the years, to become closer and closer to customers. And so, we\u2019ve certainly done that in a number of different ways. Just the footprint we have from a fulfillment capacity standpoint enables us to be closer to customers and getting great selection even closer to customers. So we continue to work. Certainly Prime was another way to get a faster delivery speed to customers and so we\u2019ll continue to work on our capabilities there to make it even better over time.","In terms of the digital units question, I apologize. There\u2019s not a lot I can comment in terms of your specific question there.","Brian J. Pitz \u2013 Jefferies LLC","All right. Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll move on to Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.","Justin Post \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Tom, we look back at your model and we go back to 2008 and 2009. In the middle of a pretty bad global recession, you were able to put up 7.3% and 7.4% operating margins in international. And now it looks like you\u2019re losing money and maybe for the whole year. Could you talk about some of the drivers that are driving the losses this quarter internationally? What the Company\u2019s patience for losses are internationally. And when you come out of this, how your business will be different and what your margin outlook is for the international profits? Thank you.","Tom A. Alberg","","Sure. In terms of what you\u2019re seeing in Q1, and you\u2019ve been seeing this certainly for a few year period here is we\u2019ve investing very heavily in international and we\u2019re doing that in a number of different ways. Certainly from a geographic standpoint, we continue to invest in new geographies, and Italy and Spain were certainly the most recent and you should assume that we\u2019re investing in those geographies. We continue to invest in China and certainly that\u2019s in investment mode.","And then also as we\u2019ve continue to grow in international, we\u2019ve invested in terms of capacity, both fulfillment capacity, as well as infrastructure capacity to support those. So what you saw \u2013 you will see some certainly variation over time in the period that you\u2019re talking about. We certainly had particularly coming out of \u2013 going into late 2008 and also 2009, we had extra capacity globally. We still did continue to invest, but not near the rates that we\u2019re investing now and that\u2019s why you saw some results that you\u2019ve seen. But again one of the things that you see now in international but in our total results is continue to invest very heavily into the business because of the opportunities that we are seeing.","Justin Post \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll now hear from Greg Melich with ISI Group.","Greg Melich \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","","Hi, thanks. I wanted to ask a bit on the decision process that you went through when raising the Prime membership fee. I know you talked about potentially doing $20 to $40. What factors did you look at in deciding on the $20? And related to that, with the deleveraging of shipment costs happening a little bit, was weather an impact on that or is that just the business and how it\u2019s trending?","Thomas J. Szkutak","","There was a number of different factors that we have looked at in terms of when we look at the price increase, but the biggest one is we had build \u2013 we think we build a great service and we saw that the just particularly the transportation cost since its inception have grown dramatically, we just haven\u2019t done any price increase during that long time period, and that\u2019s really the big reason why we decides to do that. We\u2019ve launched the program with over a million items.","And we have over 20 million items customers are using that service in addition to having the transportation cost being higher they are using that service more and that\u2019s really we applied to it. And it would be on that, there is a lot we can comment.","Greg Melich \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","Just on the shipment costs deleveraging in the first quarter a little bit. Did weather or something else have an impact, or is that just the trend of the business given the growth rate of shipments?","Thomas J. Szkutak","","This many different factors that go into that and certainly, weather would have been one of those.","Operator","","We\u2019ll move on to Ron Josey with JMP Securities.","Ron Victor Josey \u2013 JMP Securities LLC","","Hi guys, thanks for taking the question this is Andrew on for Ron. Quick question around streaming volumes in UK and Germany now that Lovefilm is bundled with Prime? Guys you have any comment?","Thomas J. Szkutak","","Unfortunately it is probably a good question for future quarters it just so early and again what little data we have so far it\u2019s very encouraging but it is very early so I think that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s a good question for future quarters.","Operator","","We\u2019ll move to Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.","Heath P. Terry \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","","Great thanks, obviously a lot of focus on pricing in AWS you are clearly still seeing accelerating growth despite those cuts, could you provide some context on the volume side of that equation whether it\u2019s just growth in customers or workload some way to sort of frame the other side of things outside of just pricing in AWS?","Thomas J. Szkutak","","It\u2019s a good question. And I think that something we can certainly work on and tried to be helpful the price change, the most recent price change is certain recent. And what we are commenting on is certainly the Q1 results but \u2013 that something that we\u2019ll think about and that would be helpful on that as we go forward. But certainly usage has been this is not something recent. Usage has been very, very strong. And as we\u2019ve continued to lower prices over time, this is the 42nd price decrease that we\u2019ve had and we\u2019ve had a great usage growth over time.","Heath P. Terry \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. And just on the AWS side, with the sort of nationalistic concerns that we\u2019re seeing around stored data, does that change at all the way that the AWS team is thinking about infrastructure needs for that business or the way that you might be thinking about CapEx?","Thomas J. Szkutak","","I think the best way to say it is, and hopefully this answers your question. The team focuses on many different aspects, but certainly the operational aspects of being up and running, being a very secure, reliable set of services, those are something the team is very focused on and spends a lot of time working on. And so beyond that, I\u2019m not sure I can add to it.","Heath P. Terry \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks, Tom.","Operator","Youssef Squali with Cantor Fitzgerald has the next question.","Youssef H. Squali \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Yes. Thank you very much. Two quick questions please. First, the HBO deal seems like a seminal event for Prime video in terms of quality and probably the price bit as well. Is this the first of many potentially large deals you\u2019re intent on getting for the platform? Or was this more of an opportunistic transaction that just came your way? And second, just on the P&L, can you just clarify where that $60 million in investment gains came from, please?","Thomas J. Szkutak","Sure. The answer to your second question, which is down below in other relates to a gain primarily from Living Social. They sold their Korean business and that\u2019s reflected in that line item. In terms of the content question, the way we think about it is this. Since we launched the service we\u2019ve continually added \u2013 tried to add great content and I think we\u2019ve been pretty successful in doing that. And this is just another contract that we\u2019ve launched into this multi-year to do that and we think it\u2019s great for customers. We\u2019re extremely excited to offer this to customers and we\u2019ll try to keep making the service even better over time.","Youssef H. Squali \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","","Is exclusive video an important consideration for you now?","Thomas J. Szkutak","There\u2019s a number of factors. Certainly we have a number of different arrangements where we have exclusive content and we think that\u2019s great for customers. We\u2019ve also supplemented with other content that\u2019s not exclusive. And we\u2019re obviously, as you know, we\u2019re working on original content as well. So that is exclusive.

Hi Tom, wanted to really ask two related questions. First, following up on the international discussion from before, I was wondering if you could prioritize where the investments are going on the international side between fulfillment, media build out, geography build out, et cetera? And then related, I haven\u2019t seen any discussion on what\u2019s happening on the domestic fulfillment build out this year. I was wondering if you could comment on that as well.","Thomas J. Szkutak","Yes, in terms of the priority, I\u2019m not sure what to add there, but I would say that we\u2019re investing heavily in China and we have been for some time and certainly that\u2019s a factor. We\u2019re investing in new geographies, most notably Italy and Spain. We\u2019re investing in, as I mentioned, fulfillment centers and infrastructure to support that growth. So, again, not a lot to add there. The other part of your question?","Ronald Scott Tilghman \u2013 B. Riley & Co. LLC","Well, let me ask you in a different way. If you look at pricing, if you look at infrastructure, if you look at geography, is there one bucket that tends to trump the others?","Thomas J. Szkutak","Again we\u2019ve been pretty consistent how we\u2019ve talked about it. Again, China is an issue. China is a big investment. In all of our geographies, not just international, we\u2019re investing on behalf of customers in terms of lowering prices. And so, that\u2019s having an impact, volume is having an impact. We continue to invest in fulfillment capacity not only for our retail customers, but also for third-parties on behalf of fulfillment by Amazon, sort of making investments there and the others that I mentioned.","Ronald Scott Tilghman \u2013 B. Riley & Co. LLC","Fair enough. And on domestic fulfillment?","Thomas J. Szkutak","Domestic fulfillment, as we have in past years, we\u2019ll continue to update you as we go throughout the year. I don\u2019t have any comments today given that we\u2019re just coming out of Q1, but we will be adding fulfillment capacity given the growth rates we\u2019re experiencing and we\u2019ll update you as we go.","Ronald Scott Tilghman \u2013 B.

Szkutak","I can\u2019t comment on what we might or might not do in the future, but the team has done a nice job from an advertising perspective and you can see those prominently on our various websites. We view it as another way certainly to help, be able to afford lower prices for customers and again the team has done a very nice job of monetizing those detailed pages to allow us to be able to do that.","Operator","Moving on to Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.","Mark S. Mahaney \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","","Thanks, Tom. Two questions, please. The international media you talked about, I guess the digitization catch-up or whatever of international media. Could you break that down a little bit further? Are there certain categories, i.e., books versus videos, versus music that one of those is dragging internationally? And what is it that needs to happen for that digital shift to occur? Do you need more rights? You just need more devices in the market? What\u2019s the drag there? And then, in terms of the operating income guidance you\u2019re very consistent how you guided the last couple of years. It seems like you\u2019re guiding for more of a sequential decline in operating income in June quarter than you have the last two years. Is that just a different type of seasonality to the business, or are there new near-term investments that you\u2019re making in this June quarter? Thank you.","Thomas J. Szkutak","","In terms of the second part of the question, related to the guidance what\u2019s reflected in the Q2 guidance is many different factors, but we are investing. I\u2019ve mentioned a number of different investments that we\u2019re making in International which related to Q1, also relate to Q2. We are investing in content, we are investing in our web services business both from new services as well as pricing.","So again, we are investing in a lot of different areas across the company. So I\u2019m sure there is a number that I\u2019m not mentioning. So again, we are investing, that\u2019s really which we are seeing in the range of guidance that we see in Q2. In terms of International media, we continue to make progress there on our conversion from physical to digital. But we\u2019re just not where we are in North America. And it\u2019s in many different categories and we\u2019ll continue to work on that. And certainly some other things that you see related to video in Europe, certainly trying to address that part of that. So again, we\u2019ll continue to work on the various pieces of that for our International business and look forward to doing that.","Mark S. Mahaney \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks, Tom.","Operator","","Deutsche Bank\u2019s Ross Sandler has the next question.","Ross A. Sandler \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","","Hey, guys. If you don\u2019t mind I\u2019ll beat the dead horse on the International question. But specifically around China, can you just give us an update on the overall strategy for China? Are the levels of investments going into the country accelerating or are they just stable? And then what kinds of milestones in terms of market share or customer adoption do you guys track to identify success or return on that investment? Thanks.","Thomas J. Szkutak","In China, we are investing a lot and trying to grow the business there. We are certainly investing in fulfillment. We haven\u2019t been investing in our fulfillment network to get even closer to customers. We are doing a lot on the retail basics as we\u2019ve done in other geographies making sure that we have a great in stock availability. We\u2019re making sure that we have [had] a unique selection. So those are the, lot of the things that we\u2019ve done making sure that we have the right pricing in place on behalf of customers making sure that our service levels are where we need them to be.","So those are the things that we\u2019d continue to work on in China. It\u2019s a very large opportunity and we are continuing to work hard. Is it a large investment? Yes it is. And that investment has certainly increased over the past several years.","Operator","","We\u2019ll now hear from Colin Sebastian with Robert Baird & Company.","Colin A. Sebastian \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","","Thanks. First, just one clarification on the AWS question. Given the comments that customers would see hundreds of millions of dollars of savings in Q2 from the price cuts, I just want to understand or clarify if we should be expecting moderating growth rate in the other segments, at least temporarily? And then lastly just Amazon\u2019s position on the ability of ISPs to add a toll for fastlane network access. Is this a scenario a situation that would change the company\u2019s approach or strategy with regards to video or is this more of a non-factor for you guys? Thanks.","Thomas J. Szkutak","In terms of the just clarification and just quote, he mentioned that customers will be saving hundreds of millions of dollars over the next several months alone, he didn\u2019t say specifically at the second quarter. So certainly that\u2019s impacting second quarter and it\u2019s reflected in the guidance that you are seeing there. But again we are very happy to do that on behalf of our AWS customers. We\u2019ve done many different price decreases over time and we think that\u2019s great on behalf of customers and we think our teams are and we are positioned very well in that business and we continue to invest in that given the large opportunity that we have there. In terms of the other question, there is not really a lot I can comment there.","Operator","","And ladies and gentlemen unfortunately we only have time for one more question which will come from Kerry Rice with Needham & Company.","Kerry Rice \u2013 Needham & Co. LLC","","Thanks a lot. Just a couple questions. One on customer adds, you didn\u2019t add quite as many new customer accounts as you did in Q1 2013. And so I assume based on your comments that wasn\u2019t related to the price increase around Prime, and so I don\u2019t know if you can add any context there. And then the second question is just around mobile. Obviously, the mobilization throughout the world is an important trend and you guys haven\u2019t talked a lot about it. Wonder if you can give us any context around your strategy there or any metrics.","Thomas J. Szkutak","In terms of Prime, again over the year-over-year, it is growing very rapidly and then also week-over-week as we look at the metrics over the last several weeks continues to grow week-over-week, so we\u2019re very encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing there. In terms of mobile, it\u2019s certainly a tailwind for our business. We have a number of different things that are working on mobile and we continue to make it easier and easier for customers to shop from a mobile perspective.","Our traffic continues to increase from a mobile perspective. We are excited about what we see there. And we continue trying to find ways to make that even better from an experience standpoint for our customers.","","Dave Fildes","Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q3 2017 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded.","For opening remarks, I'll be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.","Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.","Hello, and welcome to our Q3 2017 Financial Results Conference Call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO.","As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2016. Our comments in response to your questions reflect management's views as of today, October 26, 2017 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.","During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.","Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe, today, to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.","Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict the demand for our goods and services and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.","With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","At this time, we will open up the call for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. I guess I'll just start with, can you give us your thoughts on the Whole Foods integration, how you see that contributing to the bottom line over time? And then on a quick balance sheet note, we obviously saw the strong AWS results, but unearned revenue doesn't seem to be growing at the rate it was in the past. Maybe comment a little bit on the unearned revenue growth on the balance sheet, why it might be slower than the past? Thank you.","Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.","Yes. Thanks, Justin. This is Dave. I'd also point you to beyond the balance sheet. There's some disclosure to (03:57) unearned revenue as part of the cash flow statement. So when you look at that for the three months ended, around 34%, 35% for (04:05) and, historically, what we've seen with unearned revenue is a big and leading contributor (04:12) signing up, paying $99 upfront and having that (04:18). That continues to be the biggest absolute contributor to what you see there. The other area that's been growing over the past few years is Amazon Web Services (04:30) instances where those customers can pay for services upfront in some cases and discounts over multi-year periods.","What we're seeing more recently, I think, is on the Prime piece. We launched month-to-month Prime last year and if you think about how that works, customers are paying $10.99 per month as they go, so there's less that's deferred. So that's, I think, one of a number of factors. So, there's obviously other mix factors going in there besides the pieces that I just mentioned, but we have seen that monthly Prime has been a good driver of getting more members into the program. So, that's part of what you're seeing.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","And your question about Whole Foods, we're really excited to have them as part of the team now after the acquisition in late August. What you see in the financial results for this quarter is, it's shown actually in the new physical stores revenue component, $1.3 billion of revenue, $21 million of operating income. And that's where you'll be seeing the Whole Foods revenue showing up. In addition, that is, the cost of revenue, physical stores revenue is going to be where we're going to book any sales where the customer physically selects an item in a store. So, it will also include, or does include our Amazon Books.","But if you step back on Whole Foods, again, I think we've had busy months since we've joined forces, offering lower prices on a range of key grocery items in the stores, launching the Whole Foods private label products on Amazon, the technical (06:07) work to make Prime the Whole Foods customer rewards program, and we'll have that coming out in the future. We've added Amazon Lockers to select Whole Foods stores. So lots of activity, lots of energy and we're really excited to show customers what's possible when we join forces here.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. I guess I'll ask two as well. The first one is that was a bit of unusual upside to your guidance, even stripping out Whole Foods. What most surprised you in the quarter? You have been pretty consistent on how you reported versus your guide, so something unusual happened or somewhat unusual happened, what would you attribute that to?","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Sure. In Q3, yes, I would say we had a very strong Prime Day. As you know, we talked about that on the last call. But it really carried into the quarter. We had a record day for sign-ups for free trials for Prime in Prime Day globally, had a very strong Prime Day in particular internationally. So, it really got a lot more traction in this, the third year that we've had it. So I would point mostly to those factors. It was also a very strong quarter for AWS.","Revenue growth was the same as Q2, and now we're at an $18 billion run rate, whereas last quarter when I had this call, we were at $16 billion, so very pleased with the customer response in the AWS business as well. And usage growth is actually growing a lot higher than revenue growth. So particularly pleased with the new customers that we've added and the additional workloads that we've picked up from existing customers.","Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And then, briefly, on the international retail, that growth also by itself was intrinsically stronger than you've seen in a while. Any particular markets, geographic markets, you would call out there?","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Yeah, I would \u2013 yeah, it was pretty strong across the board. We had the impact of Souq obviously, this quarter internationally and the Diwali holiday in India was a few days earlier, which maybe pushed some sales into Q3 versus Q4. But generally, it was the strength of Prime Day internationally, and it carried through the quarter, but generally, I would point to the increased selection.","A lot of the building blocks that we've been working on, all the Prime benefits, advancements in free shipping offers or faster shipping offers, the Prime benefits would drive engagement, of course, adding selection, adding Fulfilled by Amazon partners and the selection that they bring. So again, I wouldn't point to anything other than the Prime Day pickup, but it was stronger than probably I anticipated.","Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you, Brian.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Just on Whole Foods again, I was wondering could you talk about one or two of the biggest surprises you've seen so far? And then maybe just the strategic opportunities you see of having a brick-and-mortar presence as you look to continue to grow your overall business. And the second one, on the subscription revenue, you accelerated to 59%. Could you just talk about which countries or which regions are driving that? And maybe talk a little bit about the growth or the cadence of what's happening in the U.S., your oldest market? Thanks.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Sure. On Whole Foods, I would say it is early. August 28 was the close date and what I can tell you is I have been in meetings with John Mackey and his team, and they are very like-minded with us, customer-obsessed, ready to work together to continue their mission and expand on their offerings that we can offer customers.","The other things I mentioned, price reductions early on, selling their products on Amazon.com and also installing Amazon Lockers. I think over time, you'll see more cooperation and working together between AmazonFresh, Prime Now, and Whole Foods as we can explore different ways to serve the customer. So, that's kind of the early report on Whole Foods. So far so good, and we're thrilled to finally be working together after the summer of closing the deal.","On subscription revenue, let me just remember your question there. We had essentially 59% growth, as you said, 600 basis points higher than Q2. In this line item, is certainly the fees associated with Amazon Prime and also it's where a lot of our subscription services for digital music, digital video, audiobooks, e-books, so there's some moving parts in there.","The growth in Prime has been fairly consistent over the last recent quarters in Prime memberships, and as I said, we had the largest new sign-ups on Prime Day for the Prime program. The monthly program is gaining traction and is an attractive option for a lot of people. And again, on the other subscription services, music especially, it works just so well with our Echo device that we're seeing a lot of growth in that area as we increase the number of Echo devices and customers using the Echo devices.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the question. In the comment in the release on seasonal workers, that looks roughly flat year-on-year. I wanted to know if you could understand a little bit more about the trajectory around the workers needed to fulfill seasonal holiday demand and what that might also mean for automation or efficiency benefits you're getting inside your fulfillment centers? Thanks so much.","Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.","Yes, Eric, this is Dave. I think we put out a release, I think, earlier this quarter talking about 120,000 operations folks to bring into our fulfillment centers this year. So, we're continuing to hire and hire across a number of locations. We talked earlier this year about expecting to see a greater than or \u2013 roughly or greater than 30% square footage growth in operations. So, we're certainly hiring to support that. More of these facilities do have Amazon Robotics and certainly that helps with the efficiencies there, but it requires a tremendous effort from a number of our folks as well, and so we'll continue to hire there.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","While we're on this subject of head count, head count grew 77% year-over-year in the quarter. That includes the impact of the Whole Foods and Souq acquisitions. Without those, without that head count, the base Amazon grew 47%, which is still up from 42% in Q2. So a lot of the additional pickup in Q3 was tied to our ramp for the holidays. We continued to hire a lot of software engineers. We continued to hire a lot of sales reps and it's tied directly to our major investment areas of AWS, Prime Video and devices.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the question. Brian, I was hoping you could help us understand how, at this point, you're prioritizing expansion into new product categories. In particular, there's a lot of talk now about potentially using Whole Foods stores for a physical pharmacy presence and also that you've perhaps gotten approvals across multiple states in that category. Can you just help us understand the approach in general to new categories and pharmacy in particular? Thank you.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Yeah, I can't confirm or deny any of the rumors related to pharmacy or anything else. I will say we do see a lot of opportunity with Whole Foods. As I said, there will be a lot of work together between Prime Now, AmazonFresh, Whole Foods, Whole Foods products on the Amazon site, Amazon Lockers at the Whole Foods stores. So, there will be a lot of integration, a lot of touch points and a lot of working together as we go forward. And we think we'll be also developing new store formats and everything else just as we talked about in the past before Whole Foods. Amazon Books stores, Amazon Go, and the opportunity that that technology presents. We have on campus bookstores.","So, we are experimenting with a lot of formats. I think that Whole Foods really gives us a vast headstart on that and a great base. And a great team to work with who has a lot of history and a lot of \u2013 they probably have 10 years to 20 years of learnings that we don't have and wouldn't have. So, we're really excited about that and I think working together, will bring our different strengths to the table and really be able to build on behalf of customers.","Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you, Brian.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you. The other category which includes advertising accelerated 58% in the quarter. I think the common view there is that that's a fairly high margin business, certainly higher than corporate average. Is there any reason why that isn't the right assumption to make? Essentially what impact is the growth in the ad business having on the company's overall profitability? And in terms of the increased losses in the international retail segment of the business, can you provide some color around how much of that's being driven by Amazon launching into new markets, which I know you continue to do, versus investing more heavily in existing markets?","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Sure. Let me start with the revenue. So you're right, other revenue grew 58% in the quarter. And that includes advertising services and other things such as our cobranded credit card agreements. Advertising revenue continues to grow very quickly and its year-over-year growth rate is actually faster than the other revenue line item that you see there. But I would say, generally, we're very pleased with the advertising business. Our goal here is to be helpful to consumers and help them make better shopping and selection choices. We'll also provide \u2013 and giving them targeted recommendations, so making it helpful for customers rather than intrusive.","And then we believe that by creating that growth (17:19) and engaging advertising experience with the customers, it will also maximize success for our advertisers. So, it's an important part of the flywheel and so it's the traffic and the customers, especially the Prime customers that come to the site, are really the ones that we can use to help them select items and use advertising to help make their decisions more informed when they're picking products.","On the international, yeah, I can't split it, the effects, but I will tell you again, it is international expansion and primarily in India where we're continuing to add benefits. And we launched Prime there a year ago, if you remember, and we've had more Prime members join in India than in any other country in the first 12 months. We have free shipping on 10 million items there and we're continuing to add benefits; Prime Video, Amazon Family.","We had the first Prime Day there this year, Prime Music, Amazon Business is also expanding in India. So, a lot of positive momentum and investment going on in India, very pleased with that. We also recently announced Echo and Alexa are available in India. So that should be well received by the Indian consumer base.","But excluding India and Souq, the rest is the Prime benefits and the continued growth in the other countries that we have been in for a while, continue to roll out Prime Now and AmazonFresh. In video, if you remember in Q4 of last year, we launched Prime Video in over 200 countries globally, continue to build up not only the offerings, but also the engagement that we see from those Prime customers.","So becoming more engaged and we're also doing the basic blocking, tackling of adding selection, especially FBA selection, increasing free shipping offers and also speed of shipping offers. So, there's a lot of different influences there. You saw the growth rate. We believe that it's resonating with customers. So, we will continue to invest and think that we have a good path forward.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Ross Sandler - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Two questions. There's been some news flow recently about Brazil expansion. Can you just talk about how Brazil compares to maybe some of the other international markets that you're investing in? What level of investment should we expect in Brazil maybe relative to like in Australia or in India?","And then a follow-up on the Whole Foods, so do you feel like the store footprint at 460 odd scores is adequate? Or any color on plans to expand either the Whole Foods store footprint or the Amazon Books stores or those other ones you mentioned? Thank you.","Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.","Yeah, Ross. Thanks for the question. This is Dave. On Brazil, just briefly, yeah we did recently expand and add an electronics category there in Brazil. It's a third-party marketplace offering. You may recall we've been in Brazil for a number of years now, initially launched with really a Kindle and e-books offering without the sort of physical categories and, more recently, added physical books again, a third-party marketplace offering.","So, I think, we're excited about the electronics getting out there. There is a wide variety of products included in that category: smartphones, tablets, cameras, TVs, what have you. So, I think, we're really excited to get that technology out there for Brazilians. And I think beyond that, we really just focus on those categories and growing selection there, but I can't speculate on what we might do in the future there.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","And on Whole Foods, yes, I believe the total is 465 stores or thereabouts. And we have 12 bookstores now. We are adding a few more in the near future in California, Washington DC, and Austin. So, yeah, you will see more expansion from us. We're not ready to announce what that will look like and we are working with the Whole Foods team on how many more stores we might have in that area. But still early, so those plans will develop over time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks, Brian. I understand you can't comment on rumors one way or the other but curious, as you think about categories like health care and, obviously, you guys are already in health care to some degree through Amazon Business, can you give us a bit of a status update on what you do have out there now? And particularly how the company and management thinks about entering more regulated businesses over time, how you would approach that versus a standard category that you might go into or maybe again knowing you can't comment on rumors, how you have approached that in the past or in other markets.","And then to the extent that we're thinking about AWS growth in the fourth quarter, you guys are lapping the price cuts from last year and, obviously, have about an 800-basis-point easier comp Q3 to Q4, taking those two things into consideration, how should we think about AWS growth through the end of the year?","Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.","Yeah, Heath. This is Dave. I'll take that first question in relation to health care. I think where you're seeing us do some work in that, I think, is on the areas of Amazon Business, and that's really just from the standpoint of there are many different types of businesses that we can serve with that offering, and we're in our third year now, and so there's a lot of different sectors, whether they are hospitals, educational institutions, labs, government agencies, I mean, there's a lot of different shapes and sizes across industries that we can serve with that.","And so, I think what you're seeing us do is really focus on services that meet those businesses multi-user accounts, improving approval workflow tools and just more recently, we introduced Amazon Business for Business Prime Shipping, which we think will be a great way for businesses to use multiuser \u2013 business customers have multiuser accounts, and that's in the U.S. and Germany. So, I think it's part of that offering, and we will really have to see how that evolves. And the other side, too, is certainly health care is one of many sectors as part of Amazon Web Services that are important customers that we are focusing on and building tools for. So probably nothing specific to call out on that one, but that's a lot of what you're seeing from us today.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Yeah, on AWS, we don't provide segment level estimates, but we did consider in our guidance the impact of the price cuts last year. You're right, we had a number of price cuts timed about around December 1 of last year. That certainly had an impact on Q4 of last year. But again, price cuts and not only price cuts but new products that have lower average cost and can cannibalize more expensive products is pretty much a part of our business all the time in AWS. So we're looking forward to a strong Q4 and re:Invent is in December or the end of November, early December, so that is also an exciting time of year for the AWS business.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Devitt with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Scott William Devitt - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Thanks. I had two, please. First, Prime Now, Fresh, Prime Pantry, and Whole Foods, they're all distinct offerings, but it does seem like there's natural overlap with the potential to be further connected. And I was just wondering if you could just speak to how we should think about those four as distinct product offerings in the future versus being more integrated and possibly even in some cases, eliminated to remove overlap from a customer experience standpoint.","And then secondly, given the recent management changes in video, Brian, I was just wondering if you could speak to any strategic shifts in video or changes in the pace of content portfolio build in coming years? Thank you.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Sure. Let me start with video. And I just want to be clear. We're going to continue to invest in video and increase that investment in 2018. And why are we going to do that? It's because the video business is having great results with our most important customer base, which is our Prime customers. It continues to drive better conversion of free trials, higher membership renewal rates for existing subscribers and higher overall engagement. We're seeing the engagement go up year-after-year in video and also music and a lot of the other Prime benefits. We also know Prime members who watch video also spend more on Amazon.","And we have a lot of data where that's the advantage we have is that we see the viewing patterns, and we also see the sales patterns, so we can tie the two together and understand which video resonates with Prime members, which video doesn't, and make mid course corrections. So we always do that. We're always changing the emphasis and looking for those more impactful shows, more shows that resonate better with our customer base, and things they want to see. So that will always be an important part of our Prime offer, and we'll continue to use the data that we have to make better and better decisions about where to invest our dollars in Prime Video. So we remain very bullish on the video business, and we're looking forward to a lot of interesting new projects at the back-end of this year and also lined up into next year.","On the, sorry, the second comment was, oh, the overlap. Yes. So Whole Foods, I think I mentioned this earlier, but we definitely see commonality and overlap with the Whole Foods business as well as Amazon in total, but specifically Prime Now and also AmazonFresh. And we're going to work to see how we expand those offerings, and in some cases combine them. We're not sure how it'll play out.","But we're going cooperate across those different customer touch points and trying to make them better for customers. We know customers are going to buy, just like in the physical world, sometimes you go to a convenience store, sometimes you go to a supermarket, sometimes you go to a superstore. Sometimes you need things within an hour, sometimes you can wait days for shipments. So there's no one paradigm for all customer engagement, and we're looking for the ones that resonate best with customers and we're going to continue to work on those.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.","Jason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks. I'll actually ask two, if I can. Just any way you can comment on the increase in Whole Foods traffic after the close? And then second, talk about your desire to have an ad supported business on Fire TV or through Prime Video? Thank you.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Let me start on traffic. So we're not disclosing traffic figures. Whole Foods will be issuing a final 10-K early next month. So you'll see a better perspective on the entire quarter. The quarter that, or the four week period that you see running through the Amazon P&L this quarter is pretty hard to draw conclusions on other than revenue at this point. But Dave, do you have more on the...?","Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.","Yeah, Jason, this is Dave. On the ad supported question, I think what you've seen to-date is really particularly as you're looking as a customer, as a Prime Video member and watching content, we view that as you've paid into that service and able to watch those shows ad free. There may be instances where you're viewing a first episode and there's an ad leading into that if it's the first free episode, but generally we like to have that as customers have paid into that program and they'll be able to enjoy that without interruption.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Ronald V. Josey - JMP Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for the question. Just wanted to ask about delivery and just over the last several months, we've seen a lot of announcements and products around delivery options between Lockers, the testing of the Kohl's partnership, Whole Foods obviously, Amazon Key came out recently, just wanted to better understand this investment. Is this a result of, or the thesis that more options could drive obviously more sales on the flip side, do you think you're losing sales by not having those options? Thank you.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Probably a little of both. We think that especially as we get into more and more Amazon Logistics deliveries, we're going to experiment with different ways to deliver things that make it easier on consumers, things that cut down on potential theft on doorsteps, but really it's mostly about increasing convenience for them.","Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.","Yeah. I think that's right. In terms of overall investments there.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","And the other investments obviously are on the -maybe on the bigger-ish things or like planes and transportation capacity in general. There our philosophy is, again, we are going to watch out for our customers, we're going to build capacity that gives them great service 12 months a year but particularly at holidays. By investing in those transportation options, we do so at same cost or cost parity I would say at the very minimum.","But it also allows us to do interesting things like extend cut off times for customers. It enables Sunday delivery, enable better weekend delivery. So we're seeing a lot of benefits, just the ability to stretch the order cut off from what once was 3 PM in the afternoon to midnight. Has huge benefits for both the customer and also for Amazon. It results in incremental sales and it also builds that trust that when you need something, Amazon is going to be there for you. And I need to remind you that the Thursday Night Football Game will start in two hours and 20 minutes, so...","Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.","On that, thanks for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon, and look forward to talking with you again next quarter."],"1635":["Amazon.com Inc.

Welcome to the Amazon.com First Quarter 2013 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded.","For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Sean Boyle. Mr. Boyle, please go ahead.","Sean Boyle","Hello and welcome to our Q1 2013 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.","The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 25, 2013 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K.","As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.","Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2012.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Szkutak","Thanks Sean. I\u2019ll begin with comments on our first quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 39% to $4.25 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 85% to $177 million. Trailing-12 month capital expenditures were $4.07 billion.","This amount includes $1.4 billion in purchases of our previously leased corporate office space, as well as property for development of additional corporate office space located in Seattle, Washington which we purchased in the fourth quarter 2012.","The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth consisting of investments in technology, infrastructure including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.","Return on invested capital was 1%, down from 12%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 471 million shares compared with 464 million one year ago.","Worldwide revenue grew 22% to $16.07 billion or 24% excluding the $302 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rate. We are grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers.","Media revenue increased to $5.06 billion, up 7% or 10% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $10.21 billion, up 28% or 30% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 64% of worldwide sales, up from 60%.","Worldwide paid unit growth was 30%. Active customer accounts exceeded 209 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 40% of paid units.","Now, I will discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $11.8 billion, or 73.4% of revenue, compared with 76.1%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $3.83 billion, or 23.8% of sales, up approximately 289 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $1.74 billion, or 10.8% of revenue compared with 9.5%. Tech and content was $1.26 billion, or 7.9% of revenue, compared with 6.5%. Marketing was $616 million, or 3.8% of revenue compared with 3.6%.","Now, let\u2019s talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments, our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item.","In the North America segment, revenue grew 26% to $9.39 billion. Media revenue grew 14% to $2.51 billion. EGM revenue grew 28% to $6.13 billion, representing 65% of North America revenues, up from 64%. North America segment operating income increased 31% to $457 million, a 4.9% operating margin.","In the international segment, revenue grew 16% to $6.68 billion. Adjusting for the $301 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 21%. Media revenue grew 1% to $2.54 billion, or 7% excluding foreign exchange and EGM revenue grew 28% to $4.09 billion, or 32% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 61% of international revenues, up from 56%.","International segment operating loss was $16 million, a 0.2% negative operating margin compared with income of $49 million.","CSOI increased 11% to $441 million, or 2.7% of revenue, down approximately 27 basis points year-over-year. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 6% to $181 million, or 1.1% of net sales.","Our income tax benefit was $18 million it includes $46 million of discrete tax benefits primarily resulting from the retroactive reinstatement of the federal research and development credit that was enacted in January 2013. GAAP net income was $82 million or $0.18 per diluted share compared with $130 million and $0.28 per diluted share.","Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $2.18 billion year over year to $7.89 billion. Inventory increased 27% to $5.4 billion and inventory turns were 9.5, down from 10.4 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 29% to $8.92 billion and accounts payable days increased to 68 from 62 in the prior year.","I will conclude my portion of today\u2019s call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we\u2019ve seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumption. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high-level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance, as we\u2019ve described in more detail in our public filings issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies among such subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance.","Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments or settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently.","For Q2, 2013 we expect net sales of between $14.5 billion and $16.2 billion, a growth of between 13% and 26%. This guidance anticipates approximately 275 basis points of unfavourable impact on foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income or loss to be between a $340 million loss and $10 million income compared to $107 million income in the prior year period. This includes approximately $340 million for stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets.","We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and, other operating expense to be between zero and $350 million compared to $360 million in the prior year period. We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection, and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.","Thanks. With that, Sean, let's move to questions.","Sean Boyle","Great. Thanks Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. (Operator Instructions) And our first question today will come from analyst Brian Pitz with Jefferies.","Brian Pitz - Jefferies","In February, you changed your FBA fulfilment fees. Any comments on how this affected third-party sales and what was the overall merchant response? And then just quickly any update on your latest plans for new fulfilment centers in 2013?","Tom Szkutak","In terms of -- I will take the second part of the question first, in terms of new fulfilment centers, we\u2019ve announced three in the US right now and then a few outside of the US consistent with the prior year. It\u2019s early -- we really like the growth that we are experiencing. We will be adding more of these through the course of the year but stay tuned, we will update you as we go.","In terms of FBA, there\u2019s not a lot I can talk to there. We are very pleased with the FBA business and we think it\u2019s great for sellers and great for customers. And we are pleased to offer that service.","Operator","Moving on, we will hear from Scott Devitt of Morgan Stanley.","Scott Devitt - Morgan Stanley","Tom, the international segment sales growth of 21% continues to show modest deceleration I think with the exception of 4Q, it\u2019s been trailing US growth. I understand that AWS is mostly booked in the U.S. so that\u2019s a piece of the delta. But you\u2019ve talked in the past quarters about the investments in international driving margin to at least breakeven levels in international. I wonder if you could just talk through deceleration in the revenue growth in those markets and whether that\u2019s comp related Europe macro or otherwise?","And then secondly, shipping cost on a net basis is again leveraging. I think that\u2019s a second consecutive quarter. I just wonder if you could refresh us in terms of when the accounting change occurred in terms of the shipping revenue calculation for FPA to just understand if that\u2019s an organic number now. Thank you.","Tom Szkutak","The second half of the question, there is -- it is organic. So there is no -- it\u2019s consistent year-over-year. So this is the first quarter. It will be consistent year-over-year. In terms of your question, international, we\u2019re seeing still very solid growth, 21% on a local currency basis. As you\u2019ve read, certainly there is some softness from a macro standpoint that others are saying are hard to know whether that\u2019s impacting us and how much we\u2019re not a bellwether for the economy.","But we\u2019re very pleased with the growth that we\u2019re seeing. Again 21% on a local currency basis, unit growth is actually growing substantially faster than that. So again that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing. In terms of investing, you\u2019re absolutely right.","We\u2019re investing in a number of geographies including certainly China. We\u2019ve been investing for several years. We continue to invest there. We think it's a great long-term opportunity but we\u2019re in investment mode. And certainly some of the more recent additions that we\u2019ve had with Italy and Spain are certainly in investment mode as well.","Scott Devitt - Morgan Stanley","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Moving on, we will take a question from Mark Mahaney of RBC capital Markets.","Mark Mahaney - RBC capital Markets","Thanks. It\u2019s just a broad question on demand that\u2019s kind of mid-teens at the low-end revenue growth that you\u2019ve been, kind of, guiding too for, a quarter or two now that we\u2019ve seen well below the -- the average that you\u2019ve seen in the past. Are there any other factors you would want to call out or specifically not call out?","Do you think that things like imposition of state sales tax are having in near-term drag on growth rates. Last quarter, I think you talked about consumer electronics at the high-end. Are there any particular categories there you would want to call out as maybe driving that low -- that could produce low-end of the range outside of negative FX? Thanks.","Tom Szkutak","Sure. We give -- as we\u2019re consistently doing, we\u2019re giving a wide range. We think it\u2019s appropriate, given all the factors that\u2019s not something new that we\u2019re doing. That\u2019s something that have been doing for some time in your right -- growth rate guidance for Q2 is 13% to 26% certainly foreign exchange having an impact that includes approximately 275 basis points of foreign exchange. So it\u2019s approximately 16% to 29% on a local currency basis.","So again it\u2019s a wide range and just probably not a lot to add there but it takes into account all the things that we think we need to take into account as we give guidance. In terms of the absolute dollar range, it\u2019s very similar to what we would have -- in terms of the dollar range we would have given for Q1. I think it\u2019s maybe $100 million difference in terms of the absolute value of that range that we gave. So again wide range, we think that\u2019s appropriate.","Mark Mahaney - RBC capital Markets","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question today will come from Ben Schachter of Macquarie.","Ben Schachter - Macquarie","Are there any factors that are impacting the unit growth, particularly the shift from physical to digital, for instance rented video versus purchasing of video. Are there any other factors that you would highlight that are impacting the unit growth?","Tom Szkutak","The one factor, I would call out, first of all in terms of overall unit growth. Overall unit growth is 30% year-over-year. Again, very solid growth, compares to approximately 49% of Q1 of last year. So it\u2019s certainly -- we\u2019re certainly overlapping a pretty strong growth of last Q1.","In terms of the physical and digital, certainly one thing that we\u2019re seeing is certainly digital growing at a much faster rate. And when you do see that, a little bit is in our third-party units as a percentage of total units. You will see that, that\u2019s approximately 40% this quarter. That compares to last year up about approximately 100 basis points. But what we\u2019re seeing is because the digital units are growing at a faster rate and that mostly first party you're seeing that number impacted where that percentage as a percentage of our total is not growing as fast as it has last few quarter. Again that's largely driven by the digital units growth that you are seeing.","So again that\u2019s -- if you were to back out, for example, and just look at our physical units, our physical units as a percentage of total units this year versus last year is up over 300 basis points. That\u2019s again 3p growth as a percentage of total units.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Ross Sandler, Deutsche Bank.","Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank","Question on the -- follow-up question on the shipping, so just your net shipping costs, not your shipping margin, but just shipping costs relative to gross profit declined about 300 basis points, similar to what you have seen over the past four quarters. So as you start to comp some of these efficiency gains that you are seeing in shipping, do you think that line will continue to show leverage or is it going to start to level out from here?","Tom Szkutak","We are not giving -- certainly we\u2019re not giving guidance on any specific line item but certainly over a long period of time we think there is opportunity to be more productive there, and there are certainly efficiency gains to be had there. And that\u2019s something, certainly the team continues to work on.","Operator","Next, we will hear from Colin Sebastian of Robert W. Baird & Company.","Colin Sebastian - Robert W. Baird","Just a question on what services -- wonder if you can comment on enterprise level adoption, whether there are any meaningful barriers to that happening over time. We notice you\u2019ve been pretty aggressive in hiring enterprise-level sales people?","Tom Szkutak","No, I don\u2019t think that there is. I think the team has done a fantastic job in terms of developing services that are great for many different customer types, including enterprises. And the team is heads down focused on making sure we have a great operational of these services that are great from an operational standpoint and security standpoint and they are doing a terrific job. And so it\u2019s a very great opportunity for enterprises to adopt our services and the team is certainly focused on that along with other customers. So other customers that took in, it's a great opportunity for those customers and for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth of JPMorgan.","Douglas Anmuth - JPMorgan","You\u2019ve clearly been more aggressive in terms of video content recently and you are sort of leading, was it more in the release tonight in terms of the business content. I was hoping you could just add some more color here on the value that you think TV and movie content adds to consumers\u2019 overall purchase patterns?","Tom Szkutak","Sure. It\u2019s certainly one of our digital offerings and we have a number of different services. We have certainly content that we\u2019re using as part of our prime offer that we have a lot of free content of the customers. We think that's a great service to customers along with our express shipping offers as well as other content that we have free, for example, our Kindle owners lending library for books. So again, we think it\u2019s a great -- finds a great value for customers and it\u2019s part of that value proposition. We also have in a very good transaction business for video as well. That\u2019s growing very, very fast and certainly customers like it. We are seeing that reflected in the result that you see today.","Operator","Moving on, we will hear from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Mr. Post, your line is open. Please go ahead with your question.","Justin Post - Merrill Lynch","Sorry about that. I was on mute. I was wondering if you can help us little bit about the Kindle ecosystem. On prior calls a few years ago, you singled it out as a fast growth area and you were very happy with the performance. We haven't heard as much about it lately. Kind of the impact -- sort of how units are doing against your expectations and then the impact it\u2019s having on prime subs and also your growth in operating margins? Thank you.","Tom Szkutak","We are very pleased with Kindle and digital business. And we are superexcited in terms of the ecosystem. You're certainly seeing that in our results that you see today. For example, if you look at our media growth, we are certainly -- that ecosystem is more penetrated there than it is in international and you see that reflected in those associated growth rates.","Another way you see it is, if you take a look at our top 10 best-selling items worldwide in Q1. The top 10 are all either digital or Kindle related. Paperweight is our best selling product worldwide. But again, all 10 spots in the Q1 were either Kindle or digital items. And I believe that that's the first time that we\u2019ve seen.","We've been looking at that from a quarterly results standpoint for some period of time, and we\u2019ve had various levels of the top 10. But I think this maybe the first quarter we\u2019ve had all top 10 being either Kindle related or digital related. So again, we are very pleased with what we were doing there and we are going to continue to innovate on behalf of customers.","Justin Post - Merrill Lynch","And any impact on your gross or operating margins you recall?","Tom Szkutak","One thing I would say is we certainly are investing, certainly in area of investment and you're seeing that reflected. We are making a number of investments across the business and certainly we are investing in Kindle and our digital offerings. We are investing in some of the things I mentioned earlier like China or some of the emerging geographies. So those are certainly some of the larger key investments we are making.","Justin Post - Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Moving on, we will hear from Matt Nemer of Wells Fargo Securities.","Matt Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities","Afternoon. We are hearing reports that there is refrigeration equipment going in some of your fulfillment centers outside of Seattle area. Just wondering if you can update us on plans to expand AmazonFresh. Thanks.","Tom Szkutak","Nothing to announce here. We are very pleased with what we've seen in the Seattle area. But against, it\u2019s been a test and we continue to monitor that test carefully. It\u2019s certainly something that we see that customers love the experience. The challenge has always been in making sure we get the economics right and that is something we will continued to focus on.","Operator","And up next, we will take a question from Steven Ju of Credit Suisse.","Steven Ju - Credit Suisse","Hey. Tom, anything you can say in terms of how much Amazon has done video as well as potentially your own in-house produced content currently helps and will -- should in the future help reduce churn in Amazon Prime? Thanks.","Tom Szkutak","Thanks for the question. Yeah. It\u2019s something we haven't released any of the numbers. It\u2019s something that we are tracking very closely. It is something that we believe over time will reduce churn and it\u2019s certainly helping today. What we are seeing is great traction. We see a lot of usage of the service.","Customers love it and we think it is very interesting part of Prime offering. And that\u2019s why we have been expanding NYC, some of the more recent announcement including some of the stuff included in the earnings release today around original content So, again, it\u2019s something that we find very interesting and we are excited about it.","Operator","And we will go next to Ken Sena of Evercore Partners with our next question.","Ken Sena - Evercore Partners","Hi. I was just hoping you can maybe provide a little more color on the unit growth deceleration. And looking back over the last four quarters, it seems like about 500 basis points or so each quarter of deceleration. You had about 200 basis points here, which is an improvement. But anything you could say just to any signs of maturity in some of the business anywhere that deceleration is specifically coming?","Tom Szkutak","No, there is not a lot I can add. I mean I think the 30% book, very strong growth rate. Again it\u2019s growing at a faster rate than revenue, revenue at 20%, revenue at local currency growth of 24%, a very strong third-party growth continues to be very strong. Retail growth is strong. So again there is not a lot I can provide you there. But again keep in mind that we are overlapping 49% growth last year Q1, which is certainly little bit of a difficult compare but again fees would be 30% growth rate.","Operator","And our next question today comes from John Blackledge, Cowen & Company.","John Blackledge - Cowen & Company","Just a question on the Amazon advertising platform, given the immense amount of purchase ad you have on Amazon customers, how is that being used as a competitive advantage and maybe you just provide an overall view on the direction of the Amazon ad platform over time?","Tom Szkutak","In terms of the platform itself, we think it's a very sizable, very good long-term opportunity for us. And it\u2019s something that we\u2019ve been working on for some time and we think it\u2019s very interesting. One thing you'll notice, on our site we\u2019re being obviously very -- making sure the customer experience is great. What we are really trying to do is we are trying to help customers find and discover what they want to buy online. So we\u2019re and it\u2019s very customer centric but it\u2019s also from a business standpoint of very good long-term opportunity with great team that\u2019s working on the opportunity. And we\u2019re excited about the long term potential of it.","Operator","Moving on to Anthony Diclemente of Barclays.","Anthony Diclemente - Barclays","I am just wondering what you are seeing in terms of the attach rate of your transactional video on demand business versus usage of PrimeInstant Video. I am wondering just if your consumers tend to choose between the two, when they are making the selection or there\u2019s one sort of drives the other, does the Prime subscriber have a higher transactional VOD attach rates than non-Prime? So would be helpful to see -- to hear what you're seeing there in terms of usage?","Tom Szkutak","Yeah, I think the thing that can help with this, we see -- of Prime customers, for example, we certainly see adoption of the service in terms of free content but those same customers are purchasing content as well. So there is a good attachment to it which we like. And we see Prime members doing not just within video content but we see them doing a lot of cross-shopping. So it\u2019s not surprising we see them do, maybe a customer comes in, and had been traditionally purchasing them pre-Prime, in a few categories, we find that they do a lot more cross-shopping. Same thing with digital content. They use the service, they might start with free content and then they will also continue to purchase paid content. So it\u2019s a nice effect that we\u2019re seeing, which is why we like Prime so much.","Operator","Up next, we will hear from Youssef Squali of Cantor Fitzgerald.","Youssef Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald","Two quick questions please. Going back to the international, a question, what\u2019s going on in the international media to decelerate, I think last year Q1 I think it was up 22%, FX adjusted this quarter was up 7%. Is that all macro or are there any maybe other factors that you can talk about, maybe specific to SKUs or something? And the other is more of a clarification. I know last quarter you gave the unit growth in aggregate versus the unit growth of the retail, just wondering if you could give that to us as well?","Tom Szkutak","In terms of the international media growth, this quarter it was 1% on a dollar basis, 7% on a local currency basis, which you -- in terms of the overall growth rate certainly what you\u2019re seeing is digital content as part of that is growing very fast. But it\u2019s not as large or as penetrated. Our ecosystem isn\u2019t as developed I would say as it is in the U.S. And so when you compare the two geographies for second that\u2019s one of the more meaningful differences that you see between the two as you see that both are growing digital content very fast.","It is just the ecosystem is more build out in North America. But again, certainly we see very positive signs back in the growth we\u2019re experiencing in international. It\u2019s just on the lower base. So that\u2019s began to be helpful there.","In terms of the unit growth, we said that our overall unit growth was 30% for the quarter. Our 3P unit growth I don\u2019t have the overall growth rate but it\u2019s growing at a faster rate than the total.","Operator","And our next question today will come from Jordan Rohan of Stifel.","Jordan Rohan - Stifel","Yeah. I was hoping you could comment on the market entry and expansion strategy for Amazon in Brazil. There seemed to be tremendous amount of press last year about it and it seems to have died to some degree. I know the company may already be there with Amazon Web Services and some Kindle offerings. But when do you think that might get a little bit broader?","And secondly, there's been some stories recently about an Internet streaming device or box or set-top box, something of those sorts. Can you comment on any new hardware form factors including apps as of some sort of a cell phone or handset that might be coming down the pipe, anything to look forward to in the Kindle family or related? Thanks.","Tom Szkutak","In terms of geographic expansion, there is not a lot I can say specifically about Brazil. We think we are in the right geographies right now. We\u2019ve expanded into a number of geographies over the past few years. That is certainly something always we look at and you should expect us to expand to additional geographies over time.","In terms of any questions related to our product roadmap, we don\u2019t -- we\u2019ve a longstanding practices of not talking about what we might, or might not do there. But we are certainly excited about the product roadmap that we have for the future and again, we\u2019ve a longstanding practice of not giving details until closer at launch.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, we do have time for one final question today. That question will come from Jason Helfstein of Oppenheimer & Company.","Jason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Company","Thanks. Can you give us a little more color around customer growth? I mean, that number has been slowing not dramatically, but that is a slowing trend. Are you focused more on higher value customers to drive the business and any color around the quarter would be helpful? Thanks.","Tom Szkutak","We're actually pleased with the growth from a customer standpoint. We've seen very good growth and we continue to -- we have many, many teams across Amazon that are just heads down focused on trying to improve the customer experience and inventing on behalf of customers. So, we couldn't be more pleased with what they are doing, and you see that reflected in our overall growth rate this quarter with revenue up 24% on a local currency basis and units growing at 30%, on top of strong growth quarter last year Q1.","Jason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Company","Thank you.","Tom Szkutak","Great.","Sean Boyle","Thank you for joining us on a call today and for your questions.

Good day everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com Third Quarter 2013 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today\u2019s call is being recorded.","For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Sean Boyle. Please go ahead sir.","","Sean Boyle","Hello and welcome to our Q3 2013 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.","The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management\u2019s views as of today, October 24, 2013 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today\u2019s press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.","As you listen to today\u2019s conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as our metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2012.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom.","","Tom Szkutak","Thanks Sean. I will begin with comments on our third quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 48% to $4.98 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 63% to $388 million. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.59 billion. This amount includes $1.4 billion in purchases of our previously leased corporate office space as well as property for development of additional corporate office space located in Seattle, Washington, which we purchased in the fourth quarter of 2012. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of our continued business growth consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.","Return on invested capital was 3%, down from 10%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 475 million shares compared with 469 million shares.","Worldwide revenue grew 24% to $17.09 billion or 26% excluding the $332 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in the foreign exchange rate. We are grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers.","Media revenue increased to $5.03 billion, up 9% or 13% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $11.05 billion, up 29% or 31% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 65% of worldwide sales, up from 62%.Worldwide paid unit growth was 29%. Active customer accounts exceeded 224 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 40% of paid units.","Now, I will discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $12.37 billion or 72.3% of revenue compared with 74.7%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $4.46 billion, or 26.1% of sales, up approximately 250 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $1.96 billion, or 11.5% of revenue, compared with 10.5%. Tech and content was $1.58 billion, or 9.2% of revenue compared with 7.8%. Marketing was $671 million, or 3.9% of revenue, compared with 3.8%.","Now I'll talk about our segment results. In consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments or stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 31% to $10.3 billion. Media revenue grew 18% to $2.61 billion. EGM revenue grew 33% to $6.73 billion, representing 65% of North America revenues up from 64%. North America segment operating income increased 1% to $295 million, a 2.9% operating margin.","In the International segment, revenue grew 15% to $6.79 billion. Adjusting for the $327 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 20%. Media revenue increased 2% to $2.42 billion or 9% excluding foreign exchange. And EGM revenue grew 23% to $4.32 billion, or 28% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 64% of International revenues up from 59%.","International segment operating loss was 28 million compared to a $59 million loss in the prior period. Consolidated segment operating income interested 15% to $267 million or 1.6% of revenue down approximately 10 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange CSOI increased 18%.","Unlike CSOI our GAAP operating income or loss includes stock based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating loss was $25 million compared to a $28 million in the prior year period. Our income tax benefit was $12 million, GAAP net loss was $41 million $0.09 per diluted share compared with net loss of $274 million or $0.60 per diluted share. The third quarter 2012 included a loss of $169 million or $0.37 per diluted share related to our equity method share of losses recorded by Living Social primarily attributable to impairment charge of certain assets including goodwill.","Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $2.44 billion year-over-year to $7.69 billion. Inventory increased 20% to $6.07 billion and inventory turns were 9.2, down from 9.7 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 20% to $10.04 billion and accounts payable days was 75 consistent with the prior year.","I will conclude my portion of today\u2019s call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainties surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.","As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or real settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.","For Q4 2013, we expect net sales of between $22.5 billion and $26.5 billion, a growth between 10% and 25%. This guidance anticipates approximately 125 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income or loss will be between a $500 million loss and $500 million in income compared to $405 million income in the fourth quarter of 2012. This includes approximately $350 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.","We anticipate consolidated segment operating income or loss, which excludes stock-based compensation and other expense to be between $150 million loss and $850 million income compared to $678 million income in fourth quarter 2012. We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.","Thanks. And with that, Sean, let\u2019s move to questions.","","Sean Boyle","Great. Thanks Tom. Let\u2019s move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?","","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll go first to Ben Schachter with Macquarie.","","Ben Schachter - Macquarie","Hey, Tom. On the press release it says that you have signed up millions of new Prime members and I believe if you read it says it if that happened in the last 90 days. I wonder if you ever commented on a time period like that before and is that a normal run rate to add millions of Prime users in 90 days or is there something special in this quarter that drove prime? Thanks.","","Tom Szkutak","I don\u2019t recall if we have actually given a 90-day period before. I don\u2019t believe that we have in terms of beyond that it\u2019s not all par that I can add to that, but we are very excited Prime is growing very fast, very excited for the service that we offer customers both in terms of physical and digital goods. So it\u2019s exciting and that\u2019s how we put it in there today in the release.","","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.","","Scott Devitt - Morgan Stanley","Hi, Tom. Two if I could, first on the Kindle family, it seems like the timing of device launches the e-book library size in local language content could be drivers of different levels of penetration of digital media in the U.S. relative to what you have been able to attain outside the U.S. to-date? And I was wondering if there was anything else notable that you would highlight that helps explain the different dynamic that seems to be playing out within the media revenue line domestically versus international? And whether you think in any of those issues are structural or to just work themselves out with the benefit of time and your execution? And then secondly, if you could talk a bit about how you think about the lifetime value of the non-Prime customer versus the Prime customer and what the intended outcome maybe as it relates to the increase in Super Saver pricing in the U.S. market? Thanks.","","Tom Szkutak","In terms of the first question, certainly we have been launched devices in the U.S. earlier in terms of content both you are really referring to mostly e-book content, both growing very fast. The base is different. As you mentioned, we have a higher base in the U.S. just based on when we launch, so you are absolutely right, it\u2019s \u2013 you do see that difference in the median line between North America and international. And so it\u2019s just again both growing very nicely right now in terms of digital Kindle books in this case as you referenced, but it\u2019s just different base. And so it looks like lots of opportunity that we have in both segments there, but we are further ahead right now in North America. And then, I am sorry, could you repeat the second part of your question again?","","Scott Devitt - Morgan Stanley","Just how you are thinking about the lifetime value of those that are not Prime sales versus Prime sale that you are having an increase recently did with Super Saver Shipping in the U.S. from $25 to $35 threshold?","","Tom Szkutak","Sure. In terms of the Prime customers, we have seen knowing a very strong increase and primary [ph] but we have seen very good retention of prime numbers. And so you know certainly when you look at that in terms of lifetime value we have a customer base that\u2019s certainly staying with us longer, they are doing more cross shopping and you know they are getting benefits of prime that we\u2019re offering that we continue to you know add to and then we still have a very good customer base that\u2019s non-prime, you know the you mentioned that the threshold change we did change with different thresholds in various geographies around the world for super saved shipment, or super saver delivery in those geographies and the key to U.S. we have had the $25 threshold for over 10 years and we changed 35 and during this time frame we have certainly increased our selection that\u2019s eligible for that you know by millions items and certainly as you would know you know during this you know rather once the time frame transportation cost and fuel prices have changed them significantly over that time period so we had changed it. So we just thought that was the right thing to do.","","Operator","And we will go next to Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.","","Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets","I want to ask about the North America EGM line, I guess it's the second quarter in a row you have had acceleration when I asked you about it last quarter I think you singled out fashion apparel and consumer staples. But the growth is, the acceleration really seems to be in-line with easing comps. Is there something in there that you indicates that you\u2019re getting real critical mass with your customers in those two particular categories and then just real quickly on the Kiva Robots is there a reason you would call that out? Should that have some sort of material impact overtime on leverage in the fulfillment cost line? Thank you.","","Tom Szkutak","Sure in terms of you know our growth in EGM you highlighted a couple of categories that are growing very nicely, as we mentioned last quarter as well. You know what you\u2019re seeing there and actually the growth is very broad. We have added a lot of unique selection of both our hardline and soft lines categories including consumables and apparently as you mentioned the experience is getting better on the site, unique selection has increased dramatically over the past few year. So, just a number of things they are coming together in those category. So when I look at it, it just seems very broad which we like and you know there is just a lot of new selection with great you know category expansion too over the last several years. So that\u2019s really what you\u2019re seeing there. In terms of Kiva, you know we have launched few FCs you know we think it's an interesting opportunity. I think as I mentioned last quarter this time we\u2019re ahead of the schedule that we had set forth at the time, you know that we joined with Kiva and we\u2019re excited of what we see. It's certainly we will be adding associates certainly overtime in those FCs but this certainly will be productivity with Kiva and you know we will have to stay tuned to see what that looks like but we\u2019re certainly excited about that opportunity and the roll-up.","","Operator","And we will go next to Victor Anthony with Topeka Capital Markets.","","Victor Anthony - Topeka Capital Markets","So RC [ph] is a metric you\u2019ve highlighted each quarter it's hardly around 20%, 30%, 40% range throughout the quarter in 2010, 2011. It's obviously been depressive over the past several year and half due to investments. Maybe you can help us with the timing of when you expect ROIC to return to levels so in 2011 and second you\u2019re investing a lot in video content for prime instant video, are there any (indiscernible) you can share in terms of conversions from different devices and in the past there has been talk about converting prime into video as a standalone maybe just show your thoughts there, thanks.","","Tom Szkutak","Sure keep in mind when the you know as you mentioned we\u2019re investing you know very heavily in the business. We think that\u2019s the right thing to do, we have a lot of you know good long term opportunities which is why we\u2019re doing it. It is depressing, ROIC. Just keep in mind from a pure metric standpoint just as a reminder will we measure ROIC is free cash flow divided by average invested capital. So total assets might have current liabilities and that\u2019s over 5 point average. And so when you do that first in the numerator, we do have keep in mind it\u2019s about $4 billion in our free cash flow number that relates to the purchase. It goes back to Q4 last year, but it\u2019s entered TTM free cash flow that relates to the purchase of our campus here in Seattle and some nearby lands with $1.4 billion of that. So that\u2019s bringing the free cash flow down.","Also keep in mind in the invested capital, we do include cash and marketable securities, which is certainly the largest piece of our invested capital. We think that\u2019s the right thing to do until we have either deploy that capital or return it in some way, but just to keep in mind that that\u2019s included in the metric. So in terms of Prime video, we are getting great usage from a broad set of customers on Kindle as well as other devices and the adoption is going very well. At this point, we can\u2019t share any specific metrics today, but we like what we see. It certainly \u2013 we think it\u2019s certainly helping the Prime members, the Prime membership increases that you are seeing. And we think it\u2019s interesting and we are investing there. We included in both our Q3 results as well as the Q4 guidance our assumptions around additional content that we will be acquiring including original content, so very excited about that opportunity.","","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Mark May with Citi.","","Mark May - Citi","Thanks for taking my question. The seasonal hiring is I think last year grew about in line with the growth rate in U.S. revenue growth, but this year it looks it\u2019s \u2013 you are growing at about 10 percentage points above the midpoint of your range. Is there anything that\u2019s different this year that is driving that? And then second question on pricing, there have been numerous reports recently and I think for a while now that the multi-channel competitors are competing more fiercely with the Amazon in terms of price parity etcetera, what impact are you seeing or do you think you could see from that and sort of how are you addressing it? Thanks.","","Tom Szkutak","In terms of the seasonal employees, unfortunately, there is not a lot I can add to that. We are getting ready for an exciting holiday season and that includes making sure that we have the right amount of employees as well as seasonal help during that period. It also includes making sure we have the right capacity in place, making sure we have had a lot of selection in the past couple of years and particularly over the past 12 months and making sure that we have good in-stock levels related to that selection. We are making sure that we have people to help us with not only serving customers with our retail inventory, but also are fulfilled by Amazon grown certainly very strongly over the past year and that impacts the capacity and a number of employees that you see there. So that\u2019s what you are seeing in that number.","In terms of pricing, we operate in a very competitive arena. That\u2019s something that\u2019s new, that\u2019s something that we have been doing since our inception. We have many, many different competitors. You will pass those competitors on your way to work, on the way home. They are offline, they are online. It\u2019s a very competitive marketplace. It\u2019s something \u2013 pricing is something that we worked very hard at over the years. We want to make sure we have great values for customers and something that we spend a lot of time on and work very hard to make sure that we can offer that to customers. So I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s done anything. It\u2019s something that we have been dealing with since our inception, but it is a very competitive environment.","","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Carlos Kirjner with Sanford Bernstein.","","Carlos Kirjner - Sanford Bernstein","Two quick questions, first how do you see your competitive position versus Alibaba in China and what gives you confidence that you\u2019ve a chance of being a relevant player there even in the long term and secondly in the U.S. you\u2019ve a service similar to subscription video-on-demand which is feature applying which is Amazon Prime Video. While in Europe you\u2019ve a full blown spend alone service with (indiscernible). Why is your strategy in Europe so different from the strategy in the U.S. when it comes to video-on-demand? Thank you.","","Tom Szkutak","You know in terms of China it's very early there, there is certainly a room for many winners and it's a very large segment and you know we have seen we have good business there in terms of top-line it's growing and we will continue to look for ways to make sure that we satisfy customer demand. We work on a lot of the same inputs, we work on our other geographies, make sure we have great prices, good selection, speed of delivery, we work very hard in terms of putting in a lot of capacity close to our customers and so are the things that we\u2019re working on and try to ensure success there. In terms of individual competitors you know we have a long standing practice of not let other companies but again there is room for a lot of winners and in terms of you know video content is not a lot. I can you know add to that question I apologize but certainly we had being ramping up our content in the U.S. on Amazon.com as part of Amazon Prime It's something that we have been you know looking at very carefully. We like what we see so far and we think it's interesting but beyond that I can\u2019t speculate where we might do or might not do another location.","","Operator","We will go next to Mark Miller with William Blair.","","Mark Miller - William Blair","On AmazonFresh can you comment on what you\u2019re seeing in LA versus the Seattle test, how important is the attachment rate with general merchandise and then as you\u2019re making more frequent deliveries are you finding that is driving higher sales of general merchandise?","","Tom Szkutak","It's very, very early in LA so there is not what we see so far what we would like, we\u2019re having a lot of selection there on behalf of our customers. It is a great opportunity for customers to get both a number of different items through AmazonFresh and so we\u2019re excited. We like you know the trials that we have done have been very good, the conversion has been good. We look forward even improving that experience even more overtime for customers but it's very early but we like what we see which I will stay tuned on that one.","","Mark Miller - William Blair","And general merchandise?","","Tom Szkutak","I\u2019m sorry?","","Mark Miller - William Blair","Are you selling more general merchandise as a result of more frequent deliveries in that market?","","Tom Szkutak","Yes.","","Operator","We will go next to Kerry Rice with Needham & Company.","","Kerry Rice - Needham & Company","I just wanted to ask a question on your acquisition of TenMarks which is really diving a little bit deeper into that cap market. I know you sell and rent the text books. Can you talk a little bit maybe what you\u2019re strategy is there?","","Tom Szkutak","You know it's a company that\u2019s doing some interesting things about helping you know students and children learn math. We thought it was an interesting fit for us and you know we look forward to exploring what opportunities we can do together there and you\u2019ve to stay tuned on that one but we think it's doing a very nice job and we\u2019re very excited to have them as part of the Amazon business.","","Operator","We will go next to Scott Tilghman with B. Riley.","","Scott Tilghman - B. Riley & Co","Just wanted to touch on the North America segment margins for a little bit. We have seen some pretty good progress there in terms of year-over-year improvement, you know little bit of back step last quarter but not too much and the categories fell back. I am just kind of wondering if there is anything unusual in there in terms of timing or investments that maybe called out and how should we think about it \u2013 that over the next few quarters?","","Tom Szkutak","Sure. In terms of Q3 specifically, Q3 just because of the \u2013 as I would call it the Q4 readiness, the seasonal readiness, you see this often in Q3 where both our total and our segment operating profit is lower than other quarters. And that\u2019s certainly what you are seeing in Q3 in North America. So that\u2019s in terms of the investments we are making to get ready for the season we talked about. You start and just quote the capacity that we are adding certainly in multiple geographies, but certainly in the North America it is impacting that as well. You can see it in our fulfillment line item as a percentage of revenue being up. You can see it in our techno content, so we are certainly investing. The other part two that I mentioned earlier is we are investing in video content for Prime in the U.S. And you see that has certainly in those results as well.","","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Tom Forte with Telsey.","","Tom Forte - Telsey","Great. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to know where you stand. Last year, I think you added 20 fulfillment centers on a full year basis and then last time you gave us an update, I think this year it was 5 U.S. and a handful international. I wanted to know where you stood on that and why the change versus last year? And then also very quickly, I want to see where you stood or how you felt about your Amazon Locker initiative? Thank you.","","Tom Szkutak","Sure. In terms of fulfillment centers, it\u2019s \u2013 the number is seven, but it\u2019s a net number. And so included in that are several consolidations, we are building generally larger FCs and we are consolidating some of those. So that\u2019s a net seven. And so what that means is if you were to take that as a percentage of our total fulfillment centers, you certainly a get number that\u2019s less than square footage that we are actually adding. So we are adding square footage that would be significantly higher than that. In terms of lockers, it\u2019s early \u2013 it\u2019s another way to get closer to customers to make it convenient for customers. And it\u2019s interesting we have it in a few different geographies right now. And but it is limited, we don\u2019t have it broadly across our full network and so something that we are learning. And it\u2019s an interesting experience and it\u2019s certainly something that over time we will continue to take a closer look at and certainly expand if it makes sense to do so on behalf of customers.","","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.","","Douglas Anmuth - JPMorgan","Great, thanks for taking the question. Just want to ask two things. First, Tom, can you give us some color on where you are in the shift from third-party to first-party e-books and how much of the factor that\u2019s been in reaccelerating media revenue, you have seen reacceleration in media in the last three quarters, I think in North America? And then secondly, it looks like there is six fewer shopping days this holiday season between Black Friday and Christmas, just curious what you do with anything differently to prepare for that and do you think that could actually even drive more holiday shopping online? Thanks.","","Tom Szkutak","Sure. In terms of your second one, second question, there are fewer days. There is not a lot that we do different. We certainly see when that happens. And there is some behavioral differences on behalf of customers just because of the shorter time period that we have certainly some more sizable days during that period, but there is not a lot to add to that. In terms of the transition for e-books, in terms of our total growth across Amazon both North America total, our global total, it\u2019s not a significant or meaningful impact to the overall growth rates and certainly this transition has been going on for you know some number of quarters now so it's not a lot I can help you with there.","","Operator","We will go next to Greg Melich with ISI Group.","","Greg Melich - ISI Group","I want to dig into the inventory a little bit. It looks like the growth slowed to 20% but the sales accelerated. Can you give us some insight as to why that is and maybe which category have outperformed in the quarter?","","Tom Szkutak","Sure. I would look at it more from turns perspective and if you look at it more over you know an average turns basis it has gone down and the reason is unique selection, we keep having growth in unique selection it has increased over the past year and stock levels have gotten better and so those are things that are really driving it. In terms of endpoints or any particular quarter you know they can be a little bit lumpy but I would look to the turns.","","Operator","We will go next to John Blackledge with Cowen and Company.","","John Blackledge - Cowen and Company","Two questions, first into the priorities offered one day or same day delivery at some point, there is something better there you\u2019re offering same day deliver in large markets for certain brick and mortar retailers. And then secondly can you talk about the prospects for login and pay program, how many online merchants have signed up for it and what is Amazon getting out of it economically and\/or from getting may be getting data out of purchases? Thank you.","","Tom Szkutak","In terms of speed of delivery whether be it one day or same day, you know what\u2019s happened certainly over the past 10 plus years is we have added a lot of selection. We have added fulfillment centers as a result of that we have selection that\u2019s by default you know increased amount of selection that\u2019s closer to customers. As a result of that our speed of delivery has improved and you know certainly for prime customers you know depending upon the geography in the case of U.S. you know express two day shipping for free and then for small fees they can certainly get faster than that. That\u2019s something that you know as you have seen that improvement you know gradually over the past 10 plus years, you\u2019ve seen it, it has certainly gotten even better over the last few years as we have you know rapidly increased the number of fulfillment centers. So that\u2019s something that we think it's important and we will continue to work on behalf of customers to give them those options and to make sure that you know they get product when they want it. In terms of login and pay you know it's something that we think is interesting, you know because of our large customer base and you know the credentials that we have and the secure payments that we have we think it's an interesting opportunity and we think there is certainly interesting ways to monetize that overtime and but again we think it's an interesting opportunity.","","Operator","We will go next to Ron Josey with JMP Securities.","","Ron Josey - JMP Securities","I wanted to talk new international markets and specifically I think Amazon India was called out given 10 new category launches in the past 120 days or so. So my question related to really the infrastructure in India and how good is it, and to so that Amazon can continue to grow there and in specifically if other countries can follow a model like this and you know Brazil comes to mind. Thank you.","","Tom Szkutak","Sure. We have a few different models in India and we from a marketplace model which we offer fulfilled by Amazon which as you mentioned certainly the infrastructure is not as advanced as in some geographies but we also view it as an opportunity and we\u2019re happy to help sellers fulfill it by Amazon. So it's an interesting opportunity, it's very, very early. We\u2019re in investment mode there, it's a long term opportunity but that\u2019s a very exciting opportunity. We were very strong team that\u2019s working on that opportunity. So we are excited about it.","","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Brian Pitz with Jefferies.","","Brian Pitz - Jefferies","Great, thanks. Maybe you could comment on what you are seeing domestically and internationally in terms of e-commerce trends in the current quarter, anything specific standout, especially North America given some of the mix commentary we have heard from some of your competitors? And then just some additional comments if you could on growth in the other revenue category, specifically on AWS and\/or your advertising business? Thanks.","","Tom Szkutak","Sure. I\u2019ll take the second one first. In terms of AWS, it\u2019s growing very, very strong. It\u2019s an area that\u2019s very early for us. It\u2019s growing very, very strong. We have a great team that\u2019s working on it, servicing customers and we are very excited about the long-term opportunity. In terms of you have mentioned the trends in the North America, what you have seen is really a nice steady acceleration of growth since Q4 last year. So if you look back to Q4 last year for North America specifically and you just stress that back over the past four quarters, you are seeing a really nice sequential increase from quarter-to-quarter. And again that gets back to went from 23% in Q4 last year to 26% to 30% and 31% versus the year-over-year increases by quarter for North America revenue. And a lot of this what we talked about earlier, it\u2019s focused on a lot of the retail basics as well as also improving seller performance as well. And so those are the things that are driving it.","","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Jordan Rohan with Stifel Nicolaus.","","Jordan Rohan - Stifel Nicolaus","Thank you so much. A follow-up to the last question on U.S., in particular, did you see any weakness or any discernible trends around the government shutdown in August, politics going on in Washington in September and early October? And separately, can you talk about what you are learning from being an investor in living social with the accounting charges aside. Can you talk about your own local business how it may compete with other players in the space and all of the various initiatives you have with, what can be learned from what you know at this point you are no longer a new investor in that company? Thank you.","","Tom Szkutak","In terms of North America growth other than what I mentioned on the quarterly growth, Q3 was strong. It was 31% growth. Again, we see the nice steady increase over the past four quarters that the overlap in the quarter from Q3 of last year that was 33%. So again, we like we see some growth perspectives in Q3 for North America. In terms of total growth, given the wide range for Q4 and that reflects our view for Q4, but we are excited about the quarter and about getting ready for customers during this heavy seasonal quarter. So we are excited about what we see there. In terms of living social, there is really not a lot I can add to your question, I apologize. They are doing a good job in terms of local. And we also have a local offering on Amazon. Team is very dedicated to make that work and it\u2019s an interesting area we are learning, but it\u2019s early.","","Operator","Our final question will come from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.","","Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs","Great, thank you. When you look at the deceleration in growth in North America and other revenue, I mean, obviously it\u2019s still at a very high level, but when we are thinking about the major component to that line, AWS, advertising, credit card relationship, is there anything relevant to the relative growth rates between those components that we should be thinking about?","","Tom Szkutak","I am not sure how to answer your question. It is, the only part I would call out you mentioned is a number of different items that are in there. Certainly the largest and you know fastest growing largest area by far is AWS and it's growing very nicely and that certainly reflected in that line item.","","Sean Boyle","Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions.

After the presentation we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Darin Manney. Please go ahead.","Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.","Hello, and welcome to our Q3 2016 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you which includes our financial results as well as metric and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2015.","Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's view as of today, October 27, 2016, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.","During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which are posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.","Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal segments. It is not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.","With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","At this time, we will now open up the call for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please state your question.","Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the question. The International retail segment margin was the lowest we've seen in quite a while. I was hoping you could provide some of the key drivers there in terms of the drag and any color on how to think about the incremental international investment that might be impacting the 4Q guide. Thanks.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Sure. Thanks, Doug. Yes, specifically to International, we are seeing expansion to support selection, expansion at fulfillment network increases. We're also investing in digital content and additional Prime benefits, fresh location Prime Now. But by far the biggest individual thing is the investment in India that we continue to make and very excited about it, the initial reaction in India from both the customers and also sellers. So that is essentially the International margin guidance in Q4.","Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","Eugene Charles Munster - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. Thanks. I guess when we think about the progression of margins in the second half versus the second half of 2015 and kind of the flat-lining of overall margin at this point excluding AWS, I guess should we think about this as being a temporary kind of plateau that will at some point resume once you start leveraging the fulfillment build-out? Or is there something structurally or philosophically changing with the way that you operate your business? Thanks.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Yes. Thanks, Gene. Well we will continue to invest in the business where we are seeing significant customer traction. And the things I'm about to mention fall into that category. But the largest individual reasons for the ramp-up in investment between first half and second half of this year and also second half of this year versus second half of last year are the things I mentioned on the call last quarter.","First, video content and marketing associated with that is nearly doubling year-over-year in the second half of the year. And it continues to be a large increase both Q3 and Q4. In the quarter, in Q3 we added 18 fulfillment centers and we've added five more in October. For the year we'll add 26. Most of those are in North America but that compares to 14 last year and I would look, looking back the last time we had double-digit increase in fulfillment centers was in 2012 when we added 11 in the third quarter.","So it was a rare aggregation of startups in Q3 and into Q4 that's helping us position better for Q4 volumes. Because paid unit growth continues to be strong and Amazon fulfilled unit growth which includes what we ship, includes FBA, is significantly higher than even that. So we continue to build for high AFN, or Amazon Fulfilled Network demand, including both retail and FBA. The number of warehouses that we added represents a 30% increase in square footage year-over-year. Last year we increased square footage by just under 20%. The definition of square footage in this case is all of our warehouses plus our sortation and delivery centers. So it's pretty much our customer service centers. So it's pretty much our full square footage that supports operation.","So those will dissipate as as they burn in. We've talked about fulfillment centers' initial startup costs include increase in fixed costs but also variable cost as we train workers and also bring in inventory. And there's a number of transportation costs also related to the startup of a new fulfillment center, both inbound and outbound. And they're inherently less efficient than more established mature buildings, so there will be a cycle where those will be more productive next year than they are this year and more productive in 2018 than they are in 2017.","So what you're seeing essentially in the second half of this year is a step-up investment primarily around digital content and also the fulfillment center investment, but also things like Echo and Alexa which we're adding a lot of resources to, India and AWS as we add people there to support additional service, think (7:54) rapid growth in that business.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking my question and I have two. The first one, just to go back, Brian, to the fulfillment build. In the past, I think you've talked about how it takes time to kind of get the fulfillment centers to peak efficiencies, so with these new FCs opening, could you just talk about it? Have you become more efficient so if you get into a lower volume quarter next year, there's less risk of deleverage? Or should we still kind of think about it's going to take time to get to up to peak efficiency?","And then the second one, AWS. Amazon is a company that is very good at removing friction in the purchase process. Could you just talk about some of the main hurdles you still have to overcome for large enterprises to really start using AWS more? Thanks.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Sure. So the fulfillment network as we built it, yes, they'll be more productive next year than they are this holiday peak and probably even more productive in 2018. So I can't forecast it for you into next year quite yet, but we certainly had productivity add additional cost to Q3 and even into Q4 of this year as we build the additional capacity. Again, the underlying reason for that capacity build is the strength in paid units and even more so in the units that we're fulfilling driven by our FBA program. The FBA program is a key pillar of our Prime offering. It adds selection. It makes Prime stronger and then that's a self-reinforcing where Prime then \u2013 the Prime success attract mores sellers. So we're glad to have that problem. We are just working very hard to get capacity in place and in productive use for Q4 and beyond.","Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.","Hi Brian. This is Darin. On the AWS question, yeah, we continue to invest in AWS on behalf of our customers in addition to the technologies that make integrations easier that helps companies move from an on-prem or a hybrid IT environment into AWS. So we're going to continue to do that, specifically things like the database migration tool that are helpful for customers when they move production databases from on premises to the cloud with virtually no downtime.","And also many of our AWS customers are beginning to choose and continue to choose the AWS Schema Conversion Tool which really switches database engines to get out of old guard proprietary databases and onto AWS. And so we'll continue to react to customer needs and that will include opening up new regions. We've opened up Ohio this past quarter and we've highlighted that we'll have another number of regions coming online in a few months. So yeah, were doing a lot of things to help make it easier for all customers to migrate to AWS.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Hey, Brian. Would you give us any commentary on two categories, in particular groceries and fashion and apparel? And particularly on groceries, I know in the release there's a couple of data points about Fresh rolling out into newer areas like Maryland, great to see that. But could you just talk about that in the investment horizon? Is that moving the needle for you? And how big that, any way to help us quantify how big that already is to the revenue growth that you're seeing, particularly on groceries and any particular comments on fashion and apparel, same line of thinking? Thanks.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Okay. Sure. Thanks, Mark. I will start with Fresh and groceries in general. So yes, this quarter we launched in Northern Virginia, Maryland, Dallas and Chicago. We also launched a new pricing plan which is a monthly $14.99 add-on to Prime in the U.S. and we've expanded, as you know, previously into London. We're very happy with the progression, both in the geographies that we've been in for a long time where we're at, continuing to add zip codes and additional neighborhoods and also in these new cities. Certainly a business where we continue to work on costs and profitability, but we are finding it's a very attractive service to our customers, which is what we're after.","Similarly, but not exactly the same is the Prime Now business, which has similar overlap on things besides groceries. It's a slightly different model obviously where we're more about immediacy and a smaller list of items available in one to two hours. But there's certainly a lot of people who are using that for groceries and consumable items. And that is now up to 40 cities across seven countries versus 17 this time last year. We're also adding restaurant, Amazon Restaurant Delivery to the Prime Now offer in 19 metropolitan cities in the U.S. and that's up from two last year.","So we continue to believe consumables, groceries are a key part of the offer to customers and we are playing with very different models to see which works and for what needs. So we're very happy with the AmazonFresh and we've now expanded quite a bit as you see in this year. And Prime Now, we're also very happy with, although obviously the economics in that business are even tougher, but we do feel that our scale makes that possible because of the geographic footprint and how close we already are to customers.","Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.","Hi, Mark. This is Darin. On fashion, yeah, fashion and apparel continue to be a large part of our EGM business and one that we're very excited about. We continue to make it easier for brands and manufacturers to come on board in that category. We continue to work with brands to come on board and we're happy with the traction we're seeing with those brands. And as we get more and more selection, we're really pleased with the customer engagement that we have there, both from the discoverability, the technology that goes behind making it easier to shop for fashion on our site as well as the increased selection by adding the brands.","Operator","Thank -","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Sorry. To answer your question about was that part of investment. Yes, this is certainly part of our investment but the large ramp, if you will, in investment that we're seeing from the back end of last year and also the first half of this year is more related to digital content and the build in our fulfillment network, which I've already discussed.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks a lot. In some of these incremental investment areas like warehouses, logistics and also content, I know in some cases you expense up front. In some cases you amortize over time. Just wondering if you could give us a sense of how much of the recent step-up is kind of being expensed. I'm particularly looking at your COGS as a percent of retail revenues which was up year-on-year for the first time in quite a while. How much of that was because of content that was expensed in the period? Just trying to kind of better understand that.","And I think also you've been changing around, and this is happening here shortly, FBA pricing including increasing your storage fees but also reducing your handling fees. I guess the question is, are these changes designed to just pass through kind of increasing shipping costs? Or is this more of a net-neutral change where really the goal is to try to free up capacity in some of your facilities? Thanks.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Let me start with your second question on FBA. So yes, we did make some changes to the pricing formula for this holiday season. They're essentially meant to incent the right behavior among sellers around holiday. And the biggest issue you're trying to get at is having the most valuable products for holiday in the warehouse in the Prime space and not having the warehouse filled with things that may not sell until after the New Year. So we are trying to incentivize that behavior. We're also trying to incentivize getting inventory into the warehouse quicker. So yes, the formulas were, or excuse me, the changing to the pricing formulas were really with that in mind to help the flow and the base utilization in Q4.","Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.","Yeah, hi Mark. This is Darin. On the capitalization point, I'd say the things we capitalized are the core buildings and leasehold improvements in the buildings. But the things that we're seeing hit the P&L are the fixed and variable expenses that it takes to run the building and I think that's what Brian's pointing out most pointedly in terms of what is impacting the profitability of the second half. So yeah, the capitalization's relatively small in terms of, other than in the building itself.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed with your question.","Youssef Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Yes. Thank you very much. Two quick questions. With the step-up in investments in content from Prime Video that you mentioned before, would you also be stepping up the international expansion? Maybe you can just remind us how many countries you're in with Prime Video and whether there is a potential chance of maybe stripping Prime Video from Prime to allow it to be extended to other countries.","And then I know you're not guiding to 2017. But just looking at the capacity increases that you've had for FCs for 2016, should we expect kind of that as an ongoing expense going forward? Or is the current buildup enough to maybe give you some spare capacity to cool that down for 2017? Thanks.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Sure. So first on your video comment. We're in four countries right now, the U.S., UK, Germany and Japan. And we have stated that we will be in India soon. So the content that we are creating, especially through Amazon Studios, we are generally holding the worldwide rights to and can use that in other countries as well. And the cost of that then gets amortized to those countries. It becomes part of the International segment results. So yes, and we consider that to be very valuable as opposed to, versus licensing many times by country, the third-party rights to content that we don't create ourselves.","Your question on fulfillment expenses, I can't extend the guidance into next year. We will do that obviously at the end of next quarter. But I would say this was an extraordinary step up, as I mentioned, in Q3 that is tied to very rapid growth in not only paid units but Amazon fulfilled units. So really, our forecast for additional capacity additions and the rate of additions will be tied to those growth factors as well. So we'll have to see. We right now are working on getting the capacity in. It was very lumpy this time with 18 warehouses in one quarter and another five in the first three weeks of the next quarter. So ,and obviously we'll be working on the efficiencies of all the warehouses we have, including the ones we just started up this year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird Equity Research. Please proceed with your question.","Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks. A follow-up on the FC question, and I guess more specifically it sounds like you have enough capacity in terms of fulfillment centers for the holidays, but also wondering what your comfort level is in terms of your shipping partners to manage those deliveries. And then secondly, was wondering how you would characterize the pricing environment for AWS, in particular with more deep-pocketed competitors in the space now. Google in fact highlighted this on their conference call today. Thank you.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Sure. Let me start with transportation. So yeah, we looking forward to a great holiday and that includes working with our shipping partners both in the U.S. and globally. We've worked very closely with them to line up capacity, share capacity plans. We certainly have additional delivery capability of our own. But with all of our partners, we work well in advance of the holiday to get our plans in place. And we feel very confident. We're looking forward to a great holiday not only for customers but also for sellers.","On your question on AWS, I didn't listen to the Google call, but you'll have to fill me in on that later. The thing I can tell you about pricing is that our pricing is, price reductions are a core part of our philosophy, of course. We had a price decrease in Q3, and that was our 52nd since we started this business. So we are comfortable with price decreases. Not only did we lower the prices of our products but we also create new services that are cheaper that customers can switch to. So they can also benefit from that as well.","So if you step back and say why do people choose AWS, I'll give you the points I said last quarter. Basically what we hear are the functionality and pace of innovation is greater than our competition. We have added more new significant features and services this year already than we had all of last year when we added 722. We have a partner and customer ecosystem. You've read about the VMware deal that we signed this quarter. So we continue to extend with partners and build ecosystems that better can support customers. And finally experience. We've been in this business a long time, longer than anyone else, and we've used that time to make our products and services better. So there was going to be a lot of winners in this space as we said, but we are very happy with our position and the customer reception to our products.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you. I guess when you look at fourth quarter guidance and you back out AWS, it suggests that margins are, on the core business, are going to be pretty down versus last year. Do you view this as a abnormal investment cycle, or just part of the overall kind of ebbs and flows of the business? And then long-term, I know several years ago you talked about maybe high single digit, low double digit margins long term. I wonder if you could refresh us on that, and also just let us know if you think International has structural margin differences than the U.S. in the core retail business. Thank you.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Sure. Yes. As far as the continuation of the investment into next year, I cannot give you much color on that today. What I can tell you again is that we've ramped up considerably. We've been investing quite openly in a lot of areas and continue to do so. We are experiencing a ramp-up, if you will, in the second half of this year particularly tied again to AWS, or excuse me, the fulfillment center spend and also the video content spend.","So we will continue to invest in video content. We'll continue to invest in fulfillment space to handle higher and higher paid unit volumes and shipped unit volumes. We'll continue to invest in things that we believe enhance the customer experience, particularly the Prime experience. Devices, we'll continue to invest in as particularly Alexa and the Echo products. We'll continue to invest in getting faster and faster shipping methods for our consumers. We believe that's working. We're very happy with the results. We're very happy with all the customers we have but particularly the Prime customers that we have.","As far as long-term operating margins, I can't forecast that right now. I can't forecast that for our AWS business either. We are again working on two fronts. We are honing the businesses that we're in and making them as efficient, as profitable as possible while also investing very pointedly and very wisely, we believe, in things that will enhance customer experience and create lasting businesses for us down the line. We've said we want things that customers will love, can grow to be large, will have strong financial returns and durable and can last for decades. So that's still our mission. We have pillars of the business right now with Marketplace, AWS and Prime and we're actively looking for a fourth and fifth pillar.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. I was just wondering, there have obviously been some headlines since the call that you did earlier with the press on the scale of this investment cycle relative to other investment cycles that you've been through. With the 2014 cycle sort of being the most recent, could you quantify a little bit more how you would compare this investment cycle to that most recent one? And to the extent that we are in the midst of this investment cycle, would you say we're in sort of the earlier or later stages? Any sort of clarity around that would be useful. Thank you.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Sure. Yes. The word cycle, if I mentioned that, was a omission. It was a mis-speak. The investment that we are seeing is a step-up versus what we have experienced in particularly the first half of this year and the last half, the second half of last year which I mentioned. But we have said investments are going to be lumpy. They are going to be high sometimes and they'll be moderated at other times. We are right now, the second half of this year looks like a big step-up compared to the first half and it is. But again, it's all areas that we will continue to invest in, some of which I just actually went through the laundry list. So I would not characterize it as a cycle. I would characterize it as continued investments. We make investments with the idea that they are going to pay off and they pay off in either directly in the business they're in or in their contribution to the total business many times as a part of the Prime program.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Blackledge with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.","John Blackledge - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks, just two questions. It seems you're increasing your efforts in the auto vertical with the recent launch of Amazon Vehicles. Just wondering if you could discuss some of the dynamics of the auto industry that make it attractive and maybe how it aligns with the Prime value prop. And also wondering if you had any plans to work directly with auto shops just given your ability to service most areas in one to two days. And then just the second question, on grocery would you consider physical locations in an effort to kind of expand and\/or accelerate the growth in that vertical? Thank you.","Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.","Yeah, hi John. This is Darin. On vehicles, Amazon Vehicles is really a car research destination and really builds the automotive community for customers and gets information they need when shopping for vehicles offsite or shopping for parts and accessories onsite. The features include research tools, community engagement where you can talk to other customers, and certainly we'll try to build a one-stop shop for vehicles as an extension to the automotive store which engages customers to add information about their cars in their garage and which makes it actually easier to shop for parts and accessories for your particular vehicle. And so we think there's a lot of opportunity there to add convenience for customers. On the B2B side, certainly we do have a Amazon business offering. Businesses of all shapes and sizes can sign up to be a B2B customer and the selection that we have in our parts and in automotive categories are certainly open to that channel, but I wouldn't speculate on anything we might do in a particular vertical for those business customers.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Sure. And your comment on, or question on grocery and physical stores, I can't comment on any rumors or speculations there might be regarding that. But what I will tell you is we have experimented with physical stores. As you may know, we have three physical bookstores, one Seattle, one in San Diego and one in Portland and two more coming, one in Boston and one in Chicago. And what we're finding is they're great places for customers to browse what ends up being a curated selection of books and they also get to try out our devices, which is very beneficial. So they get to touch and try our eReaders, tablets, Fire TV and Echo. So we like what we see with that connection and we also have pop-up stores that you may see and also college pick-up points. So we will try different delivery methods or pick-up points or ways of getting product to customers, but nothing specific to point out on the grocery side right now.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Schachter with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question.","Ben Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Given the low unemployment rates that you're seeing in the U.S., do you expect any unusual impact on wages for seasonal workers this year? And are you seeing overall wage pressure in the fulfillment centers? And then separately, if you could just talk about trend lines you're seeing in paid units versus shipping units. Are they diverging meaningfully versus the past? Thanks.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Yeah, so on wages, nothing to point out for this holiday. Our challenge generally is the volume of head count that we're looking to hire and we work well in advance with agencies to help to get seasonal employees and many of them turn into full-time employees after the holiday. So nothing specific on the wage pressure front. As you probably saw, head count is up 38% year-over-year in Q3 and that is a continuation of a lot of ops roles they're supporting this high demand, the opening of the fulfillment centers we talked about, new Fresh locations, Prime Now. But also a lot of hiring in our tech areas particularly around AWS and also the Echo, Alexa areas.","Ben Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","And the second, the second question?","Operator","Sorry. Go ahead. Okay. And our final question will come from the line of Neil Doshi with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.","Neil A. Doshi - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Can you just provide a little more color into the investments that you're making in India? What's driving that growth and what stage is India in today relative to some of the other large international markets that you've launched in the past?","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Yeah, sure. So we are very encouraged by what we're seeing in India but it is certainly very early on still. Most recent highlights would be the launch of the Prime program in India this past quarter. It's now one of the top selling units based on Amazon.in. And so it's very been very well received by customers. It's hard to compare India to any other country. It's very different in its stage and structure. Being a third-party market has caused a lot of invention on our side. We're being creative. The team there in India has been very creative on whenever they find a roadblock or something that has not existed in another country, they create it themselves, whether that's from delivery stations to working with small merchants to, you name it. So we're very happy with both the customer engagement that we're seeing and also the seller engagement which is very important in India and very pleased with the team that runs it over there and the way they work with teams throughout the world.","Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.","And Brian, to step back to Ben's other question on units. Ben, this is Darin. I will, so you know, paid units grew at 28% again this year as it did in the prior quarter. And as Brian pointed out earlier, our AFN unit, our Amazon fulfilled units, which include our first-party units as well as FBA units that go through our warehouses are continuing, are certainly higher than that 28%. And that's a result of the traction we're getting with our FBA sellers.","Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.","So thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter."],"1474":["Amazon.com, Inc.

Good day, everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com Q4 2019 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded.","For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Shelly Kay Pfeiffer. Please go ahead.","Shelly Kay Pfeiffer","Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2019 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions are Brian Olsavsky, our CFO; and Dave Fildes, Director of Investor Relations. As you listen to today\u2019s conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.","Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2018. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management\u2019s views as of today, January 30, 2020 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially.","Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today\u2019s press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.","During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.","Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we\u2019ve seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.","Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don\u2019t conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements. It\u2019s not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.","With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","At this time, we will now open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions]","Our first question is coming from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Heath Terry","Great. Thanks. Really appreciate this. Just on the AWS business, as you look sort of at the strength that you saw in the quarter particularly represented by the amount of dollars added quarter-over-quarter, is there anything in particular that you would call out either in terms of specific types of workloads, regions, specific customer types, that you felt like drove the strength particularly relative to the directional -- direction of growth that we were seeing in the earlier parts of the year?","Brian Olsavsky","Hi Heath. No, I would not isolate it to any one set of customers or products. I think it's been pretty broad-based, and it's kind of the culmination of a lot of work on adding new products and features, adding to our sales and marketing teams, and having better penetration in enterprise customers and hitting a lot of very different industries.","So, I think that's what you're seeing. We feel that our product set is -- leads the market, and we add to it at a quicker pace than our competition, so actually the gap on capacity and features is growing as we speak.","We also think that there's a real network effect when you use AWS with the millions of active customers and tens of thousands of global partners. And we continue to expand. We're now in 69 availability zones across 22 geographic regions. So, I think it's the combination of increased sales support, more and better products that hit customers' needs, and also the geographic expansion is what you're seeing.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.","Colin Sebastian","Great. Thank you. Was just hoping you guys could disaggregate a bit the strength in seller services, how much of that was third-party marketplace commission specifically? And are you seeing more of an uptick in some of the other content and services? Thank you.","Brian Olsavsky","On seller services, I would say it was just a very strong quarter if that's what you're referring to 31% growth in revenue. It was strong on a unit basis. And as you said, there's probably additional strength in FBA which has higher fee set than MFN does.","So -- but in general, if you step away, I think what you're seeing is more and more participation of third-party sellers in our one-day delivery program as we move through the year. That was particularly strong in Q4, and I think you'll see that more as we move into 2020.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Please proceed.","Justin Post","Great. Thanks. Just wondering if you could go high level, what drove upside to your guidance on revenue in the quarter on the retail side? Anything there that you'd really call out?","And then on the AWS investments, obviously you just talked about investments starting in 3Q. Where are you in that investment? Your margins are still below peak. Where are you kind of in that investment cycle? Thank you.","Brian Olsavsky","Sure. Well, as I said, on revenue we came in at $87.4 billion, which exceeded the high end of our range of $86.5 billion. $400 million of -- roughly $400 million of that was due to foreign exchange, but what we saw was essentially very strong holiday performance from the middle of November on.","We also had a very big uptick in response to the one-day availability that's been building through the year. I think Prime has been very strong. We mentioned that we have more than 150 million paid Prime members globally now. And we mentioned that more people joined Prime in Q4 than any other quarter before.","So, a lot of good momentum there built up on the aggregation of benefits that we continue to add to the Prime program most recently the one-day -- expansion of one-day shipping.","On AWS, where are we in the cycle? I talked more in 2018 when the margins in AWS were closer to 30% about the efficiency of infrastructure spend and -- versus prior years. So, we continue to -- since that point, we've continued to add infrastructure capability and -- to support our global expansion as well.","But what you're seeing probably more in the margins is the expansion of our sales and marketing effort at some of those costs as well as price decreases and longer-term contracts that we've signed with some of our customers.","You notice on our balance sheet that our future commitments on the multiyear deals now stands at $30 billion at year-end, and that's up 54% year-over-year. So, there's a lot of good momentum on the enterprise side as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer & Co. Please proceed.","Jason Helfstein","Thanks. Just to ask about AWS again. I mean, the investors have become, I guess, recently concerned just about again the slowing AWS revenue and margin and whether it's a function of increased competition.","So, maybe just talk about how you're reacting. You did talk about spending on sales and price cuts, but just any more you can talk about the competitive environment? Thank you.","Brian Olsavsky","Sure. I would probably argue a bit with the growth comments. As we see it here, we grew from a $30 billion revenue run rate at the end of 2018 to a $40 billion revenue run rate at the end of 2019. So, we continue to be happy with our top line growth. The -- in dollar terms as opposed to percentages, we had a larger dollar increase in revenue both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. So, we're very happy with the progress of the revenue and our adoption and acceptance by customers.","As far as competitive set is concerned, we -- again, we think that we have -- start with a very big lead in this space because of our many years of investment not only in capacity, but also in services and features that we provide to customers. We've learned from customers.","We just had a great re:Invent conference in December where all of our -- it was a great aggregation of partners and customers and developers. And at those events, we not only get to present our new products and there were over 100 that were launched in December, but we also get to hear customer issues and help -- that helps to sign or educate our forward road map.","So, it's a great shared learning. I think customers react to it. Customers will be at different stages of their adoption curve. There's always different phases: first, moving to the cloud, then organizing on the cloud, and then growing further. So there's a lot of movement.","I said that repeatedly I think in the setting that any -- quarter quarter-to-quarter movement is going to be a little bumpy. But generally, what you're seeing is the convergence of a lot of investment, a lot of operational efficiency, and a lot of innovation on behalf of customers.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Stephen Ju","Okay. So thank you. I wanted to switch it up a little bit. I guess you guys called this out in your press release, but I'm wondering if you could talk about your efforts to get the SMBs and the micro SMBs online in India. What exactly is involved from a practical perspective? Do you need to have door-to-door sales folks? And what can do to reduce friction between logistics payments and some of the other factors there?","And second, what are these SMBs selling? Is it like long-tail inventory? Is it merchandise that you can get to exports to global buyer base? And do you think this could be content that could be exclusive to Amazon? Thank you.","Dave Fildes","Yes Stephen, this is Dave. Thanks for the question. As you said, I think as we mentioned this in the release, we're definitely continuing to improve the experience in India for customers and sellers, excited by some of the response we've seen. We are continuing to invest meaningfully in digitizing those say MSMBs micro-small and medium-sized businesses.","We did pledge to invest $1 billion to help digitize traders and those micro and small businesses across India. And we've got a goal of bringing more than 10 million online by 2025. So, this $1 billion investment will help to enable $10 billion in cumulative Indian exports by 2025.","A lot of different facets to those types of investments, won't go into too much for specifics, but a lot of work being done there. We're also focused on job growth, job creation over there. Since we launched over in India in 2013, we've created over 700,000 direct and indirect jobs. So -- we also recently announced plans to create additional one million jobs in India by 2025.","So, a lot of -- I think innovation, ideas, investment. That team over there continues to do a great job locally of taking a lot of the tenants that we've had at Amazon around innovation building and really run with that over there and done a great job of coming up with some interesting and new services and features that I think are specific to that region.","And hopefully, as we continue to do that, we'll keep identifying areas over in India and tool sets features over in India that we can bring back to other regions to help benefit other sellers and the other websites more broadly.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Brian Nowak","Thanks for taking my question. I have two. Just, the first one Brian, I think on one of the media interviews, you talked about how you're becoming more efficient with one-day and you continue -- with next-day delivery and continue to do so and talked about $1 billion of cost in that current quarter.","Maybe just sort of talk to us about some of the largest qualitative fix in variable costs sort of still associated with one-day and the processes and the opportunities for efficiency to really get that number down as we go throughout 2020. And then, maybe any specific product categories or good categories where you've seen an acceleration in demand from one day that you\u2019d call out?","Brian Olsavsky","Sure. Let me make sure the numbers are understood. We had talked about last year about an initial step up in cost of close to $800 million in the second quarter. We -- that carried into Q3-- was slightly higher in Q3. And then in Q4, last time on this call I mentioned that we estimated Q4 would be $1.5 billion penalty. It was slightly under that despite the higher volumes and revenue growth than was in our guidance.","And looking ahead to Q1, we estimate approximately $1 billion of additional costs year-over-year. And again, in Q2, we'll start to lap this. And that doesn't mean the delta goes to zero. It means that there'll be a step up as we grow and expand on a volume basis and then we'll see where our rates are on actually delivering and fulfilling one day. So, I will keep you posted on our results and guide in the future as to where we see those costs going.","If you look at the efficiency or the -- first the cost, they generally fall into a few buckets. It's obviously transportation where you're building out new transportation modes, you're adding new deliveries. Partners are adding new routes. Many times they start with subscale volumes and you build them out, you get more efficient, you get more volume, more package density and that creates efficiency.","When we started this, again, Q2 of last year, we also had abrupt change to our fulfillment network in that, when it's tuned for two-day delivery on the most part when you move to one-day in a lot of cases, it's advantageous from a cost and transportation standpoint to have that inventory closer to the customer. So, we've -- last year we're in the middle of that transition. We still are as we shift inventory to be more local, it will enable local deliveries to hit shorter cutoff times.","So, that will continue to become more efficient. We do see -- we will have to scale our fulfillment center network further. We grew the square footage for fulfillment and transportation by 15% each of the last two years.","And we'll look ahead and see a step-up in that this year as we start to build more capacity for the one-day. I haven't guided beyond Q1, but that's certainly something that will step up. But we get efficiencies as we learn and grow and handle more one-day volume.","Third area is foregone ship revenue just simply, because we're having free shipment and not charging for it. That unfortunately doesn't leverage, but it -- we do start to lap after a while.","So, I would say that just as we've had other shocks to our warehouse system over the years from going to -- from media to almost every product you can imagine, to having a cycle of increased third-party presence in the FBA program now to one-day, we have a history here where we can look for opportunities to be more efficient and lower the -- any cost penalties as we move forward.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Dan Salmon","Thanks for taking the question guys. Brain, just to follow-up on one-day shipping. You noted that you begin to lap the beginning of the initiative here in the second quarter and that naturally costs can flow up with volumes. But just to be clear with you is the idea here is we anniversary at that sort of incremental expansion of one-day shipping either regionally or certain SKUs is functionally finished. I just want to make sure I understand that properly.","And then just -- we can see the other number reported. Just any color within there on the advertising business. And in particular would love to hear an update just a bit on some of your brand initiatives there. I know that probably wasn't the focus in the holiday season, but it seems to be an important growing part. Thank you.","Brian Olsavsky","Sure. Let me start on the one-day. So, yeah, we do see expansion of the one-day program as we move through the year. We've been expanding since we started this effort in Q2 of last year. Expansion means additional cities, additional routes, additional zip codes.","But more -- I think what you'll see more in 2020 is also an -- more effort internationally, more costs internationally. We have greatly improved our selection of one-day in -- particularly in Europe and Japan.","We started with higher one-day percentage of our shipments in those geographies, but we do have to take steps and are taking steps to increase that. And we expect that to be -- it started to be a little more balanced cost globally as we move into 2020.","Dave Fildes","Yeah, Dan. In terms of your question around brands. We're focused on the certainly brands as an advertising customer set and a lot of focus on providing the products and tools that are going to help customers and really inspire them. So, things that we're really excited about stores, so a brand can customize and curate a multipage store. It allows them to better tell customers who they are share their story.","So, we can help deepen the brand engagement and the customer loyalty through that type of option. Some other things like posts, which helps customers discover products and brands. And it's through a curated feed that features the brand's lifestyle content and it's on a mobile detail page. And there's international expansion in some other areas.","I think broadly with advertising, so much of this is about having -- developing great relationships with these advertisers, because I think they appreciate the fidelity we can provide around shopping outcomes. We're uniquely positioned to do this given our retail business.","On the advertising business, or rather I should say other revenue that line item grew about 41% year-over-year. Advertising is the biggest piece of that. Line item is growing at about the same rate. Advertising revenue is as a subset been growing at about the same rate year-over-year in the fourth quarter than it did in the third quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed.","Eric Sheridan","Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a two part question on AWS if I can. You called out the depreciation change with respect to AWS going forward. Just wanted to better understand some of the decisions that were made on useful life that drove that decision and how to think about that from a modeling perspective going forward?","And then the second part would be what does that mean in terms of the way you're thinking about forward CapEx cycles for the AWS business, if you're assuming useful life is moving out maybe than prior assumptions? Thanks so much.","Brian Olsavsky","Sure. Thanks for bringing that up. So, we as a practice monitor and review, the useful life of our depreciable assets on a regular basis to make sure that our financial statements reflect our best estimate of how long the assets are going to be used in operations. In Q4 -- and we've been looking at it in both the FCs, fulfillment centers and also AWS annually.","As we looked in Q4 of 2019, we believe it's -- there's enough trend now to show that the useful life is exceeding four years. We have been -- for our servers and we had been depreciating them over three years. So, we are going to start depreciating them on a four year basis.","It doesn't unwind any depreciation that's already been booked. It just takes the asset from its current status and extends the depreciation period and then new assets will be put into play will extend out for four years instead of three and we'll continue to revisit this. I do want to point out it's not just an accounting-related change. It's rather a reflection of the work that we've done to make our server capacity last longer.","We've been operating at scale for over 13 years in this business and we continue to refine our software to run more efficiently on the hardware. It then lowers stress and extends the useful life both through servers that we used in the AWS business and also the servers that we use to support our own Amazon businesses.","So -- and despite that we give AWS customers and actually because of this, AWS customers continue to get access to the latest technologies more quickly than ever before. So, we are essentially reflecting the fact that we have gotten better at extending the useful life here and now building that into our financials moving forward.","Yes, you're right. It should also impact our need and our timing of capital. I would say that it's also been part of the reason that we've been able to keep capital relatively under in check the last two years in the infrastructure area. But its $800 -- excuse me $800 million lower depreciation expense in the quarter and it will be consistent. It will change quarter-to-quarter. We will update you. But as you can see in our financial statements, it's about $2.3 billion impact in Q2 2020.","Dave Fildes","Yes. This is Dave. Just kind of on the modeling point too on that the $800 million is in Q1. We do think that the -- for that accounting impact effectively, we expect that that amount will decrease as we go through the year. And it's tech infrastructure assets. So, it's -- I should say the servers are tech infrastructure assets. So, when you think about segments the majority of these relate to the AWS segment.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Please proceed.","Ron Josey","Great. Thanks for taking the question. Brian, I just want to ask a little bit more about the holiday season, given the beat on the top line and see if there's any way to quantify maybe the impact from the shortened holiday shopping season. I mean, it doesn't seem like much just given the better results and in online sales and retail third-party seller services. But is there any way to think about the six less days?","And then also you mentioned last quarter, an impact from the Japanese consumption tax. Any sort of impact? Did that go according to plan or any thoughts there would be helpful? Thank you.","Brian Olsavsky","Yes. First of all on the -- there were two items we discussed last quarter with the Japan consumption tax raising from 8% to 10% effective October 1. The net result was a pull forward of some purchases by Japanese customers into Q3 and also some negative elasticity effects post October 1.","The other item was Diwali timing, the Indian holiday which has a very large swing factor on international revenues is, it moved more into the third quarter this year versus -- in 2019 versus 2018. So, it was a help to Q3 and a penalty to Q4. Those two items impacted the Q4 growth rate negatively by about 300 basis points. That was our estimate and we believe that was the actual outcome.","Dave Fildes","On the international?","Brian Olsavsky","On the international segment excuse me yes. The -- sorry the first question was for the holiday season. Yes, we don't see that as a factor actually. And I mentioned that last call as it wasn't incorporated into our guidance in a negative fashion. The way we look at it and the way we believe it works at least in our business is that customers will have a holiday budget and they will spend it between generally the middle of November.","It's creeping up to the early part of November through the holiday season. And we do see obviously spikes in Black Friday and Cyber Monday and we also see relative tick-up in trends as we get closer to the holiday and for the shipping threshold cutoff.","So, there's a polarization of tends to be a polarization to early shipping -- or excuse me early purchase and late purchases. As far as, the six days that sort of time period between Thanksgiving and the Christmas holiday, we don't see an impact on that. Perhaps it's a bigger issue for stores and foot traffic, but we don't notice it in our business.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Doug Anmuth","Thanks for taking the question. I just want to shift gears to grocery. I know you added Amazon Fresh into Prime kind of removing the previous $14.99 a month component there and putting it into Prime and you talked about the 2,000 U.S. cities and towns with two-hour delivery. Can you just talk about what the early impact there is of bundling kind of Fresh into Prime at this point?","And then just how you're thinking about your grocery strategy as you're positioned now? Thanks.","Brian Olsavsky","Sure. Thanks for your question. So, early results are good. We -- our grocery delivery orders from the combination of Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods Market more than doubled in the fourth quarter year-over-year. So, we believe customers are starting to notice and take advantage of this.","We wanted to take -- we will see where people's tastes and preferences will take them. We are -- whether they go to the store, the Whole Foods Market store, whether they use Prime Now or Amazon delivery for their groceries. Right now, we're really just testing and reacting to the customer demand and the customers' preferences and we'll do so for the foreseeable future.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Mark Mahaney","Okay. Thanks for including me. Then I'll throw off three quick ones. Just talk a little bit more about gross margins in the quarter. You had -- the year-over-year trend was negative last quarter, but it turned reverse and was up this quarter. So, if there are any unusual factors you'd want to call out there.","Second the -- I don't want to read over a lot into your guidance, but every year for the last five years you've always guided to operating profit down sequentially and then you may be delivered better than that, but you always guided down. This year your high end of your range is actually above what you obviously did in the fourth quarter.","Are you just trying to remind people, tell people, educate people on how the mix shift in the business towards AWS and advertising is just changing the profit profile of the business? So, any more color there?","And then last one since Sunday is coming up. I know you talked about the AWS customers and you mentioned the Seattle Seahawks, but what about the 49ers? Thanks.","Brian Olsavsky","Good luck 49ers. I'll get that out there first. Good luck Ken Sachse fan. We're indifferent. Let me start with your second one on -- sorry, the -- start with gross margin.","Dave Fildes","Yes. So, I don't think there's anything too surprising caught there. I think we continue to see some good growth in the third-party business. You saw that accelerate some. We're continuing to see that trend of more FBA sellers signing and taking a larger percentage of the total 3P mix of units that are sold through, so that continues to do well. And as Brian mentioned earlier, we think some of that has to do with the program keeps getting better with faster shipping and whatnot.","We've invested many billions of dollars in that program to make it even better for sellers. AWS had a strong quarter of course so that helps on the gross margin side as well.","And then on transportation I think you saw the outbound shipping costs to grow around 43% year-over-year. So, certainly up a good deal versus the trend line we saw in 2018. But of course that's reflective of one-day and overall relative to our expectations.","As Brian said with the $1.5 billion we guided to it came in a bit under that. So some of that was certainly part of some better-than-expected trends efficiencies. ","Brian Olsavsky","And on the comment on seasonality of guidance and Q1 that -- I think the historic trend of peaking a bit in operating income in Q4 and then stepping down in Q1 has been broken up a little bit as we've had the balance of AWS and some other things.","But if you actually look back to Q1 of last year, it was the highest operating income quarter on record. And that's one of the -- makes a difficult comp this year, because we had the -- if you remember the slowdown in expenditures in 2018 in things like fixed -- adding of headcount, warehouse space, infrastructure costs, not to zero, but like down off of prior investment levels in 2016 and 2017. A lot of that continued -- that cost baseline continued into Q1 of 2019 and it actually was a super-efficient quarter from a cost and profit standpoint.","Q2 of last year, we started to again make larger investments, particularly in one day. And so that's now something that is lapping in Q1 of this year because we didn't really have one-day in Q1 of last year. But -- so I think there's -- it's hard to draw those parallels between quarters anymore.","I will though mention the guidance that we do have the $800 million of lower depreciation from our extension of our server useful lives, which is part of the range that we gave you of $3 billion to $4.2 billion.","Dave Fildes","Thanks for joining us today on the call and for your questions.

After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded.","For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.","Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.","Hello, and welcome to our Q3 2018 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2017.","Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, October 25, 2018 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.","During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.","Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.","Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.","With that, we'll move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you for taking my question. I guess the big one is the deceleration in unit growth or online stores, which are probably related to that. I know it's a tough 3Q comp, but could you comment a little bit about that? And then kind of what initiatives could be most interesting to maybe reaccelerate that over the next couple of years? What categories? Thank you.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Thank you, Justin. Yeah, let me just remind you a couple of things from last year. We had two reactions on our Super Saver Shipping threshold in the first half of the year between February and May. That did spur a lot of unit growth in the second and third quarter. We also have issue with digital content, not an issue, but the fact that digital content is moving to subscriptions, Amazon Music Unlimited and Kindle Unlimited in particular. It's been really popular.","I'll just remind you that the units \u2013 those do not count in our unit totals nor do the units from Whole Foods Market. So, yeah, I would say essentially with that backdrop, we're still very, very encouraged by the demand and the reception from customers on the consumer side. We have Amazon fulfilled units are still growing faster than paid units. 3P is now up to 53% of total paid units.","In-stock is very strong, especially as we head into the holiday period. I think we're well positioned for the holiday. We have over 100 million Prime eligible items that are available for FREE Two-Day Shipping for Prime members. And again, when we're talking about the unit deceleration, a lot of the fastest growing areas, things like subscription services, AWS and advertising are not caught in that metric.","Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.","And, Justin, this is Dave. Just to add on to that. You mentioned the online stores. Just a reminder, there is a little bit of impact from the revenue recognition. So you see the online stores revenue growing about 11% ex-FX, to be higher than that, but for the adoption ad standard. So there's a little bit of a headwind there as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. I was going to also then ask you to drill down a little bit on the international retail business. That seemed to slow down, I guess that whatever, 15% or something year-over-year. Any particularly color? Any markets that would have led to that? Though the comp was tougher, but anything else you'd call out there? Thanks a lot.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Sure. On a year-over-year basis, I think you have to look at two things. We did the Souq acquisition last year in May. So the full pickup on that year-over-year was in 2017 and now we're lapping that. There's also material change in the Diwali calendar in India. About half of our Diwali sales last year were in Q3. This year they'll be fully in Q4. So those are a couple factors that hit the international growth area in particularly.","But I also point out that we launched Turkey in the quarter and now we have 17 Amazon websites globally. So we're still very pleased again with the international business, continue to invest in Prime benefits, international expansion as I just mentioned, and we're still seeing very good pickup. Story is different country-by-country obviously. Some are much further along than others, but overall we're very happy. India, although Diwali moved into Q4, so far that's going really well. We've seen great response from customers. We've had 60% growth in new customers during the period. Orders are coming in from 99% of the pin codes in the country. So, great first wave of the, what we call the Amazon's Great Indian Festival, which lead into Diwali.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the question. You had significant operating income upside in 3Q relative to your guide. Can you just talk about the biggest drivers there in terms of outperformance? And then when you think about your 4Q outlook, how should we think about the minimum wage increase that you've talked about? And then any other one-time or special items that might be weighing on that operating income outlook? Thanks.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Sure. Let me start with Q3 and this will be commentary pretty much on the whole year that was especially true in Q4. So, first of all, we've had very strong growth in some very profitable businesses that we have, most notably AWS and advertising. But we've also had great cost performance this year in three specific areas I'll call out. So, first on head count. If you'll remember, we grew head count 48% in 2016 and 38% last year, if you adjust for Whole Foods. With Whole Foods, it was 66%, but without Whole Foods we still grew 38%.","We have looked to really leverage our investment from the last couple years and as we've funded and moved, invested in a lot of new areas as we've talked about, AWS, devices, digital content, we've had a lot of movement within the company that has filled a lot of those roles. So we're only up 13% on head count through nine months year-over-year. So a real step down in that. Again, the theme here is going to be banking some of the investments from prior years and looking to gain greater control.","In our fulfillment center world, we had grown square footage for our fulfillment center and shipping areas by over 30% the last two years, 2016 and 2017. I've talked about that in prior calls. Making that investment to match up with very strong Fulfilled by Amazon demand and AFN or Amazon Fulfilled Network units that are growing at a faster rate than our paid units.","This year we're only adding about 15% to our square footage. So again, getting better efficiencies on what we have and banking the multi-year investment that we've been making. And the last one, which is really significant, is on the infrastructure side. You see the operating margin for AWS is up to 31% this quarter. A lot of that is based on efficiencies of our data centers, not only for the AWS business, they're also for our Amazon consumer businesses, who is AWS' biggest customer.","If you look at capital leases, which is where we spend money for the data centers, it's up only 9% year-over-year, trailing 12 months, and it was up 69% last year, at the end of the year. So those three areas have driven a lot of the cost performance and a lot of the deviation from probably the estimates that I've come up with this year. So we are really happy that again we're seeing great cost performance in a number of areas across the business.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi. Please proceed.","Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you. Question on AWS. Obviously in the last few quarters, you've seen accelerating revenue growth. This quarter, 46%, still quite strong, but dollar and percentage growth did slow. I'm just kind of curious are you just reaching a point in terms of a lot of large numbers where it will be more difficult to sustain not only accelerating growth, but sustain kind of the 40-plus-percent growth levels where we've been recently? Or was there something also going on kind of in the quarter that maybe drove that? Thanks.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Yeah, thanks for your question. This growth rate is going to bounce around. We've had sequential increase in growth rate the prior three quarters, I believe, it was. This quarter is slightly down, but still 46% growth is very strong. We are at an annualized run rate above $26 billion and that was about $18 billion this time last year. So we're very happy with the growth in the business, the momentum that we're seeing with enterprise customers. And we just mentioned on the cost side, it's been a very good year from gaining greater efficiencies in our infrastructure costs.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, the fourth quarter revenue guide and the fourth quarter revenue deceleration. Maybe can you just help us understand a little bit any of the specific categories or countries that have been the largest contributors to revenue growth throughout the course of this year? And which of those are really slowing down sort of driving this potential deceleration that you're guiding to?","Then the second one, you've applied robotics to the warehouses now around Kiva. Curious for your thoughts about the need or desire to invest in autonomous driving technologies to think about some of the other retailers partnering with Waymo and other players, et cetera.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Sure. Let me talk about guidance. So our guidance for the fourth quarter implies 10% to 20% growth and includes an 80-basis point unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. I wouldn't point to any specific country. Once you adjust for the fact that Whole Foods, it was purchased in August of last year and that has impacted every quarter since then, Q4 will be the first solid non-Whole Foods comp since before we bought them since Q2 of last year.","So if you, even factoring that, and we're looking at Q4 and we have very high error bars on the quarter. Much of our, not only our revenue for the quarter, but also for the year comes in that very tight window between middle of November and the end of the year. So it's always a very difficult period for us to estimate. What I would say is that we feel like we're in great shape for the holiday. The warehouses are very clean. We feel like we're going to have great capacity not only for retail products but also for FBA. We're going to have great capacity for shipping to our customers. So we're very ready to go. Selection should be at its highest point, especially for Prime members. So we're very bullish on the fourth quarter. And we'll just have to see how revenue comes in.","I will say there's one housekeeping item on Prime revenue recognition that you should be aware of and may remember from prior quarters. This year, we took Prime subscription revenue and amortized it over the quarters on a straight line method. Previously, we had done it on a, is tilted more to Q4. It's based more on shipping units. So what you've seen is a push of revenue and income from Q4 into Q1, 2 and 3 that we've mentioned on each call.","This is the quarter where that will reverse. That is to scale it for you. Under the old methodology we would have had $300 million more of both revenue and operating income in the quarter. That has again been caught up for in prior quarters, but again not a huge factor on the growth rate for revenue, but just another item to consider.","On the Robotics, I don't have much to say on autonomous driving. We are putting most of our efforts right now, continue to into our Robotics program. We think it's been a great addition to our fulfillment capacity. It makes the jobs in our warehouse that much better. It makes the people around the robots that much more productive. It allows us to have much greater density of product storage and a number of other benefits. It has some additional capital intensity, but it has good return on invested capital from our standpoint.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed.","Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the question. With a lot of offline retailers talking more about omni-channel, wanted to understand sort of the investments you might be making around unifying the efforts with Whole Foods and Amazon Prime Now, speeding up delivery, giving consumers as much choice as possible and moving SKUs closer to households. How should we be thinking about that push in 2019 and 2020 and how that might open up new areas of wallet share for the company? Thanks guys.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Sure. Yeah, I think we've started to show our strategy on the Whole Foods side. You'll see even this quarter we started to have greater expansion of our grocery delivery out of Whole Foods using Prime Now. We're now in 60 cities in the U.S., giving customers delivery in as fast as an hour on thousands of great organic products from Whole Foods.","We've also expanded grocery pickup and that's available in 10 cities. So the customers can pick up at the Whole Foods store. You'll see that we've started to tie Whole Foods into Alexa. You can build your cart using Alexa and then check out using the Prime Now app. So there's going to be a lot of, as you say, omni-channel overlap, especially in the grocery business.","On the storefront, we're also, as you can see, experimenting with numerous store formats. Amazon Go is now up to six stores. We opened five in the quarter. We're getting great feedback on that. Customers love the ability to quickly walk in, select items they want and leave without waiting in a checkout line. We opened up a Amazon four-star location in New York City where we're going to test the concept of a highly curated selection of top categories across Amazon. We of course have Amazon bookstores, 18 bookstores in the U.S. So we're going to experiment with multiple ways of reaching the customer, wherever they happen to be.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed.","Ross Sandler - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. I guess two questions. Any color on, it looks like shipping costs and maybe labor costs might see some inflation in 2019. So do you agree with that? Or what are some of the things you can do to potentially offset some of that pressure?","And then, the 15% fulfillment square-footage growth, you're obviously deploying a lot of automation and there's a lot more efficiency gains in the current generation of fulfillment centers than maybe the older ones. So how should we think about a 15%? Is that not a good reading indicator on growth into 2019? Or is it \u2013 any color there would be helpful. Thanks.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Sure. I think it's comparable to \u2013 last question first. I think the 15% is comparable to the 30%-plus that I mentioned in 2016 and 2017. We are debating whether the dynamics of the warehouse are changing so that square footage may not be the main indicator, might be cubic feet, but if we switch to that way of looking at it, we'll make sure that we bridge the gap on the difference between the two.","But the other comment about cost, I believe you're probably referring to the U.S. rumored USPS rate hikes in transportation cost. We're not expecting a material impact from these rate changes in 2019. Annual rate increases from our transportation partners is a really regular occurrence and we negotiate hard and we'll always work hard internally to get even more efficient on our own shipping method. So, we don't see that as being a huge issue.","On wages, of course, we did raise wages and starting November 1 just under 400,000 employees, both full-time and part-time in the U.S. and UK will be getting a substantial wage increase. So that is factored \u2013 I'm not quantifying that today, but it's factored into our Q4 guidance and it will be obviously factored into guidance into 2019.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed.","Youssef Squali - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much. Two quick questions. First, can you quantify the contribution of PillPack acquisition in the quarter? Maybe help us understand the strategy there.","And then there is some news, reports suggesting that you guys were working on an ad supported video streaming service under the IMDb brand. Can you just help shed any more light on that, is that especially relative to your Prime Video offering? Thank you very much.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Let me start with PillPack. The deal closed in September. So it wasn't a material impact on the quarter, but we're excited, really excited to start working with the management team there. They're very strong. They've done a great job building a highly differentiated customer experience, just customer-centric like we are. And right now our focus is on learning from them and innovating with them on how best to meet customer needs over time. I'll let Dave handle the second question.","Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.","Yeah. I think, I mean, we have no plans to build an ad-supported Prime Video offering for free at this time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer & Company. Please proceed.","Jason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Two questions. First, I think I may have missed earlier. You gave out the impact of ASC 606.","And then maybe second question, I think what one of the things people are trying to think through is you obviously guide to revenue and operating income, but as the business is more than 3P and advertising, gross profit is now much more important and just the way you kind of capture the value you provide. So maybe if you can \u2013 is there a way to just kind of help us kind of foot the perhaps slower revenue growth we're seeing versus what's obviously you extracting kind of more value for your partners and customers and for yourself? Thanks.","Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Jason. This is Dave. Just quickly on the ASC impact, Brian mentioned earlier that of course we've been talking about it all year the changing, and the subscription revenue recognition is now straight line. So on a comp basis you'd expect to see subscription revenue be about $300 million lower due to that accounting change.","The other piece that we hadn't talked about is the reclass that we gave in the past few quarters, specifically around the advertising services that have moved from Contra COGS into other revenue beginning in 2018. That was about $750 million increase to that other sales revenue category here in the third quarter.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Yeah. And your comment on revenue versus operating income versus potentially gross profit, I would say the impact of third-party growth and we're now \u2013 up to 53% of our paid units in the quarter were third-party. It's steadily been going up. It's up 300 basis points year-over-year. So I think the impact on revenue growth rate, since the revenue component of that is not as large, is probably something to consider on a year-over-year period. I think it tends to not be as big a factor, sequentially quarter-over-quarter is the gradual growth in it. But again, we'll continue to give revenue guidance and also operating income to an appropriately conservative level that we've tried to maintain over time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.","Anthony DiClemente - Evercore Group LLC","Thanks very much. Just wanted to dig in a little bit on advertising and the growth opportunity there. If you can help us on the potential for higher ad pricing in terms of the ROI for your marketers hopefully being reflected in higher price per ad. And then what about the ad load? So are we kind of close to being at a full ad load? Is there a long runway there? Just trying to get a sense for pricing and volume underneath advertising.","And then also along the lines of advertising, heading into the holiday season, should we expect any increase in your efforts around Alexa commercialization, voice keyword ads let's say, and does that fit into your broader advertising growth strategy? Thanks.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Yeah, let me talk a little bit more broadly about advertising. So yeah, we are seeing really strong adoption across a number of groups, Amazon vendors and sellers for sure, authors, as well as third-party advertisers who want to reach Amazon customers.","As far as penetration, we don't have that quantified for you, but we still believe that there is a lot of room to continue to improve the presentation of and bringing to our customers new and more relevant purchase options. So we're continuing to invent both on the product side, the tools side with our goal being improve the usability of the tools for advertisers, make smarter recommendations for customers, automate activities so that advertisers don't have to work as hard, and invent new products for advertisers.","If we do this right, we think we'll both help advertisers and help Amazon consumers at the same time. So I know it doesn't answer the question about specific rate increases or capacity, but that is the general strategy that we're seeing in advertising.","Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.","Yeah, and this is Dave. Just jumping on the Alexa point, I mean, I think the short answer is we don't have any plans to add paid advertising to Alexa. I think we clearly had a lot of exciting things happen in the last month or two in terms of new announcements in devices out there. And I mean really looking at that, the goal is to make customers' lives easier and make it more convenient and a lot of that is you're seeing that in the homes and to some extent on the Go. So I think if you look at the recent announcements, you're seeing a few things. I mean, one, we're bringing a lot of cool hardware options to customers.","Second thing, I mean, making the Alexa service smarter. It's getting smarter and more capable. And then also delivering tools for developers, helping them build for and really with Alexa. So I think making her smarter and seeing that she gets smarter with all the skills, leveraging the cloud and AI, becoming more knowledgeable and introducing a lot of really new cool new features. So really excited about the customer response with those devices and those tools so far and looking forward to doing even more.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Wanted to just follow up on the advertising side and get a sense for how much you guys feel like you're demand constrained versus supply constrained, either in the ability to put more ads on your property and\/or just provide the tools to advertisers and do you feel like there's more demand than you can satisfy? Any color you can share there?","Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.","Hey, this is Dave. I mean nothing specific. I mean I think so much of what we're focused on is making sure that there's a high degree of relevancy and usefulness for customers when you look at advertisements that you see on the site in particular and how we position those. And so we spent a lot of time looking at the data to make sure that customer behavior and feedback is telling us that it's useful and helpful and customers making those purchase decisions. And so, we're always testing different levels of that and trying to understand, and the various features, whether it's display or some of the sponsored elements that are out there, what kind of feedback is out there, but certainly keep that in mind as we roll out new things.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird. Please proceed.","Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks. I guess two quick ones. Any change in the trajectory of Prime membership growth since the June price increase? And then, how would you describe the pricing environments for the core AWS services? And is this still a key lever that you use for business development? Thank you.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Yeah. Sure. Let me start with the Amazon Prime price increase. Of course, that went into effect earlier the year in May. We're very pleased with the renewal data and annual sign up data that we've seen. Since then, program remains very strong, both in membership and engagement, and a lot of our video content, music and shipping definitely as well as other Prime Benefits. We just continue to see that ramp up, not only in the U.S., but in other countries.","So we do continue to make the Prime offer better as well. I mentioned earlier the linkage with Prime member savings at Whole Foods market that we set up in Q2, the expansion of grocery delivery to more than 60 cities in the U.S. using Prime Now and Whole Foods stores, the ability to pick up groceries from Whole Foods. Adding content, we have a great slate of content coming out in the fourth quarter here.","Hopefully, you've seen already Jack Ryan and The Romanoffs and pretty soon you'll see the follow-up season to The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel and also a couple other things, and hopefully you'll see Thursday Night Football tonight when you get home.","Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.","This is Dave. Just on the AWS pricing philosophy. I mean, just a reminder. When we look at this, our pricing philosophy has worked relentlessly, take cost out of our own cost structure and where we can pass savings on to the web services customers in the form of lower prices. So it's easy to lower prices, but it's much harder to be able to afford the lower prices and that's something we work very hard in all our businesses, including AWS to do that. So when you look at AWS now, we've lowered prices 67 times since we launched, including a few more in the last few months. So those pre-OC price reductions are a normal part of our business for us.","Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.","(30:42) call today and for your questions.

Now, I will turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas Szkutak","Thanks, Sean. I will begin with comments on our fourth quarter financial results. Trailing 12 month operating cash flow increased 7% to $4.81 billion. Trailing 12 month free cash flow decreased 81% to $395 million. Trailing 12 months capital expenditures were $3.79 billion.","This amount includes $1.4 billion in purchases of our previously leased corporate office space as well as property for development of additional corporate office space located in Seattle, Washington which we purchased in the fourth quarter.

We are grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers. Media revenue increased to $6.51 billion, up 8% or 10% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $13.93 billion, up 28% or 29% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 65% of worldwide sales, up from 63%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 32%. Active customer accounts exceeded 200 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 39% of paid units.","Now, I will discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $16.14 billion, or 75.9% of revenue, compared with 79.3%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content in G&A combined was $4.45 billion, or 20.9% of sales, up approximately 293 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $2.2 billion, or 10.3% of revenue compared with 9.3%. Tech and content was $1.22 billion, or 5.7% of revenue, compared with 4.5%. Marketing was $833 million, or 3.9% of revenue compared with 3.3%.","Now, I'll talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate segments, our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 23% to $12.17 billion. Media revenue grew 13% to $2.9 billion. EGM revenue grew 24% to $8.5 billion, representing 70% of North America revenues, up from 69%. North America segment operating income increased 114% to $608 million, a 5% operating margin.","In the international segment, revenue grew 21% to $9.09 billion. Adjusting for the hundred $83 million year-over-year unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, revenue growth was 23%. Media revenue grew 5% to $3.61 billion, or 7% excluding foreign exchange and EGM revenue grew 35% to $5.43 billion, or 37% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 60% of international revenues, up from 54%.","International segment operating income decreased 61% to $70 million a, 0.8% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, International segment operating income decreased 56%.","CSOI increased 47% to $678 million, or 3.2% of revenue, up approximately 54 basis points year-over-year. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating. GAAP operating income increased 56% to $405 million, or 1.9% of net sales.","Our income tax expense was $194 million in Q4, resulting in a 58% rate for the quarter and 79% rate for the full year 2012. GAAP net income was $97 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, compared with $177 million and $0.38 per diluted share.","Now, I will discuss the full year results. Revenue grew 27% to $61.0 9 billion. North America revenue grew 30% $34.81 billion and International revenue grew 23% to $26.28 billion, or 27% growth excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange.","Consolidated segment operating income or CSOI increased 6% to $1.67 billion, or 7% excluding the unfavorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange and operating margin decreased 54 basis points, 2.7%. GAAP operating income decreased 22% to $676 million, or 1.1% of net sales.","Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $1.87 billion year-over-year to $11.45 billion. Inventory increased 21% to $6.03 billion and inventory turns were 9.3, down from 10.3 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 20% to $13.32 billion and accounts payable days increased to 76 from 74 in the prior year.","In Q4 2012, we usually $3 billion of senior non-convertible unsecured debt in three, five and seven-year tranches with proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes. I will conclude my portion of today's call with guidance.","Incorporated into the guidance are the order trends that we have seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending.","It's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material impact on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don\u2019t conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments or settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently.","For Q1 2013, we expect net sales of between $15 billion and $16.6 billion or growth between 14% and 26%. This guidance anticipates approximately 122 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income or loss to be between the $285 million loss and $65 million positive income compared to $192 million income in the prior period year.","This includes approximately $285 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income which excludes stock-based compensation and other expense to be between zero and $350 million compared to $390 million income in the prior period.","We remain head sound focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.","Thanks for that. Sean, let's go to questions","Sean Boyle","Great, thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.","Scott Devitt - Morgan Stanley","Tom, it looks that you have successfully begin the transition of your logistics costs in the direction of being more of a fixed fulfillment cost with lower unit based shipping costs, given that the growth rate of about shipping now meaningfully below the fulfillment growth rate. So the question is, is this something that we should expect to continue now in the back of this meaningful fulfillment center expansion ramp?","Then separately, but on the same topic, we are also wondering, are there other parts of the business in which you can make this transition to more of a fixed cost in the future? Thanks.","Thomas Szkutak","In terms of the fulfillment question, you are right in terms of over the past few years, we have expanded in our fulfillment network pretty extensively to the point where we are closer to customers and you are seeing that reflected in our transportation cost, you can obviously see the fulfillment expense is certainly not fixed in terms of absolute terms but you can see that we had 20 fulfillment centers last year and that\u2019s reflected in the operating expense that you are seeing. But that is a benefit of having adding to our fulfillment center network. We get closer and closer to customers with a lot of great selection. So you are seeing that reflected in the individual of business gross margins, which shows up as benefits of transportation cost.","In terms of other opportunities, certainly there are a number of opportunities as we invest in individual customer experience areas across the business. Many of those would be on our website. We have a relatively fixed expense as we launch those and we amortize those costs over our full customer base. So as they grow to become more effective on a per unit or per customer basis. So there is a number of opportunities that we have had and will have going forward to do that.","Operator","Thank you. We will take our next question from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.","Douglas Anmuth - JPMorgan","Great, thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask about the shift to third-party, I guess in particularly, I think last 4Q you talked about shifting more the business in the videogame space, in particular the third-party categories that you would specifically point to in this last 4Q, you already made sort of a similar shift. Thanks.","Thomas Szkutak","We did see, you know, a good expansion as you mentioned in 3P, a third-party units as a percentage of total units increased from 36% last year Q4 to 39% on expansion of approximately 300 basis points. Our overall unit growth rate for the quarter in total was 32%. Our third-party growth rate was in excess of 40%, so, again, nice growth. You are certainly seeing it in a number of areas.","You see it certainly in our EGM business look. If you look at our North America growth rates are unique and see that our revenues, up 23% but our third-party, our total unit growth rate was a substantially faster than that, and our third-party units were growing very fast there as well, so there's a number of differently that you are seeing that, but certainly you are seeing it there.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question Brian Pitz with Jefferies.","Brian Pitz - Jefferies","Great. Thanks. Looks like you are moving more in the direction of same-day shipping. Would you provide any thoughts or insights here? Should we anticipate a significant ramp-up of fulfillment center build out, particularly in Q2, Q3? And, maybe, if you could just comment more generally on your FC built out plans U.S. versus international? Thanks.","Thomas Szkutak","There is not a lot I can comment on in terms of our plans similar to last year no as we progress through the year, we can give you further updates on what we plan to do there. Last year, we opened up 20 new fulfillment centers, and so we saw in a very rapid growth in fulfillment capacity last year, and stay tuned and we'll let you know more as the year progress there.","Operator","We'll go next to Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.","Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks. Two questions please. The paid unit growth deceleration to 32% there seems a bit of a disconnect versus an active customer growth that didn't decelerated as much on a per customer basis, are you seeing some sort of change in overall activity. Is that the impact of newer international markets?","Then just on the investment cycle, the last couple of calls, you've consistently called out future investments whether the $1.4 billion for Seattle or distribution center expansion. You didn't do it this quarter I don't over read into it, but does that we are at the end of a major investment cycle? Thanks.","Thomas Szkutak","In terms of unit growth, there's not a lot more I can add to it. We did see very strong, we saw substantially unit growth and revenue growth in terms of the paid unit growth in Q4 unit, which we are seeing very strong third-party growth as well, was up over 40%.","In terms of investment cycle, I wouldn't read into anything related to that. We will still be adding capacity during 2013 in terms of the levels of how much we'll add. As I mentioned earlier in the call, just stay tuned and we will let you know as the year progresses.","Operator","We'll go next to Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.","Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs","Great, thanks. I was wondering if you give us just a bit of a sense of what you are seeing as you the rollout fulfillment centers into new state. Obviously the sales tax issue has been that's come up a good bit, but you touched on the impact of being closer with faster delivery in those same state. Net-net, what do you see as being the impact on not asking you to give us kind of a state by state breakdown, but the impact of rolling out the fulfillment center footprint taking both of those things into accounts.","Thomas Szkutak","I am not really sure how best to answer your question. I mean, we certainly have expanded pretty dramatically over the past really coming out of 2009 between 2010, 2011 and 2012. We've rapidly increase our footprint globally. Your comment was more directed towards the U.S., but we have also rapidly increased our footprint in the U.S.","As a result of that, your book category selection, a much broader selection closer to customers as you would expect with this rapid increase. We have also expanded selection during that time period. So we continue to be in the locations we would like to be in and we will continue to expand our footprint over time and become even closer and closer to customers. Beyond that there is not a lot I can add.","Operator","We will go next to Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.","Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray","Good afternoon. Some high level query minus the margin difference between 1P and 3P. I know in the past you talked about you being agnostic between the two but the growth in 3P and what your CSOI margins imply that 3P has little bit higher margin. Is that the correct read through? Thanks.","Thomas Szkutak","There is some variation by business but certainly that we attempt to do as from my pricing standpoint, is to try to be agnostic. That is really how we run the business. Again, this is on a third-party versus retail. Then, we have also added certainly a lot of other services over the past year in terms of fulfillment. So it really depends upon where we are in the investment cycle, what our utilization is.","As you know, certainly as you look at the last few years, we have been in very heavily expanding in terms of fulfillment capacity because of the growth that we have been experiencing that certainly would put pressure on our overall cost structure. Certainly as a per unit basis because we are not giving the productivity. We don\u2019t get the full productivity for a number of years after expanding.","So depending on what type of customer is, you know, whether it is a retail unit, a straight third-party units or NFPA unit but again we are certainly attempting this on a product basis to be roughly agnostic.","Operator","We will go next to Brian Nowak with Nomura.","Brian Nowak - Nomura","Thanks, guys. First, on the device strategy with Kindle and Kindle HD, can you help us at all what you are seeing with the attach rate trend on digital goods after people buy the Kindles. Then generally, do you see a higher overall GMV per customer on Kindle devices than users on Amazon Apps through other devices?","Thomas Szkutak","In terms of attach rates, we haven\u2019t given a lot of detail but I think one thing certainly to look at, and it doesn\u2019t give any attach rate, but it gives you at least a sense of the health of the business, the number that was in the release today. We sure have a multi-billion-dollar e-book business, growing approximately 70% year-over-year, total year last year. That\u2019s growing at that rate after really just launching the business approximately five years ago. So it\u2019s a pretty good healthy growth rate five years in.","We are seeing good, I can't give you specific numbers but we have seen very good progress on a number of our other digital media categories. Video, I talked about a little bit earlier, we are seeing Prime customers. Certainly the percentage of Prime customers who were watching free content through Prime Instant Videos has gone up dramatically year-over-year.","We have also increased Prime membership dramatically, year-over-year. They are also purchasing a paid content. Those customers that are using this, they watch free but they are also paying for new content which is great.","We have launched a number of new services on the music side. Most recently, our CD with free MP3, which we have on many titles. It's still very early but we certainly like that service and pleased to offer to customers. So I can't give you specific for attach rates but the business is making good progress on the video content side. Again it's still very early.","Operator","We will go next to Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank.","Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank","Thanks, guys. Just two quick questions. As you guys build out the Prime membership and the fees available through FBA, you run into this challenge of increase in your unit volume of tail items and at the same time we need to get products to customers in much shorter shipping cycle. So, can you talk about how the new fulfillments helps on that front? Is your reliance on air going down as a percent of total items shipped. Then if I remember correctly, you guys reclassified some FBA revenue in early 2012. Can you just remind how that flows through the shipping revenue line and what could happened as you count that in the beginning of '13. Thanks.","Thomas Szkutak","Sure. Just in terms of overall selection, as we added to Prime, what I was talking about earlier in terms of having a more expanded footprint is, there's no unit question that's helping us add additional selection more economically to Prime. And so on, that's both in terms of third-party selection as well as our retail selection and so that's something that we know continue to have the benefit of as we get more and more members in Prime and have the bigger, bigger concentration of two-day shipping U.S. for that.","So, we did add the shipping portion FBA fees in Q1 of 2012 and we see some benefit year-over-year, but we are still seeing leverage in terms of, you know, ex the FBA fees quite a bit leverage there, so we I do not have a specific number for you there, but yes we are still seeing quite a bit of leverage there, ex the re-class that you are referring to.","Operator","We'll go next to Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.","Justin Post - Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you. Last year you reported 4Q in the lower half of revenue range and you were able to call out Taiwan and video games category. Any reasons why revenues were kind of in the lower half this quarter?","And then if you look at gross profit growth, it clearly has accelerated to 40% growth, but unit growth decelerated to 32%.Can you describe what's driving that kind of accelerating gross profit in the face of lower unit growth, and is it possible maybe you are letting the third parties handle some of the many less profitable categories for Amazon. Could you talk about that all? Thank you.","Thomas Szkutak","If you take a look at our growth rate, where we think the growth rate for Q4 was solid. It was up 23% on revenue basis quite a bit higher than on a unit growth basis up 32% year-over-year. In terms of some of the things that we saw and we again we saw solid growth across many different categories and geographies year-over-year.","Certainly some things to call out in terms of things that may have been a little bit softer. A few examples would be, we did see some of the higher average selling price items, particularly the items greater than $1,000 a little bit softer, a few of the consumer electronics, you subcategories like TVs, MP3 players digital cameras to some extent were softer. But, again, with the base that we have in Q4, still very solid growth.","Another one, certainly we are thrilled to have a Paperwhite in our lineup best e-reader that's out there and we are very pleased with it, but we couldn't keep up with demand. We would have had more sales in Q4 for able to keep up with demand and so the team is working very hard to make sure we have good in-stock going forward on that product, but we certainly could have sold more in Q4.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Tom Forte with Telsey Advisory Group.","Tom Forte - Telsey Advisory Group","Great. Thanks very much for taking my question. I want to ask you on Amazon Instant Video, how you thought about your current offering and your ability to add exclusive content in a cost effective manner through Amazon Studios, and what the relationship is between adding more titles and uses on your hardware such your Amazon Kindle devices? Thanks.","Thomas Szkutak","We will continue to expand our selection, both in terms of Amazon Instant Video as well Prime Instant Video and we will do that in a number of different ways. We think we have a very interesting selection right now and you should expect that will be spending more on content as it relates to Prime over time. We will continue to add selection on the Instant Video. Beyond that, you have to stay tuned.","Operator","We will go next to Ken Sena with Evercore Partners.","Ken Sena - Evercore Partners","Hi, I just had a question on your other segment line. Can you talk a little bit about the non-AWS drivers within that line as you are advertising? As you look out, are there advantages to you in terms of having AWS as far as offering things like buying, serving, analytics through the AWS platform to advertisers? Where are you in that rollout phase now? Thank you.","Thomas Szkutak","In terms of the AWS business, the business is growing very fast. We have increased the number of services pretty dramatically over the past several years. The team is doing a fantastic job there. We will continue to innovate on behalf of customers in that space. There is a number of other things that go into that line item. Some are credit card as well as other marketing revenue goes in there. But again, AWS is in that line item.","Operator","We will go next to Anthony Diclemente with Barclays.","Anthony Diclemente - Barclays","Hi, thanks. I wondered if you gave comment on the pace of business throughout the fourth quarter? Did you see a particular deceleration in the month of December? Then second question, on international, I am wondering, are there any call outs in terms of specific countries that may have been weighing on profitability? Countries where there is going to be outsized dollars of investment going on or accelerated investment at the current time. Thank you.","Thomas Szkutak","There are not a lot of specifics. We have long been in the practice of not talking about trends in within the quarter in terms of year-over-year growth or anything like that. Obviously the Q4 is very seasonal. December is, by far, the largest the month followed by November but in terms of individual growth rates, we don\u2019t have a lot of comments there.","In terms of international, yes, there certainly are geographies that we are investing in heavily. Certainly China would be one. Some of the European countries including some of the new launches that we are investing in. Those are certainly, you are seeing those represented in those segment results.","Operator","We will take our next question from Rohit Kulkarni with Citi.","Rohit Kulkarni - Citi","Okay, thank you for taking my question. In terms of your recent margin profile, actually comparing U.S. and international, I guess over the past four quarters, the vast majority improvement or rather the less worse margin trends that we have seen have been due to U.S. margins improving while international were declining in the range of 300 to 350 basis points. In Q4, international declined just 160 basis points. So my questions, should we read this as a beginning of a trend that we saw how domestic margins increased over the last four quarters and whether international should follow similar route over the next foreseeable future.","Thomas Szkutak","Yes, there is not a particular call out that I could make on that. The only thing that I would, in terms of the change I am referring to, but in terms of the difference between two, keep in mind that, a couple of factors. One, mix of business is a little bit different. Our AWS businesses is in North America segment. You also have some newer geographies. Or geography that I shouldn\u2019t say are necessarily newer but geographies that we are investing in heavily that have a longer-term horizon for returns, the ones I mentioned earlier. So those are factors as you look at the two different segments.","Operator","We will take our next question from Benjamin Schachter with Mcquarrie.","Benjamin Schachter - Mcquarrie","It looks likes the first-party gross margin is actually up fairly meaningful year-over-year. Wonder if you could talk about that within the context of Amazon Kindle hardware is impacting the gross margin. Then separately just any view on how videogames sales impact to the year-over-year growth rate for the quarter? Thanks.","Thomas Szkutak","Yes. It causes we haven't broken out the first-party versus third-party units since it's something we have done for that's only I am today or we have done in previous calls, so it's not I can help you with there.","Operator","We will take our next question from Jordan Rohan with Stifel Nicolaus","Jordan Rohan - Stifel Nicolaus","First just an accounting clarification, it should be pretty interesting, but the content cost for Prime Instant Video flowing to the cost of goods line even there is no direct revenue associated not into the tech and content line, right? Is that right?","Thomas Szkutak","That's correct.","Jordan Rohan - Stifel Nicolaus","Okay. So, gross margins would be even higher if those costs were included elsewhere or broken out separately? It also seems like it's becoming a separate question. It's something kind of common or to reduce the carrying value of your investment in LivingSocial. Give a feel on a broad strategic level as to whether the local deals business through Amazon local or through LivingSocial is something that you care to keep investing in? Thanks.","Thomas Szkutak","There's not a lot I can specifically talk about as it relates to LivingSocial beyond, what's on our result today and what we'll have in our 10-K, which we filed soon, and so I would encourage you take a look at in our full disclosures related to that. But in terms of local, there certainly is still a very interesting opportunity there. We do have a couple, we have an investment in LivingSocial, we also have a local business ourselves.","So, it's an interesting opportunity, it's a long-term opportunity in and we will continue to work on that customers to make that experience even better and you should think about it, not unlike a lot of the other businesses that we invest in with over long-term horizon and it's not very early there.","Sean Boyle","Okay. Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on investor relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter."],"1141":["Amazon.com, Inc.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded.","For opening remarks I will be turning the call over to Director of Investor Relations, Phil Hardin. Please go ahead.","Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations","Hello. And welcome to our Q2 2015 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO who will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 23, 2015 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K.","As you listen to today's conference call we encourage you to have our press release in front of you which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2014.","Now I'll turn the call over to Brian.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Phil. I will begin comments on our second-quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 69% to $8.98 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $4.37 billion up from $1.04 billion. In the supplemental financial information and business metrics portion of our earnings release, we include a few additional free cash flow measures. We believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash and through capital and finance releases.","Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.61 billion. Capital expenditures do not include the impact of property and equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligations. The increase in capital expenditures and capital leases reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure, the majority of which is to support AWS and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.","Return on invested capital was 17% up from 6%. ROIC is trailing 12 month free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter-ends. Combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 488 million shares compared with 480 million one year ago. Worldwide revenue grew 20% to $23.18 billion, or 27% excluding the $1.39 billion unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign-exchange.","Worldwide paid unit growth was 22%. Worldwide active customer accounts was approximately 285 million. Excluding customers who only had three orders in the preceding 12 month period worldwide active customers were approximately 265 million up from approximately 237 million in the comparable prior year period. Worldwide seller units represented 45% of paid units, up from 41% in the comparable prior year period.","Now I will discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $15.16 billion or 65.4% of revenue compared with 69.3%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $6.95 billion or 29.9% of sales, up approximately 130 basis points year-over-year.","Fulfillment was $2.74 billion or 11.8% of revenue compared with 11.8%. Tech and content was $2.70 billion or 11.7% of revenue compared with 10.4%. Marketing was $1.1 billion or 4.7% of revenue compared with 4.7%.","Now I'll talk about our segment results. As a reminder, in the first quarter we changed our reportable segments to report North America, International, and Amazon Web Services. Consistent with prior periods we do not allocate two segments, our stock-based compensation, or the other operating expense line item.","In the North America segment, revenue grew 26% to $13.8 billion. Media revenue grew 6% to $2.62 billion or 7% excluding foreign-exchange. EGM revenue grew 31% to $10.99 billion or 32% excluding foreign-exchange. EGM now represents 80% of North America revenues. North America segment operating income increased 113% to $703 million a 5.1% operating margin. Excluding the $9 million favorable impact from foreign-exchange, North America segment operating income increased 111%.","In the International segment revenue increased 3% to $7.56 billion. Excluding the $1.37 billion year-over-year unfavorable impact from foreign-exchange, revenue growth was 22%. Media revenue decreased 12% to $2.09 billion or increased 3% excluding foreign-exchange. EGM revenue grew 10% to $5.43 billion or 31% excluding foreign-exchange. EGM now represents 72% of International revenues. International segment operating loss was $19 million compared to a loss of $2 million in the prior year period. International segment operating loss includes $89 million of unfavorable impact from foreign-exchange.","In the Amazon Web Services segment revenue increased 81% to $1.82 billion. Amazon Web Services segment operating income increased 407% to $391 million, a 21.4% operating margin. Excluding the $71 million favorable impact from foreign-exchange, AWS segment operating income increased 314%. Consolidated segment operating income increased 166% to $1.07 billion or 4.6% of revenue, up approximately 250 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the $9 million unfavorable impact from foreign-exchange, CSOI increased 168%.","Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income include stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP Operating income was $464 million compared to a loss of $15 million in the prior year period. Our income tax expense was $266 million. GAAP net income was $92 million or $0.19 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $126 million or a loss of $0.27 per diluted share.","Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $6.02 billion year-over-year to $14 billion. Inventory increased 12% to $7.47 billion and inventory turns were 8.9 turns down from 9.1 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories.","Accounts payable increased 18% to $12.39 billion and accounts payable days increased to 74 from 71 in the prior year. I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and customer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.","As we describe in more detail in our public filings issues such as settling inter-company balances in foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters, and changes to effective tax rate can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't include additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and if foreign-exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.","For Q3 2015 we expect net sales of between $23.3 billion and $25.5 billion, or growth of between 13% and 24%. This guidance anticipates approximately 620 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign-exchange rates, GAAP operating income or loss to be between $480 million loss and $70 million of income compared to a $544 million loss in the third quarter of 2014.","This includes approximately $580 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $100 million and $650 million, compared to a $136 million loss in the third quarter of 2014. We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection, and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.","Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move on to questions.","Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations","Great. Thanks, Brian. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Our first question comes from Mark May with Citi. Please proceed. Your line is live.","Mark May - Citi Investment Research","Thanks for taking my questions. You clearly had a lot of things working well in the quarter, but maybe just focusing in on AWS, which seems to be quickly emerging as kid of your largest contributor to operating income. Can you maybe provide a little more color on what drove the acceleration and just the overall growth in the business? If you could talk a little bit about the addition of new customers versus average spend per customer and I think in the past you've talked about what unit growth was for AWS? And in the press release you talked about expanding AWS into some new International markets. Can you give us a feel for how much of AWS' business today is domestic and what kind of opportunity you have there to expand AWS outside the U.S.?","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yes, Mark. Thanks for your question. We will not be providing the granular customer detail unfortunately but we will say the growth of 81% was up 49% in Q1. You remember that we are lapping a number of large price decreases in Q2 of last year, so it was somewhat expected but a very strong quarter in AWS.","We did announce a region in India. The other thing to mention is that we continue to see very strong usage of growth that's outpacing the revenue growth of 81% obviously. And so, we're really excited about it. From a distribution of customers, it is a global business. We have regions spread throughout the world; we have 11 regions at this point and have announced plans to launch a region in India in the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed; your line is live.","Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you for taking the question. There has been some recent press reports talking about investments in India. I wanted to know \u2013 you've talked a little bit about that market in the past \u2013 whether there was any update there in terms of how you think about approaching the market and the level of investments that might be needed to compete in the market? Thank you.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Certainly Eric. What I can say about India is when we see a positive surprise we double down on it. That's kind of our policy, and India is that kind of surprise. So we're very happy, very encouraged early on with what we've seen in the ramping of the business, the level of invention going on for both customers and sellers. We are over $25 million or excuse me, 25 million names (14:02) which is the largest online store in India. And we continue to improve pricing and fast delivery so were super excited about India. I will not get into specific investment levels right now but we continue to ramp up our investment there.","Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.","Justin Post - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Thank you. A couple of questions here. We followed this coming for a long time and profits seem to move around quite a bit year-over-year and year against year. And just wondering how you think about that? Is that just the nature of your big bets and that's just going to continue or is there a way to kind of smooth that out?","And then secondly, in AWS it does seem like pricing competition has come down and we've been to a lot of your events and it seems like you're emphasizing pricing a little less to your customers. Can you talk at all about the pricing environment in cloud? Thank you.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure, let me start with that second question. So, as Phil mentioned, we are seeing continued increases in usage, both sequentially and year-over-year. We are also seeing a great efficiency in the business on a cost basis. Innovation is accelerating, not decelerating. We had over 350 significant new features and services and we believe that's what resonates with customers. While pricing is certainly a factor we don't believe it's always the primary factor; in fact what we hear from our customers is that the ability to move faster and more agiley is what they value. I'm sorry the first party your question was?","Justin Post - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","I was asking about just how the profitability kind of really moves pretty big swings year-over-year? Is that the nature of your just big bets and that can continue or is there a way to kind of smooth that out going forward? How do you think about that?","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yes sure. Well here's how I think about it. We have two things, at least two things going on. We are continuing to drive operational improvement in every business that we are in, but we are also investing in large opportunities that are in front of us, particularly in Marketplace Prime and AWS. If you saw our shareholder letter this year, I think Jeff Bezos put it really well. He said we're going to look for things that are important to customers, customers love them, businesses that can grow to be a large size that can generate a high return on invested capital and are durable and can last for decades. So we will continue to invest in the businesses we think fit that profile and we're always looking for a fourth or fifth business that fits that profile. So as far as lumpiness, admittedly it is lumpy and we will continue to work on both those tracks going forward.","Justin Post - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.","Mark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks. I don't know if Tom's listening in. That's a great exit on his part. On International retail you guys had nice acceleration there. Could you give us a little more of the why behind that? Why would International revenue grow, particularly in EGM, accelerate pretty materially. And is that the impact \u2013 it's one thesis \u2013 is that the impact of kind of the buildup of Prime in International markets and also in the U.S. too, but more spend per Prime customers as they go through this evolution that is just kind of layering on? Is that what it is? What is causing that acceleration? Thank you.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Certainly. We saw good acceleration in both North America and International this quarter. North America was up 200 basis points sequentially and International was up 800 basis points and half of that you remember we've spoken about the impact of the Japanese consumption tax that was instituted last \u2013 April 1 of 2014. It had a measurable impact on our run rate, our growth rate last year particularly Q2. And so we are lapping that, which sequentially makes up half of the 800 basis points sequential gain.","But independent of that, yes, you're right; Prime membership continues to grow. Faster outside, data that we gave at the end of the year. It's growing faster outside the U.S. than it is in the U.S. and we are happy with both growth rates quite frankly. So I would say the Prime membership to Prime flywheel, the additional benefits we are adding to Prime, not only in North America but also Internationally, and additional selection both retail and FBA which feeds the Prime flywheel.","Mark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.","Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one on the North America retail profitability was up nicely. Can you just talk to some of the drivers of that? Is it more top-line and more Prime subs coming on or is it more on the logistics side and what's driving the North America improving profitability? And then on the International profitability, is there any way you can help us understand the profitability of the more mature International markets like U.K. and Germany relative to the U.S. at this point?","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure. So let me start with North America. 5.1% operating margin was up from 3.9% in Q1 and 3% last Q2. You hit a nail on the head. A lot of it is the top-line growth, but it's also a lot of the efficiency we're seeing, particularly on the fulfillment and marketing lines, which for the whole company were flat year-over-year on a percent of revenue basis. So we are getting very good top-line growth. A lot of that is fueled by Prime adoption and we are dropping a lot of it to the bottom line with many of the efficiency projects.","In International we have not split countries out. What I can say is that if you adjust for foreign exchange the operating margin is up slightly both sequentially and year-over-year. What you're seeing there is also obviously colored by our investment our increased investment in India based on the momentum and the success we've been seeing there so far.","Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.","Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just two things I wanted to ask, First on Prime Day. Brian, if you could give a little more color there on the early takeaways that you have and then also perhaps more importantly how you think that sets Amazon up for the back-to-school season and then also the holidays later in the year? And then also can you just comment on the head count, which I believe is up 18,000 or so sequentially, which I believe is the biggest number that you've ever added in a quarter. Is there anything in particular that stands out there, or just more fulfillment centers, more geography expansion as well? Thanks.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Let me start with that second question first. Yes, head count was up 38% year-over-year. The vast majority of that is in operations where we are adding people for our new FCs and call centers. We continue to look for smart, innovative people who want to build on behalf of customers and \u2013 but this particular quarter is colored a bit by the operations growth.","If you look at Prime Day, we're thrilled with the results of Prime Day. It surpassed all of our expectations. Any metric we look at, everything was a huge success. Customers save millions. New Prime members signed up in higher rates than we've ever seen.","People bought more devices than on any other day. So, it's a great success. My hats off to operations team and all the people who worked on that because it was Christmas in July quite frankly, a bigger day than Black Friday, as we've said and orders increased 266% year-over-year. I'll also point out that worldwide FBA unit growth approached 300%, so not only was it a great day for Amazon, it was also a great day for our sellers which is great. So while not breaking out the impact of Prime Day specifically, it's incorporated into our guidance.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein.","Carlos Kirjner-Neto - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. I may be delusional, but if I add your capital leases and CapEx that suggests that AWS capital intensity is at least 80% if not much higher. What gives you confidence that if AWS continues to grow so fast and consuming so much capital two years out you'll be able to fund its growth from the retail business. And secondly, can you help me understand why you are not ruling out Prime Now and Fresh faster? What specifically are the bottlenecks there? Thank you.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Let me start with that second one. Prime Now you said, and Amazon Fresh. We are working very quickly on Prime Now. We've now expanded to nine cities, three more in the quarter including our first International city in London. So, we're moving quick, but we'd always like to move quicker obviously. On AWS I think your question was more around the ability to fund AWS? No comment specifically on that. We do realize it's a capital-intensive business and we have modeling that shows it's going to be a very \u2013 it is a very good business for us and that's what we aim for as long-term return on invested capital and free cash flow. So, we're certainly cognizant of the capital part of the calculation, so not much more I can add on that, Carlos.","Carlos Kirjner-Neto - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Heath P. Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks, guys. I'm wondering if you can touch a little bit more on AWS margins. Is there a level particularly when you've been able to maintain pricing strength the way you have been, where you feel like margins start to become and that the leverage you have there start to become a catalyst for lowering prices? Or is that purely a competitive decision? And as you think about sort of AWS longer-term, is there a framework or structure that you use to think about where margins in that business should be?","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Thanks for your question Heath. I will point out that we have continued to lower prices. We've had multiple price cuts this year. We are now up to 49 since launch in 2006, so it is a fundamental part of our business model. So is innovation. As I said, we have over 350 new features and services \u2013 also significant features and services that have launched this year. And as we were just talking with Carlos, the capital investment is very large as well, so we continue to fund it. And we are super excited with the customer reception that we are getting and the feedback we get from large customers so we are thrilled with the business.","And price reductions are part of that model. And again, as I said earlier, we're in the long haul. We're in this for the long haul. We are looking for return on invested capital, free cash flow, and happy customers in the space.","Heath P. Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, thanks. I really appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Youssef Squali with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Youssef H. Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Thank you. I guess, another question on AWS if I may. So, I want to go back to something that you said, Brian. You said that you've seen greater efficiency in the business from a cost standpoint. I was wondering if you can maybe parse that out a little more for us. Were you referring to OpEx or CapEx? And if you're referring to CapEx as well, do you feel you that you have reached escape velocity that should allow CapEx as a percentage of revenues, pricing aside, to now allow you for a constant decline in that metric, CapEx as a percentage of revenue for that that particular business? Thanks.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","What I can tell you is we have seen great efficiency on the cost side, the cost to generate the capacity for AWS. I will also say that Amazon is one of the primary large customers of AWS so we see it in the consumer side of the business as well, although that's not included in AWS revenue. It's an inter-company relationship. So, we get a double whammy there. We are getting great efficiency from our external AWS business but also from our own use of AWS services.","Youssef H. Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ron Josey with JMP Securities.","Ron V. Josey - JMP Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just a quick follow-up on Heath's question, just on the price reductions. Brian, you said earlier in the year, can you just compare the reductions earlier this year versus the ones across the board and from last year in 2Q 2014? And then a follow up just on the third-party units I think you mentioned third-party units are now 45% or maybe 47% of total units. Is there a natural limit there or it doesn't matter as long as the customer experience through FBA is seamless? Thank you.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Hey Ron. So, I'll comment on the units first. We are really following the model of giving our customers as many choices as possible and letting them choose whether they want to buy first-party or third-party and I think we're working really hard to make sellers succeed on the platform. Brian touched on the success that our FDA sellers had with Prime Day, but we see FBA as a tailwind for third-party business in general.","When we surveyed those sellers in the past, in 2014 about 71% of sellers saw a 20% or greater increase in sales when they entered the FBA program. So we are really happy with what that's doing for third-party business. We're working really hard to give customers as many options as possible and allowing them to choose. And we don't really have a specific target there. It all comes down to customer choice.","On the price reduction question, we've got a long track record of driving costs out of the business and you can certainly see where we've even done that over the last several quarters if you look at the margins in AWS. We've also lowered prices for customers 49 times since launch and so it can be lumpy, but over the long haul that's the model we follow.","Ron V. Josey - JMP Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Vogel with Barclays Capital.","Paul Vogel - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great, thank you. Just a question on the content side, is there any update on how engaged folks use the video side of Prime and their shopping behavior, number one. And number two, just any update on sort of your plans for growth on the content cost side? Thank you.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure. On the engagement of the Prime customers, excuse me PIV customers, we have seen buying habits that look like normal Prime customers or other Prime customers from the group that comes in through the digital pipelines, but we do also see a higher pickup in retention rates and free trial conversions. So we're very happy with the linkage between our digital offerings in the Prime customer base.","On the content side, I will say that one of the factors in the sequential guidance Q2 to Q3 being lower, is two things. What we are talking about is the fulfillment center \u2013 additional fulfillment center costs that we see this time every year as we get ready for Q4 but also additional step-up in content spend, where we spend a lot of our content in Q3. You will see extensions of a lot of the successful shows that we've had so far this year. A new pilot season including Man in the High Castle and Hand of God so stay tuned for that \u2013 or seasons of Man in the High Castle and Hand of God.","Paul Vogel - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.","Eugene C. Munster - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Good afternoon, and congratulations. I just want to follow up on a previous question. In past calls you talked about an increased focus on productivity. Is that still a focus of yours? And separately, any thoughts in terms of how robotics are impacting \u2013 any updates in terms of number of robots in fulfillment centers? Thanks.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure thing. Thanks for your questions, Gene. On robotics first, we don't have any new numbers to share with you, but we're super excited with the progress of that business. We had very high expectations for Amazon Robotics and its impact on our warehouse cost structure and we have been very pleasantly surprised by the job being done on that by that team. So that's looking great.","Efficiency, yes. As we've talked about in the last few calls we have even more emphasis on variable and fixed productivity. I think that's evident in the Q2 results that you've just seen. To give you a little more color on that, I would say what does that look like? We have defect reduction and process improvements are probably something we've always done and worked on, both to lower our cost but also to improve the customer experience and also the seller and vendor experience.","We're using software and algorithms to make decisions rather than people, which we think it's more efficient and scales better and will be more accurate, especially as we insert machine learning into the decisions.","As I said earlier we benefit from the efficiency gains of the AWS business on the Amazon site as well.","We look to increase the leverage of our fixed assets, particularly our fulfillment centers and the throughput of the fulfillment centers, and just generally getting inventory closer to customers as we add and expand warehouses in the sort centers that we added primarily last year. All have helped our cost structure, so just a little more color on maybe some specifics on the efficiency area.","Eugene C. Munster - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Pitz with Jefferies & Company.","Brian J. Pitz - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks. Now halfway through 2015, any update or insights on your fulfillment center build-out plans for the year? If you can't disclose that, can you maybe just give us a general sense of focus and strategy? How should would be thinking about domestic versus International? As well as sortation versus traditional? What's kind of the path to build that over the next 6, 12, 18 months? Thanks.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure. So we ended the year last year with 109 fulfillment centers around the world and 19 U.S. sort centers. And typically we're looking at what the demand would be for peak as we figure out what we need; so still a little early in the year to comment on that, but in the past we've given an update sometime around Q3 on that. But continuing to build as we have demand. And like Brian said, we like to be close to customers and benefit from having inventory close to customers as well. So like I said, a little early for the update at this point but something we're looking at and something the team's working really hard on.","Brian J. Pitz - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Colin Sebastian with Baird Equity Research.","Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks and congrats on the great quarter. In the Retail business obviously a lot of variables driving growth there, we're seeing higher Prime membership levels for one, but I wonder how much of that growth you can also break down by some other factors; for example, we're seeing a notable increase in selection across longer tail categories? And then secondly, in the press release, no mention of Fire Phone. I think almost every other product was mentioned. Can we just chalk that one up now to a learning experience and an example of where Amazon is showing some discipline around investments? Or how should we think about that? Thanks.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","So I'll start with the Fire Phone question. We have a policy of not commenting on our roadmap, so can't give you anything there. We obviously do learn from everything we do and value the feedback we get from customers, but nothing to share at this point. In terms of growth, we continue to see selection as a strong driver of growth. Prime is obviously very important as well; we really haven't teased those apart. FBA becomes very important as well and we've talked about some of the tailwinds we see there, and sort of the linkage between marketplace and Prime that FBA provides. So all those things are going on. As you're seeing EGM strength across a lot of the categories there, there was no single category we're really calling out, but continue to see good selection growth and good Prime growth as well.","Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank.","Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks, guys. So, Brian, I know you guys don't like to provide guidance beyond the next quarter but philosophically if we go back a few quarters you've characterized 2015 as a year where you believe that some of the heavier investments made in prior years should start to benefit and pay off. And we're see \u2013 we're clearly seeing that in AWS and in North America retail and it looks like you're still investing heavily on International retail. So if we kind of look out 2016, 2017, is there any high-level philosophical commentary about whether you see next year as another year of these types of trends that you're seeing now? Or are there any bigger investment areas particularly in the retail business that you might be looking to take advantage of?","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks for your question. I can't forecast into the future on that but I will reiterate the investments we have going on right now which again, we're looking to invest to strengthen the Prime platform. That includes video content including Amazon Originals, Prime Music, Prime Now. We have robust device business including the launch of a new Paperwhite Fire TV Echo with general availability and numerous other products that we're very excited about. That roadmap, we know that those devices drive customer engagement and sales. We build fulfillment centers so that we can add selection and we can add FBA partners. And we had things like same-day delivery which we talked about.","On the AWS side we continue to invest in that infrastructure. We talked about opening, announcing the region in India so there's expansion there as well. Future expansion, services expansion Internationally very similar to the U.S. on a number of the Prime fronts but also the investment in India. And then a few other things you may have seen in our press release today, the launch of Mexico which we are excited about and Amazon business.","So lots of \u2013 as I said, lots of investment in front of us. But we operate in two paths. We are definitely working for operational efficiencies in the business that we're in. We're investing wisely in things that we think are big and important. And it's not a static activity. We continue to evaluate those investments, take into account what customer response is and make changes. So I think you can look forward to the continuation of that into the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kerry Rice with Needham & Company.","Kerry Rice - Needham & Co. LLC","Thanks a lot. You've talked a lot about operational efficiencies. I know you guys have partnered with the post office and deliveries. Can you talk a little bit about how that is potentially benefiting and maybe the longer-term strategy with the post office? And then, you guys haven't necessarily broken this out, but I think you do generate a fair amount of revenue from advertising. I think that's in the other category. Is there anything that you can provide on advertising revenue? Thank you.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure. So I'll start with the first part of that question. We definitely are delivering a lot of packages with the post office. I think most notably they did a lot of the Sunday delivery that you saw when we started launching Sunday delivery. So we try lots of things for fulfillment. We're constantly working to provide the best experience to customers and be as efficient as possible. And so we're happy with all the partners we have and continue to work with them to provide the best experience possible.","For advertising, I would remind you that certain parts of the advertising roll up into other. Some actually roll up to EGM and media, as well. So it's a business we're really excited about. We're taking a customer centric approach as we build that to make sure we're providing engaging business, engaging adds to customers and making sure we keep the customer front of mind. And it's a business that the team is excited about and working hard on.","Kerry Rice - Needham & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Ju with Credit Suisse.","Steve D. Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah. Thanks. Brian, just to follow-up on the India question earlier. I mean, o my knowledge foreign e-commerce operators such as yourself are not allowed to have first-party retail operations. But given that fulfillment enhance customer service has always been a high focus item for you guys. What steps have you taken in the country to make sure that the consumer experience there is as good if not better for the inventory on which you have no direct control?","And secondarily, similar to China, you have a pretty large population base and Internet penetration growing that's probably comparable to what was the case when you add JOYO \u2013 when you acquired JOYO. So can you provide any color on how the general operating environments are the same or different? And do you expect your growth trajectory there to be similar to what you saw in China? Thanks.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","So, your first question was about the infrastructure and how we're managing the customer experience in India. So FBA, Easy Ship and some of those programs are important to us. They're very valuable for sellers to make it easy for the seller to get their goods to the customer. They're great from a customer experience standpoint because we can do what we do best with the logistics. And so there is a lot of investment and a lot of efforts going on that front.","I would say that India and China are totally different. And I think as Brian mentioned, India is a country that we're doubling down on based on the success we've seen there so far. And so very happy with the trajectory we're on there and excited to be investing and have the opportunities we do at that point.","Steve D. Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Blackledge with Cowen & Company.","John R Blackledge - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. It appears that Amazon is growing its share of household budget driven by many factors, Prime growth and strong growth in large verticals like apparel among others. Specifically on apparel, I'm just wondering how you view the breadth of Amazon's apparel offering. Any color on that segment's performance in the second quarter. And how do you view Amazon's apparel opportunity going forward? Thank you.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Thanks for your question. We have not broken out specifically apparel, but we're super excited about that business. It's growing very well. We like our position in it. We think our website is very tuned to selling online. So we're very happy with that. It is a big business for us, not only in North America but also Internationally. You mentioned a couple other consumables categories. I will say we are very happy in our consumables and hard lines categories, as well. We drive a lot of repeat business with things like Prime Pantry and Subscribe and Save and others. So, very happy with the EGM business as a whole.","John R Blackledge - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks.","Operator","And your final question comes from Scott Tilghman with B. Riley.","Scott Tilghman - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Thanks. I wanted to just follow up on a couple things. Three quick questions, first off on International I was wondering if you could compare and contrast relative performance of media and EGM? You're moving in different directions. Second, there have been a couple questions about shipping but most notable is that we had a couple price increases from the majors hit at the beginning of the year and it seems like you're costs are coming down. I was wondering if you could comment on that. And then third, just following up on Brian's question around the FCs. I was wondering how many of the facilities lend themselves to expansion rather than having to put up a new facility? Thanks.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Let me start with the first question on International media and EGM. I think we are seeing similar trends in both geographies, those segments that EGM growth is very strong media growth has been consistent for the last four quarters. We do like the work being done by media teams. There's a lot of pipeline of invention: things like Prime Instant Video, Prime Music; all feed the Prime pipeline and Prime ecosystem, if you will. They work great with our devices by the way. They drive other non-media sales.","They are very tied together, although certainly the EGM is outpacing the media segment or media businesses right now. On transportation costs, not a lot to add there. Again, the combination of doing our own shipping and using third-party carriers so the rate increases are staged and we see those quite frequently, so nothing to add there. On the FCs and whether we would expand or build new, I think we are looking to always get the most out of the fulfillment centers that we have and as we need new facilities we place them closer and closer to customers so that can have its benefits as well, but not much more to add on that one.","Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations","Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions.

Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com Q1 2015 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded.","For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Phil Hardin. Please go ahead.","Phil Hardin","Hello and welcome to our Q1 2015 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO and Brian Olsavsky, Vice President and CFO of our Global Consumer Business. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.","The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 23rd, 2015 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.","As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. In addition, the release includes historical financial results of our North America, International, and Amazon Web Services reportable segments for 2014 and 2013.","During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.","Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2014.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Brian.","Brian Olsavsky","Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our first quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 47% to $7.84 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $3.16 billion.","In the supplemental financial information and business metrics portion of our earnings release, we included a few additional free cash flow measures. We believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash into capital and finance leases.","Trailing 12 month capital expenditures were $4.68 billion. Capital expenditures do not include the impact of property and equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligations.","Return on invested capital is 14%, up from 9%. ROIC is trailing 12 month free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 483 million shares, compared with 476 million one year ago.","Worldwide revenue grew 15% to $22.72 billion or 22%, excluding $1.3 billion unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Worldwide paid unit growth was 20%. Active customer accounts was approximately 278 million.","Excluding customers who only had free orders in the preceding 12 month period, worldwide active customers were approximately $260 million, up from approximately $230 million in the comparable prior year period. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 44% of paid units.","Now I'll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $15.40 billion or 67.8% of revenue, compared with 71.2%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $6.62 billion or 29.1% of sales, up approximately 290 basis points year-over-year.","Fulfillment was $2.67 billion or 11.7% of revenue compared with 11.3%. Tech and content was $2.52 billion or 11.1% of revenue compared with 9.2%. Marketing was $1.05 billion or 4.6% of revenue compared with 4.3%.","Now I'll talk about our segment results. Beginning in the first quarter we changed our reportable segments to report North America, International and Amazon Web Services. In addition we have provided historical results for these segments for 2014 and 2013 with our earnings release filing today. Consistent with prior periods we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or the other operating expense line item.","In the North America segment, revenue grew 24% to $13.41 billion. Media revenue grew 5% to $2.97 billion. EGM revenue grew 31% to $10.25 billion, representing 76% of North America revenues.","North America segment operating income increased 79% to $517 million, a 3.9% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange, North America segment operating income increased 77%.","In the international segment, revenue decreased 2% to $7.74 billion. Excluding the $1.3 billion year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 14%. Media revenue decreased 12% to $2.32 billion or increased 2%, excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 4% to $5.38 billion or 21%, excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 69% of international revenues.","International segment operating loss was $76 million, compared to a loss of $33 million in the prior year period. The unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, international segment operating loss was $78 million.","In the Amazon Web Services segment, revenue grew 49% to $1.57 billion. Amazon Web Services segment operating income increased 8% to $265 million, a 16.9% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange, AWS segment operating income decreased 13%.","Consolidated segment operating income increased 41% to $706 million or 3.1% of revenue, up approximately 60 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI increased 45%.","Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income was $255 million compared to $146 million in the prior year period.","Our income tax expense was $71 million. GAAP net loss was $57 million or negative $0.12 per diluted share, compared with a net income of $108 million and $0.23 per diluted share.","Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $5.12 billion year-over-year to $13.78 billion. Inventory increased 10% to $7.37 billion and inventory turns were 8.8, down from 9.1 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 13% to $11.92 billion and accounts payable days increased to 70 from 68 in the prior year.","I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.","As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance.","Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.","For Q2, 2015 we expect net sales of between $20.6 billion and $22.8 billion or growth of between 7% and 18%. This guidance anticipates approximately 750 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates.","GAAP operating income or loss to be between a $500 million loss and a positive $50 million of income, compared to $15 million loss in second quarter 2014. This includes approximately $600 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.","We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $100 million and $650 million, compared to $404 million in the second quarter of 2014.","We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.","Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move on to questions.","Phil Hardin","Great. Thanks, Brian. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Pitz with Jefferies and Company. Please proceed. Your line is live.","Brian Pitz","Thank you. Can you share with us any updated metrics for Prime Now, how sticky is it in terms of repeat customers, average order value or other details? And also any update on your fulfillments center plans for the year, if you can disclose specific numbers, maybe you could just qualitatively tell us your focus either domestic versus international or sortation versus traditional FC build out? Thanks.","Tom Szkutak","Sure. On Prime Now, we don\u2019t have specific metrics we want to share today. But we have expanded to seven cities with more on the way. Customers are really enjoying the one hour and two delivery of tens of thousands of daily essential products.","So the response has been great. We will point out that our operations network that was \u2013 has been building for the last 20 years helps make Prime Now a viable proposition for us and scale makes a possible. So really so far customer responses are great.","Brian Olsavsky","And Brian on FCs, you know, as we've done prior years, it\u2019s early in the year and as we progress through the year we'll give you some updates on how many. But as a reminder we ended the year with 109 fulfillment centers around the world and we'll update you as we go.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Ross Sandler","Great. Thanks for the new disclosure guys, really helpful. I guess, just speaking, you know, now a little bit we all understand the investments you are guys are making on international, retail, and maybe with our margins been declining.","Can you give us a little color on what's driving up the North America retail segment margin and I guess in the context of that, just talk about the impact that Prime is having on the retail margin for both North America and International? Thanks.","Brian Olsavsky","Yes, sure. So North America operating margin up a 120 basis points year-over-year to 3.9%. Lot of good cost efficiency, but again we're continuing to invest so actively as we build the Prime platform and that we have customers. So you'll see lot of invention definitely to see the Prime platform, which things like Video Content, Prime Music, as we talk about Prime Now devices that will continue to build fulfillment centers for selection and expansion in FBA. So that\u2019s \u2013 its generally what's driving the operating margin in North America.","Tom Szkutak","And just to add on to that, we're \u2013 we gave metrics last quarter about Prime. It\u2019s growing very fast. As Brian said, we're feeding the platform and certainly common thing with category expansion, new FCs, original content, Prime Instant Video devices, Prime Now. The common theme is they are all really intertwined with Prime and inextricably to our consumer business in Prime.","So it\u2019s just we're happy to do it. And the last quarter we gave an indication of the growth rates after being added for 10 year. So we're super excited to have the platform and to continue to invest in it.","Ross Sandler","Great. Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.","Douglas Anmuth","Thanks for taking the question. Can you guys talk a little bit more just about the international business and kind of the key initiatives here in terms of getting the growth to reaccelerate some of these levels?","And then also perhaps little bit more on your strategy. In China how you are thinking about the cost structure there, relative to previous years and some of the key ways you might be able to rationalize things there? Thanks.","Brian Olsavsky","Yes, let me start with China. So, I think you'll see a lot invention, you're seeing a lot of invention from us in China right now. Amazon is trusted source of authentic [ph] international products and that\u2019s really what we're doubling down on now with a Amazon global store on our own site, which gives Chinese customers access to over 1 million Amazon products globally.","And then the team of flagship store for international brands which you've heard about giving thousands of direct imported products access to \u2013 customer\u2019s access to these products and those happen to be stocked and ready to ship from our fulfillment centers in China. So that\u2019s an added benefit. 25% of those are exclusive \u2013 over 25% of those exclusives to Amazon.","So we continue to be selective in our investments there, but we're taking the long-term view and we have hopes for the new initiatives along the global \u2013 with the global store and the team of flagship store.","Tom Szkutak","In terms of the growth for total international, just maybe some comments first about the current quarter and then I'll elaborate little bit further. But the growth was down 2% on a dollar basis, up 14% on local currency basis. So we did see a little bit of improvement in terms of growth rate acceleration versus last couple of quarters.","And in addition to the things that Brian mentioned earlier about the Prime platform, that\u2019s something that we're doing globally. And so we're certainly \u2013 all those things we're working on globally. So those are things that at least in most geographies we have today.","One thing to keep in mind also, as you look at growth rate for Q1, is last year Q1 we talked about in April 1st there was a consumption tax increase in Japan. We had some \u2013we think some pre-buys in Q1 and we're overlapping that in Q1 of this year. So it\u2019s a headwind if you think about it for Q1.","But we're looking \u2013 we think there is still a big opportunity, as we mentioned last call, big opportunity with Prime. Prime is growing at a faster rate. We think there is still a great opportunity to add unique selection to \u2013 for category expansion. And again, so we're going to continue feed the Prime platform as we talked about, continue to add selection in a lot of categories.","We're also very excited about India, if you take a look at our results for \u2013 from an operating profit standpoint, you see that it was approximately negative 76 million on a dollar basis. If you back out exchange that\u2019s approximately breakeven, included in there we certainly have a sizeable step up in investment in India. And we're super excited from what we see there right now. We think its very big opportunity and we're investing appropriately for that big opportunity.","So those are some of things that we're working on and we think there \u2013 we still have a lot of opportunity there moving forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.","Brian Nowak","Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one is on the new inter US [ph] disclosure. Can you just help us on accounting question. The AWS data center costs related to the core e-commerce business, are those being allocated to North America and International, are those being fully embedded into the AWS segment?","And then a second question goes back to China. I guess any early learnings from the team of [ph] partnership and whether you have any thoughts or potentially a lower capital intensive grow strategy in China?","Tom Szkutak","To answer you first question, yes, they are, the associated infrastructure cost to run our North America and International consumer business those costs, those infrastructure costs are being allocated to those segments.","The second question in terms of China, its early, we're liking \u2013 certainly some of things that we're seeing there, but there is not a lot I can add to that at this stage.","Brian Nowak","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert Baird.","Colin Sebastian","Great. Thanks. Maybe just another follow up on the new segment disclosures. Thanks for breaking it out. You know if we assume that the advertising segment is reasonably profitable than the implication is then that the core retail business is very modestly profitable close to breakeven.","And just wondering what the thought process and strategy is behind that. If in a sense there is some subsidy to the retail side being used as you build market share in the core business? Thanks.","Tom Szkutak","Yes, I think the best way to think about it is, we certainly have an advertising part of our North American consume segments. But the way you should think about it is, we are making some great investments for the long-term and that\u2019s really what's reflected in the operating results that you are seeing in terms of \u2013 so it is certainly impacting the operating margins both for North American and International.","So it\u2019s the things that we \u2013 both Brian and I talked about that we're doing globally to support Prime platform all of those things that we mentioned, video content, original content, Prime Now, category expansion, investing on behalf of FBA, which also helps Prime devices. Those are all intertwined and certainly part of that. And then some of the things outside of that are more specifically related to International in addition to those are some of geographic stuff that we talked about.","So I think you should think about it that way that certainly think its big opportunity and again, one of the reasons I want to give you an update, last quarter on Prime growth and you can see that that\u2019s going very well. And so we're feeding that and that\u2019s what we have been doing and that\u2019s what you see also and certainly results that you are seeing today.","Colin Sebastian","Very helpful. Thanks very much.","Tom Szkutak","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark May with Citi.","Mark May","Thanks for taking my questions. On the international revenue I believe there is probably \u2013 there's a real distinction here between some of your more established countries and some of your more emerging countries. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about for Germany and the UK and Japan and some of the more established markets, what the profit profile of those markets look like and just how much of the international segment results are being \u2013 losses being held back by a handful of the more emerging markets.","And then a question on AWS pricing. It seemed like the pricing environment was pretty competitive last year. What are you seeing in the market this year and what are your expectations going forward? Are you expecting a bit more of a stable pricing environment? Thanks.","Tom Szkutak","Yes, in terms of International, we're not breaking out individual country results. The one thing that could mentioned around from a country perspective was India in terms of which \u2013 it certainly stepped up our investment. And if you look at it year-over-year, so that\u2019s certainly reflected in the numbers that you are seeing.","In terms of AWS, we've had 48 price decreases since inception. The team is doing a terrific job in terms of working on behalf of customers to pass on savings as they see it. But in terms of any comment on what to expect going forward there is not really much to add there.","Brian Olsavsky","Its probably is worth adding that, although prices are factor, the primary factor for customers choosing with AWS is really around their ability to move quickly and to be nimble and agile.","And so we're very pleased with the kind of continued adoption and usage growth we've seen and obviously the benefits of AWS around their ability \u2013 customers ability to be nimble as a primary factor there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein.","Carlos Kirjner","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have two. My first question is about the profitability of the North America segment. You mentioned a few minutes ago that investments in Prime were part of the \u2013 most of the explanation for what is a relatively low 3.9% margin in North America. Which are much lower than the 5% to 6% EBIT margin that [indiscernible] retailer books? Despite a large benefit of booking repeat net.","Here's the question. Prime is not new in North America. You probably have tens of millions of Prime users in the US, 30, 40, 50 million. Yet margins are still low. What gives you confidence that the investments that you are making will pay off?","Second question on AWS, if you look at expenses like R&D, perhaps even the fixed component of marketing and sales, which presumably one day will be really fixed, are this still growing significantly? In other words, is there room for significant margin expansion at some point in the future when AWS, I don\u2019t know 2 to 5 or 10 times its current size or do you expect the need to scale up at the same rate as revenues? Thank you.","Tom Szkutak","In terms of your first question, specifically related to North America, one of the \u2013 our comments we made last quarter that we disclosed was, we disclosed the growth rate globally, as well as the growth rate in the US. And the growth rate in US after 10 years is up 50%, it was 50% year-over-year. And so 2014 versus 2013 in terms of Prime membership and that\u2019s after a price increase on Prime from 79 to 99.","And so, it gives you a feel for the work that we put into Prime to make that experience great for customers and the value that we are giving them. So again, given that growth. And so, that\u2019s what \u2013 that\u2019s certainly one of the things that gives us comfort, but when we look at the individual pieces we like what we see, so in other words, some of the investments we're making, I think as we've talked about in the past, I'll give one example would be video content, both original and license content.","We mentioned last call that we spent approximately $1.3 billion on content globally for Prime customers and what we've seen and to date is was certainly still an investment for us, its certainly impacting our operating results, but we like what we see. We see customers who come in through our free trial pipeline if you will for video content. They convert it at a higher rate. We see \u2013 we have a great retention of Prime members, but those who scream actually, we retain those at a higher rate and we bring in new customers through our video pipeline.","The purchasing pattern that we have for those customers is very similar to those who come in from other pipeline. So in other words, they are buying very good from a physical product standpoint, as well as digital. So they are buying a diverse set of products.","So in other words, this video content that we're spending is helping us customers who buy consumable from us, they will buy clothing from us, they will buy shoes from us, they will buy electronics, they will buy media items.","So that\u2019s what we're seeing and so again it\u2019s some of these things are very early. We'll have to over time how efficient they are, but each period we go we keep the data that we see we're encouraged. And so that\u2019s just one example.","But that\u2019s why we're investing a lot in Prime and we think it\u2019s a great \u2013 the Prime platform if you will, and we think it\u2019s a great opportunity and again as I mentioned earlier all these things we're investing in are very intertwined.","Brian Olsavsky","And Carlos, I think you had a question about AWS. From our perspective its business that\u2019s still really in day one. A lot of potential innovation in front of us we believe. And so you can see we're putting a lot of CapEx obviously there and including capital leases and we think over time we will be able to generate significant free cash flow with stronger ROICs.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.","Mark Mahaney","Thanks. Thanks. I want to go back on North America retail margins and just I want to try to figure out, I know you're not going to go, where they could go, but if we look in the past, I assume that if the base o2014 and in full year 2013 was probably depressed for North American retail margins, North American segment margins and if we look back five or six years, it's probable that that was running at kind of mid to high single digits CSOI margins. Kind of similar to the incremental margins you just reported for that segment 8.7%.","So I guess the big question I want to ask is, is there a structural change in the North American retail business over the next \u2013 this year and the next couple years versus what you had call it in 2004 to 2009 when the margins were \u2013 I think were pretty clearly higher and now you're going to be recovering to those levels. That's what I'm trying to get at. Any color would be great? Thanks.","Tom Szkutak","Yes, the \u2013 thanks for the question Mark. Just in terms of going forward, we're not giving any specific guidance, beyond the current quarter. So I can't predict for you what could happen. But what you mentioned is, and some of the periods you were describing as you mentioned what our business look like, several years ago when we Prime was nascent and we were early \u2013 a bit earlier business.","And so we go through different cycles. We're certainly still investing very heavily. That being said, we \u2013 as I mentioned last quarter, we're spending time on making sure that we get productivity. So we're working on both investing heavily in the business, we're working on fixed and variable productivity in other areas, putting a lot more energy into it.","That\u2019s what's helping us with the improvement that Prime mentioned in terms of operating margins year-over-year, it\u2019s a number of different aspects, but certainly mix of business and some productivity is certainly impacting that.","But again we think there is opportunities to improve margins over time, you'll have to stay tuned on that to see what it looks like. But we certainly as you can see from not only results, but some of the data points that we've given over the last several quarters we are investing heavily in the business, again, because we like what we see and Prime growing so dramatically globally after being in it for long time and we think that that\u2019s a great platform to feed.","Mark Mahaney","Okay. Thanks, Tom.","Operator","Our next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.","Justin Post","Hey, couple of questions on margins. First on AWS a think those are higher than most of us were thinking. Appreciate the disclosure. What is driving your margin versus your pricing decision? How do you think about passenger cost efficiencies or potential margin growth through your customers.","And then secondly on international margins you know, clearly below history, below the US, what kind of things need to happen to get those at least to where the US is today much less back to where they were six or seven years ago? Thank you.","Tom Szkutak","Justin I'll take the AWS portion of the question first. So our model over the long-term really has been to innovate and to use our scale and position to be able to pass savings along to customers. And so we've had 48 price decreases since we launched.","As I talked about earlier, that\u2019s one factor customers save a lot of money, but the primary motivator is really around the innovation that AWS enables and the ability for developers to move really quickly.","Brian Olsavsky","And in terms of international, again as you mentioned Justin, we are investing a lot right now which impacts the margins there again ex-exchange think of it as approximately breakeven for the quarter. And so again, we're continuing to invest. We're investing in all the things that we talked about related to the platform, continue invest in some emerging geographies, most notably certainly India with the step up given the experience we have.","And so we are optimistic over time. We have a lot to do there, we think it\u2019s a great opportunity for us. And so that\u2019s what we're doing, but we're excited about the opportunity and that\u2019s why you see the results that you're seeing there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.","Heath Terry","Great. Thanks. Just wondering if you could give us a sense of how we should think about the run rate of CapEx and capital lease obligations in the quarter as any sort of indication for full-year and the trajectory of investment in fulfillment and data centers.","And then just on the question of a Prime and Prime Video, as we think about the way that media growth is trending now, is there a point where you start to think of allocating Prime, some of those Prime revenues to media to account for the \u2013 as Prime Video usage increases?","Brian Olsavsky","Yes, in terms of the CapEx question, there is certainly two pieces of that, there is the consumer, the North American, International piece, is a number pieces, but certainly two largest pieces which certainly be the CapEx associated with fulfillment and the second would be infrastructure. And again it\u2019s for AWS versus North America, and International.","I'll take the North America and International first. We're seeing good growth and year-over-year in terms of overall unit growth, in terms of revenue growth, certainly ex-exchange, as I mentioned earlier, it\u2019s early in the year. So we do every year we'll continue to monitor the growth there. We're making plans for the rest of the year and we'll get back to you as we progress throughout the year in terms of what fulfillment capacity will need to support that growth this year.","In terms of web services, it\u2019s obviously growing extremely fast. We saw some acceleration of growth from a revenue perspective. Over the last few quarters here, usage is growing faster than that, so we will be deploying more capital as we go there.","In terms of the amounts, specific amounts, we're not giving guidance on that today and one of the reasons it is growing so fast that we wan to make sure we put the right amount of capital in place and the teams has done a great job doing all the planning and the execution around that, so that\u2019s what we're doing there.","In terms of media, I am not fully sure I understood the question, but as it relates to I think its video, could you repeat the part of that\u2026","Heath Terry","Right. Was just getting a sense of as video becomes such a \u2013 becomes a bigger part of the Prime value proposition, do you start to allocate some of the annual revenues from Prime more directly into that media segment. Because of the level of usage associated with Prime Video versus the shipping benefits of Prime?","Tom Szkutak","Heath, we do allocate some Prime to account for the video.","Heath Terry","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Tom Szkutak","Thanks for the question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.","Gene Munster","Good afternoon. Could you talk little bit about the focus on the same day and same hour and specifically about the incremental investments and just some context to how big of those investments are and separately is what the strategic advantages, there is something ultimately obviously to improve the experience. But do you see in any of your data that this opens you up to be more competitive with traditional retailers? Thanks.","Tom Szkutak","Yes, I'll take that one. We certainly as I said earlier, we see this as a natural extension of our existing infrastructure investments we've \u2013 the 109 fulfillment centers, again very close to customers. It allows us and locks for a same day and next-day deliveries. And to its extreme one hour and two hour deliveries as you've seen with Prime now.","So we're not forecasting or giving much more on that, but we definitely see it as a valuable customer\u2019s proposition, customers and braced it. Again, smaller number of azans [ph] ten to thousands of azans are available for one, two hour delivery and generally in the category, essential products that you would need in short time period.","Brian Olsavsky","And one thing I would add to that as Brian mentioned, earlier as well, we are in seven cities today and there would be more to come. We haven\u2019t said how many, but you should be definitely expecting more to come and we're excited to do that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Peck with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Robert Peck","Yes, thank you. I was wondering Tom, could you give us an update on your retail store strategy. Should we expect stores to open up across the US or is that limited to China, New York.","And that number two, India has come up a couple of times on the call today. China had several structural challenges based on the market there. I was curious if you could differentiate what you are seeing that's different in India versus the China challenges? Thank you.","Tom Szkutak","Yes, in terms of our consumer business, we love the business that we have today. We love \u2013 we think there is a great opportunity to do that to continue to expand the existing business that we have. In terms of other things we have long standing practice of not talking about what we might or might not do there. In terms of the second part India, and China could you repeat that part, I am sorry?","Robert Peck","Sure. So you talked about India a couple of times today on the call. Obviously it's big area of investment focus for the company. China has some structural challenges based on how the marketplace is. I was wondering if you could differentiate what you are seeing in India that makes you optimistic there versus some of the challenges you faced in China?","Tom Szkutak","Yes. Thank you for the question. They are very different, you'll see the growth rate in India is very rapid. We talked about last year and its increasing investment. I think the biggest differences there focused on sellers and the connection of sellers.","A big part of the challenge there is helping sellers all across India to succeed and grow their online businesses, you'll see from our press release that we've launched a new apps for that. So that helps them manage our inventory better and also respond to customer inquires. So that\u2019s probably the biggest difference that we see between India and China. But and still very, very early on in India.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer.","Jason Helfstein","Thanks. So can you talk about how the impact on available third-party SKUs impacts the business, particular in Europe and ultimately what you could do to drive more SKUs through the platform, whether it's lowering third-party rates or is it other factors to try to get more SKUs on their after a third-party?. Thanks.","Tom Szkutak","We spent a tremendous amount of time on our seller business over the years and trying to improve both the experience for sellers, as well as customers. And we've done a lot of interesting things to help sellers and that\u2019s why you see the results that we're seeing today 44% of our units today, as of this quarter, our third party units, that\u2019s up about 400 basis points from last year.","Certainly one of the things that we've talked about its most, that\u2019s notable is fulfillment by Amazon. And so the benefit for sellers is they get to take advantage of our multi newer fulfillment network globally, we have a 109 fulfillment centers globally, as well as our customers get to take advantage of that as prime numbers where we offer in those geography.","So it\u2019s really a great benefit for sellers, its good for sellers, its good for customers and we believe good for share owners too. So again, we're very excited, number of different things we're working on, but certainly one of the drivers along with all of the things that I mentioned is certainly FBA is very helpful.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Miller with William Blair and Company","Mark Miller","Hi, good afternoon. Looking at the service sales less the AWS revenues you've got a $4 billion in fees mostly coming from the marketplace off a strong mid-30%. Help us think about the cost that go against those marketplace fees and specifically within fulfillment if you could help us understand how much of the cost is going against 3P are basically FBA fulfillment, perhaps percent of units part of the FC's that are going to 3P?","Tom Szkutak","So Mark, I can't comment on the derive number, but I can say that FBA continues to grow really well, it\u2019s become a bigger and bigger part of our third party mix over the years. I think we gave you an update in Q4 that it was more than 40% of our third party units.","Obviously in the fulfillment line there is cost associated with that as well, as our other third party units as well I think like payment processing and other cost that we incur. So I don\u2019t know if there is much more we can say about that.","Mark Miller","If I can insert a second question, given the upside and profitability in the first quarter, the guidance for the second quarter quite a bit lower. What are the factors you see that are negatives or I guess otherwise people can I think you are sandbagging? Thanks.","Tom Szkutak","Let's take a look at the guidance that we gave, again, we gave as we have in previous quarters, we gave the wide range and from a consolidate segment operating standpoint we gave a 100 to 650, the implied margin at the lower end, the higher end is approximately 50 basis points upwards to 2.9%.","This quarter in Q1 we were up 60 basis points year-over-year in total at the upper end of that forecast implied would be up 80 basis points, so again, that\u2019s the range and we think its appropriate range for Q2.","Operator","Our final question comes from Ron Josey with JMP Securities.","Ron Josey","Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just going back to margins a little bit more on AWS. As a look at the seasonality, I'm wondering if there's any seasonality in margins because it looks like margins 2Q and 3Q came in sub 10% versus mid teens in 4Q and 1Q and then sort of looking at it a different way, maybe given the different profitability into 2Q of last year, did that have any impact on the pricing cuts in April?. Thanks very much.","Tom Szkutak","So, let's start with the increase you saw sequentially in margin from Q2 or Q3 to Q4 of 2014, so revenue grew by about 21.5% sequentially and expense grew by around 10% so obviously we were growing faster in top line and expenses.","Over the long-term improvements and efficiency and innovation allow us to drive that kind of cost out of the business. I mean there is certainly was an impact with pricing changes and you probably saw some of that in Q2 as well, but over the long-term that\u2019s the model we follow.","Ron Josey","Great. Thank you.","Tom Szkutak","And with that, thank you joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on investor relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter."],"1145":["Amazon.com, Inc.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q4 2015 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Phil Hardin. Please go ahead.","Phil Hardin","Hello and welcome to our Q4 2015 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.","The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's view as of today, January 28, 2016 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.","During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2014.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Brian.","Brian Olsavsky","Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our fourth quarter financial results. Trailing 12-months operating cash flow increased 74% to $11.9 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $7.3 billion, up from $1.9 billion.","Trailing 12-month free cash flow less lease principle repayments increased to $4.7 billion, up from $529 million. Trailing 12-month free cash flow less finance lease principle repayments and assets acquired under capital leases increased to $2.5 billion, up from an outflow of $2.2 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.6 billion.","Capital expenditures does not include the impact of property and equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligations. These capital expenditures and capital leases reflect additional investments in support of continued business growth, due to investments in technology infrastructure, the majority of which is to support AWS, and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.","The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 490 million shares, compared with 483 million one year ago. Worldwide revenue increased 22% to $35.7 billion, or 26% excluding the $1.2 billion unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Worldwide paid unit growth was 26%.","Worldwide active customer accounts were approximately 304 million. Excluding customers who only had free orders in the preceding 12-month period, worldwide active customer accounts were approximately 280 million, up from approximately 254 million in the comparable prior year period.","Worldwide paid Prime members increased 51% year-over-year. Worldwide seller units represented 47% of paid units. Fulfillment by Amazon or FBA units represented nearly 50% of seller units. Worldwide active Amazon Web Services customers exceeded 1 million.","Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $24.3 billion or 68.1% of revenue, compared with 70.5%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $9.7 billion or 27.1% of sales, up approximately 100 basis points year-over-year.","Fulfillment was $4.4 billion or 12.3% of revenue, compared with 11.3%. Tech and content was $3.2 billion or 9% of revenue, compared with 8.2%. Marketing was $1.7 billion or 4.8% of revenue, compared with 5.1%.","Now I'll talk about our segment results. As a reminder, in the first quarter we changed our reportable segments to report North America, international, and Amazon web services. Consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments, our stock-based compensation, or the other operating expense line item.","In the North America segment, revenue grew 24% to $21.5 billion. Media revenue grew 11% to $3.9 billion or 12% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 28% to $17.3 billion.","North America segment operating income was $1 billion, a 4.7% operating margin, compared with $733 million in the prior year period. North America segment operating income includes $6 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange.","In the international segment, revenue grew 12% to $11.8 billion. Excluding the $1.1 billion year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 22%. Media revenue decreased 3% to $3.3 billion or increased 5% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 19% to $8.5 billion or 31% excluding foreign exchange.","International segment operating income was $60 million, compared with $65 million in the prior year. International segment operating income includes $47 million of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange.","In the Amazon Web Services segment, revenue grew 69% to $2.4 billion. Amazon Web Services segment operating income was $687 million, a 28.5% operating margin, compared with $240 million in the prior year period. AWS segment operating income includes $60 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange.","Consolidated segment operating income was $1.8 billion or 4.9% of revenue, up approximately 140 basis points year-over-year. CSOI includes $20 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange.","Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 88% to $1.1 billion.","Our income tax expense was $453 million. GAAP net income was $482 million or $1 per diluted share, compared with a net income of $214 million and $0.45 per diluted share.","Now I'll discuss the full year results. Revenue increased 20% to $107 billion or 26% excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. North America revenue grew 25% to $63.7 billion or 26% excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. International revenue grew 6% to $35.4 billion or 21% excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange.","Excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange, Germany revenue grew 18%. Japan revenue grew 19%, and UK revenue grew 16%.

CSOI includes $16 [ph] million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income was $2.2 billion, compared with $178 million in the prior year.","Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $2.4 billion year-over-year to $19.8 billion. Inventory increased 23% to $10.2 billion. And inventory turns were 8.5, down from 8.6 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels, and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 24% to $20.4 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 77 from 73 in the prior year.","I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions.","Our results are inherently unpredictable, and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy, and customer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.","As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters, and changes to our effective tax rate can all have a material effect on guidance.","Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, recording further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently.","For Q1 2016, we expect net sales of between $26.5 billion and $29 billion or growth of between 17% and 28%. This guidance anticipates approximately 130 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates.","GAAP operating income to be between $100 million and $700 million, compared with $255 million in first quarter of 2015. This includes approximately $600 million for stock-based compensation and other operating expenses net.","We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense net, to be between $700 million and $1.3 billion, compared with $706 million in the first quarter of 2015.","We are grateful to our customers and remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience. We believe putting customers first, is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.","Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move on to questions.","Phil Hardin","Great. Thanks, Brian. Let's move onto the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is coming from analyst Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Stephen Ju","Hey, thanks. So Brian, I think in the past you've given some indication as to what usage growth may be at AWS. I was wondering if you have an update for that in the fourth quarter.","And secondarily, is there any way to characterize what the pricing environment is right now for AWS as well? Thank you.","Brian Olsavsky","Yes, thanks, Stephen. No, I don't have a usage growth number for you. We'll say we're - it's been very strong. And AWS revenue is on a, just short of a $10 billion run rate at the end of Q4.","As far as pricing is concerned, we had a price reduction in January for our EC2 services. It was our 51st price reduction since we launched AWS years ago. And generally what we find is that price is important. But so is speed and agility for customers and the ability to deliver services and features that were beneficial to them.","I will point out that we added 722 new features and services in 2015 and that was up 40% year-over-year. So we feel we have a lead in this space and we don't take it for granted and we want to serve customers better each year.","Stephen Ju","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from analyst Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.","Jason Helfstein","Thank you. Can you talk a little bit about the dynamics in fourth quarter eCommerce, particularly in the US? Did we see more aggressive promotional activity and maybe talk about how you tried to work that to continue to drive the Prime number of members going forward? Thanks.","Brian Olsavsky","Sure. Well, what I can say is our approach to pricing has not changed. And through Q4 [ph] we did everything we could to have the best prices available for customers and in stock in time for the holiday.","Another dynamic of Q4 was that it was a huge FBA quarter, nearly 50% of our third party units were FBA and our third party units were also up to 47% of our paid units, up 400 basis points year-over-year.","So a really strong quarter for our FBA sellers using our FBA services. It did put a lot of demands on our warehouses and we were full. It was a very busy quarter and it did increase some of our variable costs as a result, primarily in the US, but a very strong quarter for FBA. It exceeded our - even our expectations.","Jason Helfstein","Perhaps how are you able to integrate that into holiday promotions?","Brian Olsavsky","I'm sorry. You cut off there. Could you repeat your question?","Jason Helfstein","Sure. Just any additional color around Prime and how you were able to integrate that into holiday promotions?","Brian Olsavsky","Nothing specific. I will say, you know, one interesting enhancement this year was our Prime Now service, which allowed people order in selected markets up until 11.59 on New Year, excuse me, Christmas Eve. So that was a valuable service to many late shoppers, last-minute shoppers.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Aram Rubinson","Hey. Thanks very much. Two questions both on the logistics side. It seems pretty clear that you guys are trafficking in some old world assets, like truck trailers and ship lanes and air fields.","Can you help give us a sense as to maybe what we're trying to accomplish with that, if it's defensive to protect your service to your existing customers or if you're looking to maybe start new businesses with those assets?","Brian Olsavsky","Sure, Aram. Thanks for your question. I would say what we've found is in order to serve \u2013 properly serve our customers at peak. We've needed to add more of our own logistics to supplement our existing partners. That's not meant to replace them.","And those carriers are just not - no longer able to handle all of our capacity that we need at peak. They have been and continue to be great partners. And we look forward to working with them in the future.","It's just we've had to add some resources on our own. You mentioned trucks. The Amazon trucks, we did invest in those - this past year. We use those primarily for movement between our warehouses and our source centers.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Nowak","Thanks for taking my questions. I've got two. The first one is just on gross margins. I think they were down of about 200 basis points sequentially. It's the biggest fall in the fourth quarter in quite sometime. Anything you call out there, is the devices are more - sortation center, is anything pressuring gross margins we should think about in the fourth quarter?","And then on the fulfillment line, you mentioned FBA being a big driver of the growth in the fulfillment costs. Anything else you would call out leading to incremental fulfillment costs, maybe India or something else? Thanks.","Brian Olsavsky","No. And again, keep in mind that the fulfillment as a percent of revenue is impacted by the calculation of FBA revenue being a net number as opposed to a full revenue number. But our fulfillment costs per unit actually decreased year-over-year. It just we are now shipping more and more of our, other demand out of our warehouses, because of the strength in retail and FBA.","On gross margin, I would - first I'll caution you and say, we would encourage you to look at free cash flow, which was \u2013 grew at minimum of $4 billion on each of the metrics that we point out and our profit which was up 88% year-over-year.","If you look sequentially, also keep in mind that in Q3 when it was up 500 basis points year-over-year, that was lapping the write-down of our Amazon phone [ph] inventory the prior year. So there is a little bit of noise in the Q3 number.","But generally, again, we're happy with the ability to service customers, the reaction of customers in Q4, and the bottom line results that we had.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird Equity Research. Please proceed with your question.","Colin Sebastian","Great, thanks. One follow-up and then another question. On the logistics and transportation side, I was curious if that's to date just to supplement some of the other carriers. But more broadly or longer term, is there an ambition from the services side to perhaps provide capacity to other companies.","And then on AWS margins, I was just wondering if we should expect more leverage there going forward and whether Q1, whether that should demonstrate some seasonality versus what we've seen in terms of sequential growth in prior years? Thank you.","Brian Olsavsky","Sure. Let me work backwards. We don't give guidance by segment. So we cannot really comment on AWS specifically in Q1. And the operational improvements, excuse me, the gross margin, operating margin year-over-year that we've seen in the AWS business has been heavily driven by operating efficiencies, both purchase reductions and purchase prices and also efficiency in driving greater utilization of the assets that we have.","So we're very happy with that. Keep in mind that we did have a - although the year-over-year increase in capital expenditures and capital leases was not as great as we saw in 2013 to 2014, we did spend over $9 billion on those, on capital expenditures and capital lease obligations, up from prior year was, excuse me\u2026","Operator","Thank you. Our next question\u2026","Brian Olsavsky","Sorry, let me finish my answer to him, please. We grew up \u2013 we grew from in the $5 billion range in 2013 to $8.9 billion in 2014 and now over $9 billion in 2015.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Senna with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Ken Senna","Hi. So lot of headlines around Amazon's activity at Sundance I just was hoping you could maybe expand once more on the video strategy and specifically are you seeing an inflection in Prime Video usage. And maybe just also on your streaming partners program, what the general reception is like? Thank you.","Brian Olsavsky","Sure. We're very thrilled with the customer response to Prime Video. Again, when Prime Video is used by our Prime members, it drives adoption and retention, higher free trial conversion rates, and higher renewal rates for subscribers. So what we were encouraged by in Q4 was that globally we doubled the number of \u2013 our Prime members doubled the number of viewing hours of the Prime Video year-over-year. And internationally, we had twice as member Prime members streaming year-over-year. So very encouraged by the pickup and the response of customers.","The other comment I would say about video is we're very happy with the Amazon Studios content, in particular. We've had some great success in 2014 and 2015. As you probably know, Transparent has won multiple Golden Globes and Emmys, both for actors and for the show itself. Mozart in the Jungle just won two Golden Globe Awards.","So very, very pleased with the critical acclaim to the Amazon Studios content and we've got a lot of new content coming out this year. Catastrophe Season 2, Bosch Season 2, we're all looking forward to.","And in February, we will have Chi-Raq, our first original movie that we got to work with Spike Lee on, which won many critical, made many critics' best film list in 2015. That will be coming to Prime Video in February.","Phil Hardin","Just to add, this is Phil. On the question about the streaming partners program, so that's our new over the top streaming subscription program for Prime Members. We think it's a really convenient way for them to access additional content, content sources like Showtime and Starz. And it's really early, so it's just out of the gate. But we've been very pleased with what we've seen so far.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Mahaney","Two things, please. Any callouts on the macro side? Occasionally you called things out, anything this time? And then can you talk a little bit about Amazon business, I know, there is a little bit of a line in the press release on it. I know you've had this for a couple of years. But any indications to materiality of that, the kind of momentum it's gaining, the kind of traction it's gaining? Thank you.","Brian Olsavsky","Sure, Mark. Thanks for your questions. No macroeconomic comments. Again, we feel we're very encouraged by the customer response to our offerings in Q4. Amazon business, yes, in April you may remember we launched it as a marketplace with specific features and benefits for businesses.","That - Amazon business now serves more than 200,000 businesses from small organizations to Fortune 500 companies. So it's still early, but we're encouraged and we think we're creating some value, a lot of value for our business customers.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Mark May","Thanks. Brian, question on international retail business. I think you added well over a billion in revenue year-on-year in the quarter, but from a CSOI perspective, you really didn't see any improvement there. I'm sure there is, there are a lot of different things going on.","I just wondered if you could unpack that a little bit and give us a sense of, you know, what profitability looks like maybe in some of your more mature, established countries and regions, relative to the investments you were making in other countries, so that we can kind of get a better picture of what's actually going on under the hood there? Thanks.","Brian Olsavsky","Sure, Mark. Thanks for your question. We are very pleased by the international growth, 22% FX neutral, was up 1000 basis points year-over-year. We saw that the - we told you the Prime growth, Prime membership growth of 50% in-- excuse me, 51% globally, 47% in the US means that the international Prime programs grew at a faster clip than that.","So very pleased with the up-tick. We rolled out a lot of additional Prime features internationally as well this year, from FREE Same-Day to Prime Now to Prime Music and Prime Video in Japan, to name a few. So very happy with that.","But in general, if I step back, our investments in national are twofold. First, there's the Prime platform and all the features that I just mentioned, including the fulfillment, adding more fulfillment resources to handle higher and higher retail volumes and very strong FBA program as well.","And then the remainder - the biggest other investment area is obviously India. And we like \u2013 we continue to see, like what we see in India. In Q4 Amazon India was the top e-commerce site in India throughout the very busy diwali shopping season, including the shopping season, according to comScore. And sales by sellers in Q4 were greater than all of 2014 combined in Q4.","So seeing great progress with downloads, innovations for sellers and customers alike. And we like the ramp there and we're continuing to invest in India.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Douglas Anmuth","Thanks for taking the question. Two things. Just first, on the North America EGM growth, if you could just talk about the 28% there and the decel on an easier comp and whether there's any particular factors within that we should be thinking about and perhaps if there was any weather and apparel impact there?","And then second, last quarter, and I don't want to misquote you, but you said something along the lines of being able to invest as you'd like and also deliver good profit and that the pendulum wouldn't swing as far perhaps as it has in the past. Is that statement and thought still hold as you head into '16? Thanks.","Brian Olsavsky","Sure. Let me start with EGM. So EGM growth, North America EGM growth of 28% was actually also the highest in the last 4 years. So we're happy with that. The deceleration you're seeing of 700 basis points is more a function of the Prime Day that we had in Q3, if you remember. We didn't break it out by segment, but we said that Prime Day contributed 200 basis points to our Q3 run rate, revenue growth rate.","So sequentially last year, any North America EGM we dropped from 31% to 27%. This year, it's 35% to 28%. So there is always a - generally a sequential drop in Q4. But certainly very happy with that business and its role in Prime as well, total customer satisfaction.","Your other question, investments. Yes. We continue to have healthy investments as we've stated across the globe. To step back again on that, our general philosophy is we want to find things - businesses that customers love, that can grow to be large, will provide strong financial returns, and are durable that can last for decades.","We think Prime is that. We think marketplace is that. We think AWS is that. And we are constantly looking for a fourth or fifth business that fits that criteria. So - but as we continue to invest, primarily in.","As I said in Prime, the Prime platform, Prime features for customers, expansion for fulfillment capacity as we build out to support 26% unit growth in Q4, for instance and much greater FBA share, and not to mention all the investments in AWS, we are constantly looking for cost efficiencies and fixing variable productivity.","I think a thing to think about is the investments will ebb and flow over time, but our focus on cost reductions and improvement on customer experience will be constant.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Heath Terry","Great, thanks. I was wondering if you could give us a sense, you know, as we look at the slowing growth in AWS, obviously still from an incredibly high level and still very strong growth there. But take - try and take that into context with the growth in margins that you keep seeing in that business to levels that certainly seem a lot higher than you would anticipate for an Amazon business.","Is there any capacity constraint or management that, that's driving pricing strategy in AWS? We've heard the comments about the number of availability zones that are being launched this year, which is obviously about, a big part of driving incremental capacity in that business and just trying to balance those, think about how we should balance those three things?","Brian Olsavsky","Sure. Let me work backwards from your footprint question or comment. We have - we just announced Korea as a region and we'll be adding five more regions in the next, in the future, in the near future, as we mentioned.","CapEx, let me start with that first. CapEx, we've seen great efficiencies in capital expenditures, particularly in AWS. And we continue to work on better purchase efficiencies and driving utilization rates in our data centers. CapEx, as I mentioned, grew quite a bit in 2014 and grew even more to over $9 billion across all of our capital expenditures and capital leases in 2015.","From the new regions, they are not the major driver in any way. Most of our capacity and capital and capital leases in AWS is to service existing regions and existing customers demand growth. But there is certainly expenditures when we open up new regions. Some of that is not always in the year that we open the region. So we spent a good bit on those new regions already in 2015.","But as far as pricing, there's no capacity constraint, and I would a little bit dispute the deceleration comment on, yes, on a percentage basis, 69% is lower than Q3. But as I said before, we're approaching a $10 billion run rate in this business.","On a dollar basis, we continue to grow \u2013 we saw the greatest growth year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter and, again, we continue to invent, now with our price, we continue to innovate on behalf of customers and see great customer response.","Heath Terry","Sure, sure. Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kerry Rice with Needham & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Kerry Rice","Thanks a lot. First question is if you can provide maybe some context around linearity within Q4, more as a, you know, compares to your expectations, obviously you have a ramp up into the holiday season, but was - did December tail off faster than expected or did the ramp up, did it spike higher than you expected?","And then just on the follow-up, maybe can you add some context about how the mobile played a role in the holiday season for Amazon? Thanks.","Phil Hardin","So in terms of - this is Phil. In terms of expectations, I think we were pleased with what we saw this Q4 and, you know, if you look at what we gave for guidance, we were in the upper half of the range there for revenue. So no real callouts there. I think, what was your second part of your question?","Oh, and mobile, we said for a long time continues to be a tailwind for the business. We're working very hard to make sure that it's very easy for customers to buy the things they want to buy and access, a lot of the features they\u2019ve grown accustomed to on the website. And so we're very focused on the convenience factor.","And if you look at some of our new offerings like Prime Now that's available through a mobile app and very convenient for customers. As Brian's mentioned, allowed them to shop even up to Christmas Eve and then have their items delivered in two hours.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","Carlos Kirjner","Thank you. I have two. I want to go back to AWS margins. You talked briefly about purchasing an asset utilization. But do these explain the 800 bps on a year-on-year margin expansion? And are you seeing anything else? Like, is there any impact of scale driving leverage over fixed costs? Is there some benefit from revenue mix shift, like services like Aurora and Redshift growing faster than EC2 or is all the margin expansion due to purchasing and asset utilization? So that's the first question.","And the second, I have a question about your streaming content expenses or cost of revenues to be more precise. Last year you told us they were $1.3 billion, but if you can give us a figure for '15. In lieu of that, can you comment on whether 4Q saw higher than usual costs for streaming content compared to other quarters in the year? Thank you.","Phil Hardin","Carlos, this is Phil. So your question about the AWS margins, that business as they continued to learn and as we continue to invent and get better at designing and operating the infrastructure and assets, we have been able to drive costs out of that business. So that's one of the primary drivers of the improvements that you see in margin year-over-year.","There's also an FX tailwind in there as well, which I think was about $60 million this quarter, which would contribute on a year-over-year basis, which really arises because we're largely priced in dollars, but have assets with local currency costs throughout the world.","As for the streaming content, we haven't given another update this year and haven't given any commentary on the profile quarter-to-quarter.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Brian Pitz with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Pitz","Thank you. You mentioned Amazon Dash in the press release. Can you give us some color around how you're viewing the traction there both with customers and with brands and devices? And then maybe any update on Twitch. How is traffic and user engagement been trending on that site? Thanks.","Phil Hardin","This is Phil. So on the Dash Buttons, we're really excited about what we're delivering there. I think, as you saw in the release, there are some new devices that take advantage of the underlying service that we think will be really convenient for sellers and interesting for device makers. So we're excited about what we're building there. Don't have any stats for you today.","On the Twitch side, we continue to let Twitch do what Twitch does best. And so don't have any updates on numbers there. But they continue to really engage customers and offer a really unique experience, which was one of the reasons we were attracted to them to start with.","Brian Pitz","And maybe just quickly, end of year fulfillment and sortation centers?","Brian Olsavsky","Yes. I'll take that. So we ended the year at 123 fulfillment centers, up a net 14, and we have 23 sortation centers in the US, up four year-over-year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your questions.","Gene Munster","Hey, good afternoon. I want to just quickly revisit the margin pendulum question and some of your comments, as you mentioned that to kind of expect it to ebb and flow. Could you tell us if you expect it to ebb and flow, but moving higher or is ebb and flow just mean that, that it's kind of undetermined in 2016?","And then second follow up is the Robotics, any update in terms of number of robots or how you see that expansion going forward? Thank you.","Brian Olsavsky","Yes, my comment on ebb and flow was more about the investment and also including capital expenditures and capital leases, so not around gross margins. And merely I was pointing out that, again, we've laid out all the invested areas where we're seeing heavy investment.","We continue - we see continuation of that certainly into 2016 and beyond. There are quarter-to-quarter and even year-to-year fluctuations in some accounts, and some investment areas.","But generally we're pretty transparent on where we're investing our dollars. And then against that backdrop, we are always looking for efficiency and the nice thing about growing the top line at such a high clip is we have a lot more areas for opportunity to save money year-over-year and we always look to do that.","Phil Hardin","And this is Phil. On the Kiva question, the last update we've given is more than 30,000 robots. We continue to be really pleased with the program and like what it does in the warehouse, both from a density of storage, as well as from making the jobs easier for the associates who are picking packages, by bringing the packages actually to the associates. But no new numbers on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Justin Post","Thank you. Two questions. Was there any category mix impacts in the quarter on gross margins, that's just a quick one? And then secondly, as you look back at last year, you had some quarters where you really exceeded your guidance on the CSOI line.","Maybe looking back or just looking forward, what are the types of things that causes you to come in at the high end versus maybe the low end when you look back or when you look forward? Thank you.","Brian Olsavsky","Sure. First, on guidance, we keep it pretty consistent process on how we look at guidance and how we value or how we estimate the near-term view of the business. I will point out that Q4 is obviously a very large quarter, the largest revenue quarter by far of the year.","There's a lot of demand that comes in the last six weeks of the year as well. So very, very little visibility at the time of guidance when we do recall. So reason our best projections on a lot of fronts. We think it's a similar - we know it's a consistent process and there are times when we under run and sometimes we over run it.","Phil Hardin","On the - this is Phil. On the category mix question, you know, obviously category mix does play a role in the gross margin. I would say, though, that we're much more focused on operating profit dollars and free cash flow dollars, as we've probably talked about before.","The gross margins are impacted by first party versus third party mix, as well as AWS mix if you're looking at the total for the company. So we're much more focused on the dollars. And no specific categories we're calling out as a driver for gross margin because, again, we're much more focused on the profit dollars.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Vogel with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Vogel","Great. Thanks. Just wonder if you could give an update on the strategy around same-day shipping. How we should think about kind of further expansion of that and kind of what parameters do you guys use to determine what markets to go in? Is it density of the market? Is it proximity of your distribution facilities? Just some color on that would be great.","Brian Olsavsky","So we deliver, really quickly, a couple of ways. One is the same-day that you've seen us rollout in number of markets here in the US. There is Prime Now and we're now in more than 25 metropolitan areas for Prime Now. And delivering for free in two hours is difficult and expensive, but customers love it.","So we feel like this is the natural evolution of our delivery and we're happy to invest in that service. You know, we like what it does for Prime members. We like the convenience factor. And so we're taking a long-term approach and doing what we normally do, which is really focus on continuing to drive greater and greater efficiency.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Please proceed with your questions.","Ron Josey","Great. Thanks for taking the questions. So I wanted to ask little more about North American operating margins. Because I think they expanded just under 50 bps this quarter to 4.7%. And that compares to an average of 200 basis points, thereabouts, expansion of the prior three quarters.","So I'm just wondering if in 4Q maybe higher FBAs cost or something else in there that led to maybe an expansion not as great as we saw in prior quarters. And then following up on the Prime Now question, just now, I'm wondering how hour-delivery or two-hour delivery has changed customer perception of just delivery overall? Thank you.","Brian Olsavsky","Sure. Yes, again, I'll point out that the demand for FBA services was very high, nearly 50% of our third party units, again, were FBA. And the demand for space and services was very large by our seller base, which was great from a lot of standpoints, but did exceed our expectations. But did make our warehouses rather full and did cause us to incur some additional variable costs in the US.","And there is also the dynamic that we were fulfilling more of these units ourselves at our warehouses because of the FBA growth and the retail growth.","Phil Hardin","On the speed of delivery, this is Phil, you know, all I can say is the customers love the service. It's very convenient, and it gives them flexibility and the ability to get products really quickly.","I don't know if there is any big trends we are ready to call out at this point, but they seem to really, really like it. So we're encouraged by that. We're excited to invest in it and excited with what we can do for our Prime members.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Doshi with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.","Neil Doshi","Great. Two questions, please. And one, it seems like the Echo did perform well. Can you talk more broadly about your Internet of Things ambitions and kind of how Echo plays into that strategy?","And then secondly, just wanted to know a little bit more about restaurant delivery. It seems a little bit outside of the wheelhouse. What's the impetus behind doing more in terms of food delivery and what are your ambitions there? Thanks.","Brian Olsavsky","So on the Echo, we like what - how Echo has done. We're really excited about the ecosystem and some of the skills that are being added to Echo, as well as some of the other devices that are taking advantage of Alexa, which is kind of the brains behind Echo.","So we like our device business in general. As you probably saw from the press release, we had a good Q4, where we did almost doubled, or double what we did last year. So very excited about the devices. We like that they pump more energy into Prime and really the whole ecosystem.","Not sure on the Internet of Things, but it's very exciting for devices standpoint. And the brains of Echo are in the AWS cloud. And so, Echo gets new capabilities all the time as Alexa gets better and better.","On the restaurant delivery, it's just another great service we can offer for our Prime members. This is tied in with the Prime Now offering in a handful of cities at this point. And so we have the delivery people going out and making the deliveries in the neighborhoods. And so this is one more really valuable convenient service we can offer for our Prime customers.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question will come from John Blackledge with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.","John Blackledge","Great, thanks. Two questions. First one, shipping costs were higher than we expected. I think it was 12.5% of net revenue versus 11% last year. Just any color on the higher shipping costs? And is that percentage of net revenue a new normal as we are in 2016 now and as we look out?","And then the second question on Prime Now, in 25 markets globally, how should we think about the total number of markets that - additional markets you can enter with the Prime Now offering in 2016? Thanks.","Brian Olsavsky","Sure. As you say, net shipping margin was up 70 basis points year-over-year. Again, this is all tied in with the increase in FBA growth and the demand from Prime members. We're shipping more units \u2013 more of our units, so this ripples through our ship cost per unit, and again, the calculation of ship costs as margin is a percent of revenue and that is impacted by the denominator effect on the FBA sales, being booked at a net revenue.","Phil Hardin","Related to your Prime Now question, this is Phil, we're in more than 25 metropolitan locations. It's - if you've been watching, this rollout's really happened in the last year. So it's been a pretty rapid rollout.","And we're excited to bring it to more places. We don't have a target for you today, but we are working hard to bring it to more and more places. We're outside the US now in a handful of countries in the UK and Japan, and Italy and working to expand. So it's a program we're really excited about and we're happy to bring it to more customers.","Phil Hardin","Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter."],"1585":["Amazon.com, Inc.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded.","For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Darin Manney. Please go ahead.","Darin Manney - Director, Head of Investor Relations, Amazon","Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2016 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. We'll be available for questions after our prepared remarks.","The following discussion and the responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 28, 2016 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.","As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2015.","Now I'll turn the call over to Brian.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Darin. I'll begin with comments on our second quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 42% to $12.7 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $7.3 billion, up from $4.4 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow less lease principal repayments increased to $3.9 billion, up from $2.4 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases increased to $2.5 billion, up from an outflow of $492 million. Worldwide revenue increased 31% to $30.4 billion or 30%, excluding the $166 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Worldwide paid unit growth was 28%. Worldwide seller units represented 49% of paid units.","Now I'll talk about our segment results. North America revenue grew 28% to $17.7 billion. North America operating income was $702 million, a 4% operating margin compared with $348 million in the prior year. This includes $5 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. International revenue grew 30% to $9.8 billion. Excluding the $184 million year-over-year favorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 28%.","International operating loss was $135 million compared with the loss of $189 million in the prior year. This includes $40 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange.","Amazon Web Services' revenue grew 58% to $2.9 billion. Amazon Web Services' operating income was $718 million, a 24.9% operating margin compared with $305 million in the prior year.","Our operating income was $1.3 billion or 4.2% of revenue, up approximately 220 basis points year-over-year. This includes $45 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Net income was $857 million or $1.78 per diluted share compared with a net income of $92 million or $0.19 per diluted share.","I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. For Q3 2016, we expect net sales of between $31 billion and $33.5 billion or growth of between 22% and 32%. This guidance anticipates approximately 30 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates.","Operating income to be between $50 million and $650 million compared with $406 million in third quarter 2015. We're grateful to our customers and remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks.","And with that, I'll hand it back to Darin.","Darin Manney - Director, Head of Investor Relations, Amazon","Thank you, Brian. Before we move to questions, I need to remind you that our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe to be appropriate assumption. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.","Our guidance also assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently. It is not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services and, therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.","With that, let's move to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. [Operation Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is from Mark May of Citi. Please proceed.","Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks for taking my question. We've noticed some data points out there that suggest that you're kind of accelerating your build-out of fulfillment capacity in North America and obviously also in India. Can you give us a sense of what sort of impact that, that might have in the near to mid-term on your CapEx, depreciation and ultimately CSOI, especially as it relates to your Q3 guidance? And then just kind of a maintenance question, how much is FX impacting your Q3 guidance? Thanks.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Okay. Thanks, Mark. Yeah, let me talk a little bit about guidance and I'll incorporate the answer to the fulfillment question. So, you'll notice on the top line guidance of $31 billion to $33.5 billion or 22% to 32% growth incorporates the Prime Day results and I can talk more about that later. But Prime Day was very successful for us. It was up 60% on a worldwide basis over the prior year, and it was also a record day for our Amazon devices, as well as sellers and customers alike.","In the bottom line, you'll need to remember that Q3 is a typically a lower operating income quarter as we prepare for Q4, the holiday peak. It's a little bit more exaggerated this year in that we're opening 18 fulfillment centers this quarter. To put that in perspective, we launched six in Q3 of last year. This will bring us up to 21 net FCs for the year by the end of Q3 and that compares with 10 fulfillment centers for the first three quarters of last year on a net basis. So, why are we expanding so much? If you remember back to Q4 and the capacity constraints we had in Q4, primarily due to really strong FBA growth, we talked a lot in the Q4 call about the operational cost of that in Q4. Customers well taken care of, but we had additional fulfillment costs from being so tight on capacity.","This year, with that in mind and then knowing that our growth rate is actually accelerating on a unit basis, we are \u2013 Q2 was 28% unit growth for paid units, but fulfilled by \u2013 units Fulfilled by Amazon is much higher than that due to the growth of Prime and FBA. That compares with last year in Q2 when we saw 22% unit growth, so we're 600 basis points faster growth in Q2 this year than last year and that 22% last year turned into 26% in Q4. So it ramped up in the back end of the year.","So a lot of data points there, but the bottom line is that there's a large step up in the amount of fulfillment capacity in Q2 \u2013 excuse me, Q3 versus Q2. There's a couple of other factors while I'm at it for guidance. We are also nearly doubling our content spend in the second half of this year versus the second half of 2015. We have a great slate of new Amazon Originals coming out later this year, both in the U.S. and internationally. And we're nearly tripling our number of new Amazon Original shows \u2013 TV shows and movies compared with the second half of last year.","There are other investments certainly that are increasing sequentially. I'd point to India and AWS, but primarily the two biggest issues in Q3 guidance I would say are the operational ramp and also the increase in digital content spend.","Darin Manney - Director, Head of Investor Relations, Amazon","And, Mark, to follow up on the other question, our net sales guidance anticipates approximately 30 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates.","Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And, Brian, where does that bring your video content spend to with the doubling in the second half if we look at it on an annualized basis?","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","We're not disclosing that at this time.","Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth from JPMorgan. Please state your question.","Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the questions. I just want to go back to Prime Day for a minute. I didn't hear any commentary around new Prime members in particular. Obviously a lot of other metrics that you gave but hoping you could provide a little bit more color around that. And then also, is there anything else that kind of stood out in terms of what you learned around operations and systems ahead of the holiday season? And then just going back to the 3Q guide, what's the right way for us to think about stock-based comp in the third quarter? And if we looked at your 2Q numbers, is that kind of a fair assumption for what you're thinking about? Thanks.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Let me circle back on Prime Day. So again, it was the biggest global day ever for Amazon and was up 60% on a order product sales basis versus Prime Day 2015. It was a record day for Amazon devices. It was a great day for small businesses and sellers who saw great year-over improvement in their sales. And more importantly, it was a great day for customers. Globally they saved over double what they had saved in Prime Day 2015. So we're very pleased with the results of Prime Day, and the impact of Prime Day is factored into this guidance. As far as new customers and new Prime members, we're not disclosing that, but suffice to say that it was a great day for both existing Prime members and also new customers who were trying us out for the first time.","Darin Manney - Director, Head of Investor Relations, Amazon","And on the stock-based compensation, you'll recall beginning in Q1 this year, we began allocating stock-based compensation and other operating expense to our North America, international and AWS segments. So we're including that in our guidance on operating income and have not separately guided to stock-based comp and other income expense this quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gene Munster from Piper Jaffray.","Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hey. Good afternoon. First, love the conference call format here. Get right to it. In terms of questions, the customer count, can you give us a little bit of guidance on that? And then also talk about the theme of automated consumption and separately, the importance of Prime Now and how you can kind of grow those SKUs. Thanks.","Darin Manney - Director, Head of Investor Relations, Amazon","Hi, Gene. This is Darin. I'll start with the customer accounts. As we noted again in our Q1 release, our active customer accounts exceeded 300 million. However, today we're not going to update that number.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","To your question on Prime Now, so I will point out Prime Now is now in more than 40 metro areas worldwide. In the past quarter we expanded further internationally to Germany, Spain and France, so it's a global program, again, offering free two-hour delivery on tens of thousands of items. We also have in the same vein of, I think what you called maybe automated consumption, the same day has expanded. Now we've added 11 metro areas, bringing the total to 27 metro areas that are qualified for same day. So, yeah, we think this is an important part of our Prime offering. We know customers love it. We're very happy with their order patterns from Prime Now, and very happy with it. Of course, we do always talk about \u2013 we always usually get asked about profitability and it is a very hard service to deliver and make money on, but we know customers love it and we're in a great position to do this because of our long-term approach, our drive of greater efficiencies and our proximity to the customer with our vast global FC network.","Operator","Our next question comes from Heath Terry from Goldman Sachs.","Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks. I was wondering as it relates to the Q3 guidance, can you give us a bit of a sense of just how we should think about margins in the AWS business, especially as the next eight availability zones roll out? Presumably that kind of increase in capacity likely has an impact on margins, but would appreciate sort of any direction you can share on how to think about that.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure. We don't give \u2013 obviously we don't give segment-based guidance. But to your question about AWS, we actually see nine availability zones in four regions coming out in the next \u2013 in the coming year. The impact on short-term is pretty much indistinguishable from the growth that we're seeing in our expansion of our base customers in our existing regions, so we don't see a large step-up from the addition of new regions relative to the large and rapid growth in the business itself.","We do think that it does pay benefits both for ourselves and for our customers because of the expansion, and we're happy to have added the region in Mumbai this past quarter. We think when we expand geographically, existing customers will run more of their workloads on AWS. Sometimes they have local latency concerns or security issues that require them to run things in their country, so that helps. And we also open up to new customers when we add these regions. So not a large impact on Q3 guidance, but certainly an exciting investment for our customer base.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein.","Carlos Kirjner-Neto - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. Two questions if I may. As I look at your tech and content expense as a percentage of revenues, we see year-on-year decline for the last two quarters, which is something we hadn't seen since mid-2010, and of course it's reflected in the AWS margins. Can you help us understand what has driven this significant change in relative trajectory in tech and content expenses? And the second question is, why is it that the rate at which you are deploying Prime Now is so much greater or faster than the rate at which you are deploying Fresh? What's different between them and how is it that you are deploying Fresh in new markets but not as fast as Prime Now, and what drives the difference? Thank you.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure. On tech and content, that's going to be a combination of our people cost related to many areas of the website and also the infrastructure cost to run it, at both the Amazon Web Services and also the Amazon site. We've been seeing some great efficiencies in our infrastructure, both internally as Amazon and also as part of AWS. We have great people working on not only better efficiency, but also driving cost out of our acquisition prices. So, there's a lot of great work going on there and I think that's what you're seeing reflected in the tech and content line. Again, this can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, but we're happy with the current trend and you see it in the AWS margins.","On Prime Now versus Fresh, they are separate \u2013 sorry. The \u2013 we'll point out in Q2 that we added London and Boston as two new sites in London for AmazonFresh, and that was the first international location. But we've been running AmazonFresh for seven years, or excuse me, since 2007 in Seattle and what you've seen as we've been testing the model, we've been expanding in North America and more so we've been expanding within the cities that we're in, adding zip codes, adding additional customers. So, the move into Boston and also now into London give us some really good data points and as \u2013 it's a great customer feature for the Prime offering.","Prime Now is a little bit easier to build up from scratch, I would say. The \u2013 it has a different purpose, although some of the products overlap. Again, this is more about immediacy of one-hour and two-hour delivery of a curated list of important products that people need in a short period of time. So, they have different roles. Some of the products overlap, of course, but we're happy with both, and we think that customers like both of them.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley.","Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one is on the Echo. Anything you could share at all on some of the most commonly used searches? How are consumers using the Echo as of now most commonly? And then anything on uplift in purchase behavior from Echo households? And the second one on Prime, on AWS margins, can you just walk us through some of the puts and takes that have been driving the AWS margin expansion we've seen in the first half of this year? Is it utilization, product mixes? What's been driving the margin expansion? Thanks.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Well, in Echo, again, we continue to build out the list of devices, launching the Dot and Tab and Fire TV skills this past year. And now we have 1,900 third-party skills for the Alexa, including new skills from Kayak, Lyft, NBC, Honeywell and more. So there's a lot of uses that we're seeing for Echo. A lot ties into our Prime Music offering. It's just a great way to access Prime Music and more and more the Amazon site. We don't have anything to disclose on physical orders from \u2013 through \u2013 excuse me, orders through Echo.","On Amazon Web Services margin, again, this is primarily due to efficiencies gained on our infrastructure, better utilization, better cost out. There is a \u2013 certainly a mix of products and services. I don't have a bridge for you on whether that's helpful or hurtful, but the \u2013 these margins in AWS will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, and that's what you're seeing. But we're very happy with the year-over-year improvement.","Operator","Next question is from Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets.","Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Hey, Brian, could you give us some wise as to the revenue growth acceleration that you're seeing, a little more color about the revenue growth acceleration in North American retail and in international retail? I remember last quarter you called out really starting to see, kind of I don't know, critical mass tipping point, whatever the buzzword is, from Prime and from FBA in international markets. Is that what's continuing, I assume, to kind of drive that re-acceleration? And any geographic country comments behind that? Thanks a lot.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Yeah, I have the same buzzwords for you, Mark. It's really the flywheel of Prime is definitely working. It's simple as that. The low prices, vast selection and convenience continue to resonate with customers. Prime membership increases and selection through FBA makes Prime more valuable. So it's a bit as simple as that in the consumer business in North America and international, we are seeing great acceptance of Prime and usage of Prime benefits. We continue to expand the list of Prime benefits for customers to make it more valuable, and none is more valuable than FBA, which we've talked a lot about the value of Prime to FBA and vice-versa.","FBA is bringing more Prime-eligible selection to Prime and then the growth of Prime and the type of customers that utilize Prime and their buying behavior is a great traction for other FBA sellers. So that is essentially what we're seeing, and we're certainly pleased with the customer response to those offers globally.","Operator","Our next question comes from Youssef Squali from Cantor Fitzgerald.","Youssef Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Thank you. Two questions, please. Brian, your operating income has been come in stronger than expectations, but more importantly, stronger than your own guidance, at least in the last couple of quarters. I was just wondering as you look back at where you guided relative to actual, where do you think that delta was most pronounced? Why wouldn't we assume that maybe, at least on the margin, the investment intensity in the business has maybe decelerated a bit?","And second, on Prime Video, just was wondering, considering what the main competitor there is doing, i.e., expanding aggressively around the world, you guys have been growing in a more measured manner, is that still the plan or are you guys interested in maybe instead of moving into a few countries, kind of expand globally in one fell swoop? That's it. Thanks.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Let me start with the second question first. So on Prime Video, again we're very happy with the customer adoption of Prime Video, and we know the customers love it. We like the results that we see, particularly with the free trial conversion, the renewal rates for subscriptions. So it's clearly working. I mentioned earlier how we're doubling the investment rate in the second half of the year versus last year's second half, and we're tripling the Amazon Originals content.","That Originals content for TV and movies, that content can be used globally. We've talked a bit about our Prime launch in India, and alluded to the fact that we'll be having video soon in India, but local content and also Amazon Originals. So, stay tuned for that. I don't have any more to announce on that today. On the variance to guidance, what I'll say is, we came in the very high end of our revenue guidance. I would say that our business model usually reacts well to high volume as we get a really good leverage on our fixed expenses. So that's part of what we saw, very strong operating efficiencies as we hit essentially the highest end of our revenue guidance.","But we do have a lot of diverse profit streams here at Amazon and a lot of investments going on at any point in time. I think I heard a question there about level of investment. We continue to invest heavily. In fact, I just called out a few things that are going to be stepping up in investment levels in Q3, mostly ops and digital content. So we continue to invest on behalf of customers. But we also work very hard at efficiencies and scaling the businesses that we have. So we take both roles very seriously around here, investing on the right \u2013 in the right things, seeing results on behalf of customers, and also driving efficiencies. And there can be timing, quarter-to-quarter, the operating margin and levels of investment can fluctuate, but certainly continue to expand.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein from Oppenheimer. Mr. Helfstein, your line is live.","Ray Mcdonough - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Sorry about that. This is Ray McDonough on for Jason Helfstein. Just on the AWS side, we've been hearing a lot of talk and especially a lot of media reports that larger customers tend to use AWS, they might use Google and Microsoft Azure in tandem in sort of a multi-cloud kind of architecture. Just wondering your thoughts on how you see AWS fitting in the overall ecosystem and kind of your place longer term in the ecosystem.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Well, first of all, we believe customers will choose AWS primarily for three factors, the functionality and pace of innovation that we bring to the table, our partner and customer ecosystem and our experience. We've been in this business longer than anyone. Having said that, there are room \u2013 there's plenty of room for multiple vendors in this business. What we focus on is innovating on behalf of customers and expanding the geographic footprint to make our services more widely available.","You can see us continue to invest in things like new application services, higher up the stack, additional technologies that will make integrating with AWS seamless for those companies that have a hybrid IT environment and then continuing to add functionality for data analytics, mobile, Internet of things, machine learning offerings, things like that, that will add greater and greater value for AWS customers. And I would say the rapid pace of innovation continues to stretch our lead in that dimension. We have had 422 new significant services and features added in the first half of this year. That's a faster pace than last year when we added 722 services and features. So we feel good about the business position we're in and our position with customers.","Operator","Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian from Robert W. Baird.","Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thanks, guys. As another follow up on the margins, I was hoping you could comment on any impact from the investments and build out of enhanced transportation capabilities including the air cargo leases. And then secondly, was hoping you could identify any categories within EGM that are becoming more meaningful drivers of growth or at least are an increasing focus on the retail side? Thank you.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, sure. First, on EGM, I'll just say the growth is across a lot of different products, none to exactly call out here, and we think that a lot of it is, of course, driven by the growth of Prime itself. EGM in North America grew 32%, which was higher than the revenue growth rate, and also grew 36% internationally. So when people join Prime, they are certainly buying EGM in strong quantity. So that continues to grow with the growth of the Prime program.","On transportation, I think your question was about whether that's impacting our short-term results. No. The answer is no. We are certainly expanding our service offerings in the transportation side and we have been for many years, things like sortation centers and delivery methods. The plane deal that we were talking about is essentially planes that we're going to be leasing from other companies, and you'll hear more about that as we go forward, but that is to essentially take on the demand for internal flights as we move product around. It certainly will be well utilized.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Pitz from Jefferies.","Brian J. Pitz - Jefferies LLC","Thanks for the questions. First, on FC build out, is the cost of building centers scaling over time given the use of Kiva, other technologies or general learnings, or are those costs still relatively consistent? And also, we noticed some device sellout in the next four to five weeks, post-Prime Day. Was this a bit of a planned inventory reduction for some of the devices or did volumes take you by surprise here?","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","I will start with the second question. So I would just say Prime Day had enormous impact on the device business and devices were well featured and also well adopted by customers. So it was the largest device sales day that we've ever had and essentially pretty much across all of our device types, E-readers, tablets, Fire TV and Echo.","And I'm sorry. Your first question was around \u2013 the cost of fulfillment centers. Not disclosing that we do continue to change our fulfillment centers. We've changed, again, the automation, the size, the scale many times and we continue to learn and grow there. So no general trends I can point to on cost per fulfillment center to start up because they do vary in size and mission and some have fully outfitted in using Amazon Robotics, others \u2013 some don't for economic reasons. Maybe the volume is not perfect for robot volume. But yeah. But, yes, so I can't give you any real distinct trends there.","Operator","Our next question is from Justin Post from Merrill Lynch.","Justin Post - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Great. Thank you. First on the customers, I'm guessing \u2013 I'm wondering why you aren't giving the number, a lot of people use it for their models. And then second thing, when you look at the U.S. Prime penetration versus total U.S. customers, how do you feel about that and do you think there's still a lot of room for Prime growth in the U.S.? Thank you.","Darin Manney - Director, Head of Investor Relations, Amazon","Hi, Justin. This is Darin. I'll comment on the customer accounts again. We may consider updating that in the future, but really we encourage you and our investors to look at our free cash flow measures, our revenue and our GAAP operating profit since our customer purchasing behavior can vary.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","And on Prime penetration, of course, we haven't released Prime subscription levels. We have talked about growth certainly globally and in North America. What I can tell you there is we still think there's a lot of room in Prime. We've tailored programs to students. We've tailored video programs. We've rolled out monthly plans. We have plans with grocery delivery. So there's a lot of different flavors of Prime and we are aggressively looking for a perfect Prime for everybody. We know that, again, when customers try Prime, they like it. So it's really just about getting them to try Prime and continuing to deliver great Prime benefits and great low prices and selection.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross Sandler from Deutsche Bank.","Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks, guys. I just had two. First as a follow up on the logistics topic. So, in addition to the cargo planes you just mentioned for in-network moving products around, you guys have registered and received a U.S. Maritime license to operate as a freight forwarder and you recently announced this partnership with the UK for drone delivery that you've been working for a couple years. So I guess at a high level, can you just talk about the overall logistics strategy is evolving from trucks and fulfillment centers to incorporate some of these new methods and how that might impact your unit costs going forward?","And then the second question's on AWS. So you continue to put up really strong results. And you guys obviously talk to a lot of customers across lots of different verticals. Just a high level, what percent of enterprise workloads do you think have shifted to the public cloud at this stage? Is it low-single digit to mid-single-digit? And any color there on where we are in terms of penetration in the space. Thank you.","Darin Manney - Director, Head of Investor Relations, Amazon","So thank you, Ross. This is Darin. Let me take that first question on Prime Air in the UK, we've been working with and developing Prime Air for some time to develop a rapid delivery system that is safe, environmentally sound and it really enhances the services that we provide for millions of customers. And we're extremely happy to partner with the UK government to advance the safe use of drones for small parcel delivery. This is providing us with permission to trial new methods in the space, including beyond line-of-sight operation, sense-and-avoid technologies and flights where one person operates multiple drones.","So we definitely appreciate the pragmatic and forward-looking approach on this topic with the UK and we're going to continue to work with regulators and policy makers in many countries, including the U.S. So we're excited about there. As for the ocean-going licenses, we have no comment on that today.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","As far as AWS, essentially penetration question you asked. We think still very early. Again, we like our position, our industry leading position in the cloud space, and we're working on things that would incent more and more customers to accelerate their cloud conversion. The lower prices and services that we offer, and as I said, we'll work on things that will make it easier and easier for customers to work with us with their hybrid data centers or transfer their volume to us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS.","Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe one clarification and one big picture topic. On the clarification, appreciate the disclosure on content and how that'll double year-on-year in the second half. For purposes of just making sure we sort of can understand the trajectory, is there any way to frame it within second half of this year versus first half of this year, just so we can sort of try to triangulate on a gross margin basis from the content spend? And the bigger picture topic would be China, hasn't come up yet on the call. Wanted to understand your latest thoughts there on either the competitive landscape relative positioning in China and how you think about investments in China. Thank you.","Darin Manney - Director, Head of Investor Relations, Amazon","So, hi, Eric. This is Darin. I'll take the second question on China. So we continue to operate well in China. We see China as a \u2013 and the way we're approaching China as a way to \u2013 a trusted avenue for our Chinese customers to access authentic international brands and we'll focus on those global brands and bringing those to Chinese customers. Offerings like the Amazon Global Store where Chinese customers can access those international brands on the China website and have them shipped directly to their houses is something we're focused on. So, yeah, it's still early days and some of those experiments that we're doing, but we're seeing good traction on those things and we like that.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah and on the content spend, I think the only other data point I can give you is probably a dated one at this point, but we spent $1.3 billion in 2014, that's the last number that we disclosed and we continue to add content. The best I can give you at this point is that it will be double, nearly double what we spent in the second half of 2015.","Operator","Our final question will come from Victor Anthony from Axiom Capital.","Victor Anthony - Axiom Capital Management, Inc.","Thanks for putting me on. Maybe I'll just ask a question about India. You called out India was \u2013 you had the most visited e-commerce site as well as the most downloaded mobile app, and you also launched Prime. So maybe you could just talk about the opportunities and the challenges that you see in that market. And second, there was some press reports that you invested about $500 million of incremental capital in Italy. I was wondering what are you seeing in that market that justifies that level of investment.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure. So India, we're very encouraged by what we've seen so far in India, both with customers and also sellers; that's a (40:18) third-party seller market. You heard that we launched the Prime program this week, which will be a whole new experience for Indian customers. In hundreds of cities we'll now have unlimited free one-day and two-day delivery, and we also mentioned that Prime Video is coming there, both Indian and global content. We're also starting to see exclusive online sales partnerships. Recently, we've had partnerships with Motorola, Samsung, Lenovo on select phones. But more importantly, again, we really like the opportunity in India. We like the initial results that we see from customers and also sellers. We really like our team there. We have a great team of Amazonian's who've been very inventive in India.","Every time there's an obstacle or something that's different from the U.S. or another major business they'll invent around it, whether it's a shipping method or a payment method or whatever. So, very creative and the customer response has been really strong. So we are very excited about the Prime program. We think it'll enter into a new chapter in India, and we've seen great success every country in the world that we've launched Prime, and we feel India is going to be no different. So we're looking forward to seeing what we can do on behalf of the Indian customer.","Darin Manney - Director, Head of Investor Relations, Amazon","And hi, Victor, this is Darin. On Italy, yes, we continue to invest in Italy and really throughout Europe to keep pace with the strong customer demand we see. Since opening Italy in 2010, we've invested over \u20ac450 million and created 1,700 jobs in Italy, and this increased investment will be to add future FC near Rome and other infrastructure assets. So, yes, this is really to support both the customers that we have there in Italy and throughout Europe, and we'll continue to invest in the coming years.","Darin Manney - Director, Head of Investor Relations, Amazon","So thank you for joining the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our investor website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.

Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our Chief Financial Officer and Brian Olsavsky, Vice President and CFO of our Global Consumer Business. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.","The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, January 29, 2015 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.","During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.","Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2013.","Now, I will turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Szkutak","Thanks, Phil. I will begin with comments on our fourth quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 25% to $6.84 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased to $1.95 billion. In the supplemental financial information and business metrics portion of the earnings release, we included a few additional free cash flow measures. We believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with capital and finance leases.","Trailing 12 month capital expenditures were $4.89 billion. Capital expenditures does not include the impact of property and equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligations. Return on invested capital is 9%, down from 13%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by the average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter-ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 483 million shares compared with 476 million one year ago.","I will turn the call over to Brian for additional financial highlights.","Brian Olsavsky","Thanks, Tom. Worldwide revenue increased 15% to $29.33 billion or 18% excluding $895 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Media revenue decreased to $6.95 billion, down 4%. Excluding FX, media revenue was flat year-over-year. EGM revenue increased to $20.64 billion, up 21% or 24% excluding FX. Worldwide EGM increased to 70% of worldwide sales, up from 67%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 20%. Worldwide active customer accounts were approximately 270 million. Worldwide paid Prime members increased 53% year-over-year. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than two million. Seller units represented 43% of paid units, Fulfillment by Amazon or FBA units represented more than 40% of seller units. Worldwide active Amazon Web Services customers exceeded one million.","Now I will discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $20.67 billion or 70.5% of revenue compared with 73.5%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $7.62 billion or 25.9% of sales, up approximately 300 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $3.33 billion or 11.3% of revenue compared with 11.1%. Tech and content was $2.41 billion or 8.2% of revenue compared with 6.6%. Marketing was $1.49 billion or 5.1% of revenue compared with 4.3%.","Now let's talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or the other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 22% to $18.75 billion. Media revenue grew 1% to $3.54 billion. EGM revenue grew 27% to $13.53 billion, representing 72% of North America revenues, up from 69%. Other revenue grew 43% to $1.67 billion. North America segment operating income increased 40% to $1.02 billion, a 5.4% operating margin.","In the international segment, revenue grew 3% to $10.58 billion. Excluding the $872 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 12%. Media revenue decreased 8% to $3.41 billion or a decrease of 1% excluding foreign exchange and EGM revenue grew 10% to $7.11 billion or 19% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 67% of international revenues, up from 63%.","International segment operating income was $20 million, down from $151 million in prior year. Consolidated segment operating income increased 18% to $1.04 billion or 3.5% of revenue, up approximately 10 basis points year-over-year. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income was $591 million compared operating income of $510 million in the prior year.","Our income tax expense was $205 million. GAAP net income was $214 million or $0.45 per diluted share compared with a net income of $239 million or $0.51 per diluted share.","Now I will discuss the full year results. Revenue increased 20% to $88.99 billion or 20%, excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange.

Accounts payable increased 9% to $16.46 billion and accounts payable days decreased to 73 from 74 in the prior-year.","And now back to Tom with guidance.","Tom Szkutak","Thanks, Brian. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we have seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.","As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rate can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently.","For Q1 2015, we expect net sales of between $20.9 billion and $22.9 billion or growth of between 6% and 16%. This guidance anticipates approximately 460 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income or loss to be between $450 million loss and $50 million in income, compared to $146 million in income in the first quarter of 2014. This includes approximately $450 million for stock-based compensation and the amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between zero and $500 million in income compared to $502 million income in the first quarter of 2014.","I will conclude my portion of today's call with an update on our reportable segments. We expect to change our reportable segments to report North America, international and Amazon Web Services, beginning with first quarter of 2015. We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for our shareholders.","Thanks and with that, Phil, let's move to questions.","Phil Hardin","Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Brian Pitz with Jefferies and Company. Please proceed with your question. Your line is live.","Brian Pitz","Hello. Can you hear me? Hi, guys. Just a quick question. You had a strong holiday season. 100 million more items shipped for free this holiday, while FBA units was up 50% and fulfillment expense remain relatively flat. How did you manage that? Are the new sortation that was essentially the key to controlling shipping costs? And what percent of units sold are FBA? Thank you.","Tom Szkutak","Sure. In terms of the last part of your question, the percentage of FBA units of third-party paid physical units are over 40% and in terms of the fulfillment discussion, certainly Q4 is our most seasonal quarter. You can see that we get a little bit better leverage, I should say, than we have gotten in other quarters. Again, most seasonal quarter. Not a lot to add to that but we continue to ship on behalf of retail offerings as well as FBA that's included in that.","Brian Pitz","Great. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Katie Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Katie Huberty","Yes. Thanks. There's a headline on the tape referencing improving productivity in 2015. So I just wondered if you could clarify what areas of the business you are focused on in terms of productivity? And then what are some of the projects or areas that we should be prepared to see a large uptick in investment in 2015?","Tom Szkutak","Yes. I think that you are referring to is, I mentioned on a earlier call, that we do an annual planning process. We actually start it in the late-summer, early fall. We go through that process. We take a break for the seasonal holidays and then we get back to it. We are in the process of finalizing it right now. And the teams are putting even more energy and attention on driving what we would call fixed expense and variable expense productivity as well as other efficiency projects. So there's many, many different pieces that go into that. But certainly we have added a lot of people and structure over the last several years. And so we have been putting folks on that. But we are just putting even more folks on it as we finalize our plans for 2015.","Katie Huberty","And what areas should we expect big upticks in investment in 2015?","Tom Szkutak","In terms of investment, certainly we are going to continue to support the growth of the business. You should expect that we will be spending more in terms of CapEx to support our web services business which is growing very fast. You should expect us to add fulfillment capacity, as we have done in prior years. We have updated you a bit as we have gone along and so we will do that from time-to-time during the year as well in 2015. So stay tuned on that.","Katie Huberty","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Please proceed you are your question.","Ron Josey","Great. Thanks for taking the question. Real quickly on fulfillment cost. It looks like the overall cost is already quite a bit, around 17% growth in 4Q from 30% in 3Q. I am wondering if anything specific led to that improved overall growth from, is it maybe the key of a rollout? And then quickly, I think there was mentioning around breaking out AWS results. Wondering if any reason now? Perhaps it's getting to a level that you have to do it? Thank you.","Tom Szkutak","Yes. In terms of the fulfillment piece, it's not a lot of callouts on that. We had unit growth of 20% year-over-year. Certainly our FBA is growing at a faster rate. The sellers were up 65% over years who did 40% of our units. And again, the team continues to work on getting productivity there. In terms of AWS, we just think it's an appropriate way to look at our business for 2015. And so our plan is to separating it out as of Q1 of this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Kaizad Gotla","Thanks. This is Kaizad Gotla, in for Doug. I think you noted Prime is growing faster internationally than it is in North America. So can you help us reconcile that with the difference between your North America and international EGM growth rates?","Tom Szkutak","If you take a look, what I mentioned was, Prime, worldwide is up 53% year-over-year. so it's growing very fast globally. It's 50% growth in the U.S. and even higher in international. And so the reason both are contributing to the growth rates that you are seeing. But we are certainly at a earlier stage in international. So it's an opportunity for us, but in terms of the number of Prime members relative to the U.S. is smaller. So it's an earlier phase. So again, as we continue to grow that, it's an opportunity for us and certainly something that we are focused on.","Operator","The next question comes from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your questions.","Carlos Kirjner","Hi. I have two questions. Can you comment on your view of the relative value proposition of Prime in European markets and Japan? Is it similar to the U.S.? Two-day shipping and all the other benefits? Or is it different? Because we think, for example, that penetration of Prime in the European markets is much lower and you have told us that the number of Prime SKUs is much lower in the U.K., for example. So what's the fundamental cause of that? Why is it that Prime in the U.K. is not as developed as in the U.S.? Is it timing or is it the proposition?","The second question is about AWS. You have a leadership position now and it's a very large market and it's easy to see from the outside that you are hiring aggressively, both in engineering and sales. Given the size of the opportunity and your position, what specifically prevents you from hiring faster, developing more products, investing more? How do you balance? What prevents you from doing that? Why wouldn't you invest twice or three times as much in AWS? Thank you.","Tom Szkutak","In terms of, I will take the AWS one first, we are expanding very rapidly. We have been hiring a lot of great people over the past few years and several years. We do think it's a big opportunity. We are making sure we keep the hiring bar really high to make sure we bring in great resources like we do across all of Amazon and we are super excited about the opportunity. So we are investing very heavily. You see that certainly in our CapEx numbers and the assets we are acquiring with some of the capital leases you see that represented. So again we are investing very heavily, both in terms of people as well as capital for that business and we share your excitement about the business.","In terms of from the Prime piece, the proposition is a bit different by geography and we continue to make it better in all the geographies that we have Prime. That's something that we are focused. The shipping speed is different by geography a bit, but the focus is all about how we make sure that we get a great experience for customers in those geographies. But the one thing is different is, you mentioned is that, the proposition or the timing. So the proposition is a little bit different, but we will continue to work on making it better for all the geographies we have it in. But the timing is different. We did launch in the U.S. first. And then we launch in other geographies following that. So as a result, it's just earlier in these other geographies. So we still think it's a very good opportunity and something that we are focused on.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark May with Citigroup.","Mark May","Thanks for taking my question. One on, I am sorry if I missed this, what's your thought or outlook for pricing in the AWS Cloud business for this year? It was obviously quite fierce last year. Do you think it will be quite as competitive in 2015?","And then in the media business, we have been hearing data points about a slowdown in the eBook space. Are you seeing that? And what's your outlook? Do you see any hope for the media segment to improve as a result of that? Thanks.","Tom Szkutak","In terms of the first question, we have continued to lower prices for customers in web services. Certainly that's something that we have been focused on. Since early launch, it's something we continue to focus on. It's hard to predict what will happen going forward. So I really can't comment on what we might or might not do there. But certainly it's something that we had, since launch, we have had many, many, it's in the high 40s, I think, in terms of pricing actions there. So we are very excited to make sure that we have great prices for customers.","In terms of the media, you are seeing an overall media growth globally. You are seeing some softness in the growth rate there. I just want to point out certainly one of the larger factors or largest factor that's in that number is, keep in mind that we have video game consoles that are part of the media growth numbers or the media absolute numbers. And last year it was a very strong year for new console launches. And so what happens is, when you have those launches, you also have video games that are -- the video game sales themselves are also strong. So for example, if you look at North American media growth rate in Q4 of this past year, you are seeing that impact. So that's what you are seeing there.","Operator","Our next question from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.","Mark Mahaney","Great. Thanks. Hi, Tom. Can I ask you a high-level question?","Tom Szkutak","Sure. Go for it, Mark.","Mark Mahaney","Okay. Amazon has always pitched itself in terms of price, selection and convenience to customers. And I saw this great survey work that was done by Morgan Stanley in the last couple of weeks about this global survey that indicated a little bit of the shift in consumers' interest in online commerce more towards convenience. You must have a pretty good feel at Amazon for whether that broad value proposition to consumers is shifting. If it's shifting to be slightly less sensitive to price over the last couple of years and more towards convenience. Are you seeing that kind of shift? There's a lot of implications if that is, in fact, what is happening.","Tom Szkutak","I would say it this way, in terms of customer reaction, you see it really across the fundamental inputs that we have talked about for a long time. So in other words, in terms of speed of delivery and convenience, we see that with Prime members. Prime members are buying more. It's more convenient. They are getting their physical product to them faster versus being not a Prime member. So we certainly see that. So that's certainly speed of delivery helps. We need to make sure and it's something that we are always focused on is making sure we have great prices and that's every single item across categories, across geographies. So it's something we are focused on.","We do think that's important for customers. And we need to have the selection, be in stock. When a customer comes to our detail page, it matters. And so I don't view it as a shift. I view it as there is certainly a lot of visibility and transparency around all of these. That's what shopping and operating a business online does. There is just amount of transparency. We think we like that world. And that's something that we continue to focus on those inputs so that we can be successful in that world and that's not something new. That's something we have been focusing on for a long time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer.","Jason Helfstein","Hi. Thanks. Two questions. One, just if you can clarify any impact of the Fire phone in the quarter? And then secondly, can you talk about how fuel prices impact your model? And I know the shippers, they use a trailing index to calculate fuel, how those savings would show up? Or if you would pass those on to third parties, et cetera? Thanks.","Tom Szkutak","Yes. I don't have really any callout for the Fire phone. We continue to sell. I had mentioned, we have a little bit over $80 million of inventory at the end of the Q3 and it will continue to sell through that in Q4. In terms of fuel prices, not a lot to callout there in terms of impact on the quarter. Certainly, over a long period of time, if it's sustainable we should see some benefits there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gene Munster of Piper Jaffray.","Gene Munster","Good afternoon. Over the past couple of years, it's just been a little bit of a roller coaster with margins for investors. There is points of optimism followed by points of frustration and there is really some optimism here in this report. Is there anything that you can help investors with to understand just how you think about different cycles of investing to try to smooth out some of this roller coaster mentality that happens with the stock? Thanks.","Tom Szkutak","Well, in terms of, I would describe it this way, Gene, we have a lot of opportunities in front of us that we have talked about and we are also being selective with those opportunities. We have added lot of resources over the past few years. We certainly have been in the heavy investment cycle. I mentioned earlier we are in the process of finalizing our plan for 2015. We always put energy into various productivity measures but we are putting, the team is putting even more focus on those efforts as we finalize our 2015 plans. We will have to see where that ends up, but we are putting more energy and focus around our various fixed productivity or expense productivity, efficiency projects and again a wide range of different activities. And so that's what we are doing and you will have to stay tuned to see how that progresses as we go.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank.","Ross Sandler","Hi. Thanks, Tom. I have two questions. First on India, can you talk about the India opportunity broadly and maybe some advantages you may have versus some of the local peers in terms of leveraging your scale? That market appears to be just on fire right now. So just a little bit of color on India.","And then on Prime, can you talk about the Prime member behavior in terms of purchasing frequency? How it looks today versus may be a Prime member that joined two years ago? I know it looks a lot different from those very early Prime adopters from six, seven years ago. But just more recently, over the last couple of years, is the behavior consistent as you grow the base? Thanks.","Tom Szkutak","Sure. In terms of India, we think it's very, very early. We are investing certainly in India and we think it's a very interesting opportunity. We have a very good team there and we are excited to participate. Again we think it is very early and so we like the opportunity there.","In terms of Prime, there is not a lot I can help you with on that. But what I would say is this, certainly as you think about customers who are not Prime that become Prime, we see a very sizable step up their purchasing patterns. And so the customers are certainly buying a lot more from us. And one of the things that we are seeing, another thing that we are seeing is certainly, as Jeff references and I quote, \"Prime has evolved. It is both a physical and digital offering. It's unique that way.\"","We see, for example, although it's still very early and we are learning and investing in this area, but I take video content, for example, what we see is customers that come in who come in through our Prime pipeline for video for free trial, those customers are converting at higher rates than other channels. We see that customers that are video streamers, even though we have high renewal rates, they are renewing at even higher rates than others. We see those people who were customers who were streaming have very similar purchase patterns on the physical product side as those who don't.","And so we view that as a positive. So it's very integrated from a customer experience standpoint which we think is great. And so those are the things that we are seeing in Prime right now. And with Prime being almost 10 years old, growing at 53% year-over-year on a sizable base, tens of millions, we think is very interesting. It's something that we are very focused on as we continue forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS Investment Research.","Eric Sheridan","Thanks for taking the question. On the topic of China, I wanted to know if you could help us either qualitatively or quantitatively understand what the trajectory or the size of the business is in China? And then maybe the trajectory around investments needed to compete in China? And how you think about the opportunity there long-term, looking through the lens of the competitive landscape and maybe Amazon's particular skill set on going to market in China? Thanks.","Tom Szkutak","Sure. We haven't broken out the size of the business. I can't help you much there, but we continue to work on the customer experience there. The team has some interesting ideas that you will have to stay tuned on, of how to make that experience better. And we continue to work on it. So there is not a lot more that I can add to that.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Blackledge with Cowen and Company.","John Blackledge","Great. Thanks. Just a couple of questions. In North American media, aside from the video game impact, just wondering if there are any other factors driving the low or flattish growth year-over-year? And then, CapEx was up about 40% in 2014. It's kind of bounced around over the years. Just wondering if you can give us a sense of the level of growth in 2015? Thanks.","Tom Szkutak","Sure. In terms of the North American media, a number of different certainly puts and takes there, but certainly by far the biggest one is the one I called out, which is the video game console. So if you look at the growth rate in Q4 last year, meaning 2013 and Q4 2014, you see a big difference. And the biggest, the most sizable difference there is certainly the video game consoles portion and the video games associated with those. So another way to say it is, the video game consoles and video games portion of that is down year-over-year and obviously years ago we put the videogame consoles as part of North American media to keep it with video games and they are larger ASP items as well that go in there. So certainly having an impact on that one when you look at the growth or when you compare Q4 2013 growth to Q4 2014 growth there.","In terms of CapEx, we are not giving guidance on the 2015 spend, but given the high usage rates that we have had in web services, you should expect that we will be spending CapEx to support that growth and we will certainly be adding new fulfillment centers as we go. Also keep in mind that we do also finance capital. So if you look at our capital lease activity point to that, that's also increased in activity over the last few years. Certainly a number of different types of CapEx that go into that financing, but the biggest piece is certainly infrastructure to support our business primarily on the AWS side. So again that's also included in that number.","Operator","Our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.","Heath Terry","Great. Thanks. Tom, I was hoping you could give us some kind of sense of the impact on delivery times and conversion rates that you saw during this holiday season from the investments that you made in fulfillment, particularly the sortation centers that were added before the holidays? And then also, to what degree you have seen some leverage, or some of the slower growth in fulfillment costs from moving more of the fulfillment obligation to first party owned infrastructure?","Tom Szkutak","Sure. In terms of the sort centers and I would say, just in addition to sort centers, what's happened over the course of last several years is, with all the fulfillment centers that we have added, we have actually invested gotten selection closer to customers. And so that's helped us from a delivery speed standpoint. It's helped us from a cost standpoint in terms of transportation cost being closer to customers. And so you it's a natural result of the footprint that we have added.","In terms of sortation centers, there is a lot of different benefits of that. But certainly one of them is, as you get closer and closer, certainly throughout the year, it's helped us with holiday deliveries, it's helped us with Sunday deliveries and as we have closer to, in this case December to the end of holidays, it's certainly helped us from a delivery to the customer standpoint. So we are very pleased with the performance of those sortation centers. And really the global team of fulfillment team around the world, I think they did a terrific job during the holiday season as they did throughout the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Miller with William Blair and Company.","Mark Miller","Hi. Good afternoon. There's quite a disparate performance between North America and international in terms of the profit change year-on-year, up nearly $300 million, North America down over $100 million. So could you just help us understand why the international performance is so much weaker? Perhaps give us some color on the established markets in Europe relative to emerging markets. In the past, you have also discussed Japan. And then, is there an inflection point where international profits we could expect to head up again?","Tom Szkutak","Sure. The first one is, certainly the growth rates are slower in international versus North America, certainly would have an impact. The second, as we continue to invest in international in terms of adding capacity for infrastructure, for fulfillment capacity, as you know, if you look at our international growth rates, the unit growth rates are actually growing at a higher rate than revenue. And then emerging geographies. We talked about India earlier. Very excited about India. We are investing in India. We are also investing in China. So those are certainly impacting the results as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Justin Post","Great. Thank you. I wanted to ask about gross margins. They were up quite a bit year-over-year and it looks like, in our numbers, EGM beat and media missed. So any thoughts on the mix shift there helping or hurting gross margins? What are the key drivers for that line and can AWS continue to drive that in 2015? Thank you.","Tom Szkutak","Certainly, AWS mix of business is having an impact. AWS is certainly part of that and impacting that. Also just to keep in mind, our third-party unit growth is growing at a faster rate than retail and so certainly that's having an impact. And then obviously, continuing to lower prices for customers as well as working with our partners on the vendor side to support those activities from a pricing standpoint. So those are the dynamics. And in terms of 2015 beyond the guidance that we are giving, there is not a lot of callout there, but we have had a great success of being able to grow our retail offerings. Our marketplace side has grown very nicely over the years including 2014. The team has done a great job there. Fulfilled by Amazon, in terms of number of sellers, continue to grow there. The percentage of paid physical units are approximately 40%, a little over 40% of the total there. So that's become much more meaningful over the past several years. So very happy about that. So all those contribute to the numbers that you just talked about.","Operator","Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird.","Colin Sebastian","Great. Good afternoon. One question as a follow-up on AWS and specifically some of the announcements related to WorkMail and WorkSpaces. This would signal that Amazon is moving up the stack towards a more of a SaaS offering. Is that the right interpretation? And if so, should we expect a broadening of those SaaS product initiatives? Thank you.","Tom Szkutak","I am very happy to make a launch that you mentioned, we think it's exciting. It's certainly, you know we are excited overall about web services offerings. The team has done an incredible job in terms of innovation as well as operating these large services that scale. So they are doing a terrific job. In terms of what we might or might not do in the future, we are not talking about what that roadmap is. You will have to stay tuned.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ben Schachter with Macquarie Equity Research.","Ben Schachter","Tom, can you just give any color on how you are evaluating the opportunities to show video advertising against the ever-increasing video content? Thanks.","Tom Szkutak","We really aren't using advertising too much in that area. You have seen it a little bit on some of our original content but beyond that we really can't comment. We think the experience we have is great for customers. We get a lot of positive feedback on the content that we have there and the uninterrupted content, if you will. And so I wouldn't speculate on what we might or might not do there. But we are getting great feedback from customers.","Operator","Thank you.

We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, January 30, 2014 only and will include forward-looking statements.","Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.","As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as our metrics and commentary on the quarter.","During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.","Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2012.","Now, I will turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Szkutak","Thanks, Dave. I will begin with comments on our fourth quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 31% to $5.47 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $2.03 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $3.44 billion.","The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth consisting of additional capacities to support fulfillment operations and investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services.","Return on invested capital was 13%, up from 4%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 476 million shares compared with 470 million shares one year ago.","Worldwide revenue grew 20% to $25.59 billion or 22% excluding the $258 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange.","Media revenue increased to $7.23 billion, up 11% or 13% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $17.13 billion, up 23% or 24% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 67% of worldwide sales, up from 65%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 25%. Active customer accounts exceeded 237 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 39% of paid units.","Now I will discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $18.81 billion or 73.5% of revenue compared with 75.9%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined were $5.9 billion or 23.1% of sales up approximately 210 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $2.84 billion or 11.1% of revenue, compared with 10.3%. Tech and content was $1.69 billion or 6.6% of revenue, compared with 5.7%. Marketing was $1.11 billion or 4.3% of revenue compared with 3.9%.","Now I will talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments or stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 26% to $15.33 billion. Media revenue grew 21% to $3.51 billion. EGM revenue grew 25% to $10.65 billion, representing 69% of North America revenues down from 70%. Other revenue grew 52% to $1.17 billion. North America segment operating income increased 19% to $725 million, a 4.7% operating margin.","In the International segment, revenue grew 13% to $10.26 billion. Adjusting for the $244 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 15%. Media revenue grew 3% to $3.71 billion, or 6% excluding foreign exchange and EGM revenues grew 19% to $6.48 billion or 21% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 63% of International revenues, up from 60%. International segment operating income increased to 116% to $151 million, a 1.5% operating margin.

Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI increased 28%.","Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income increased 26% to $510 million or 2% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $179 million, resulting in a 40% tax rate for the quarter and 32% rate for the full-year 2013. GAAP net income was $239 million or $0.51 per diluted share, compared with $97 million and $0.21 per diluted share.","Now, I will discuss our full-year results. Revenue grew 22% to $74.45 billion or 24% excluding the impacts of foreign exchange. North America revenue grew 28% to $44.52 billion and International revenue grew 14% to $29.94 billion or 19% growth excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Consolidated segment operating income or CSOI increased 20% to $1.99 billion or 21% excluding the unfavorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange and operating margin was 2.7%, consistent with the prior year. GAAP operating income increased 10% to $745 million or 1% of net sales.","Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $1 billion year-over-year to $12.45 billion. Inventory increased 23% to $7.41 billion and inventory turns were 8.9, down from 9.3 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 14% to $15.13 billion and accounts payable days decreased to 74 from 76 from the prior year.","I will conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we have seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.","As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance.","Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently.","For Q1 2014, we expect net sales of between $18.2 billion and $19.9 billion or growth of between 13% and 24%. This guidance anticipates approximately 30 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates.","GAAP operating income, or loss to be between a $200 million loss and $200 million in income, compared with $181 million in income in the first quarter of 2013. This includes approximately $350 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.","We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between a $150 million and $550 million, compared with $441 million in the first quarter of 2013. ","We launched Prime in the U.S. nine years ago with free, unlimited two-day shipping on 1 million items in an annual membership priced at $79. Today Prime Selection has grown to over [19] [ph] million items.","Even as fuel and transportation cost have increased, the $79 price has remained the same. We know that customers love Prime as the usage of the shipping benefit has increased dramatically since launch. On a per customer basis, Prime members are ordering more items across more categories with free two-day shipping than ever before.","With the increased cost of fuel and transportation as well as the increased usage among Prime members we\u2019re considering increasing the price of Prime between $20 to $40 in the U.S.","We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.","Thanks. With that, Dave, let's move to question.","Dave Fildes","Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move onto the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Absolutely, Mr. Fildes. Well, ladies and gentlemen at this time, we will now open the call up for question. In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Mark May with Citi.","Mark May - Citi","Thanks for talking my questions. The unit growth in the quarter, I believe was around 25%, which was a deceleration notable versus the last couple of quarters I believe the comp even got a little easier. Can you provide any color as to the dynamics in the quarter that may have drove that. Then I am trying to get a sense of how to think about the magnitude of Prime price increase maybe if you could give us a sense of the base of subscribers that that would be applied to. Then lastly on shipping demand, is there anything that Amazon will do differently next holiday season to try to smooth out the pace of demand late in the holiday shopping season.","Tom Szkutak","First, the unit growth, you are right. It was 25% year-over-year it is a small deceleration over the last couple of quarters. Keep in mind that it is certainly our biggest quarter most seasonal and so both, from a revenue and from a unit standpoint you saw a deceleration from Q3 to Q4 of 2012 also, so we saw a deceleration not of the same magnitude we saw back in 2012 from Q3 to Q4.","If you take a look at the total growth, it's 25% on a unit basis, 22% ex-exchange on a revenue basis. We saw very good growth in North America, up 26%. This is again on a revenue basis. It's down sequentially a little bit in the last couple of quarters but certainly up from Q4 of last year, where we grew 23%. In the International, revenue was up 15%, ex-exchange.","If you look at the pieces, certainly one of the biggest things you are seeing is, if you look at the media growth in our digital categories within media and International, it's growing very fast, but as we have been talking about for quite some time, certainly a shift going from physical to digital you see that reflected in the North America media growth rates.","The reason why you don't see it as much in our International is because we are at the very early stages of that. So that's what you are seeing in terms of the differential, certainly one of the key differentials between the International media growth rate and North America growth rate. Also, keep in mind, in other revenue, the AWS revenue is growing very fast is recorded North America segment.","In terms of the Prime in terms of the impact, I am sorry I can't help you with the impact on U.S. What we have said, is globally we have tens of millions of customers and we certainly have been offering Prime in the U.S. longer than International and both segment is growing very fast from a Prime perspective. That's helpful.","Then, from a customer standpoint, during Q4 we worked very hard on behalf of customers to make sure that we can service them. I think the team did a very nice job. We will continue to work on that to get even better in future quarters and in future Q4 going forward.","Operator","Our next question will come from Neil Doshi with CRT Capital.","Unidentified Analyst","Good afternoon. It's actually Rob [ph] on the call for Neil. I have a couple of questions. If you could maybe talk a little bit about the impact of refunds or incentives given to customers to make up for some of the goods that arrive late in the holiday season? Also on Prime, with respect to the increase, would you consider saving that in Prime, perhaps just the new members at first and also would you consider giving an installment option to maybe soften the blow? Thank you.","Tom Szkutak","Yes, in terms of the refunds, we did give some in the form of gift certificates as well as refunding some shipping fees or fees that were incurred by customers for that subset of customers who were impacted. So that's reflected in the Q4 results that you see today. In terms of details of how we would roll out the Prime price increase that we are considering, you have to wait on that, but certainly as I mentioned, it's something that we haven't had any increase in the nine years. Customers certainly love Prime.","The available units for shipment have grown dramatically from one million to over 19 million over the last nine years. We haven't had any price increase. Customer usage, on a per customer basis, has gone up pretty dramatically, given the selection and the convenience of the service. So that's why we are considering, of course during this nine year period, shipping cost have gone up a lot, fuel cost have gone up a lot. So that's certainly the basis for us taking a look at it but in terms of the details, we will be back when we make those decisions back to customers.","Operator","Moving on to Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.","Douglas Anmuth - JPMorgan","Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to follow-up on Prime as well. I was hoping, Tom, maybe you could give us some color on how newer Prime members, you have obviously added a lot of them over the recent quarters, but how newer cohorts of Prime members act relative to older cohorts and in particular if they convert as quickly and if they are spending on a similar early trajectory as your more tenured Prime members? Then also, can you just comment on, I believe, the constrained signups in 4Q on Prime? Thanks.","Tom Szkutak","Sure. In terms of the details, I can't really give you a lot of color on the more recent versus the Prime member who have been with us for a long time, except to say that there is a lot of similarities in terms of what we are seeing. In other words customers, when we launched Prime nine years ago, one of the things that we hoped for was customers who would do a lot more cross shopping that they would buy more from us and we are seeing that trend also in more recent Prime additions. The program is growing very fast. We are very, very pleased with it and we think it's great for the business as we look forward as well. What was the second part of the question again?","Douglas Anmuth - JPMorgan","4Q, I think you talked about signups being constrained in the quarter.","Tom Szkutak","Again, we have a very fast growth. We put a couple of statistics out in our holiday release on the 26th that you can refer to, but we had very strong growth and it did constrain it a bit and the customers liked it. Again, there is lot of demand for the service and we are going to continue to make sure that we can satisfy customers there and we thought it was appropriate to do so, to do that during Q4.","Operator","We will move on to Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.","Scott Devitt - Morgan Stanley","Hi, Tom. A couple of questions. Starting with continue the trend with Prime questions. First, you mentioned higher shipping costs being a driver of potentially higher prices in the U.S. The U.S. Prime service is also the only one that has Kindle lending library and video and was just wondering if potentially if those additional services led you think about increasing price as well to potentially further bolster either or both.","Then secondly international CSOI has been on the glide path lower over the past few years and if that's happened, the organic international growth rates moderated during the same period.","Then just wondering going back to the decision to embark on the international investment cycle, if you anticipated the current revenue growth rate that you are experiencing, and if not, where are the areas in the business where you could point to that we would begin to see growth that has not yet evident in the international business. Thank you.","Tom Szkutak","Sure. In terms of the first part, we have added a lot of new services to Prime beyond this shipping benefits you mentioned Kindle owners lending library. Certainly video, Prime Instant Video we are investing very heavily, and so those are certainly costly. Those aren't the reasons for the price increases that we\u2019re contemplating. That decision again is just based on - we have not done our price increase in nine years. Shipping costs have gone up if you look back very considerably over the nine-year period.","Customers like the service, they are using it a lot more and we have a lot more selection. They are using it a lot more and so that's the reason why we are looking at the increase.","In terms of the international growth, the growth was solid, with revenue ex-exchange at 15% the unit growth was considerably faster than that, primarily because third-party growth was very strong and certainly FBA is a component of that and when you think about the capacity that we built for not only for retail, but also for our third parties and we are able to offer our FBA items through Prime as well, so we are very happy with the capacity that we have built across the world, including our international operations and that's reflected in the results that you are seeing.","Certainly one of the reasons why you are seeing the growth of operating income up over 100% in Q4 for international is because of the mix of third-party certainly helping that, so it's a combination of a number of factors, but certainly that's one that\u2019s a significant call out.","Operator","Our next question comes from Justin Post of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. A couple of things. I was hoping you could talk about your initiatives with AmazonFresh. What you are seeing in the Bay Area and Los Angeles so far? Are you seeing more units per customer?","Then maybe talk a little bit about the international Kindle stores. Could you start to see the better media results as you build out that infrastructure? Thank you.","Tom Szkutak","Sure. In terms of Fresh in LA in the Bay area, it's very, very early. We like what we see. Customers like the service. There has been good adoption. There has been good conversion from the Prime trials. So we are very pleased with what we were seeing there, but it is still very early. So you will have to stay tuned on that one. But again, it's very early but we like what we see.","In terms of International Kindle stores, absolutely. To be very clear, if you look at the Kindle content growth in Q4 in International, it's very strong. It's just again, we are at the early stages of this cycle from physical to digital. So the growth rate is very strong and the and we saw similar type things when look back in the U.S. in terms of trends, but again, it's at the early part of the cycle in that conversion.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We will now hear from Brian Nowak with Susquehanna.","Brian Nowak - Susquehanna","Thanks. It looks like a 1P growth margin, ex-shipping expanded nicely year-on-year again. I was wondering if you could talk to some of the margins or some of the drivers of 1P growth profitability getting better? And how should we think about the sustainability of that over time? Thanks.","Tom Szkutak","We are not breaking out the first party margins, if you will. So I can't talk to the specifics of that but our retail business is very good. The combination of our retail business is in our third-party business on a platform. It works for us. We think it's very important to have both offerings for a number of reasons. One is, from a customer experience standpoint, we like the fact that customers come to our detail pages on our respective websites around the world they see competitive offerings. They know that we are very excited about making sure we get great values for customers and we price our products, appropriately and competitively low. So having the third-parties on our website certainly helps do that. It also adds additional selection that we don't have. So the combination of being able to make sure we have a competitive marketplaces as well as add great unique selection from both retail offerings and third-parties to make it work. So that's why we don't initially about first-party or third-party in terms of margins, but it's a combination of those working together on a platform that makes it work.","Brian Nowak - Susquehanna","Thank you.","Operator","We will now hear from on John Blackledge with Cowen & Company.","John Blackledge - Cowen & Company","Great. Thank you. A couple of questions. With the potential pricing change of Prime in the U.S. would Amazon consider offering Prime Instant Video separately? And in terms of Prime Instant Video, can you discuss the change in marketing spend for the service on a year-over-year basis 4Q13 versus 4Q12? Then just, in the North America electronics and other goods segment, could you call out any particular categories that you drove the growth? Thank you.","Tom Szkutak","In terms of Prime, there is not a lot I can help you with there. We certainly have - it's a great offering for customers. I wouldn't speculate what we would do or not do going forward but we like the service that we have. We continue to invest in our Prime offering and it comes in a number of different forms. We will continue to add unique selections that Prime eligible. We have a great pattern of doing that over the nine-year period. We have also offered other services, as you mentioned, in terms of Prime Instant Video as well as Kindle Owners' Lending Library. So it's a great value for customers and we plan on keeping that a great value for customers even with the price increase that we are considering in the U.S.","John Blackledge - Cowen & Company","Great. Thanks. And in the North America, in the electronics and other goods segment, just wondering if there are any particular categories that drove the growth?","Tom Szkutak","Yes, it was very broad, in terms of growth. We are very fortunate that we saw very good growth across many different categories. Certainly, in a few call it's a softline categories were very strong, consumables are very strong again in number of different areas those sort of lengthy [columns].","Operator","Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets has the next question.","Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets","Yes. Just stick with that EGM category North America. It looks to us like it has decelerated relatively sharply. I thought you were going to call out some areas of weakness there. Is there anything that cause that growth rate - you would call out that caused the growth rate to decelerate on easy comp? Then Tom, could did you want to call it anything related to whether or UPS started to think that those impacts [material business].","Tom Szkutak","Well, again, I think the question was around EGM in North America in good 25% already did decelerate from Q3. Keep in mind that a number of the categories with EGM this certainly is seasonal impact. If you look back to last year, Q4 growth rate in North America was 24%, so we actually saw an acceleration from Q4 last year to Q4 this year slightly.","Then, sorry, Mark. Second part of your question was related to?","Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets","Did you want to call it anything related to weather an UPS?","Tom Szkutak","No. I mean, I think, certainly some of the UPS issues were documented in the press. From our standpoint, our team did a very good job of serving customers. We did have the issues that you are describing, but again I will continue work on behalf of customers to make sure improve that experience over time and we didn't serve them well. We certainly did give some GCs to customers who also reimbursed them for shipping costs with where they incurred that and we will continue to make that better for customers over time.","Operator","Moving on to Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein.","Carlos Kirjner - Bernstein","Thank you. The two quick questions. Your CapEx was just slightly higher than last year's same period if you this correct for the real estate purchase. Even though the business overall grew 22% and you said AWS grew very fast. Does this relative decrease in CapEx signal an expectation AWS is going to grow slower?","Secondly, again, the Prime price increase, if you haves tens of millions of prime users that decreasing price at least $20 with no incremental expense. That's quite a good chunk of money. Do you have specific to reinvest that money? Thank you.","The first part of your question, do we expect, is this an indication that AWS is slowing down. No. It's not. Actually, we are very pleased with the AWS business. It's growing very fast. The team is doing a fantastic job from a product and service standpoint and that we are very excited about that business, so I wouldn't form any pins about what CapEx might be in the future related to the growth rates and AWS is going very, very well.","Then you know the price increase on Prime, anything that we would invest would be an independent decision. From that, again, I think in the opening remarks I talked about the rationale as to why and that's really what's driving that decision and then our investment decisions would be independent of that.","Operator","Greg Melich with ISI Group has the next question.","Greg Melich - ISI Group","Hi. Thanks, Tom. Going back to Prime, you consider the price increase, do you think the brand is such that you would be running to price seller or [tier] based on the value that's offered and sort of services you provided to certain customers?","Then second, on the categories, I believe you called out a few quarters earlier that clothing in particular was one and third-party clothing had picked up a lot. Did you see that this holiday just given the importance of that category in the season?","Tom Szkutak","I will take the second part first. Softlines is very strong in Q4, which clothing is a piece of that.","In terms of tiers on Prime, I wouldn't speculate. We might or might not do in the future, but we like the Prime program where we have invested very heavily in it. We continue or you should expect us to continue making it even better over time.","Unidentified Analyst","There's no prohibition to that but just do you still like it the way it is.","Tom Szkutak","Yes, we like it the way it is. Yes. But again, if you look back at what we have done, you can't expect that we might do going forward, but certainly we have had, in the U.S., Prime in place for nine years. We have added a massive selection during that time period. We have also added, this is on the physical side and we have also added digital content as well to the service in the U.S. with Kindle Owners' Lending Library as well as Prime Instant Video and so it's a great value for customers. We see that customers love it and we are going to continue to try and make that even better for customers over time.","Operator","Moving on to Ron Josey with JMP Securities.","Ron Josey - JMP Securities","Great. Thanks for taking the questions. So I wanted to follow-up on AWS and talk a little bit on pricing. While it is certain coming down as efficiencies improve but I believe AWS is sold in hour increments. I think Google's compete solution is sold on a per minute views. So I was wondering if you thought about maybe changing the way AWS is charged to maybe per minute? And then a quick follow-up on just fulfillment centers, if you could just remind us what you ended the year with and if you have any plans for this year? Thank you.","Tom Szkutak","Sure. I will take the second part first, the fulfillment centers. We opened seven on a net basis. So that's the net adds, but if you take that as a percentage for total fulfillment centers, you will get a number, but our square footage actually grew at quite a bit faster rate than that. Keep in mind that, I think we have talked about it in previous calls, we did have some smaller older facilities that we consolidated into larger ones. So that's a net seven. Again the square footage growth is higher than that.","In terms of pricing on AWS, the team has done a fantastic job looking at the best way to run that part of our business. I wouldn't want to speculate what they would or wouldn't do related to pricing, but they are certainly making sure that they have offered great services to customers and they are great values to customers as well. And we are very excited about that part of the business.","Ron Josey - JMP Securities","Thank you.","Operator","We will now hear from Chad Bartley with Pacific Crest.","Chad Bartley - Pacific Crest","Hi. Thank you. Two quick questions. How much of the slowdown in revenue in unit growth was a function of the shorter shopping season in Q4? And then, in terms of raising the price on Prime, how much of that might be based on customers' reaction behavior after recently raising the threshold for free shipping to $35?","Tom Szkutak","In terms of the shorter period for shopping, it's hard to tell, honestly. It's hard to know. It definitely was a shorter period from post-Thanksgiving to the holiday. But again, hard to know. And then, sorry, your other part of your question?","Chad Bartley - Pacific Crest","I am curious if the potential price increase on Prime and your confidence in doing that and that it wouldn't impact the adoption of Prime. How much of that is tied to the early results of raising the shipper saving threshold to $35 from $25?","Tom Szkutak","They were independent decisions. They weren't related.","Chad Bartley - Pacific Crest","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thomas Forte with Telsey Advisory Group has the next question.","Thomas Forte - Telsey Advisory Group","Great. Thanks for taking my question. So, when we think about shipping costs, I know you are talking about raising the rate on Prime, but you just indicated that you added seven fulfillment centers in 2013 on a net basis. As you get closer to the consumer and you shorten the shipped miles, how should we think about the benefit on shipping expenses from just having more fulfillment centers close to the consumer?","Tom Szkutak","Yes. There's no question that as we grow our footprint, we get closer and closer to customers with additional selection and that certainly helped us not raise prices or look at raising prices before this. So certainly we will continue to roll out our footprint. We are trying to make our networks as efficient as possible. And that's even with this price increase that we are looking at. It still enables us to make sure that we have Prime at a great value to customers and that's something that's very important to us, because we know it's very important to our customers.","Operator","Moving onto Brian Pitz with Jefferies.","Brian Pitz - Jefferies","Great. Thanks. In terms of digital content how are exclusive titles and original series driving user growth and Prime memberships? And any color on what kind of engagement dynamics you are seeing across the different platforms? Thank you.","Tom Szkutak","Could you repeat the question please?","Brian Pitz - Jefferies","Sure. In terms of digital content, I am just trying to figure out how some of your exclusive content titles are driving user growth and Prime memberships and any color just on what type of engagement you are seeing across different platforms via PC, tablet et cetera.","Tom Szkutak","We are seeing customers like the digital content. We are seeing great engagement, we are not breaking out in terms of the form, but again we are seeing great engagement. We do track very closely the Prime customers to come from free trials for examples.","They come through the pipeline for digital content from free trial standpoint, we track those conversions and we see that's growing very nicely. We do look at customers that use our Prime Instant Video, what are their shopping patterns look like both side of digital content.","Beyond the free content we have on there, do they buy more digital content and certainly we are seeing nice growth in digital content because of that, because they do. They also do a lot of shopping physical categories as well, so those things we are tracking very closely and it's a great pipeline for us as customers look at the total value proposition for Prime, including digital content.","Operator","Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs has the next question.","Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs","Great. Thanks. Tom, you mentioned a strong growth in AWS. Looking at the deceleration in the North America and other line, how should investors think about the relative growth of AWS versus the advertising and financial partnership that make up the rest of that segment? Then just on Fresh with L.A. and San Francisco's performance centers caring a number of non-perishable SKUs. What does Fresh do for your same day fulfillment capabilities in those markets?","Tom Szkutak","In terms of AWS, I think the best way to think about it is a number of things other than AWS can be a lumpy, and you should assume when you look at the North America growth for Q4, our AWS revenue is growing at a faster rate than other.","Then in terms of Fresh, when you look at those two and look at the new offerings that we have in the Bay Area and in the L.A. area it's certainly helping our same day delivery and they work hand in hand. In another words, we have increased the capability both, for Fresh as well as for our non-Fresh part of our business there in those locations.","Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We will now hear from Youssef Squali with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Youssef Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald","Thank you very much. Two questions please. First, have you seen any impact from the rise of Google's PLA this quarter? Second, are you using Kiva's technology in your food distribution centers particularly for perishables? Our understanding is that is not optimized for that, but is that true and if not, are there any other solutions outside of Amazon that do that optimally? Thank you.","Tom Szkutak","In terms of Kiva, it's very early. We are early in our installations there, that's really all I can say. We have it in the few facilities. It's going very well, very pleased with having Kiva as part of the Amazon family, if you will, and we are excited about the opportunity that brings us going forward.","Youssef Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald","On the PLAs?","Tom Szkutak","I can't comment.","Youssef Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank.","Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank","Thanks. Tom, just a quick high-level question, so consumers in smartphone markets are spending about half their time on mobile these days and a lot of that's coming off of PC. I am sure that is a great kind of new customer acquisition channel for you guys, but in terms of existing Amazon customers, are you guys seeing purchase frequency for physical products go up because of having phones with you all day? Or is it just swapping off of PC and into these newer channels? Thanks","Tom Szkutak","I kind of view just having the more connected devices, is just a tailwind for our business, and it's additive. It's certainly helping our business grow. So whether that's phones or tablets, it's just a tailwind for our business. And we think it will continue to be so. So customers will certainly still purchase from their desktop or their laptop and so the tablet mobile will not be completely additive, but it will certainly be a tailwind for our business. It's just anytime customers have easier access to be able to purchase, that's good for us.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one additional question from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.","Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray","Thank you. Good afternoon. Could you just remind us on just kind of high level philosophy, the trade-off between revenue growth and earnings. I think investors typically think that you see this as all of your market as nascent and profitability as kind of a distant thought. Is that still the case and any guidance in terms of how to think about that over the next two, five, ten years? Thank you.","Tom Szkutak","Sure. We track a lot of our investments on a discreet basis as best we can. We are looking to maximize. Can you hear me okay?","Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray","Yes.","Tom Szkutak","We are looking to maximize free cash flow in those investments over time. So we have some investments that certainly start to pay-off and become profitable in a three to five year period. We have others that have been a bit longer. But again, we are monitoring those investments very carefully. Our goal is to maximize free cash flow for investors over time. That's clearly our goal. And that's something that we are working towards.","All that being said, we are investing a lot in the business right now. You can see that when you look at our results and the reason why we are doing that is because of the very large opportunities that we see. We do go in cycles, as you have seen in our historical results, from time to time. We will pull back to make sure the model is working and we have done that and I am sure you will see that going forward at times as well. But again, we are focused on making sure that we have a great customer experience with maximized free cash flow over the long term.","Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray","Got it. Thank you.","Dave Fildes","Great. Thanks, Tom. Thank you all for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter.

In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.","Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.","I'd also like to update you on the impact of the recent U.S. tax reform legislation. In our fourth quarter results, we recorded a provisional tax benefit for the impact of the new tax legislation of approximately $789 million, which is primarily driven by the remeasurement of federal net deferred tax liabilities, resulting from the permanent reduction in the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%. As we complete our analysis of this new legislation, we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts. Those adjustments may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made. ","With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.","Mark Mahaney","I'd like to focus on the North American retail operating margins. That 4.5% was the highest, I think, we've seen in a couple of years, maybe the highest since you've actually broken that segment out. So could you just go through the drivers behind that? I know you called out Alexa as being better than expected. Was that one of the factors? Was it the full quarter of the Whole Foods impact? Was it advertising revenue? Just what drove that result and how sustainable is it?","Brian Olsavsky","Sure, Mark. Let me address your question by answering the entire company on noteworthy North America elements are strongest. So for the quarter, we came in at the highest end of our revenue range, $60.5 billion, 26 -- 36% FX-neutral growth and 25% FX-neutral growth, excluding the Whole Foods acquisition. So the fact that we came in at the high end of the range, volume was high, especially in North America, and a lot of times in Q4 and other quarters actually, we see better efficiencies when the warehouses were busy. So it's a very clean operational quarter, I would say. The ops team did a great job handling record volumes in Q4 and also incorporating all the new capacity we had opened in 2017. If you remember, we have added over 30% to our fulfillment square footage in 2017, coming off the similar increase in 2016. So amid all these opening of new buildings, many of them late in the year, the ops team did a fantastic job. ","Advertising was also a key contributor as we're continuing to make more value -- the offering's more valuable, both to customers and advertisers alike, and that was particularly strong in North America, although not in the North America segment. I would also point out, AWS had a strong quarter, accelerating growth versus Q3 and also expanding operating margins by 100 basis points. So particularly in North America, I would say there's the volume -- the strong volume -- top line volume, combined with increased advertising revenues and also very clean operational performance. Obviously, there's a lot of things that can happen in Q4 from weather to demand patterns changing. We've seen additional costs creep in, in the name of customer experience in prior years, and this was, in hindsight, probably one of the cleaner Q4s recently.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with J.P. Morgan.","Douglas Anmuth","Brian, I was hoping you could talk about how you're thinking about your primary investment areas in 2018 and perhaps if you could put it in context of '17. There things that are notably different this year relative to last year and also, how you think about the margin trajectory relative to what we saw last year.","Brian Olsavsky","Sure. I will be giving you guidance quarter by quarter, but I can talk to the general trends in the large investment areas. Let me start with AWS infrastructure and the growth in technical and sales teams. That will continue. We're [indiscernible] $20 billion run rate in top line revenues for AWS, up from 18% -- actually $18 billion last quarter. So we're very happy with both the progression in new services and features that we've been able to bring to customers and also their response with continued geographic expansion and continuing to again build on our tech teams and our sales teams. So that would -- that expense is going to continue and likely increase. Prime benefits will continue to increase as well. Prime Now -- excuse me, Prime Video, Prime Now, AmazonFresh, all of our major Prime benefits, we continue to expand globally.","Devices, as Jeff said in the press release, we are very happy with the results of Alexa. It's a very positive surprise for us both on a -- adding a little bit more to that, we had record device sales with very high levels of customer engagement, including increased levels of voice shopping, growth in functionality, growth in our partner, partners we work with, skills that we've increased rapidly, we're over 30,000 skills for Alexa. We've got 4,000 plus smarthome devices from 1,200 unique brands. So that -- the relationships we're having with external companies is actually helping to accelerate the adoption of Alexa with customers. So really strong usage of -- excuse me, Alexa with our devices. Obviously Echo, Echo Show and the Echo family all directly tied to Alexa, but also Fire TV and tablets and we're seeing more and more engagement. Alexa usage on Fire TV is up 9x year-over-year.","Music listening time on Alexa was 3x higher this holiday season. So that's what we mean when we said far exceeding our expectations. Those are the things that I would point to. And that is an area again where we'll continue to invest heavily, and as you say, double down on that. Fulfillment, again, is -- fulfillment capacity, especially the fuel strong top line growth and growth in Amazon fulfilled the units, which, again, is growing much quicker than our unit growth rate. We expect that and hope that to continue as well into 2018. Video content, we spoke about on the last call. We do like the results we're seeing with engagement on customers, their buying habits, their engagement with the Video content, their use of it on devices and we will continue to increase our budget in that area. But I'd be really -- I'd incorporate that into the guidance each quarter as we move through the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays.","Ross Sandler","Hey guys, just two questions. AWS reaccelerated again this quarter. Can you just give us some color on what are the key drivers there? Was it lapping some of the price activity from a year ago? Was it higher utilization, moving up the stack? Any color there would be helpful. And then a question on shipping costs. So it looks like it grew about 31% up on shipping costs in the quarter, and that's been kind of moving in tandem with the Amazon fulfilled unit growth. Is that the right way to think about it? It looks like it might be getting a little bit of leverage in the model right now what's driving that, the shipping cost leverage?","Brian Olsavsky","Sure. Let me start with that last one. Yes, the shipping costs are going to be very tied to AFN unit growth and also the impact often greater Prime adoption and faster shipping methods. So we consider that a very strong quarter as down sequentially in the growth that we've seen recently. That will fluctuate quarter to quarter. Again, it was a very strong operational quarter in Q4, and we've expanded the number of items that shipped free. There are now over 100 million items in the U.S. So shipping cost is always going to be a strong part of our offering, and we're -- it's going to be increasing due to our business model, and we, at the same time, look then to minimize the cost by getting more and more efficient in that area, AWS, yes, if you remember last year, we did have price increases in December of last year towards the end.","So it had a partial impact on the quarter. But generally, just strong usage growth -- usage growth continues to be strong growing at a higher rate than our revenue growth rate, and customers continued to add workloads and expand. And as I said, we're adding new services and features all the time, over 1,400 in 2017 alone. So it's a number of factors, I would say. It's not as simple as lapping a cost error -- excuse me, price decrease last year, but we're very happy with the performance in the AWS business. Now over a $20 billion run rate.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi.","Mark May","Brian, if you look back historically, your Q1 operating income guidance is typically about $300 million, $400 million lower than your Q4. Obviously, it's significantly greater than that this quarter. Maybe if you could shed a little light on why that is so and what are some of the key drivers there. And AWS and cloud pricing appears to have been more subtle in the recent quarters. Maybe if you could talk a little bit about the pricing environment and why that has been the case at least compared to trends from back in '14, '15, previously.","Brian Olsavsky","Sure. Let me start with guidance. So yes, the operating income guidance is $300 million to $1 billion. Operating income last year was $1 billion. Q1 is generally when we see the volume drop off from Q4 obviously, but a lot of the cost remain from the year-over-year build up in cost, particularly in the fulfillment network. So it's generally a headwind every Q1. It's -- given the 30% plus growth in square footage last year that we've built, that's 1 major headwind from Q4 to Q1. But we also continue to invest, particularly in Alexa and our device area. As I mentioned in a number of comments earlier, we're very happy with the results, the customer adoption, the device sales that we're seeing and the general customer acceptance there. So we will continue to invest there. That's probably the 2 largest factors in Q1, I would say.","Dave Fildes","This is Dave. Just on the second piece on pricing. I think on the pricing environment, nothing really to call out there. I guess, just a reminder on our pricing philosophy for AWS, I mean periodic price reductions are a normal part of our business where reduced prices more than 60x with AWS since launching. So really, our kind of goal philosophy here is to drive efficiencies in our ops and pass those savings on to customers, and some of that's through, again, with the more than 60 price reductions, but also finding through new service and future launches, better options for customer that -- customers to present more efficient features for them to be able to run their businesses.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets.","Daniel Salmon","First, Brian, any comments on the impact of ASC 606 accounting changes on your first quarter guidance here? And then just second on the advertising business, in particular, the ads that we see in the search results on the site, you have line search product sponsored ads, do you aim for certain particular ad load across the entire platform? Do you look at sort of tailoring it based on users activity, maybe a combination of both? I would just be interested in your thoughts on that.","Dave Fildes","Yes, this is Dave. I'll take the first part of that question just around the new revenue recognition standard. We did adopt a new standard in January 1 of this year, 2018, and you'll see that reflected in our financials for the first quarter coming up. There are -- it touches on a number of different parts of our business in terms of how we recognize revenue in terms of any aggregate, the impacts to our expectations for the revenue guidance for the first quarter. It's not material. There's a number of different areas, at least, that we've called out in our filings with the 10-Q in the past and the 10-K that will be on file shortly that talk about the different areas that are impacted us. But again, not material in the aggregate.","Brian Olsavsky","And on advertising, I would say our strategy is to make the customer experience additive by the ad process. We want customers to be able to see new brands and have easier time discovering products that they're looking for. For brands, we think the value proposition is that we can find ways for them, especially emerging brands, to reach new customers. So we're working with advertisers of all types and sizes to help them reach our customer base and the goal of driving brand awareness, discovery and better purchase decisions by the customer.","Operator","Our next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Justin Post","I think I have two questions. First, your Whole Foods, you've got over a quarter under your belt. How's it going versus your expectations? And what can Amazon really bring now that you've been there for a while, how are you thinking about that? And then secondly, your international decelerated a little bit this quarter, just wondering if there was any country to call out or anything going on there? And we know that you spent about $3 billion on International investment, I guess, last year. Where do you think the high watermark is on that? So just maybe a little more color on your international about business.","Brian Olsavsky","Sure. Let me start with the Whole Foods question. We're continuing to be very excited about the opportunities we have to innovate with the Whole Foods and Amazon teams together. In our physical stores, it feels there are supplemental disclosure that physical stores revenue was $4.5 billion in Q4, which is primarily comprised of Whole Foods and was slightly better than what was built into our guidance that I gave you last call. So, so far, our focus has been on continuing to lower prices even beyond the initial ones that we discussed at the close of the deal in late August. We've launched Whole Foods products on our Amazon website, and we're -- the technical work continues to make Prime the Whole Foods customer rewards program and we expect to have more on that later in the year.","We've also added Lockers, and much more to come. So we're very happy with the initial results out of the team in Whole Foods down in Austin. Also, I will mention that we did see a small operating income loss for the quarter from Whole Foods. At the time of the acquisition, we had stepped up the fair market value of certain assets on the balance sheet. This is going to increase the amortization. It's a noncash charge, but it will increase the amortization over the useful life, and a lot of that is forward frontloaded, so we'll see higher amortization in the first few years, and then it reverse later. So excluding this noncash expense items, Whole Foods had a positive operating income in Q4, but you'll see in the 10-K that the operating income, including the charges, was slightly negative in Q4. International growth, your comment about slowing down, I think there's a slowdown versus Q3, if that was your point. 28% growth in Q3, FX neutral, was helped quite a bit by Prime Day and kind of the strengthening of Prime Day in a number of locales.","Although we've had Prime Day in most of those countries, it's really starting to gain more and more traction there. So that is probably more of a help to Q3 than a discussion of any weakness in Q4. So we're -- continue to be pursuing the same strategy as we have in North America, adding Prime benefits, adding devices, adding video content, adding AmazonFresh, Prime Now, giving a lot of value to the Prime customers in the international countries as well and also in that numbers. In India, India continues to be a good story for us. We feel that it's had a lot of growth in the past year. In fact, more Prime members joined India's Prime program in the first year than we've seen in any other country in the history of the world, our world. So the selection is also increasing Prime eligible selection is up over 25 million items, launching Video there and also continuing to add other Prime benefits such as Prime Music will be coming soon, Amazon Family is there, as I said, Prime Video, and we had our first Prime Day in India. So that's a little bit on international growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.","Brian Nowak","I have two. First one, in the press release, you talked about the strength of the Prime member growth in 2017. Could you talk a little bit about to the -- what you're seeing in growth in Prime subscribers in the United States at this point? And are you still seeing a similar tick up in consumer spending as they come into Prime as you have in the past? And the second one , Brian, to go back to an earlier question on areas of investment this year, you didn't talk a whole lot about kind of new categories to expand into beyond the old retail business. I'd be curious to hear about your investment needed to go into logistics, health care and kind of new areas you haven't really cracked into as hard yet.","Dave Fildes","Yes, this is Dave, thanks for the answer the question, Brian. Just on the first piece, in terms of just Prime membership and Prime behavior, we continue to see that we're seeing sign-ups from memberships at a strong clip. When we look at the year-over-year growth in paid Prime members on a global basis, it's been consistent in Q4 year-over-year, similar growth rates year-over-year to what we've seen in some of the earlier quarters of this year. So that's, of course, a mix of strength in the U.S. and also strength in some of the newer markets that we've launched or introduced the Prime program in. We continue to see that as Prime members sign up and engage into the program, their purchasing patterns of change and they do spend more as they move into the program. And of course, our focus is -- continues to be on adding some of the features around Prime that Brian's been talking about, but also importantly, making sure we're adding more selection to the offering through our own efforts, first party, but also programs like Fulfillment by Amazon, which continues to be a fast grower for us.","Brian Olsavsky","Yes, and on new businesses or expansion of categories, as you discussed, I would not talk to anything that's not been publicly announced, but on some of the ones you mentioned, they are underway and are continuing. I've said logistics, we will continue to build our logistics capability both -- and that will be all the way to end delivery. We've been able to increase service levels in many cases by delivering ourselves. And although we have a strong partner network here, we will always be able to leverage our strength and our knowledge about where shipments are going, both within our network and to final customers that will create opportunities for us there as we increase or better the customer experience as well.","I would say on the category side, that the biggest effort will be on continuing to be on groceries and consumables with the Whole Foods acquisition and again, we continue to look at our whole offering of AmazonFresh, Prime Now, Whole Foods, how can they work together to create better and better offerings for our customer base. And to a lesser extent, versus grocery, I would say we continue to build our business, B2B businesses, and very happy with the initial performance there with a number of the companies and universities that we've been working with and their initial results.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research.","Scott Mushkin","Hey, guys, so I wanted to go back to, and I think you said one of the biggest focuses of the year is going to be on the consumables now, Fresh, Whole Foods. There's been a lot of press on the Whole Foods front, the out-of-stock issue and then clearly, in the Now, as we've been testing it, the Fresh has the same issue. So I was wondering if you guys could talk about what the company plans to do. I mean, there is obviously the reputational risk that could come from that to kind of correct some of these issues and kind of what the view of the company is on the out-of-stock issues. Not just the Whole Foods but just generally across the consumables business in Fresh and Now.","Brian Olsavsky","Yes, let me just back it to a more general statement. I'd say Whole Foods is not less in their commitment to providing the best selection of high-quality products and having them in stock for customers. We've made no changes post acquisition that would have impacted anything related to in stock, except perhaps the fact that the price decreases have brought up demand and there's an amount of rebalancing related to that. So I think the out-of-stock issue is that -- may be getting press or tied more to the increased demand that we're seeing and also selective weather-related restocking issues.","But stepping beyond any short-term issues, the commitment is -- remains to have healthy, high-quality selection in stock for products. That's what the Whole Foods team is committed to. That's what the Amazon team, with them, is committed to, and also across any delivery channel that we have, AmazonFresh, Prime Now or Whole Foods. So where there's issues, they'll be corrected. Where there's areas we can improve our selection and delivery for customers, we'll do so. But it be something we're working on. So the immediacy, the perishability are all challenges everyone has in this area, but we're confident that we will have a good service and continue to delight customers.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Youssef Squali","We've seen that the number of private label products on the site has increased pretty dramatically over the last 12 to 18 months. Could you speak to your private label strategy, in general? How big is that segment today? How big can it become? And just broadly speaking, how are the margins in that segment versus comparable third-party products?","Dave Fildes","Yes, thanks for the question. This is Dave. I think broadly, when we look at our strategy, it's focused on, number one, providing a broad selection for customers across a number of categories, so that they can find and buy exactly what they're looking for. When you look at private brands, it's very much meant to supplement that great selection, and we look for ways to be able to find private label items that have a high-caliber of quality, but also can bring that selection and that convenience for customers and really supplement what vendors and sellers are already providing the customers in many cases. We've not broken out kind of how significant or how large that is. I think for a lot of these initiatives, when you look across categories that would offer, many of them are still earlier stage and have been around even from kind of infancy for shorter period of time, a year, a couple of years, in some cases.","Amazon Fashion is one area where you're seeing us offer a number of private apparel brands and some of the more popular lines with customers things like Good Threads, Amazon's Essentials, which is men's and women's basics; consumables, is, of course, another big area where we have the benefit of working with some of the Whole Foods private label, but also doing some of our other Amazon brands, things like Happy Belly and [indiscernible] Prime and others. So I think we'll continue to iterate on those and try to find different areas. And certainly there's other verticals that I didn't mention there that we're interested in continuing to kind of learn from customers what they want and what they're looking for there, and so we'll keep adding selection.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Sena with Wells Fargo.","Kenneth Sena","Maybe if you could just remind us of the thinking that behind keeping AWS and Retail under 1 corporate structure, and does it make sense given the scale of where AWS is right now? And then -- and I'm sorry if I have a little bit of an echo, I don't know why, but -- and we're hearing from marketers just how important Amazon is to their media strategy, so I don't know if you could just maybe talk about that a little bit more broadly in terms of the approach in your philosophy to that business.","Dave Fildes","Sure, we see a lot of value in all of our businesses. And AWS is a key component, as is the physical consumer business. The -- what I'll point out is, the management team is a common management team. The consumer business, if you will, is, if not the biggest, one of the largest customers of AWS. So we see a lot of commonality there where we, as depending on the position in the company, on the consumer side, the use of AWS is -- has driven great infrastructure efficiencies just like other companies see when they use AWS, turning fixed costs into variable costs and pooling resources and not having a lot of trapped capacity throughout the company and taking advantage of all the new services and features. So as an internal customer, the consumer business is very happy with AWS. And I think AWS is also very benefited by the fact that they have a large internal beta customer that tries out and uses a lot of their products and services. So it's a good combination for a lot of reasons, and we see no reason to change the structure that we have.","Brian Olsavsky","Yes, and sorry, Ken, your second question was?","Kenneth Sena","Yes, the second question was just on the advertising side. And we're just hearing so much more how important Amazon is to broader media budgets. And so just hoping to get maybe a little bit more color just on your approach to the business right now, some of the drivers behind the recent success and just maybe just more of a sort of, as you look out over the next few years, kind of how important do you see this business becoming in the grand scheme of things?","Dave Fildes","Yes, I mean, I think right now, we're really just focused on finding ways to work with those companies, whether it's vendors or sellers that are coming to us, and offer them a great experience on the website and ability to be able to reach customers. So I think there's more to come on that side. As we said, we're definitely seeing some strong growth in our advertising revenues as part of the other revenue line item. And I think we're going to keep building more and new tools based on what we're learning from our customers there to better serve in the future.","Brian Olsavsky","Yes, I think we're also point of a key lien in from brands and agencies into the e-commerce marketing space. So it's other side, search or social marketing, it's really helping them engage customers on a high, efficient, highly efficient manner.","Dave Fildes","Thanks for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our IR website, at least through the end of the quarter.

Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is coming from John Blackledge with Cowan. Please proceed with your question.","John Blackledge - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for the question. So, the first quarter GAAP operating income guide essentially implies negative incremental margins kind of at the low, mid and high end of guidance. So, just wondering if you could frame in order, if possible, the investment areas that are driving the negative incremental margins and then just generally how should we think about the margin profile in 2017? Thank you.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Sure. Thank you, John. First, let me talk about revenue just to get that out there as well. We are guiding to 17% to 25% growth on an FX-neutral basis. That includes approximately \u2013 excuse me, yes, on top of that is approximately 250 basis points or $730 million of FX negative impact which brings the non-FX adjusted rate down to \u2013 excuse me, range down to 14% to 23%. I will also point out that we have the leap year comp from last year. Last year, the extra day of leap year was worth 150 basis points to us in our Q1 revenue. This year, that reverses. So we have 150-basis point headwind to growth. And that's been factored into our guidance range.","But your question was on bottom line. So yes, what you are seeing, John, is the continuation of the step-up investment that we saw in the second half of last year. I talked about, in prior calls, about the fulfillment center step-up. We had 26 warehouses we added last year. 23 of them were in the second half of the year. Digital content, digital video content and marketing stepped up quite a bit in the second half of the year. We continue to invest heavily in those two areas. We also have investments in other Prime benefits from Prime Now to AmazonFresh and of course we are continuing to invest in Alexa and our Echo devices. And finally, I guess, I'd point out India which continues to be a rather large investment for us.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Devitt with Stifel.","Scott Devitt - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Thank you. Questions on video. I was wondering if you could just give any quantification in terms of the magnitude of video spend in 2017 as well as the lumpiness from an expensing standpoint quarterly.","And then separately as it relates to just the video service, from a positioning standpoint in the market, how do you think about the unique aspects of the product that Amazon has relative to others in the market in terms of the aggregation tools that are being provided now where some of the value is being perceived longer-term? Is it the uniqueness of the content or is it other things? If you could provide a little bit of color on that, that would be helpful. Thank you.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Sure. Well, ultimately, I'll step back and say one of the main things we look out on Prime Video is customer usage patterns and in 2016 we had a doubling of Prime hours for video, music and reading. So we're happy with the engagement that customers have. We're also happy with the \u2013 especially on the Studios side, the people we've been able to work with, some of the most talented people in the entertainment industry. And our customers have responded really well to the shows that we've created. We've garnered awards, of course, but mainly that what we're focused on is good content that is attractive to customers.","I'll also point out that we rolled out the global Prime Video offer in the second half of last \u2013 or, excuse me, in Q4. And what we see there is again, original content is a fixed cost expense. The more we can amortize it over a large base, the better off we'll be. But more importantly, we have great content that we want to share with people outside of our primary retail countries. And this takes us to over 200 more countries. So we're very happy with the results in video. Yes, the investment did step up in the second half of last year, including marketing. And that will continue in 2017 and likely beyond.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Ben Schachter with Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Benjamin Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Can you discuss what you're doing to help merchants in China sell and ship directly to consumers in the U.S. and other developed economies and how that business has been evolving over time? Thanks.","Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.","Yes, hi, Ben. This is Darin. Yes. We're very pleased with our FBA offering, and that's really helpful to sellers around the world. Certainly, our international sellers have access to more and more customers through that offering and that doesn't exclude sellers in China as well. The offering in China that we have for consumers is also a great, trusted customer engagement. And we have a very strong and trusted venue for Chinese customers to access international brands there as we continue to focus on great offerings through the AmazonGlobal Store, which offers great brands from outside of China to customers. And so there's a mix of things going on in China and we're happy with what we're seeing in both of those.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please state your question.","Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Just a follow-up on India and China. I know you are investing a lot. I'd love to hear how much, but you probably won't tell us. But can you tell us why you think the market is worth investment and what really attracts you to the market as you think out longer-term? And then China, can you give us any updates there on how financial performance is doing and if you've changed your strategy and if anything has gotten better there this year? Thank you.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Sure. Let me start with India. So, it's still very early. We continue to say that, but we are very encouraged with what we've created with customers and sellers alike in India over the last few years. We continue to develop new functionality for that country, whether it's delivery, whether it's seller features. We rolled out Prime last summer if you'll remember, and we recently launched Prime Video there. So we've had success with [technical difficulty] (10:55) we've been in. We don't expect India to be any different. We will continue to build our business there and continue to do a great job for both customers and sellers. We're bullish on India longer-term and it's early. But we like the initial engagement we're seeing and the response from, again, both customers and sellers.","Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.","Yes, and this is Darin. On China, like I said, we're very pleased with our offering in China. Our strategy there has been one of bringing a trusted and authentic product to customers in China, both domestically and from international offers. So we'll continue to focus on the Global Store there. As you may know, we've launched the Prime program that's focused around the availability of international goods in China and that we're pleased with what we're seeing there.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Two primary questions. Can you give us a sense of what the best way to think about the impact that the shift to third-party and within that, the growth in FBA is having on these sequential growth rates? To the extent that there's 150-basis point impact from leap year on a year-over-year basis, is there a way to quantify the impact that that shift to third-party is having on the growth rate for the first quarter for what you've reported in the fourth quarter?","And then on the AWS side of the business, with the price cut in November, can you give us some sense of what impact the price cut had on the deceleration in growth compared to the impact that presumably it had in driving incremental volume to the platform?","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Sure. Let me start with that second question first. So more basically, on AWS, very happy with the response from customers. I feel we've got a very broad base of customers from startups to small-medium businesses to large enterprises to the public sector. And we're continuing to see strong growth across all those sectors. The business is now a $14 billion annualized \u2013 running at a $14 billion run rate. You are right that we had seven price cuts in Q4, essentially timed for December 1, so about 1\/3 of the impact was seen in Q4.","But that's going to be constant in this business. We've been pretty clear that this business is all about creating new functionality for customers, giving price cuts and then working on the operating efficiencies. So, very pleased with Q4 and the pace of the business. The new services and features last year were over 1,000 versus 700 or so the \u2013 excuse me, in 2015. So we continue to innovate on behalf of customers. We're working with some very large customers in each industry. You've seen probably press releases on companies like Capital One, Workday, Salesforce and others. So, again, widespread usage and new customer adoption, which is great.","Your second question on FBA, I can't break out the year-over-year difference there. What I will say the impact of FBA on our business is and first that's one of the things that we look at is how well are we attracting new FBA sellers, because again, FBA reinforces Prime, Prime reinforces FBA. It's a good flywheel and we added active sellers in FBA grew 70% year-over-year in 2016. So we're very happy with the continued adoption of FBA and what that does to Prime, eligible selection for Prime members.","The other data point I'll give you that affects our cost structure is our Amazon Fulfilled units, which is the combination of retail plus FBA, grew nearly 40% last year and that compares to our paid unit growth of 24% in Q4. I'm giving you a Q4, not a full year number, but they're similar in relative proportion. The fulfillment center expenses and a lot of our shipping costs are tied to the increase in that FBA percentage and that growth of Amazon Fulfilled units.","So that is certainly a factor that we consider a positive from a customer standpoint and it's one from a cost standpoint that we certainly continue to work on every day. But that's about \u2013 I think that's the most I can give you on FBA at this point.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thanks very much. Maybe as a quick follow-up on the quarter, we've heard from other e-commerce companies and retailers about a higher degree of promotional activity during Q4. So I wonder if there was any conscious decision on your part to pull back from some of the more aggressive discounting.","And then my whether question is whether you can shed any more light on the motivation to build out the air cargo hub in Cincinnati, understanding the need to support the growth of the core retail business, but also if this gives you more of an opportunity to build out direct connections to suppliers, for example, or a longer-term offer excess capacity or logistics as a service. Thank you very much.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Sure, Colin. On your first question, holidays are always a very promotional period. So we don't see \u2013 I can't really comment on the year-over-year differential in promotional activities to us. We are always looking to not be beat on price. We want to offer the best options to customers and we saw a lot of great response from customers this holiday season. I think we would be a very trusted holiday partner particularly as you get closer to the holiday. So, on the promotion side, we don't consider it a huge factor either way. It's pretty much a cost of doing business 12 months a year for us.","And, sorry, the second question is on the hub in Cincinnati \u2013 or excuse me, in Kentucky. Yes, that is \u2013 I saw the announcement on that. That is a partnership we have to build out the facility at the Hebron, Kentucky airport. I think it'll create thousands of jobs over time. What it does for us is it gives us a base for future growth. It's all about supplementing our existing capacity both our partners and ourselves and essentially building capacity that can handle this top line growth and also the growth in AFN or Amazon Fulfilled Network units which as I just mentioned is even higher than our paid unit growth.","So same as some of the investments you saw in airplanes last year, our partnerships with companies that do air cargo. This is about supplying our need for our customers and our sellers. We value the partnership with external, the external providers as well and I think we're all dealing with the problem of having lots of incremental volume year-over-year.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Mark May with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you. Just a question on paid unit growth. For the last several quarters here, it's been accelerating on a year-on-year basis and I think this quarter 24%, it was below the 26% that you reported in Q4 of 2015. Just kind of curious what had been driving the acceleration over the past few quarters and what may be changed this quarter?","And then in terms of the Q1 revenue guidance, wondering if you could provide a little bit of color in terms of the impact that maybe the recent AWS price adjustments are having on your Q1 guidance. Thanks.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Let me start with the second one. So we factored it in, obviously, into the numbers I gave through guidance, the timing of it was again closer to December 1. So there'll be an incremental differential in Q1 on those price cuts, but this is something that we again have quite frequently and I don't think it's a large factor in Q1. The bigger one is more mechanical that leap day comp I would say. And just if you're looking on a non-FX adjusted basis, the foreign exchange exposure, which I mentioned was $730 million or 250 basis points expected in this guidance.","Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.","Hi, Mark. This is Darin. On the unit growth, we're very happy with the 24% unit growth that we saw in Q4 like you mentioned. Our unit growth has been strong and that's primarily attributable to our Prime program and the customers and members that enjoy that program. As Brian mentioned, that 28% is only part of the story. Our Amazon Fulfilled units, the amount going through our fulfillment centers and which essentially includes our first-party retail and our FBA sales and it grew nearly 40% over 2016. So we're very pleased with those results and happy with the fundamentals of the business from that perspective.","Customers continue to respond very well to the low prices. The vast selection which is helped by the FBA sellers and the strong convenience that we can offer through FREE Two-Day Shipping and the multitude of other faster shipping options such as Same-Day, Next-Day and in some cases with Prime Now, the 1-Hour Delivery to 2-Hour Delivery. So Prime membership and selection continues to drive growth and you'll see that in our unit growth numbers.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to talk obviously about border tax. I was hoping that you could give us some of your initial thoughts there and how you might think about some of the key considerations around a potential border tax.","And then secondly, can you just talk a little bit about fulfillment centers. You mentioned the 26 fulfillment center buildout in 2016. Any color that you can give us in terms of how you're thinking about that for 2017? Thanks.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Sure. On the first one, we have a long-standing practice of not commenting on regulatory or tax matter. So I'm not going to comment on any proposed issues out there. We certainly keep an eye on external issues and weigh in when we think it's going to impact our business. But, your \u2013 sorry. Your second question was on FCs. We will continue to invest in FCs. The comparable I'll give you is that I won't forecast 2017, but the 20% growth in square footage that we saw in 2015 was followed by 30% square footage increase in 2016. That generally went to service that 40% growth in units, in AFN units. It also included some of the additional logistics delivery stations and all, too. So it's not all FC capacity, that's square footage. But I would say that we are going to continue to invest in fulfillment centers as long as our AFN growth rate maintains high, and we certainly want to keep that high and growing.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Two questions, please. First, any comment on customer growth qualitatively, how that's trended, how that trended throughout the year, accelerated, consistent, decelerated? And then, would you be willing to give any commentary on the engagement impact you're seeing from all of these Echo devices that are getting into households? Are you seeing people shop more? Are they engaging more with other parts of Amazon? Just any sort of impact on what people with these Echo devices do that's different than Amazon customers that don't have them. Thank you.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Sure. Let me start with the Echo. So I don't think I'm going to answer your exact question there on quantifying the retail sales through Echo devices. It's still very early days on that, so that's not material. But the engagement is just like any other Prime benefit or investment that we have. We do look at engagement and we like the engagement of customers who have Echoes. But let me step back a minute and give some highlights on that, Alexa and Echo together. As we mentioned in our press release, the unit sales of Echoes grew nine times, 9x, year-over-year during the holiday period. So, great customer adoption. We're really glad to see that and that creates a great base of Echo and Alexa fans out there.","We've added 4,000 skills to Alexa since I last spoke to you in October and we're working with a lot of major companies as they add abilities, too, for our customer base to use the Alexa or the Echo to reach them. Tens of thousands of developers are building new skills for Alexa. So, the skills addition should continue. And just as importantly, tens of thousands of developers are also using the Alexa Voice Service to help integrate Alexa into their products, which then creates a great network effect. We're doing that ourselves. If you've seen in the quarter, we added Alexa capabilities to our tablets and Fire TV devices, making them better. So it's a great, again, part of the flywheel in that, Echo and Alexa make the devices better and it builds engagement, not only with Echo and Alexa, but also with Amazon.","Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.","Hi, Mark. This is Darin. On the customer count, no absolute number to give this quarter. As you know, back in Q1 we gave an active customer count that exceeded 300 million and I can say it's still growing and we're pleased with the number there. What we do like is the engagement with Prime. We continue to add Prime members and similar to the flywheel that Brian was just mentioning, that the FBA selection helps us with engaging customers and in particular the Prime program. So we're very pleased with our customer engagement this year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one is just on the last mile, the logistics build. Can you help us at all on what you're seeing in some of these markets like the UK where you have more of the last mile buildout done on your own? Is there anything you're seeing about Prime behavior? What are the advantages and even the challenges you're facing as you're building out the last mile?","And then secondly, on the brick-and-mortar stores, any learnings, and strategically, just talk to the strategic advantage of having a bigger Amazon storefront. Thanks.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Sure. Let me start with your first question. So as you point out, we've had Amazon Logistics deliveries in the UK for more years than some of our other countries and what we see is it gives us control of the shipment for a lot longer. We can, again, shift order cutoff times out and time is valuable to us because, again, we can avoid split shipments, we can avoid other costs of acceleration. And so having control later in the process is very valuable to us especially as we're working across multiple nodes in a network.","But I've driven with drivers in Downtown London and it's a very interesting experience. I think it's a great value to our customers. It's interesting to see the route density that we see in the high cities \u2013 or, excuse me, in some cities and the challenges and the upside of that. But I would say essentially, in a nutshell, our logistics deliveries allow us to have better control of the end delivery in markets where we use it. The challenge is always going to be cost and as we get better at this and get economies of scale, we lower those costs over time. So that's essentially my overview of Amazon Logistics.","Sorry, your second question was on \u2013 oh, the stores, sorry. Yes, you probably noticed we launched the \u2013 we opened the Amazon Go Store in Seattle in the fourth quarter. We think that is very interesting. It's only one store at this time. But it's using some of the same technologies you would see in self-driving cars; computer vision, sensor, fusion, deep learning. So it's a great accomplishment by that team. It's in beta right now and we like the promise of that.","Probably more advanced and further along are the Amazon Bookstores. We have three physical stores; Seattle, San Diego, and Portland right now. We see adding five more this year. So we're still in that phase where we're testing and learning and getting better, even on the bookstore. I would say there's other things that are physical in nature, the pop-up stores and college pickup points that we learn from as well, and think creates a great value particularly at the college pickup points.","So not much projection beyond where we are today except for the fact that we will be adding more bookstores. But we test, we innovate, we think the bookstores for instance are a really great way for customers to engage with our devices and see them, touch them, play with them and become fans. So we see a lot of value in that as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.","Jason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Two questions. As we think about investment in the first quarter in 2017, any color how to think about domestic versus international. You did give some comments about India, but just any other color or how to think about it?","And then on AWS, you announced both new products that reinvent at the low end and at the high end. Any commentary on if that impacted the types of customers who you've been adding on AWS with those new products. Thank you.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Sure. I can't give an exact split of the investments by geography, but I would say most of the fulfillment expansion was in North America last year. Most of those 26 warehouses we talked about. We see that being more balanced over time and being more global as we move forward. Video content is with the new global program, global Prime Video is becoming more global with the launch in India as well. And, of course, we had Prime Video in some of our existing countries prior to that. So that is going more global and will be more balanced. As we see devices roll out to other countries, same thing.","So I would say over time it will become more balanced and probably what you've seen in the short run tended to be more North America focused. But I can't give you a great split of \u2013 I'm not giving you the absolutes anyway, so I can't give you a great split of the two. And I will also say that we are \u2013 not all of our investments are on the consumer side. AWS continues to expand their global footprint. Last year, we added regions in the UK and Canada. We now have 42 availability zones in 16 geographic regions and we will continue to grow that business globally. And India, again, we've mentioned, but that is, obviously, an international investment.","Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.","On the customer split, we serve \u2013 in AWS, we serve millions of active customers along the spectrum of large enterprise companies as well as small startups and the public company \u2013 or public environment as well. The multitude of launches that we had in reinvent was great for all sizes of customers, really, both large and small; both companies starting \u2013 just getting their start with AWS, but also companies that have been engaged with AWS for many years.","And so we're really happy about the engagement of reinvent and the participation in that conference as well as the engagement of the new services that we've launched in Q4 and all of 2016, really.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two, if I can ask. One, the other North America revenue line in our view has a lot of advertising revenue in it and that line continues to sort of show a lot of momentum, come in better than expected. Can you talk holistically sort of short-term, medium-term, long-term about how you think you're approaching an advertising business across your broad properties, what that might become longer-term and how that might impact the P&L?","And then one housekeeping item, anything to call out as an impact from demonetization efforts in India in either Q4 or Q1? Thanks so much.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Yes, sure. I'll take the advertising question. So yes, it's very early in the advertising space. But what our goals there are to be helpful to customers and enhance their shopping and viewing experiences, mostly with targeted recommendations. We think that is a good strategy rather than invasive things that take away from the shopping experience. I would say Sponsored Products is off to a great start. I find it a very effective way for advertisers to reach interested customers. We also, on video, have not added much in the way of advertising yet. There's some pre-roll as we call it. But for the most part, we like the progression. We are balancing customer experience with advertising at all times and we like the team that's working on it.","Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.","And on other revenue, I just want to call out, there's a number of things going into that particular line. These things include revenue from our co-branded credit card arrangements and certain advertising, particularly display advertising. We have other types of advertising that's spread out throughout the P&L, whether that's a kind of shared marketing investment from our vendors which goes into contra COGS and lowers the cost of sales, or it's related to other seller advertising which is generally within the EGM and media categories. And so I'd say other revenue incorporates a number of things, not just advertising. And on India demonetization, nothing particular to call out today on that.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente with Nomura Instinet. Please proceed with your question.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thanks for taking my questions. It's about Prime Video. You said you were pleased with the hours of engagement. My question is do you think that the hours of video stream need to accelerate from here to get to an adequate return on the invested capital in video? Or are you happy with those returns with the current levels of engagement?","And then relatively on Prime Video, could you just talk about your ambitions to potentially extend the video offering beyond on-demand and into possibly a virtual cable bundle? And then finally, just a question of do you need to aggressively partner with distributors, whether they be cable distributors or hardware device companies in order to get better distribution of the Amazon Prime Instant Video app and content to your customers? Thanks.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Yes, I can't add too much or won't add too much on the last two questions. But I will say on \u2013 you're talking about the levels of engagement now that we're seeing versus what would be the long-term model over time. We're certainly spending ahead of the value of the engagement right now, but it's a good sign that it's building. And an important step was that global Prime program that we launched in the fall \u2013 excuse me, in Q4. As I said, it's very much a fixed expense game, especially with original content. That fixed amount can go up or down, but the ability to amortize it over a large population is what we're looking for.","So, we see a double benefit of the global Prime Video program, again both to amortize the investment in original content but also to show that original content to more and more people, because we think it's done really well. We think it's won a lot of awards and we've worked with some \u2013 again some great, talented people. And it's our ability to scale that and to amortize it over a much larger customer base, which will help us in the future.","Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.","Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions.

After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded.","For opening remarks, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Sean Boyle. Please go ahead sir.","Sean Boyle","Hello and welcome to our Q2 2013 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.","The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 25, 2013 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K.","As you listen to today\u2019s conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.","Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2012.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas J. Szkutak","Thanks Sean. I\u2019ll begin with comments on our second quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 41% to $4.53 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 76% to $265 million. Trailing-12 month capital expenditures were $4.27 billion. This amount includes $1.4 billion in purchases of our previously leased corporate office space, as well as property for development of additional corporate office space located in Seattle, Washington which we purchased in the fourth quarter 2012.","The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth consisting of investments in technology, infrastructure including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.","Return on invested capital was 2%, down from 11%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 474 million shares compared with 468 million shares.","Worldwide revenue grew 22% to $15.7 billion or 25% excluding the $392 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rate. We are grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers.","Media revenue increased to $4.4 billion, up 7% or 11% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $10.42 billion, up 28% or 30% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 66% of worldwide sales, up from 64%.Worldwide paid unit growth was 29%. Active customer accounts exceeded 215 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 40% of paid units.","Now I will discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $11.21 billion, or 71.4% of revenue, compared with 73.9%. Fulfillment, marketing, tech and content and G&A combined was $4.09 billion, or 26% of sales, up approximately 275 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $1.76 billion, or 11.2% of revenue compared with 10.1%. Tech and content was $1.43 billion, or 9.1% of revenue, compared with 7.6%. Marketing was $651 million, or 4.1% of revenue consistent with prior period.","Now, let\u2019s talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments, our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item.","In the North America segment, revenue grew 30% to $9.49 billion. Media revenue grew 16% to $2.17 billion. EGM revenue grew 31% to $6.48 billion, representing 68% of North America revenues, up from 67%. North America segment operating income increased 19% to $409 million, a 4.3% operating margin.","In the international segment, revenue grew 13% to $6.21 billion. Adjusting for the $391 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 20%. Media revenue decreased 1% to $2.22 billion, or grew 7% excluding foreign exchange, and EGM revenue grew 22% to $3.94 billion, or 29% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 63% of international revenues, up from 59%.","International segment operating income was zero, down from $16 million in the prior-year period. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, international segment operating income increased to 11%.","CSOI increased 14% to $409 million, or 2.6% of revenue, down approximately 20 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI increased 19%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense.","GAAP operating income decreased 26% to $79 million, or 0.5% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $13 million. GAAP net loss was $7 million or $0.02 per diluted share compared with net income of $7 million and $0.01 per diluted share.","Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $2.49 billion year-over-year to $7.46 billion. Inventory increased 24% to $5.42 billion and inventory turns were 9.4, down from 10.1 turns a year-ago as we expanded selection, improved in stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 27% to $8.99 billion and accounts payable days increased to 73 from 68 in the prior-year.","I\u2019ll conclude my portion of today\u2019s call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we\u2019ve seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high-level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It\u2019s not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we\u2019ve described in more detail in our public filings issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies among such subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance.","Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently.","For Q3, 2013 we expect net sales of between $15.45 billion and $17.15 billion, a growth between 12% and 24%. This guidance anticipates approximately 300 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating loss to be between $440 million and $65 million compared to $28 million in the third quarter of 2012. This includes approximately $340 million of stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.","We anticipate consolidated segment operating income or loss, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $100 million loss and $275 million in income compared to $232 million of income in third quarter 2012. We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection, and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.","Thanks. And with that, Sean, let\u2019s move to questions.","Sean Boyle","Great. Thanks Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Ross Sandler from Deutsche Bank.","Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank","Thanks, guys. Just have one question on shipping. It looks like the unit efficiency in shipping continues to improve, what are you guys doing to drive the cost of shipping each unit lower? Are there more cost that can be taken out on a per unit basis? And then as you start looking at same day delivery in some of these markets, including the new grocery program, what incremental costs do you see around doing same day fulfillment? Thanks.","Thomas J. Szkutak","In terms of the economics, we have great team, operations team that\u2019s working on how do we serve customers reliably and faster. So that \u2013 certainly that\u2019s reflected in our transportation costs. Also from a productivity standpoint, we just as we add capacity, which is getting closer and closer to customers with larger selection which is certainly helpful from a productivity standpoint. So, those are some of the dynamics that you need to think about, when you think about our transportation cost and the teams done a great job over the years of becoming even more reliable, faster, and more productive and again that we working on ways to make that it better over time.","Operator","And we\u2019ll move to Douglas Anmuth from JPMorgan.","Douglas Anmuth - JPMorgan","Great. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping if you could talk a little bit more just on the profitability of the grocery business and how you\u2019ll know when is the right time to expand to more markets beyond Seattle and LA? And then also if you could comment on the European macro environment, just given the growth that you saw in the international business just decelerating a little bit from last quarter? Thanks.","Thomas J. Szkutak","In terms of the, the fresh business, we started doing the pilot several years ago in Seattle. We did a number of \u2013 team has done a great job, inventing on behalf of customers, it\u2019s a very good customer experience. The challenging that we\u2019ve had over the past several years is to how to make it economically viable. And so that\u2019s the team has done a lot of different experiments and invented well on behalf of customers that to see what works. And we took a lot of that knowledge and which enabled us to launch fresh in LA. And it\u2019s very early there, we\u2019re still in the trial period, its good customer experience and we like what we see so far, but it\u2019s very, very early. And so, it\u2019s something that we\u2019ll continue to work on and both from a customer experience and from an economic standpoint. And there is not much more I can add to that right now, so you have to stay tuned and see where that ends up.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Miller from William Blair.","Mark Miller - William Blair & Company","Hi. Good afternoon. Could you help us understand the third-party unit growth? I think this is the first quarter in about three years that third-party unit penetration hasn\u2019t increased. And then, additionally I wonder if you could comment at all on potential to expand prime membership options, potentially it is something like a super prime offering for expanded video content and fulfillment options?","Thomas J. Szkutak","In terms of the third-party unit growth, it was 40% this quarter, which compares to 40% last year in Q2. So again, it is flat as a percentage of total units. One thing we keep in mind though is our digital units are growing at a faster rate than physical. And those digital units are primarily first party units. So if you take out digital units out in both periods, we\u2019re actually up approximately 300 basis points. So, physical seller business is growing very nicely. It\u2019s going at a faster rate than retail and its doing very well and so, very pleased to see that.","Operator","And we\u2019ll move now to Brian Pitz from Jefferies.","Brian Pitz - Jefferies & Company","Great. Thanks. Quick question on fulfillment centers, any color on your current plan for the year in terms of locations, U.S. versus international, timing etcetera. And then separately any comments on the weaker growth in international media? Thanks.","Thomas J. Szkutak","In terms of FCs we\u2019ve announced to-date five net new facilities in the U.S. We\u2019ve also announced some in international, its still early as we did in prior \u2013 last few years, we gave you updates kind of as we went along and so we can update you a little bit later in the year to see how that progresses. But we certainly are adding new capacity and that\u2019s reflected in the guidance which you see in Q3 as we get ready for our Q4 seasonal quarter. In terms of growth, in international media, what you\u2019re seeing there is on a local currency growth basis, you see a 7% growth. That\u2019s consistent with what you\u2019ve seen in the last couple of quarters. We are at the very early stages, we\u2019re excited about what we\u2019re seeing so far in digital. But we\u2019re in that early stage of transformation from digital from physical to digital within international. And so, you see from the release that we\u2019ve launched a lot of new things related to digital over the past 90 days and even prior to that. So, we\u2019re very excited about those launches and excited about the transformation. We are also excited, if you look at our total international business, we\u2019ve got a lot of opportunities to invest in. I talked about the conversion from physical to digital. We also have selection still to add within existing categories, new categories, new geographies, so we\u2019re very excited about the opportunity that we\u2019ve there.","Brian Pitz - Jefferies & Company","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll now go to Scott Devitt from Morgan Stanley.","Scott Devitt - Morgan Stanley","Hi. Thanks. I guess, the International topic again, but it has been asked a few times. So maybe specifically in China, Tom, in terms of what the Company hypothesis is in terms of the way that market plays out over time and how you think about investment spend in that market. And then secondly, as it relates to AWS, it\u2019s nice, the event \u2013 the annual event and the quarterly events that happened, I was wondering when you think it makes sense to start talking more about it in releases and on calls? Is it just the 10% revenue threshold or something else that would lead to more discussions on that, on calls like this? Thanks.","Thomas J. Szkutak","In terms of China, we\u2019re investing heavily in China. And we have \u2013 we\u2019ve been for some number of years. We\u2019ve a good customer experience there. We continue to look at ways to make that even better. We\u2019re adding selection across many categories right now. It\u2019s a very interesting geography. And so, we will continue to work on that experience for customers. You should expect us to be in investment mode for some time and, but it\u2019s a very sizable segment, very interesting long-term growth opportunity and we\u2019ll continue to work on making that better for customers and for investors over time.","In terms of AWS, the business is growing very, very strongly. We\u2019ve got a great team that\u2019s innovating on behalf of customers, launching the services, becoming more productive, which allows us to be able to lower prices. We\u2019ve had many price reductions since we started with AWS and we share that very visibly and so we\u2019re excited about that business. And even though we were off to a very good start, it\u2019s a very big opportunity and we continue to invest in that business and we\u2019re very excited to do it. We think its great long-term opportunity and we\u2019ve great team working on it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from RBC.","Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets","Great. Thanks. Tom just one question related to consumer packaged goods. Any comments there on whether you\u2019re seeing broader purchases by the Amazon customers of more traditional consumer staples than you've seen in the past and is that something that you\u2019re trying to promote? Thank you.","Thomas J. Szkutak","Yes. We \u2013 just to make sure I heard your question, we\u2019re seeing \u2013 when you look at our for example, our North America growth, particularly EGM, we\u2019re seeing very good growth across many different categories. But if you call out, we\u2019re seeing very good growth in apparel specifically, and also consumables. And so, the teams has done a very nice job, both teams done a very nice job from a customer experience standpoint and they\u2019re growing very nicely and that is something that we\u2019re seeing, and it does help with frequency to the site as well.","Operator","And we\u2019ll now go to Mark May from Citi.","Mark May - Citi","Thanks for taking my question. Another one on international in the media segment there, I believe that you now have a more comprehensive, kind of localized international strategy for the Kindle. And I wonder if you could talk about what, if any, impact that you think that that might have over the next few quarters in terms of its impact on the international media segment? And also on international, the AWS, I think one of the contributors of growth and we suspect margins in the U.S. has been the success of AWS here. I wonder if you could talk about any plans for AWS outside the U.S.","Thomas J. Szkutak","Sure. In terms of Kindle, you\u2019re right. We now have Kindle stores, if you will, established in all the Amazon domains that we\u2019ve around the world. And recently we announced Kindle Fire HD, its available customers in over 170 countries. We introduced Kindle Paperwhite and Kindle Fire HD in China, both -- that\u2019s both online on our website and also in a number of offline retail locations. So again, there is a lot of advancement in terms of the Kindle, but again, it\u2019s very early. Very encouraged by the opportunity that we have there for customers and our ability to try to capitalize on that from a digital content standpoint. In terms of AWS, the business is expanding, and its incredible opportunity globally. We recognize that, the team recognizes that. And we\u2019ll continue to work on that on behalf of customers.","Operator","Our next question comes from Justin Post from Merrill Lynch.","Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch","Thank you. The Company and the business is going through a lot of transitions with digital media, AWS, obviously Prime and potentially same-day delivery. Long time ago, you used to give us kind of a margin outlook for the Company. As you these businesses, do you think that they\u2019re better for Amazon and that you can have greater share of retail as these evolutions happen. And then also, what are the implications on Amazon\u2019s long-term margins as you go through these transitions over time? Any help on that could help. Thanks.","Thomas J. Szkutak","Sure, in terms of the way we\u2019re looking at I\u2019m certainly it is based on the free cash flow potential, and we have a -- we\u2019re in some really interesting great businesses that have a lot of potential from a free cash flow generation standpoint with good and high ROICs which is exciting. From a margin standpoint always challenging to predict where that will come out in terms of absolute numbers. But what we will do is, we want to make sure that we try to maximize free cash flow, that\u2019s something that we\u2019ve always said. So, our strategy hasn\u2019t changed, our outlook hasn\u2019t changed in that regard. Frequently we\u2019d be asked historically is, double-digit operating margins are possible. And I still think it's possible, but also if it means if a good high single-digit operating margin gets us to better, higher free cash flow over time, that\u2019s fine too. So, again our goal is to, we don\u2019t focus on individual margins. Our goal is to make sure that we generate free cash flow, large monthly free cash flow and use that capital efficiently, and so those are goals that we have and we certainly think that opportunity is there in each of the business that we operate in.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ben Schachter from Macquarie.","Benjamin Schachter - Macquarie Securities Group","Two quick questions on revenue recognition, over the past some quarters I believe that the certain digital media at least has moved around between the agency and wholesale model. Can you help us quantify how this has actually impacted the reported media revenue rates in other words would 2Q revenue rates have been meaningfully different if the model had been the same. And then the second question, just quickly on Prime, can you remind us how you recognized revenue from the Prime memberships deal over the course of the year? Thanks.","Thomas J. Szkutak","Sure. In terms of the Prime we recognized it over the life of the subscription. And then in terms of third party versus first party certainly we have had some shift within digital media, but again digital media is primarily a first party business, and it happens to be one portion of our business. But you\u2019re actually right, and in terms of our third party business which from a unit perspective is 40% of our total units this quarter. We recognized the share of that revenue, the rev share if you will ad revenue where as the other parts of the business largely were recognized in that as first party revenue, and so we\u2019re recognized in the full amount of the revenue in the current period.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jordan Rohan from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Jordan Rohan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company","Thank you so much. I\u2019m curious about your expansion efforts in Spain since it's a relatively new territory for you, how well situated you are and how ready you are for the fourth quarter there. And also, there have been a lot of stories about Amazon heading into Brazil, but I don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve identified any fulfillment centers and things like that. Can you discuss the extent and breadth of your offering in Brazil whether it's Kindle devices, digital media or something beyond that? Thank you.","Thomas J. Szkutak","In terms of Spain, we\u2019re very excited about what we see. It's growing very fast. We\u2019re in investment mode and it's an exciting geography for us, and we\u2019re very optimistic over time it will be a great geography for us. So we\u2019re very happy to serve customers in Spain and we\u2019re continuing to -- as we\u2019ve done in other geographies that we\u2019ll continue to serve customers and continue to expand our selection and get service levels even better over time and so I\u2019m excited about that. In terms of Brazil, we do have a Kindle store and we have devices at physical retailers. So, from a Kindle perspective that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing in Brazil.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ron Josey from JMP Securities.","Ronald Josey - JMP Securities","Great, thank you for taking my question. I\u2019m wondering if you can talk a little bit about North America EGM. Just given the strength you saw on the business and continued reacceleration, have you seen any sort of impact I\u2019m assuming no, but from price matching programs from offline retailers, and we\u2019ll talk -- and also sale tax. Thank you.","Thomas J. Szkutak","In terms of North America, total growth we saw an acceleration from last quarter from 26% to 30%. We saw an acceleration in both North American Media as well as North America EGM. Within EGM it was very broad. In terms of growth we saw a very strong growth across many different categories and so very pleased with that, I called out a couple, that were notable in terms of apparel as well as in consumables, certainly those are getting larger and still growing very fast which I call those out. In terms of competitiveness, it's been, it's very competitive, it is today, it has been since our inception. We have many different competitors online. We have many competitors offline. As you go to your home or office you pass our competitors every day. That\u2019s an environment where we\u2019re used to dealing in. It\u2019s something that\u2019s not new. It's something that we see in all of our geographies across many different categories.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of comes from Heath Terry from Goldman Sachs.","Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs","Great, thank you Tom. As you get closer to customers with more FCs and more efficient shipping, what kind of impact is that having on conversion rates, on within customers in those areas as shipping time shorten or delivery time shorten. And then as you look at the early adopters for Fresh in LA any sense that you can share with us of what kind of cross shopping you\u2019re seeing among new Fresh customers, are they bundling media in EGM in those other orders or to any degree are these new Amazon \u2013 new to Amazon customers that have been brought in purely because of Fresh?","Thomas J. Szkutak","If you take a look at LA, it's just again I\u2019m very excited and it's very early. So, I think on that one you\u2019ll just have to stay tuned. But in terms of, as we get closer and closer to customers with fulfillment, we have seen growth due to that and it\u2019s manifested its way \u2013 in a few different ways, but notably you\u2019ll see it in Prime. Because of our fulfillment logistics capability we\u2019ve been able to offer Prime broadly and we just have selection, it's just closer and closer to customers. And if you look back over the last several years, there\u2019s been different reasons why we\u2019ve grown away, we have grown in terms of adding the selection and making sure that we have really sharp pricing and, but certainly Prime and which includes a speedy delivery certainly been notable, has had a notable impact. And we\u2019re very pleased with the Prime program, customers like it. We\u2019re having -- we see very strong growth in Prime subscribers. We see very good retention of Prime members. So, it's a great program for us and certainly again delivery speed is certainly impacting that program, our overall growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from Anthony Diclemente from Barclays.","Anthony Diclemente \u2013 Barclays Capital ","Thank you. On the topic of media just wondering Tom if there are any callouts in terms of categories of strength or weakness within physical or digital media that you could call out, and along those lines just wondering if you could comment on your media device rollout strategy from here I there\u2019s anything you can tell us. And then quickly, is there any reason PrimeInstant Video isn\u2019t available for Android devices? Thank you.","Thomas J. Szkutak","In terms of media growth not a lot of callouts except probably the obvious is digital units growing very fast relative to physical units and we\u2019re excited to see that. And because of where we are, we\u2019re further penetrated in North America, you\u2019re seeing a bigger impact in our growth rate than you are in international and we certainly see that but not a lot of other callouts there, but again we\u2019re very pleased and certainly customers are responding to many things including selection and great prices and everything else within those digital offerings, but also they\u2019re responding to unique selection that we have. And if you take a look at our release you\u2019ll see the specific numbers related to some of the exclusions we have, and certainly that\u2019s having an impact. So there\u2019s many, many different things that are working for us in that space as part of our overall ecosystem for digital that we\u2019re pleased with. In terms of our device plan, we\u2019re very pleased with the devices we have and to offer customers we think we have a great offering both in terms of Kindle and Kindle Fire. And in terms of our future roadmap, we\u2019ve a long standing practice of not talking about what that will be prior to announcement.","Operator","Our next question comes from Youssef Squali from Cantor Fitzgerald.","Youssef Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald","Thank you very much, two quick questions please. Tech and contents was up to 9% of revenues, I think that\u2019s the highest it's ever been. How much of that is actually streaming content related and how do we look at it going forward, does it stay at that elevated level? And then on Fresh, is that business profitable for you in the Seattle area? Thanks.","Thomas J. Szkutak","In terms of tech and content we\u2019re spending in a number of different areas, but there\u2019s a few that I\u2019d like to highlight. One is certainly keep in mind that the infrastructure related to our very fast growing web services business is included in tech and content, so certainly as we ramp up that business and it's becoming more sizable and growing very fast you\u2019re seeing that impacting that line item. We\u2019re also investing very heavily in digital and that\u2019s across many different parts of our digital offerings there, that\u2019s also included. Any of the tech teams they\u2019re working on customer experience across Amazon as we grow so as we support both our seller businesses and our retail businesses, they\u2019re included in that line item. So, certainly that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing there. In terms of Fresh we\u2019re not breaking out the financials but keep in mind that Fresh was designed as a pilot and certainly the economics that improved over time through invention on behalf of the team there as well as operating efficiency. So, again that was set up as a test and which has enabled us to launch LA.","Operator","We will now go to Colin Sebastian from Robert Baird.","Colin Sebastian - Robert W. Baird","Thanks very much. I guess a quick follow up on the device strategy and given the fairly quick pace of innovation in the tablet market overall. I wonder if you can contrast the benefits of that for Amazon given the popularity of shopping in media apps with the cost and complexity of maintaining your own line of hardware, and related to this it seems as if the pace of new content acquisition on licensing has picked up a bit and so I wonder if that reflects any changes in either the competitive dynamics or pricing or is some sort of other strategy shift on your part? Thanks.","Thomas J. Szkutak","In terms of some of the dynamics, we\u2019re very excited about our digital business. We\u2019re inventing, you\u2019ll see a lot of different inventions both on the hardware side as well as on the software side from a device standpoint. You\u2019ll also see a lot of invention around the content side and we think for example PrimeInstant Video which combines video in our Prime membership is very compelling, and we\u2019re investing heavily in content. It's still very early there but we\u2019re finding that customer\u2019s certainly existing Prime members are more and more streaming content. We\u2019re having new Prime members come to Amazon largely because of video in terms of one segment of that population that\u2019s coming, the new Prime members is because of PrimeInstant Video and we can see that based on the free trials and the conversion of those free trials from related to PrimeInstant Video and so that\u2019s certainly one portion of our growth in Prime memberships which we find exciting. For us to be able to offer exclusive content on the book side is very interesting. So, again we\u2019re investing a lot of different -- across a lot of different areas and yes there are a lot of different dynamics, but we think we\u2019re well suited for both the device software and content side of those businesses.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Nemer from Wells Fargo Securities.","Matthew Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities","Good afternoon, just two questions. One, given your comments that international will be in investment mode for some time. Can you just remind us what the priorities are there from either a geography or a product standpoint. And then secondly following the management changes at Quidsi, I would love an update on the plans for that business and maybe just a sense for how integrated it is to Amazon Retail? Thanks.","Thomas J. Szkutak","Yeah, in terms of the international piece what I was referring to was an investment move, sometime I was referring to China specifically and we have a lot of opportunity to grow. We\u2019re still continuing to invest in international, but I would -- my comment was specifically around China. And then your question around Quidsi?","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to Steven Ju from Credit Suisse.","Steven Ju - Credit Suisse","Tom, is there \u2026","Thomas J. Szkutak","Hello, just to follow-up I think on the Quidsi question I think was around the founders leaving and we\u2019re well positioned with them leaving, and this is the last part of that. But we did -- we\u2019re fortunate to have the founders with us for a number of years, and they did a great job while they were here. And we have a great team at Quidsi, and we\u2019re pleased with that business and the team -- our retail team works very closely with Quidsi business and we\u2019re excited to have it as part of the Amazon team.","Steven Ju - Credit Suisse","Tom, is there anything you can share in terms of the situation in Germany with the worker strike\u2019s, are you able to fulfill from an unaffected fulfillment centers or is it causing some invents to your operations there? And also if you could update us on what you\u2019ve been doing with Kiva since you\u2019ve acquired it. Are you focusing on internal integration, are you selling more aggressively through external clients? Thanks.","Thomas J. Szkutak","In terms of Germany there\u2019s a not a lot I can add to there. We\u2019re certainly serving customers, those results are reflected in our overall total results that you see today for Q2 as well as our international results. In terms of Kiva we certainly -- we gave a great team there, we love the technology. We don\u2019t have any announcements in terms of rollouts, but we\u2019re ahead of schedule from what we had set out at the time of purchase which we\u2019re happy about. So, I\u2019ll have to stay tuned on the actual rollout, but we\u2019re very encouraged by what we see there.","Operator","And our final question comes from Ken Sena from Evercore Partners.","Ken Sena - Evercore Partners","Hi, thank you.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q1 2016 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded.","For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Phil Hardin. Please go ahead.","Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations","Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2016 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 28, 2016 only and will include forward-looking statement. Actual results may differ materially.","Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial result is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.","During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2015.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Brian.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our first quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 44% to $11.3 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $6.4 billion, up from $3.2 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow less lease principal repayment increased to $3.5 billion, up from $1.5 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow less finance lease principal repayment and assets acquired under capital leases increased to $1.6 billion, up from an outflow of $1.2 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.9 billion.","Capital expenditures do not include the impact of property and equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligation. These capital expenditures and capital leases reflect additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investment in technology infrastructure, the majority of which is to support AWS, and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. A combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 490 million shares, compared with 483 million one year ago.","Worldwide revenue increased 28% to $29.1 billion or 29% excluding the $210 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Worldwide active customer accounts, excluding customers who only had preorders in the preceding 12-month period, exceeded $285 million. Worldwide paid unit growth was 27%. Worldwide seller units represented 48% of paid units.","Now, I'll talk about our segment results. In the first quarter of 2016, we began to allocate stock-based compensation and other operating expense net to our segment results. These amounts are combined and titled stock-based compensation and other in our segment results and reflect the way we now evaluate our business performance and manage our operations. For reference, this quarter, I'll also mention segment operating income excluding stock-based compensation and other.","In the North America segment, revenue grew 27% to $17 billion. Media revenue grew 8% to $3.2 billion. EGM revenue grew 32% to $13.5 billion. North America segment operating income, including stock-based compensation and other, was $588 million, a 3.5% operating margin compared with $254 million in the prior year. This includes $5 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. North America segment operating income before stock-based compensation and other was $924 million, a 5.4% operating margin compared with $517 million in the prior year.","In the International segment, revenue grew 24% to $9.6 billion. Excluding the $177 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 26%. Media revenue increased 7% to $2.5 billion or 9% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 31% to $7 billion or 33% excluding foreign exchange. International segment operating loss, including stock-based compensation and other, was $121 million, compared with a loss of $194 million in the prior year. This includes $21 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. International segment operating income before stock-based compensation and other was $20 million, compared with a loss of $76 million in the prior year.","In the Amazon Web Services segment, revenue grew 64% to $2.6 billion. Amazon Web Services segment operating income, including stock-based compensation and other, was $604 million, a 23.5% operating margin compared with $195 million in the prior year. This includes $24 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Amazon Web Services segment operating income before stock-based compensation and other was $716 million, a 27.9% operating margin compared with $265 million in the prior year. Our operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. Operating income was $1.1 billion or 3.7% of revenue, up approximately 260 basis points year-over-year. This includes $50 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange.","Consolidated segment operating income before stock-based compensation and other was $1.7 billion or 5.7% of revenue, compared to $706 million in the prior year. Our income tax expense was $475 million. Net income was $513 million or $1.07 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $57 million or a loss of $0.12 per diluted share.","Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $2.1 billion year-over-year to $15.9 billion. Inventory increased 30% to $9.6 billion and inventory turns were 8.6, down from 8.8 turns a year ago as we expand selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 26% to $15 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 72 from 70 in the prior year.","I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.","As we describe in more detail on our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rate can all have a material effect on our results. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisition, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.","For Q2 2016, we expect net sales of between $28 billion and $30.5 billion, or growth of between 21% and 32%. This guidance anticipates approximately 70 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. Operating income to be between $375 million and $975 million compared with $464 million in the second quarter of 2015. This includes approximately $825 million for stock-based compensation and other operating expense net. We are grateful to our customers and remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.","Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move on to questions.","Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations","Great. Thanks, Brian. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. Thank you. Our first question is from Mark May of Citi. Please state your question.","Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks a lot. Lots here, but international retail revenue \u2013 the international retail segment really stood out. Revenue accelerated. Seemed like a bit of a milestone also that the CSOI turned positive in a non-Q4 quarter. Can you shed any more light in what the key driver there was and how sustainable it is? And AWS, just mathematically, the comps get tougher starting in Q2, just given what happened in 2014. Is that something that we should be taking into account in terms of thinking about how the rest of the year may progress? Thanks.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Your first question on international, yes, all three segments had very strong growth in the quarter. International's 26% FX-neutral growth rate was actually the strongest we've seen in three and a half years. I would attribute it to the Prime flywheel. As we may have mentioned in the past, we feel that Europe and large countries in Europe and Japan are a few years behind the U.S. on a lot of the key Prime metrics, but we also said last year that Prime subscriptions were up 51% year-over-year in 2015, 47% in the U.S. and a higher rate than that internationally. So certainly, a lot going on in international, a lot that's really good, adding Prime subscribers at a high clip, continuing to add selection at FBA sellers. So you'll see devices, you see video content. So it's the whole array of Prime offering, Prime Now, Same-Day. Everything is in Europe. It may be getting there a little slower than the starting point in the U.S. but we see it really showing up in customer engagement and customer purchases.","On the AWS side, I think the 2016 to 2015 comparison probably stands on its own and 2014 falls by the wayside, so I would encourage you to look at recent trends. We don't forecast obviously by segment.","Operator","Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth, JPMorgan. Please state your question.","Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask you about unit growth overall and if we look back over the last three quarters, you've accelerated it now to a materially higher level than what we saw in 2014 and the first half of 2015, and I realize in 3Q last year you had Prime Day. But I just was hoping you could comment on the overall acceleration we've seen here and key drivers behind that? And if there's something different perhaps than what you talked about on international? And then just also on AWS and can you just talk about the underlying drivers here of margins and thinking about that a little bit going forward primary sources of leverage? And as you open up six new regions in coming months, should we expect this to be constant build-out or something that's more lumpy over time and more in waves? Thanks.","Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations","This is Phil Hardin. I'll take the units question. So really the units are driven by very similar trends to what Brian described. I think when we look at the bridges for revenue, and obviously units are a key driver of revenue, things like Prime are key in that bridge. I would also call out selection growth, that's been a big area of focus for us. And one important way we drive selection is through FBA, and so we continue to be very pleased with the progress we're making in FBA. What that means for our Prime customers is there's more for them to choose from, obviously that gives them more they can purchase, it makes Prime more valuable. For sellers, it means they sell more. And so I would say that FBA is helping drive some of the selection growth we're seeing here, so selection growth and Prime though are two very key drivers of our growth.","On the second part, I think that, Brian...","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, one other comment I didn't say earlier, I do want to point out that because of the leap year there's an extra day in Q1. Every company would have seen this obviously, but we estimated it was worth about 150 basis points to our growth rate revenue. That would be consistent with North America and international. Your other comment was on \u2013 or question was on AWS and a bit about margins and margin outlook. We're very pleased with the quarter, we came in at 23.5% operating margin on a \u2013 the new basis including stock-based compensation and other. We're very pleased. But stepping back with the 64% growth in AWS which is now a $10 billion business, but on the margin side, I would caution you that we're pleased but it is very early to start drawing too many conclusions on the long-term margins in this business, they'll be bumpy over time. At any point in time they're going to reflect the balance of investing including global expansion that he's talked about, price reductions we may offer, and also driving cost efficiency, which for us is a very important driver in not only this business but also the North America and international segments.","Operator","Our next question is from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please state your question.","Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks. Looking at the active customer account number, it looks like growth slowed pretty significantly, about 10 percentage points. Just curious if you can give us a sense of anything that might be throwing that number off, assuming we're reading it the right way? And then, as you roll out on AWS \u2013 as you roll out the fixed new Availability Zones over the course of this year, is there a way to quantify what kind of an impact that's going to have on the capacity at AWS?","Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations","So I'll take the first part of your question about active customers. So as we look at our metrics and what information we provide each year, we often make some changes. So this quarter, we only gave the active customers with a paid purchase in the trailing 12 months, and so that number was more than $285 million. I think that's pretty similar to the trends that we've seen in that metric.","Now in the past, sometimes we had also given a total active customers count, and so that number for this quarter was over $310 million. So that may be where you're making the statement about the slowdown in growth, but the trajectory was very similar from prior quarters for both of those numbers. But we opted just to give the other one, but you now have the number for the total number of customers.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","And on your AWS footprint question, so we ended the quarter with 33 Availability Zones in 12 geographic regions, and we have five \u2013 11 more Availability Zones opening in the next year. The impact on capital, yes, there will be additional capital investment as we built out those zones. Some of it has already taken place. But I will also say that by and large, the largest increases in capital leases is to support the growth of incremental usage of customers we have now and agreements we have now. So \u2013 and you should expect to see us continue to invest and support this business. We're very, very \u2013 we have a leadership position, we intend to maintain it and we're very excited about where we are.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question.","Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Two, please. The first one is on Prime. You've two straight years of around 50% Prime subscriber growth. Just curious about how you think about keys to driving Prime sub-growth going forward and the thought process behind the reported monthly Prime subscription?","And the second one on logistics investments, so there's been a lot about truck investments and logistics investments. Any comments at all about learnings and what you're seeing from some of the investments in your truck fleet and your own delivery network? Thanks.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, let me start with the Prime. Yes, we have had very strong growth the last two years and earlier, obviously on Prime growth of members. I would say it's a culmination of a lot of separate investments that we're making. So if you look at the success of our devices, we are seeing tablets where we sold twice the volume in Q1 year-over-year. Fire TV Stick, you may have read in our press release that it has greater than 100,000 customer reviews, the most reviewed product ever, 62,000 or over 62,000 of those reviews are five-star reviews. We've not only had the Echo, but we have the Echo Dot and Tab, so we're branching off that product line and having trouble keeping those in stock.","And of course we launched the new Kindle Oasis e-reader. So that is an important part of the story. As it is with digital content, you may have seen the recent announcements that we're working on a great amount of new content for Prime members. We love the \u2013 customers love the content and we like the results we see, particularly around Prime free trial conversion and renewal rates for subscribers who use and take advantage of Prime.","So beyond the awards that the content is winning and the success we're having with Amazon, particularly our Amazon Originals, we feel that program is working. We're going to significantly increase our spend in that area. Some of that is in Q2, you'll see that more in the next few quarters. But we think that's working and look forward to bringing a lot of new content to our Prime subscriber base, both through our normal Prime subscription and also the monthly plan that you alluded to.","Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations","This is Phil Hardin and I'll jump in on the second part of your question. So for the trucks, it \u2013 really it's trailers. The typical use case is running a lag between a fulfillment center and a sort center. So we're running enough volume there that we're using trucks already. We thought it made sense to go ahead and buy some trailers, we're actually still contracting out for the truck part. And it gives us flexibility, we think the economics will make sense over time.","Similarly, we've announced an agreement to lease some airplanes with Air Transport Services Group, an agreement to lease up to 20 Boeing 767s there, and similar use case, it's products that are already boxed. And we think again, this is activities we've been doing already which need to grow at a very rapid rate. This gives us extra capacity and we think it's good to be able to deliver to customers, and we think it makes sense over the long-term.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Please state your question.","Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Two questions related to Prime overseas. Could you talk about the status of Prime in international markets? How far rolled out it is in most of your major markets? And then, you talk about Prime flywheels, and you did last year. But it seems likes those flywheels spun faster than you expected in the fourth quarter of last year that caused some near-term expense issues for you? Can you talk about how you're thinking about planning against that as the Prime flywheels are getting broader for you, how do you try to get ahead of that into the peak season later this year? Thank you.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, sure. Let me \u2013 this is Brian. Let me start with the second question first. It wasn't necessarily the Prime flywheel that was the issue, it was more the FBA demand that we had from FBA sellers for space in our warehouses. We were very full. It was a high-class problem to have. But it \u2013 as I mentioned last quarter, it did result in higher fulfillment costs in the fourth quarter as a result, and I think you'll see some of that dissipated now in Q1, so you could tell it was a Q4 issue. We learn from every Q4, this one was no exception. We are already making plans for a smoother Q4 next year. We will continue to add fulfillment capacity, we will work with FBA sellers on inventory stocking and timing and we think that there's things that we can do better as we do every year, come out of fourth quarter with immense learnings.","Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations","This is Phil. On the Prime question, we launched Prime in the U.S. in 2005, followed that in 2007 with U.K., Germany, Japan, and then other countries after. We have Prime in all of the countries where we have Marketplaces with the exception of Mexico, China and India. And Prime is really in varying stages in those countries. We have some kind of an expedited shipping offer in all of them. Here in the U.S., we've been talking quite a bit about Prime Now, that's also in Italy and Japan and the U.K. at this point and not others, also varying levels of digital benefits as well.","So, generally, the international countries are not as far along with selection or the fullness of the digital offers. We've got Prime Video in the U.K., in Germany and Japan. Music is not fully rolled out yet to all of the others there. So that's where we are with Prime.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein. Please state your question.","Carlos Kirjner-Neto - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. I have two. I think it's the first time since 1Q 2011 that we see tech and content as a percentage of revenue declining or flat. Is this just a sign of your inability to increase investment in line with revenue growth? Or is there something else going on and if yes, what?","And secondly, Brian, you said that the growth of Prime has been driven by investments you have made and are making. And you gave the examples of devices that you guys are selling. I think it's a mathematical certainty that Prime subscribers will decelerate in North America at some point from 50% growth. As penetration increases and growth slows, will we see a deceleration in the investment levels? And in other words, how do we think about the effect of deceleration in Prime on the North American margin structure in the future? Thank you.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Let me start with that second one. So we think there's a lot of room to grow in not only our international countries, but also in the U.S. So we plan on continuing to build the benefits of the Prime program from music to video, to two-day shipping, to same-day shipping, to Prime Now. So I don't see that dissipating. And again, it remains the best deal in retail. So hopefully everyone signs up for that.","On the tech and content question, I don't have a lot to call out in the quarter. I would say there's no let-up in the pace of invention here, particularly on the AWS side. We usually quote the number of new features and services to you each quarter, we had 214 in Q1, up from 170 the first quarter of last year. So over 26% growth in this quarter alone coming off a year where I believe the number was 722 significant new features and services delivered for AWS customers last year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Pitz of Jefferies. Please state your question.","Brian J. Pitz - Jefferies LLC","Thanks for the question. Any comments on your business in India? How is that market ramping up? And maybe on the competitive front there, any sense of where the local incumbents may actually have some advantage in the region? Thanks.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, sure. Thanks. Actually, I just returned from India where I spent a week with our teams in Bangalore and Hyderabad. We're breaking ground on a new 10-acre campus there. So we are solidifying and increasing our investment in India on all fronts. I had a chance to see firsthand the level of invention going on with both customers and sellers, making deliveries to customers, seeing the I Have Space program we have with merchants. It's a very exciting time in India and again, the invention is off the charts. We are inventing things in India that do not exist in other parts of the country \u2013 excuse me, parts of the world. And the team there is one of our best.","You can see it in some of the external commentary as well. For the second year in a row customers selected Amazon India as Amazon's most trusted online shopping brand. During the quarter, we rolled out a feature called Tatkal which is a studio on wheels that we go to the sellers to help them sign up. We let them do registration, imaging, catalog, uploads and basic seller training. So we're taking it to the sellers, taking the business to the sellers. We've already reached sellers in 25 cities and we're really helping them expand their business not only within their home region, but throughout the whole country.","Operator","Our next question comes from Justin Post of Merrill Lynch. Please state your question.","Justin Post - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Thanks. My question is on the international margins. They're quite a bit below where they were many years ago and trailing the U.S. Maybe talk about the dynamics there and what is it going to take to catch up over time? Thanks.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure. So, on the op margin side, although there was improvement year-over-year and, yeah, you're right, it is still on FX-neutral basic \u2013 basis negative. We have, as I said earlier, selection expansion, infrastructure investments, fulfillment network and AWS \u2013 excuse me, that's not the international segment \u2013 fulfillment network and digital content. So we continue to build the underpinnings of the Prime program in our international countries. You also have to keep in mind that we're making large investments in India. We're very excited about what we see and we will continue to invest heavily in India.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank. Please state your question.","Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. I just had two questions on AWS. First, last fall at re:Invent, you guys disclosed that data management revenue was at a $1 billion run rate. So can you provide an update on that figure? And maybe just talk about how much of AWS revenue today is outside of the storage and compute layers.","And then the second question is on the AWS margin. So I think everybody is trying to learn more about the structural long-term margin, and it was down a tad quarter-on-quarter. So is that solely from FX impact? Or was there some seasonality of expenses? Any color on what's driving the AWS margin and how we should think about that over the longer term? Thank you.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","I'll take your second question first. So again, we had margin expansion year-over-year that was quite significant, from 12.4% to 23.5%. But again, it's very early in this business. We're very pleased with the results we're seeing on the top and bottom line, but margins are going to be bumpy and affected by levels of investing, price reductions and also cost efficiencies that we're driving. So quarter-to-quarter, it will vary. We are concerned at this point about capital efficiency, returning price to customers periodically with price reductions and adding feature sets for them to make the business more valuable.","Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations","This is Phil. For your other part of your question, we're not providing an update on the $1 billion stat. What I would say is that the AWS team has strong revenue growth across their suite of products. The fastest-growing product in their history is actually Aurora, the new database. So we're very excited about what we're seeing in that space but we're not breaking out the revenue for those various components today.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS Investment Research. Please state your question.","Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the question. Looking at the gross margin, impressive performance in Q1. There were a few headwinds it looked like in gross margin in Q4. Wanted to understand how we should think about the puts and takes in gross margin, it has evolved to be a much higher number over the last couple of years, what some of the puts and takes are going forward especially with respect to content costs? Thanks.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure. So I don't have a forecast for you on content costs in isolation or really forward looks on anything besides the guidance I've given you. But, yes, it hits in the gross margin, content costs do show up there. I think the bigger issues that you should look at in gross margin, and again starting with the comment that we expanded by 300 basis points year-over-year, that is really driven by, first of all, the AWS growth and again, $10 billion business growing 64% is very \u2013 we're very pleased with that and that affects gross margin as well.","The other bigger element though is the third-party contribution. Third-party units are now up to 48% of paid units and that's up 400 basis points year-over-year, so that continues to be a factor in gross margin. Again, we book that on a net basis. The third-party revenue, it's a positive factor in gross margin and can be a negative factor in fulfillment costs and some of the other metrics.","Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations","This is Phil. Also just to jump in. The gross margin is not the primary metric we use to measure the business. We are much more focused on free cash flow dollars and operating profit dollars. So there are a whole lot of moving parts in gross margin, and Brian mentioned a lot of them. But it's not a primary metric for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Aaron Kessler of Raymond James. Please state your question.","Aaron M. Kessler - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great, thanks. Couple of questions. First, if you can just update us on maybe your new advertising initiatives in terms of how the sponsored links are performing? Additionally, if you can just \u2013 maybe just give us an update on Prime Now, it seems like you've rolled out a number of cities for that. How that's evolving and the traction with Prime Now? Thank you.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","So, we're very excited about the advertising business, and we think it's still very early days for this opportunity. So it's an offering we've been working on. We're trying to take a very customer-centric approach. You probably noticed some changes in the treatment on the website. And we did move away from text ads and product ads in favor of some of the other newer products. And we are really excited about the opportunity there is for third-party sellers, and for other vendors on the site. But we are not breaking out numbers today.","Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations","In Prime Now, we are now in 30 metro areas, really from a standing start 16 months ago when we opened our first Prime Now location and it's now a worldwide business in the U.S., U.K., Italy and Japan. So the five cities we added in the first quarter were Raleigh, North Carolina, Cincinnati, Tampa, Liverpool, England, and Osaka, Japan. So, yeah, how do we feel about that business? Again, it offers tens of thousands of daily essential products. We think it's a service that customers like, certainly is hard for companies to do. We think the natural evolution of our operations network and our scale gives us a chance to do this and we are happy to invest in it as a service for our customers. We are taking a long-term approach on this one, though.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse. Please state your question.","Steve D. Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Hi. Thanks. So your capital lease-driven property and equipment acquisitions is down again year-over-year. So, will you help tie this to perhaps the overall usage growth at AWS? Or maybe the changing nature of how your enterprise customers may be using the platform to be more compute versus storage or database-heavy? And I think historically on the e-commerce side, you guys have been price followers as opposed to price leaders. AWS, you have been price leaders for the most part for actively taking down price. So, now, given your leadership position, do you think you'll continue to be price leaders? Or do you think it's now time (35:09)?","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Let me start with your CapEx question. So we like to look at both capital expenditures and capital leases because they are both essentially levels with our level of investment. Those totaled $9.5 billion in the trailing 12 months, and it was up 7% from the 12-month period ending this quarter last year. I will point out that the prior year was $6.1 billion. So we have stepped up investment, although it did not go up as much year-over-year this quarter, we are still spending almost $10 billion on what essentially is fulfillment capacity in support of really strong growth, unit growth and FBA, and global expansion and then also on AWS, additional capacity for existing customers as they grow their business and also new regions.","We've been working and continue to work very hard on capital productivity. It's very important to us, and I attribute a good piece of the ability to keep that at a modest growth rate year-over-year to our capital efficiency, and better purchasing across all capital and capital leases quite frankly. But again, we are spending almost $10 billion. So...","Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations","And, Stephen, this is Phil. Just to jump on the usage growth comment, we continue to see really strong usage growth. We are not in the business of raising prices, we lower prices for AWS, so there can be mix for products, but by and large, if you see our revenue growth, know that we are also lowering prices which means that by math, we are typically going to be growing usage at a very strong rate. So I just wanted to jump on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Blackledge of Cowen & Company. Please state your question.","John Blackledge - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. So the North American EGM segment outperformed our expectations of growth accelerating on a year-over-year basis. Given you don't break out GMV by vertical within the EGM segment and just given the strong growth at massive scale, can you cite any key verticals that were particularly strong?","And second question is just an update on Fresh. Rollout has obviously been much slower than Prime Now. How should we think about the Fresh rollout and the impact over the long-term? Thank you.","Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations","This is Phil. I'll take the EGM question first. So just to put numbers on that, the year-over-year in the U.S. or in North America was 32% growth, which was up from 28% in Q4. And there's not any single categories we're calling out there. To grow on a base that big, that kind of rate, you really need pretty strong performance across the board. So a lot of categories are selling a lot. And it's a lot of the drivers we talked about, as Brian mentioned on the revenue growth side, Prime, selection, growth. And we also benefited from the extra day in the quarter due to the leap year, but strong performance from many of the categories.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yes. And on AmazonFresh, we continue to have a strong Fresh business in a number of cities in the U.S. We know customers love it. We're making good progress on the economics. And you'll also notice that we have other ways for people to buy consumable products. We have Prime Pantry. We have Prime Now. So we're playing with a lot of different models to see what resonates with consumers and it'll guide our investment decisions going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ben Schachter of Macquarie Equities Research. Please state your question.","Benjamin Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","First, congratulations on a great quarter. A couple on Prime and one on China. First, a point of clarification. You answered a previous question by saying that you will significantly increase investment in Prime. Was that in reference specifically to video or should we expect new types of offerings beyond video and music?","And then, secondly on Prime, membership is likely hitting some saturation levels for certain demographics in the U.S.? Do you intend to focus on more lower income households for growth there? And then finally, quickly on China, anything notable to call out there that's been different over the recent past driving results, the free trade zone, et cetera?","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","I'll take the first question on content. Yes. My comment on Prime benefits was essentially one about video content and our investment there, not saying other investments may not go up as well, but that is the one that we are focusing on and that I called out.","On the comment about Prime, I guess what I'll call availability or...","Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations","Saturation.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","...saturation, yeah, I think that's one of the thoughts behind our monthly plan. We want to create flexibility for consumers to try Prime in a low-cost way, if that's how they choose. We've always had our free trial program, but it is a hurdle for many people or there's a hesitancy to put up a full year's payment for a year of Prime. Annual is still going to be a better deal but we know that customers may try it more frequently if it's a monthly plan, and that's what we're looking for. We know that once customers try it, generally, they'll really like it. So we think that will purge (40:38) some other demographic groups as well.","Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations","This is Phil. Another comment on Prime. On your saturation question, keep in mind that even in the U.S., which is our most mature by years of launch, we still grew last year at 47% year-over-year membership growth, and we continue to make the program better and better. I think the monthly offers are great for flexibility, give people a chance to try new ways. And we continue to add content. We continue to add selection. Prime Now is a huge benefit that didn't even exist two years ago. So all these things are making the program better and we're still out trying to meet as many customers as possible. We're obviously very committed to driving Prime and it's important to the company.","Your question on China, probably the biggest thing to point to is more progress and selection on the Amazon global store. So this is our website. This is the offer that allows Chinese customers to shop from the U.S. website, Amazon.com, with prices in RMB and with Chinese-language pages. So it's focused on really items that may be hard to get, and Amazon's really trying to become the trusted source for many of these goods. So really that's a big part of the focus. And if you've been tracking that number over time, we're now up over $10 million, which is good progress on that front.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ron Josey of JMP Securities. Please state your question.","Ron Victor Josey - JMP Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for taking the question. I want to go back to North America but this time just focus on margins. 5.5%, 5.4% margins, I think that's the highest level since maybe 2Q 2010 and resumes the margin expansion we saw really for most of last year. So just hoping we can understand \u2013 help us understand a little bit more what's driving that? I'm sure the more mature Prime flywheel you mentioned that's happening in Europe. But is there anything else that's going on besides Prime flywheel, maybe more efficient shipping or things along those lines? Thanks.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","I'll start. I think you see the growth rate of the segment at 27%. It's showing the success we're having with customers. When we grow at that clip, we can do a lot of good things it. We can \u2013 on the cost side, we run our facilities more efficiently, we can buy better, we can look to in-source some things that we may have paid externally for. So, there's a number of things that we can do that I think will show up on the bottom line. But principally, what we're trying to do now is \u2013 again, make the Prime experiences as strong as possible for consumers.","Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations","This is Phil. The other thing I would add to that is that the margin you see in any quarter is really the output of our rate of investment at some places and drive for efficiencies in others. And we're not really trying to optimize for any particular number in a given quarter. We're just trying to make the best decisions we can to grow long-term free cash flow per share. And so, again, we're juggling the investment in the places where we feel like we have long-term opportunities where we need to invest with making sure we're getting continuously better in all our other processes at the same time.","Operator","Our final question will come from Bob Peck of SunTrust. Please state your question.","Robert S. Peck - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yes. Hi. Thank you. Just two quick ones. Just back to India for a second, I was wondering if you could talk about the regulatory environment there and particularly how it pertains to Amazon Cloudtail. And then number two, on logistics, could you talk about excess capacity in logistics as you build out air, freight, sea, et cetera. And would you ever entertain delivering other companies' items, i.e., like a FedEx or UPS? Thanks.","Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations","This is Phil. I'll take the India question. We're happy to see the recent clarifications and we're happy to operate in any regime. So frankly, the more clarity, the better.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","And then on the logistics question, stepping back, the reason we add logistics capability and transportation capability is so we can serve our customers faster and faster delivery speeds and we've needed to add more of our own capacity to supplement our carriers and our partners. They're still, again, great partners, have been and will continue to be for the future, but we see opportunities where we need to add additional capacity and we're filling those voids.","Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations","Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com First Quarter 2012 Financial Results Teleconference. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Sean Boyle. Please go ahead, sir.","Sean Boyle","Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2012 Financial Results Conference Call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.","The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 26, 2012, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.","During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you'll find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with our comparable GAAP measures.","Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2011. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas J. Szkutak","Thanks, Sean. I'll begin with comments on our first quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 1% to $3.05 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 39% to $1.15 billion. Return on invested capital was 12%, down from 24%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over 5 quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 464 million shares compared with 466 million shares. During the quarter, we repurchased 5.3 million shares of our common stock for $960 million. ","Worldwide revenue grew 34% to $13.18 billion or 34% excluding the $56 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. We're grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers. ","Media revenue increased to $4.71 billion, up 19% or 19% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $7.97 billion, up 43% or 43% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 60% of worldwide sales, up from 57%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 49%. Active customer accounts exceeded 173 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units were 39% of paid units compared to 36% of paid units in the Q1 2011.","Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $10.03 billion or 76.1% of revenue compared with 77.2%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $2.76 billion or 20.9% of sales, up approximately 283 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $1.26 billion or 9.5% of revenue compared with 8.4%. Tech and content was $816 million or 6.5% of revenue compared with 5.3%. Marketing was $468 million or 3.6% of revenue compared with 3.2%.","Now I'll talk about our segment results. And consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation expense or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 36% to $7.43 billion. Media revenue grew 17% to $2.2 billion. EGM revenue grew 44% to $4.77 billion, representing 64% of North America revenues, up from 60%. North America segment operating income increased 20% to $349 million, a 4.7% operating margin. ","In the International segment, revenue grew 31% to $5.76 billion. Adjusted for the $55 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 32%. Media revenue grew 21% to $2.51 billion or 22%, excluding foreign exchange. And EGM revenue grew 40% to $3.2 billion or 42%, excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 56% of International revenues, up from 52%. International segment operating income decreased 72% to $49 million, a 0.9% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, International segment operating income decreased 65%.","CSOI decreased 15% to $398 million or 3% of revenue, down approximately 170 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI decreased 14%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 40% to $192 million or 1.5% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $43 million in Q1, resulting in a 51% rate for the quarter. GAAP net income was $130 million or $0.28 per diluted share compared with $201 million or $0.44 per diluted share.","Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities decreased $1.17 billion year-over-year to $5.71 billion. Inventory increased 47% to $4.25 billion and inventory turns were 10.4, down from 11.6 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 24% to $6.89 billion and accounts payable days decreased to 62 from 66 in the prior year. ","Our Q1 2012 capital expenditures were $386 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including the Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.","I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.","As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance excludes the financial results on the Kiva Systems acquisition, which we expect to close in the second quarter of 2012, and assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.","For Q2 2012, we expect net sales of between $11.9 billion and $13.3 billion or growth of between 20% and 34%. This guidance anticipates approximately 240 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income or loss to be between $260 million loss and $40 million of income or between 229% decline and 80% decline. This includes approximately $260 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate Consolidated Segment Operating Income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between 0 and $300 million or between 100% decline and 22% decline. ","We expect capital expenditures including capitalized software development to be approximately $0.8 billion to $0.9 billion. These anticipated investments are driven primarily by our expectations of continued business growth, consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. ","We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And with that, Sean, let's move to questions.","Sean Boyle","Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Spencer Wang with Credit Suisse.","Spencer Wang - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Tom, just a couple quick questions. One, I was wondering if you could update us on your plans for fulfillment center increases in 2012. And then also on Prime Instant Video, you guys are over 17,000 movies and TV episodes now. Are you guys at a critical mass? Or do you guys expect to continue to invest aggressively there? And one last quick clarification question, the CapEx guidance, was that for the second quarter or the full year?","Thomas J. Szkutak","Sure. I'll take the last one first. The CapEx was for the second quarter. And the first question on fulfillment centers, in terms of announcements so far that are out there, we've announced 13 for 2012. And so certainly, any changes to that, we'd be back to you. But again, we're experiencing very, very strong growth both in terms of retail but also our FBA. We're seeing that in our third-party growth. Our third-party growth increased in Q1 over 60% again this quarter. Again, a big piece of that was certainly FBA is doing very well. So again, we're continuing to invest, and the number is 13.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.","Scott W. Devitt - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Tom, I just had a question around the operating margin dynamics in the North American market versus International. If you look at it year-over-year, I guess, or even sequentially, the International margin is down pretty materially, but you had a significant uptick in the North American margins, so sequentially and just a moderate decline year-over-year. So wondering if you can just clarify what's happening in North America versus the International markets. Is it 3P FBA having a more significant effect in the U.S. versus other markets? And then I had one follow-up question.","Thomas J. Szkutak","In terms of the -- we're investing heavily in both segments. But what you're seeing is, clearly, if you look at over the past couple years, we've launched a few new geographies, Italy and Spain. We're investing in those geographies. As we've talked about in the past, China, we continue to invest there. We think it's growing very fast. We like what we see. We think it's a great long-term opportunity for investing there. So those are some of the dynamics that are impacting International. And so we continue to invest again across both geographies. But those are things that are a little bit different. In terms of third-party growth, we're seeing very strong third-party growth across International, as well as North America, so we're pleased to do that. And we're investing again on behalf of customers and sellers, as well as retail for the capacity that we need to do that.","Scott W. Devitt - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then secondly, on the employee base growth, I don't know if thinking about unit growth is the right way to think about it. But is there a point in time where you think the employee base starts to grow more in line possibly with unit growth? And can you maybe walk through where you're adding most significantly that's driving the headcount growth?","Thomas J. Szkutak","Sure. We are adding a lot of resources across a number of different areas. But certainly if you look at both year-over-year and sequentially, the Q1 numbers that you're looking at, the vast majority of that is in operations and customer service. Again, and those are based on the hirings that we did coming out of Q4. We have a lot of -- we do supplement our workforce with temporaries in Q4. We did hire a number of those coming out of Q4. And those are reflected in the numbers. And to answer your other question, yes, we'll moderate it at some point certainly. But again, we're -- given the growth that we're experiencing right now, we are investing and we're making sure that we have the right resources to do that.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Mark Mahaney with Citi.","Mark S. Mahaney - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Tom, could you just provide a little more color on the gross margin trends? And it also looks within that like shipping for the first time in a while shows a little bit less deleverage than it has in the past. Is there some sort of tipping point you've reached there? And just broadly on gross margins, that real drive-up that you've seen over the last couple of quarters, is that primarily just due to product mix shifts or revenue mix shifts? Is there anything else in there? And then could you also just briefly comment on AmazonSupply.com? Would some of that -- all of the inventory that you've built up for that launch, would was that -- have we seen that in the buildup in inventory and the reduction in turns? Or are we going to see that going forward?","Thomas J. Szkutak","In terms of the -- we're not reporting gross margin specifically. But in terms of -- if you take a look at the relationship between COGS and revenue, certainly, one of the things we're seeing, a number of different factors there, certainly mix of business is one. But another factor is certainly the one I mentioned earlier, which is around third-party growth. We saw very strong unit growth overall this quarter, up from last quarter, so we had sequential growth. Third-party units as a percentage of total units were up approximately 300 basis points over last year. And we saw just great third-party unit growth, so it was up over 60% again in Q1. And so those are factors that are certainly impacting our operating margins, if you will. In terms of supply -- AmazonSupply.com, certainly, we have inventory on hand to support that business. It's certainly something that we're optimistic over the long-term. But in terms of the inventory increase that you've seen, it's very broad over a number of different businesses and categories and geographies. So that's really what's driving it.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I had 2 for you. First, I was wondering if you could talk about just over the last few years if you could give us a sense how much of the third-party increase has been related to agency e-books. And then the second question is in light of the DOJ case, I was wondering if you could walk us through your thoughts about the agency e-book model, as well as whether or not this will mean we should see things move back to wholesale.","Thomas J. Szkutak","Yes. There's not a lot I can help you with there in terms of the questions. We do think that the suit is a big win for Kindle owners. And we look forward to being allowed to lower prices on more Kindle books. It's certainly our unit growth, if you will, in total -- I'm not talking 3P, just in total. Certainly, the paid unit growth has been certainly helped a lot by e-books. It's growing, as you can imagine very, very fast, so it's certainly impacting that growth rate that you've seen over the past few years, which has been great for us and great for customers. So beyond that, there's not a lot I can add to your questions.","Operator","And we'll go next to Ken Sena with Evercore Partners.","Kenneth Sena - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","In your press release, you mentioned the launch of your Amazon Appstore. And can you just share any thoughts on current traction on Android or specifically off Kindle Fire? And what are some of the advantages and disadvantages that you see for Amazon in that area?","Thomas J. Szkutak","It's early, so there's not a lot I can do. We're excited about it. We think it's a very interesting opportunity and happy to do that on behalf of our customers. But stay tuned, and it's early.","Kenneth Sena - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And maybe one more follow-up. If you can just maybe talk about any of the traction you're seeing within Kindle Fire more broadly or any thoughts you have maybe around Kindle smartphone, that'd be great, too.","Thomas J. Szkutak","In terms of the Kindle Fire, we are pleased with the growth that we're seeing and customers are buying a lot of content. And you're seeing that when you look at particularly in North America. When you look at our North American media growth from Q4 to Q1, you're seeing that accelerate. And that's certainly a big part of it. And so we're very pleased with what's happening, and we're going to continue to add more and more content for customers and across all of our digital categories. And we think we have a great value proposition for customers today, and we're going to continue to make that better over time.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Doug Anmuth with JP Morgan.","Douglas Anmuth - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I want to ask 2 things, Tom. If you could first just give us some more color on the outlook around segment operating income in 2Q and just how we should be thinking about the drivers there in terms of the sequential decline. And then secondly, just the North American media business, you saw good reacceleration from 4Q to 1Q. Can you talk about the factors there leading to that acceleration?","Thomas J. Szkutak","Sure. I'll take the second one first on North American media. I just mentioned that a little bit in one of the previous questions. But certainly, our digital media growth has been great and certainly it's helping that. One other call-out, just to keep in mind, in Q4, I had mentioned that video games, including video game consoles, the consoles are part of North America media, that's a seasonal business that was bringing down growth in Q4. So it's also something to keep in mind. In terms of our guidance, we've given a pretty broad range on both the top and the bottom as we have previously. We think the segment operating income on the bottom end of the range is certainly appropriately conservative. But again, things that you should think about, we'll continue to add capacity as we've talked about in the past. With the growth that we're experiencing, we are adding more. And as I mentioned on one of the earlier questions, we've announced approximately 13 new fulfillment centers. So those are as a result of the growth that we're experiencing. We're also adding capacity to support AWS in our retail business on the infrastructure side as well. So those are things to think about as you think about Q2 from a segment operating income, as well as the CapEx that I mentioned in the opening. Another area is certainly our digital offerings. We are certainly adding more content, and specifically, more video content, which will be as reflected in our guidance. And so those are factors, among others, that you should think about.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.","Charles Eugene Munster - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Another question on gross margin. It was obviously impressive results, the best in 3 years almost. And it's been a little bit of a roller coaster in terms of the profitability quarter-to-quarter. And we understand that you're in an investment phase and there's a massive opportunity ahead of you. Is there anything that you can tell us as we think going forward over the next few quarters? Just is the investment philosophy that played through this quarter going to play on in other quarters? Or is each quarter kind of its own 3 months and it could go either way?","Thomas J. Szkutak","Yes. Gene, in terms of guidance, we're just giving guidance on Q2 today. But the one thing I would say is again we're seeing very good growth, as you see in Q1 and reflected in the guidance for Q2. And we'll have to stay tuned to see what it looks like for the remainder of the year as we progress. But we're extremely happy with the opportunities that we have. We think it's -- we're in a great position with the opportunities that we have. Even though we've reached some scale, we just have tremendous opportunities in front of us. And that's why we're investing in those.","Operator","And we'll go next to Brian Nowak with Nomura.","Brian Nowak - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I have a couple of questions. The first one is I know there's a lot of focus on kind of CSOI margins and margin pressure from the build. But I was just curious if you still see areas of your business in the oldest part of your business, where you think you have inefficiencies you can still work to improve execution and kind of get some margin lift out of those in the oldest part of the business just to improve execution. And the second one is any more clarity on how much roughly Quidsi and Lovefilm added to revenue growth this quarter?","Thomas J. Szkutak","In terms of opportunities for improvement, even though we've made a lot of progress, we still feel we have a lot of room for improvement in all parts of our business. Certainly, the most opportunity is the newer parts. But certainly if you go back and look at -- we're still trying to get great productivity and putting together programs to get great productivity in each of our operations. And so there's really too many to list here on the call today. But we look at in all facets for our business in terms of productivity. We think there's opportunities to partner with vendors even more to get better savings and better prices for customers. So the list is long. But I think when you look at the opportunities in terms of the ranking, in terms of at least basis points improvement, start with the newer things that we've launched -- at least directionally, the newer things that we've launched, work your way backwards, and those were usually where the biggest opportunities are in terms of basis points.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities.","Matthew R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just going back to the \"gross margin\", is it fair to say, given the change in that metric and the change in third-party units, that potentially the core margins in 1P really accelerated in the first quarter in addition to there being a continued mix shift to 3P? That's my first question. And then secondly, can you comment on any product categories in either media or EGM that either held you back in the quarter or were a tailwind? I think last quarter you mentioned video games and a few categories in terms of giving some color.","Thomas J. Szkutak","Yes. In terms of the second part of the question, I think the -- in terms of any headwinds, I would say there's a few areas, as we talked about last quarter with some of the supply issues that we had related to the Thailand floods that caused certainly issues, some issues for us specifically in the areas of some parts of cameras, audio, video, office equipment. And so you saw some of that impact in Q4, as well as Q1. The good news for us with our platform is we have many, many different sellers. So where we had supply, we continue to offer those for customers. And in cases where we didn't, oftentimes we had third parties that may have had -- still had inventory. So it certainly helped us very well to get through that situation. So those are some of the headwinds that were in Q1. And then we had very strong broad growth amongst many categories, certainly, in terms of the retail categories. And we also had very strong growth in Kindle. Globally, AWS is growing very, very fast. So we had some very, very positive, if you will, tailwinds from the strong growth.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Carlos Kirjner with Sanford Bernstein.","Carlos Kirjner - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Two questions, if I may. First, on fulfillment. If you think of the expected authorization of your fulfillment network in the fourth quarter of this year versus what you had in the fourth quarter of '11, do you expect it to be the same, higher or lower? And secondly, on Kindle, now that you are a manufacturer, a seller of Android-based devices, can you comment on your intellectual property position and the strategic and financial risks associated with potential lawsuits from competitors? For example, do you intend to go buy patents in the market?","Thomas J. Szkutak","In terms of the first question, in terms of fulfillment utilization, difficult to say at this point what our utilization will be. We have a very good team of people who work on this in each of our geographies, trying to make sure we have adequate capacity throughout the year, as well as for Q4. And it's always a tough balance. We want to make sure that we have enough because we want to make sure we satisfy customers. And so we'll have to see as we progress through the year what the growth looks like. And we certainly -- based on what we're experiencing so far, we expect it to be very good. And we'll have to see what happens in future months and quarters to see what that looks like. So it's a little bit early to say what we think that utilization will be. But we're trying to make sure in any time we do this is to have enough but not too much. And it's a delicate balance, so hard to predict what it will be. In terms of your second question, I don't think there's a lot I can help you with there. We have -- we certainly have a lot of technology that we develop ourselves. And we have a great technical team that's working a lot of different interesting areas on behalf of customers and will continue to do so. Beyond that, there's not a lot I can comment.","Operator","And we'll go next to Jordan Rohan with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Jordan Rohan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","A couple of point of clarification. I don't think I heard you blame macro weakness in Europe. Now clearly, you had stronger results across-the-board, so I don't see it evident in the results. Are you clear enough about the direction of the macro or its impact on your European operations that you can kind of say, at least from what you're seeing, it's not affecting you now? And the second question is on this percentage of third-party versus first-party sales. Last quarter, I believe you said that it got up to 36% in part because of stockouts due to the Thai flood and such. At some point, one would think that the supply chain for cameras and other equipment affected by the Thai flood would normalize. Would we expect that to therefore normalize back down from 39% level back down to the mid-30s? How can we think about that relationship?","Thomas J. Szkutak","Sure. In terms of the macro economics of Europe specifically, it's -- we're not exactly a bellwether for the economy, and so it's hard to  assess. It certainly is having some impact on us. And you're certainly reading the same press as we are in terms of what's going on, and it's very challenging. But it's hard to quantify what that impact is, so we're certainly having some impact but it's hard to quantify, is how I would explain it. And then in terms of 3P, we have -- we've seen the dynamic that you're talking about in terms of it has helped us with stockouts both in Q4 and Q1 for sure and has helped growth. Where does it moderate? Hard to say. But we have seen outside of these 2 quarters, very good third-party growth. And that's been accelerating over the past couple years in terms of third-party unit growth. There's a number of different factors in terms of making that experience better for sellers. The most notable one is Fulfilled by Amazon. And so that's certainly having an impact in all the geographies that we operate and have that in. And so it's great for sellers, it's great for customers and it's great for shareowners. So it's a nice intersection there. So we're very excited about it, and that's really what's driving it. The stockouts and things, those will happen from time to time in various categories. And I think that's certainly one of the benefits of our model of having both first-party and third-party offerings. But I wouldn't view that as the substantial driver of what's happened in third party over the last few years. It's other things that we've done to improve that experience for sellers.","Operator","And we'll go next to Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank.","Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just had a couple questions around AmazonSupply. And I guess, first, wondering if this is the beginning of a bigger push into the B2B kind of industrial space. And then secondly, what do you all see as your strongest assets as you approach this space? Are you planning to rely a lot on third party for inventory? And then just finally, along those lines, the press release mentions the extension of corporate credit. Wondering how integral this might be to the strategy. And then just more broadly, how do you think about credit extension to customers?","Thomas J. Szkutak","In terms of the AmazonSupply, it's an interesting -- we've been serving businesses for some time. This is just again a separate URL to help us do that with some interesting selection, we think, on behalf of businesses. We work very closely with a lot of businesses today, both as a customer on our consumer side of our business. We also obviously have a lot of third-party sellers that we work with as part of our seller business. So we're very excited about that. In terms of any -- in terms of extension of credit and everything, those are things that we're working through. And we want to make the right decisions on behalf of those customers. And I can't add much to that today. But certainly we can talk more about that in the future as that evolves.","Operator","And we'll go next to Anthony DiClemente with Barclays.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","On the Kiva acquisition, I was wondering if you could talk about how you're planning on implementing that at your fulfillment centers. And does it require much incremental investment? And then more broadly about mobile purchasing behavior, wondering if you could speak to just the purchasing behavior you're seeing from your consumers in terms of what's the order of magnitude and what type of mix shift in buying that you're seeing from PC and mobile? That would be great.","Thomas J. Szkutak","In terms of Kiva, it's early. We haven't closed it yet. And so we're very, very excited to be having Kiva and the team as part of the Amazon team. We're extremely excited to have that. And in terms of implementations within Amazon, we still have a lot of work to do to figure out how and when we'll do that. And so those are things that we'll be working on. But we're very, very excited about the opportunity to join with Kiva. So we're excited about it. In terms of mobile, not a lot I can help you with there. Certainly, the mobile part of our business is growing very, very fast. And it's a very exciting opportunity. And this is not something that's new; it's something that we've been working on for a number of years in a number of geographies. And we'll continue to work on that experience to make it even better for customers over time.","Operator","And we'll go next to Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","A. Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","First question is on taxes. Can you help us at all understand what percent of your marketplaces currently pay taxes similar to, say, offline retail? And maybe any help on what you saw on New York with the tax law changes there. Maybe start with that, and then one follow-up.","Thomas J. Szkutak","I'm sorry. Could you repeat the first part of the question?","A. Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes. What percent of your market, including International markets, are already on what we call level-tax basis, meaning the taxes are the same for buying on Amazon versus an offline retailer?","Thomas J. Szkutak","Yes. So you're saying sales tax.","A. Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes, sales tax, yes.","Thomas J. Szkutak","Assume that approximately 50% of our sales, we either collect a sales tax or a value-added tax. So we collect it in several states today in the U.S. and a large number of geographies outside of the U.S. And so it's approximately 50%. So this is not anything new. This is something that we've been doing for a long period of time. And we have very good businesses in those geographies and states that we collect.","A. Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And did you see any slowdown in states where they've enacted sales taxes in your sales levels?","Thomas J. Szkutak","Yes. I can't comment on any specific geography or state. But again, you can see by the growth that we've experienced over the past few years, which includes during those past few years, certainly adding some geographies, if you will, to our collection efforts. And so those are all represented in the results that you've seen over the past few years and several years. So that's all I can add to that.","Operator","And we'll go next to Herman Leung with Susquehanna Financial Group.","Herman Leung - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Two quick questions. First, I know there's a lot of investment going on in the data center areas for your Web Services business. I was wondering at the current level, I mean, what -- how much capacity you're able to support, especially as you're signing on more of these larger type customers on the government side? And I have a quick follow-up.","Thomas J. Szkutak","Yes. No, we're ready for additional demand. The team has worked extremely hard to make sure that we keep up with demand. And so as you've seen over the past few years now, you're seeing our CapEx growing. As a result of it, you're seeing the operating expense as it relates to that in our technology and content. And so the team has done a very nice job in terms of adding capacity and is very excited to continue this fast growth that we're experiencing in AWS. So we're very happy to do that.","Herman Leung - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","And just a very quick follow-up. I guess, on your -- the GMV that's flowing through your third-party business, is there an opportunity over time to kind of share with us the real power of the third -- just the third-party volume that's actually flowing through the top line?","Thomas J. Szkutak","We have -- the best way to think about it, at least from our -- as it relates to our retail and third-party business, they're not -- it's certainly not a 1-for-1 because you have new and used products. You have different category mix. But in terms of an overall volume perspective, as I mentioned in some of the earlier comments, that it was about 30 -- approximately 39% of our total units, so it's very meaningful. And that's growing -- grew over 60% this quarter, again, up from 36% of our total units. So again, it's -- I can't give you the GMV. But in terms of units as it relates to our retail units, it's 39% of total units, so it's meaningful.","Operator","And we'll go next to Ben Schachter with Macquarie.","Benjamin A. Schachter - Macquarie Research","Given the success of the ad-supported Kindle, should we expect more devices to be offered with an ad-supported option? And then also if any comments on the dynamics driving the increase in the shipping revenue. And finally, any update on the share buyback?","Thomas J. Szkutak","Yes. In terms of what we do going forward, we certainly have a long-standing practice of not talking about what we would do going forward, so you have to stay tuned on that. In terms of the share repurchase, as I mentioned in the opening comments, we purchased 5.3 million shares, just under $1 billion, $960 million during the quarter. We have a little over $700 million or just under $800 million left on our authorization that we have from the board, which was $2 billion, that we got some ago. So that's left on the authorization.","Operator","And we'll take our last question from Colin Sebastian with R.W. Baird.","Gregor Schauer - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","This is Gregor Schauer in for Colin. I have a question regarding the Kindle Fire, which you guys have noted for the quarter is still the #1 bestselling and most gifted product on Amazon.com. But it's still only selling in the U.S. Can you help us think through or understand sort of what are the other considerations in terms of the timing of an international rollout of the Kindle Fire?","Thomas J. Szkutak","I really can't. I think you'd have to stay tuned. It's certainly a very interesting opportunity for us. And we know that, and you'll have to stay tuned.","Operator","And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back to our speakers for any closing remarks.","Thomas J. Szkutak","Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions.

Good day everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com, Q3 2019 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation we will conduct a question-and-answer session.","Today\u2019s call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Shelly Kay Pfeiffer. Please go ahead.","Shelly Kay Pfeiffer","Hello, and welcome to our Q3, 2019 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO; and Dave Fildes, Director of Investor Relations. ","As you listen to today\u2019s conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2018.","Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management\u2019s views as of today, October 24, 2019 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today\u2019s press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.","During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.","Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we\u2019ve seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.","Our guidance also assumes among other things that we don\u2019t conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It\u2019s not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.","With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed.","Eric Sheridan","Thanks so much for taking the question. I wanted to know if I could go a little bit deeper in the framework you gave around revenue guidance for Q4. ","Historically, you have seen deceleration in the year-on-year growth rate in Q4 versus Q3, but many of your businesses look like they reaccelerated in Q3 over Q2. So just wanted to know whether it was AWS or advertising or some of the things in e-commerce business, whether there are things we should be keeping in front of mind from a headwind or a tailwind perspective, as we think through some of the moving pieces in Q4? Thanks so much.","Brian Olsavsky","Sure. Hi, Eric. Yes, let me make clear, we are really excited and looking forward to a great holiday season. We feel like we had a great Q3 as well and have made rapid progress on our One Day shipping. The ops team has done a great job getting us to a position where we are in and I think that\u2019s going to be a great additional service for customers in Q4. ","On the guidance front, here\u2019s what I would have you keep in mind. If you look back over the last few years and adjust for the acquisition of Whole Foods and Soup, which obscured this a bit in the last couple of years. ","There has been a noticeable drop in run rate, between Q3 and Q4 generally on the lines of about 300 basis points. We are factoring that in this year, that\u2019s just something we\u2019re expecting. It\u2019s a bit about the law of large numbers and the differential between growth and holiday season, that\u2019s very tight few weeks of the holiday season versus the rest of the year. ","So we factor that in, and then there\u2019s also two other issues. The Diwali holiday in India was all in Q4 last year and a bit of it was in Q3 this year. Also the Japan consumption tax was raised from 8% to 10% on October 1, and what we saw was a pre-buy a bit in Q3 at the end of the quarter, and based on our history with the last time the consumption tax went up many years ago, we\u2019ve expected a slight negative impact from that tax in Q4 in Japan. ","So if you wrap those together, we expect it\u2019s going to be more of an issue with our international growth rate. I would say it has helped us by 150 basis points in Q3, and will be a negative headwind of 300 basis points year-over-year in Q4. ","For the company, it\u2019s not as large an issue. There is about 40 basis points of favorability in Q3 and it\u2019s expected to be about 80 basis point headwind in Q4. So that\u2019s a little bit more on our guidance, but again we are really looking forward to Q4. ","I think we\u2019re well positioned to make it the best holiday ever for our customers. I think One Day should help with holiday shipping. We\u2019ve got a great new device lineup you may have seen announced in September and on the AWS side, we\u2019re looking forward to our re:Invent Conference in Las Vegas, where we welcome over 65,000 conference attendees.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Doug Anmuth","Thanks for taking the questions. Brian, I just wanted to ask you kind of more broadly about Prime One Day, what your biggest learnings have been so far over the past several months as you\u2019ve been increasing availability? ","And then how should we think about that availability now, and when we get into the heart of the holiday season? And can you also just help us understand how that\u2019s playing into your operating income guidance for 4Q? Thanks.","Brian Olsavsky","Sure. Let me start with the second part of that. So back in Q2, I said that we were estimating an $800 million expense tied to One Day in Q2, and we actually were just above that in Q2. In Q3, we expected that to grow, we put into our guidance and we hit essentially where we expected on the guidance. ","So as we head into Q4, we\u2019ve added what\u2019s just nearly a $1.5 billion penalty in Q4 year-over-year for the cost of shipping, which is essentially transportation costs, the cost of expanding our transportation capacity, things like adding additional poles and shifts in our warehouses, the cost for deploying inventory closer to customers, there\u2019s a lot of tangential costs, by and a way the biggest expenses is on the actual transportation cost. ","So we\u2019ve built that into our Q4 guidance estimate, but we\u2019re very pleased with the customer response to One Day. You can see it in our revenue acceleration and also in our unit growth acceleration. Once again the ops team has really done yeoman\u2019s work here to create this capacity for us and they continue to unlock additional capacity daily. ","We\u2019re expecting that it will be again a great help to customers in Q4. We have seen Prime members increase their orders, spend more, so that they must also see it as a real help to them in their daily lives.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed.","Youssef Squali","Great, thank you so much. Brian, kind of just a couple of quick ones. Of the 400 basis point sequential acceleration growth, can you help us just understand maybe how much of that was driven by Prime Day, which I think you guys said was a record day for you versus One Day shipping. Just trying to extract one versus the other, because obviously going into Q4 you\u2019re only going to have the latter. ","And then on \u2013 a lot of news around counterfeit and whatnot on the side. Can you just help quantify that for us if there is a way for you to do that? And is the higher OpEx 4Q also driven at least in part by the higher investment to combat that? Thank you.","Brian Olsavsky","Yes, sure. So on the second one, I would say we\u2019re certainly very diligent on trying to catch counterfeit products. We put a lot of effort into that, we put a lot of human effort, we put a lot of machine learning and algorithmic effort into that as well. ","But I would say the bigger investments in Q4 are certainly two-fold: One around the One Day shipping that I just mentioned. The other would be on AWS. We continue to invest in AWS. If you look at the progression of our operating margin in that business, it reached a high of 31% last Q4, excuse me Q3. That was a time when we were \u2013 as we mentioned at the time it was very efficient, we had been banking some savings from forward investments in infrastructure in 2017. ","We continue to feel really good about not only the top line, but also the bottom line in that business, but we are investing a lot more this year in sales force and marketing personnel, mainly to handle a you know wider group of customers, an increasingly wide group of products, we continue to add thousands of new products and features a year, and we continue to expand geographically. ","So the biggest impact that we saw in Q3 year-over-year in the AWS segment was tied to costs related to sales and marketing year-over-year and also to a secondary extent, infrastructure, which if you look at our capital leases or equipment leases line, it grew 30% on a trailing 12-month basis in Q3 of this year and that was 9% last year. ","So there has been a step up in infrastructure costs to support the higher usage demand. So we see those trends continuing into Q4, and that\u2019s essentially, probably the other element of operating income year-over-year, that\u2019s shorter than in prior quarters.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Brian Nowak","Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Just to go back to the One Day costs, I appreciate the color. I\u2019m curious to hear about how you think about what portion of these costs are sort of transitory versus structurally? It sounds like there are some shipping costs in there. ","Can you just sort of talk to some of the steps, you have to take over the next one to two years to get the One Day shipping costs closer to what they used to be for Two Day, and how do you think about how long it\u2019s going to take? ","And then secondly on One Day, I think it\u2019s mostly U.S. to-date, is that right? And then if not, how do you think about sort of timing on pushing more internationally? Thanks.","Brian Olsavsky","Sure. Yes, most of the expense has been in the U.S., but we have also increased our One Day selection internationally. We\u2019re starting to see some benefits from that. But I would say the biggest impact so far, both on the top line lift and also the bottom line cost is in the U.S. ","You know we\u2019re still learning here on the One Day costs as we go about what the long-term cost structure will be. We know we have temporary costs in the short run as we do things like forward deploy inventory, get greater inbound into those warehouses, set up new Amazon Logistics, AMZL capacity, staff you know multiple shifts, so that we can have later pull times to hit One Day cut-offs, things like that, adding sort centers. ","So it\u2019s a you know drastic change to the whole network topology that would \u2013 you know we\u2019re glad to do and working through it and we\u2019ve been down this road before obviously, and a number of different incarnations in Amazon history. So we will keep posted on a, you know quarterly basis as best we can, but right now, really forward guiding is for Q4.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Heath Terry","Great, thanks. I know most of the focus on One Day has been on speed, but based on the vans we\u2019re all seeing, it would seem that the shift to more of your own last mile infrastructure is maybe the bigger part of this. ","As it scales and you get to higher levels of efficiency and utilization, does that become margin accretive or profitability accretive relative to using the third parties almost exclusively in the way that you have in the past? And then this was also a very big hiring quarter for you, 100,000 people. Can you give us a sense of where those people are going you know relative to AWS fulfillment, retail, kind of understanding sort of where they have been prioritized?","Brian Olsavsky","Sure. Thank you for your questions Heath. On the first question, I think it boils down to whether it will be competitive long term with other options out there. Yes, we will be, we believe that. In many cases we are already are and the places where we have very high AMZL percentages, the U.K. for instance, in some cases we\u2019re lacking alternative options for the type of delivery that we\u2019re doing.","But in the long run we\u2019re going to have a combination both of our own capacity, certainly fueled by helps with third party carriers, large carriers that we\u2019ve used in the past. So we see a role for all carriers, in fact including the delivery service partner program that we\u2019ve developed to help spur small businesses to help fill this need as well. ","But on the cost side, yes it\u2019s going to be the route density and other things will improve over time and get our cost structure down, but for now, there is certainly some start-up paying in adding new capacity. ","On the headcount question, yes we increased as you said close to 100,000 people in Q3. I mean we are up 22% year-over-year. In the past that pointed to investments in technology teams and that\u2019s certainly part of it, but by in a way the biggest driver this time is the people that we\u2019re adding for fulfillment and transportation roles, especially as we head into Q4 and add this additional transportation capacity to service One Day.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Stephen Ju","Okay, thank you. So Brian, I\u2019m wondering if you can weigh in on the puts and takes on the long-term potential margin for AWS? When this was first launched it pretty much sold itself and now you are employing a greater number of salespeople, and with that I guess the incremental marketing dollars. But on the other hand it seems like the engineering talent hiring should slow down over time. So I\u2019m just wondering if you can weigh in on what\u2019s coming in or what\u2019s coming out. Thanks.","Brian Olsavsky","Yeah, sure. I would say the margins \u2013 our margins expectations are that we will price competitively and continue to pass along pricing reductions to customers both in the form of absolute price reductions and also in the form of new products that will in effect cannibalize the old ones. ","And we also see a point out that you know increasingly what we\u2019re doing is renegotiating or negotiating incremental price decreases for customers who then commit to us long term. And if you look at our disclosure on our 10-Q, it shows that we have $27 billion in future commitments for AWS, from AWS customers and that\u2019s up 54% year-over-year. So that\u2019s another thing to watch, it\u2019s not only the short-term commitment, but also the long-term commitment that we see.","On the rest of the P&L, there again we have, I believe some of the best infrastructure people in the industry. If not the best, we are continually driving up efficiency and lowering costs and we see that in our bottom line. ","The sales and marketing investment, we\u2019re chasing a large opportunity here and that will be, you know as we say bumpy as we go along, but we are fully confident that that will be a very leveraged cost as we get to scale. ","And then on the technology side, as you said, yes we will continue and invest in SDEs and software engineers to build these you know products that customers love, continue to respond to their demands, and that will push or inform our product portfolio.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Lloyd Walmsley","Thanks. Can you talk about the key drivers of the acceleration in what looks like advertising revenue within other and related to that, the press release mentions I think you are now $37 million Fire Stick users worldwide. So can you talk about maybe how much ad inventory you\u2019ve been able to get inside of networks within that and how meaningful is this to the overall kind of advertising strategy. Thanks.","Brian Olsavsky","Yes, so let me start with the first question on advertising. So other revenue, which is principally advertising grew 45% this quarter, up from 37% last quarter and the biggest thing in there is advertising and advertising grew at a rate higher than that 45%. ","So we are very happy with the progress in the advertising business, continue to focus on advancing advertising experiences there, helpful for customers, helping them to see new products, we want to empower our businesses to find attracting and engage these customers and it\u2019s increasingly popular with vendor sellers and third-party advertisers.","So it\u2019s still early and what we\u2019re focused on really at this point is relevancy, making sure that the ads are relevant to our customers, helpful to our customers, and to do that, we use machine learning and that\u2019s helping us to drive better, better and better relevancy.","Dave Fildes","Yeah. And then Lloyd, this is Dave. Just quickly on Fire TV. I mean I have to start with the fact that we did recently introduce 20 new Fire TV products, so that includes the new \u2013 and the first Fire TV Edition Sound Bar, Fire TV Cube. So a number of things have come out recently. We\u2019re really excited to get into customers\u2019 hands, so more to come there. ","I think specifically on the advertising side and the opportunity with that, we are continuing to see some increased adoption. You know one of our areas of focus is expanding our video and OTT offerings for brands. It\u2019s still early in this space, but we\u2019ve done a few things with IMDb TV, Live Sports, things like adding more inventory through Fire TV apps, and as I said IMDb TV, adding more OTT video supply through Amazon Publisher Services or APS integrations and streamlining access for third party apps and really just making it easier for advertisers to manage their campaigns and provide better results.","So, as I said early days, but I think with the engagement of the device community, the fact that we\u2019re really excited with the progress and improvements of these devices, I think yeah, again a lot of opportunity there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Devitt with Stifel. Please proceed.","Scott Devitt","Thanks. There has been a meaningful reacceleration in paid unit growth in the past two quarters with the expansion of the One Day guarantees for Prime customers, and I\u2019m just wondering if consumers are responding more in certain categories that you would highlight over others or is the response fairly broad-based across the product categories where One Day has been expanded? Thank you.","Brian Olsavsky","Hi, Scott. Yeah, what I can tell you is that yes, the unit growth has been reaccelerated in the last two quarters and actually Amazon Fulfilled unit growth is growing at a higher clip. So we do attribute it to One Day. ","We\u2019re seeing broad sales across all categories. So you know there has been some reduction in the threshold for some lower ASP items that we\u2019ve been doing separately over the last six months that have spurred some sales in lower ASP items, but we think that is again the right decision for customers, especially over the long term.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Mark Mahaney","Hey, thanks, I want to go back to AWS. When asked about margins, you first referred to \u2013 Brian you first referred to by bringing down prices. Are you seeing anything different in terms of the level of price competition? Could you talk about what kind of traction you\u2019ve had building out into the enterprise, and I know it\u2019s a broad question, but take a shot at it. And third part of this is, your interest and your success in going in and generating more app \u2013 you know going up the stack and getting more into the application software space, all that AWS related. Thanks.","Brian Olsavsky","Sure. Hi, Mark. So yeah, I would say my comments around pricing were as much mix as absolute price decreases or competitive price pressures. It\u2019s certainly a competitive market that we see and we\u2019ve seen for really a number of years. So everyone is very sharp on their pricing and is very eager to lock up long-term commitments from AWS customers. ","We do it with you know a combination of price and capability that we think is unmatched. So the bigger element of that really is around us creating new products and services that are cheaper and less expensive than the old ones. So there is a certain bit of mix issue that we are always up against. ","But again in your question on enterprise penetration, you know I think the enterprise, we\u2019re making great progress there. You know it\u2019s going to be hard on revenue growth, it\u2019s going to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, it\u2019s hard to predict the pace of some of the sales cycles and the enterprise migrations that companies are willing to make or some are faster than others and some have other work to do before they can migrate. ","So you know there\u2019s a lot of factors at play there on the enterprise business, but we are having great success and we\u2019re adding a lot of sales force or sales representatives, especially for the enterprise market.","Dave Fildes","Yeah, and Mark, this is Dave. Just really quickly just in terms of your question on the stack. I mean I think for really since as long as AWS has been around, we really pride ourselves in getting really top, high caliber people both in the technical side, but also sales people that are plugged in and listening to customers, understanding issues that are emerging, having open lines of communication and that\u2019s really allowed us to innovate quickly and really faster than anyone else, and we see that in the terms of the service and feature breadth and depth that we have.","So, a lot of the focus for us is really making sure that that flywheel keep spinning, and that we continue to roll out a lot of great services the customers are looking for. So I think that\u2019s largely what dictates our roadmap and making sure that we give ourselves autonomy and availability to look to new areas and stay on the cusp of whether it\u2019s kind of emerging technologies or really just our customer needs or pain points that need to be solved.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Baird. Please proceed.","Colin Sebastian","Thanks. Maybe first is a follow-up on the logistics and delivery side. I\u2019m wondering if you could give us some sense for the portion of SKUs in the U.S. or orders in the U.S. that are now delivered through your own network of drivers and partners. ","And then secondly, there have been some reports that Amazon is or on occasion is delivering products for other merchants or suppliers, not specifically tied to an Amazon order. So just wondering if you view this as another potential opportunity down the road as you get excess capacity and on the logistics side? Thanks.","Dave Fildes","Yeah Colin, hey it\u2019s Dave. Thanks for the question. On that second point, in terms of how we think about the capacity we might have for our own, I think you know \u2013 I\u2019d start with, you know we\u2019ve got a great relationship with third party carriers across the countries where we operate. ","Over time I think you know we\u2019ll look and expect to be able to grow our internal volume using AMZL or Amazon Logistics, but also continue to grow our 3P volumes with carriers, transporters around the world. But our focus is really on ensuring that we\u2019ve got capacity from available resources, whether it\u2019s our own or our great carrier partners to be able to serve the small and medium-sized businesses in the 3P realm, but also the first party items that we are receiving orders from customers, making sure we\u2019re able to deliver those things quickly and reliably.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question will come from Justin Post with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","Justin Post","Great, thank you all; it\u2019s going to be a couple here. Just wondering back on the shorter holiday season, do you think that\u2019s going to be a headwind for overall online sales in the quarter, anything specific to Amazon? ","And then secondly, just thinking about the regulatory environment. I wonder if you could just comment on the opportunities and the competitiveness for third-party sellers. Are there other platforms that you see for them and how do you think about their profitability on Amazon, if you can comment on that at all? Thank you.","Brian Olsavsky","Sure, yeah. On third party I would say we only succeed if the third party sellers succeeds. So we\u2019re heavily invested in them as they are in us. So we are constantly investing on their behalf, adding new products and features and you know we are cognizant of their economics as well and we want a business that works for both of us and we set our fees accordingly.","So I think that you know we\u2019ve \u2013 and I\u2019ll also point out that with the One Day, the increase in One Day sellers have participated, and not as much as anyone else, as much as our 1P offering. So, it\u2019s been a great boon for sellers as well as, particularly in our FBA program. ","On the holiday season question, we are not anticipating that the move of you know the shorter time period between Thanksgiving and you know Christmas Day is going to be that impactful. What we found in the past is that there is generally a holiday budget that is spent somewhere between November 15 and - November 1 maybe and December 25, and well certainly Black Friday and Cyber Monday are important dates in that holiday period. ","You know there is - the purchase tend to move around. Some have been moving early in the quarter, some of them moving later in the quarter as customers can count on and receive very quick shipments at the end and have higher faith in delivery just before the holidays. So that\u2019s a little bit color, that\u2019s what\u2019s anticipated in our guidance that we\u2019ve given.","Dave Fildes","Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website, at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.

After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded.","For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Darin Manney. Please go ahead.","Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.","Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2017 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results to the comparable period of 2016.","Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 27, 2017 only, and include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially.","Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.","During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.","Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.","Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements and excludes the impact of our proposed acquisition of Whole Foods Market. It is not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.","With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","At this time, we will open up the call for questions. We ask each caller please limit yourself to one question.","Thank you. Our first question comes from line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. I was just wondering if you could give us a sense on the investments that are planned in Q3. Previously, you've been willing to provide sort of some qualitative guidance around how you're rank ordering those or in terms of the ones that are the largest areas of investment in the quarter. I'm just wondering if you could update us on that given the guidance for Q3 and what we saw in investment in Q2.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Sure. Let me see what I can tell you on that. First of all, I want to remind you that Q3 is typically a lower operating income quarter as we're preparing for the Q4 holiday peak. The other dynamic is that, similar to last year, a large percentage of our new fulfillment centers are coming online in the second half of the year, a lot of them in Q3. So, to give that some perspective, the Amazon-fulfilled network, or the combination of retail and FBA shipments coming out of our warehouses has been nearly 40%. It was that last year, and it's continued through this year. Last year we added 30% additional square footage to handle that additional shipping volume, and about 80% of that went into service in the back end of last year. And that's what I mentioned about this time last year.","The similar dynamic this year, we are going to have about 80% of our increase in square footage for fulfillment and shipping coming online in the back end of the year, so that's a major increase. The other comment I would make is on the video content. Video content last year, I highlighted the fact that it was going to be a significant step up between second half of 2016 and the second half of 2015. We are still \u2013 we lapped that most of the first half this year and we'll also be increasing video spend on a sequential and year-over-year basis in Q3, and that's included in this guidance.","Other than that, can't give much more specifics except to say that the large investment areas remain the increasing fulfillment capacity to service the strong growth of the FBA business. I will also point out that the strong usage growth in AWS has led us to a step up in infrastructure in capital leases to build the capital leases in the trailing 12 months. They've increased 71% through the end of Q2 versus last year. That is servicing \u2013 accelerating usage in our largest AWS services as well as geographic expansion. So that's additional factor sequentially in the quarter year-over-year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you. A question on the grocery category and the announcements that we have \u2013 that we heard recently. Specifically, does that imply that the strategy has changed around fresh, which was presumably replacing the trip to the grocery store? Or should we think about adding different modes such as pick up points and bricks and mortar as serving a distinct customer base or geared to reduce the cost bottleneck around home delivery? Any comments would be helpful. Thanks.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Sure, Colin. First, as far as Whole Foods is concerned, as Darin mentioned, it's not included in this guidance since it hasn't closed yet, but we are excited about that acquisition and looking forward to working with the team at Whole Foods. We think they are very customer-centric, just like us. They've built a great business, focus around quality and customer. So we're really glad to join up with them. On your larger question about what the place of Amazon Fresh, likely Prime Now and some of our other efforts, I would say we believe there'll be no one solution, so we're experimenting with a number of the formats from physical pickup points in Amazon Go to online ordering and delivery to your door through Prime Now and Amazon Fresh.","And we'll see how customers respond. We like the response that we've seen so far. We think it's a valuable \u2013 all those are valuable services, Amazon Go is not out of beta, but the other ones are. On top of that, we're looking forward to adding the Whole Foods team and their great reputation for quality customer service to this offering.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. A couple of questions. It definitely seems relative to your guidance, you may have stepped up spending in the second quarter. Anything in particular to call out, India or anything like that? And then just thinking bigger picture, I'm wondering why physical locations might make sense for Amazon. Why is that a positive use of capital going forward? Thank you.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Sure. As far as Q2 is concerned, we were very encouraged by the revenue and unit growth acceleration, particularly in North America. We see that tied to the Prime growth and the adoption of Prime and success of that program. Also point out that AWS stepped up its run rate from a $14 billion run rate last quarter to $16 billion. So we saw the largest quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increase in revenue in that business as well. And gross margin expanded 130 basis points.","So as you point out, the year-over-year difference is primarily driven by investments, what we were within the guidance range and we continue to invest in, as I said, fulfillment capacity and logistics services, digital video, our Echo and Alexa, Echo devices and Alexa platform India, the buildup at the AWS infrastructure, all the things I mentioned not to mention Prime Now and Amazon Fresh and Prime benefits.","We did see a big jump in head count in year-over-year. You'll see it's 42%, and in the past, I'd say most of that is driven by operations hiring. I've even said that headquarters or office hiring many times in the past was below the level of revenue growth. Right now, what we're seeing is an accelerated growth rate in software engineers and also sales teams to support primarily AWS and advertising. So, yes, the growth rate of those two job categories actually exceeded the company growth rate. So we are adding \u2013 having success hiring a lot of people and pointing them at some very important programs and customer-facing efforts.","On the place of physical, again, as I mentioned in the earlier question, we are experimenting with a number of formats. You've seen the physical bookstores and I would say that the benefit there is again, we have a curated selection of titles and it's also a great opportunity for people to touch and feel our devices and see them, especially the new Echo devices. I went into the store in Seattle last week and I saw about a third of the people were standing around the device table learning how they work, how they interact with devices. So, I saw firsthand the customer experience, I think, that's what we're seeing as a benefit to the physical stores right now.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark May with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you. A question on the comments around the fulfillment investments. Could you characterize or maybe even quantify how much of the fulfillment infrastructure investment that you're making is kind of incremental, is geared towards handling growth and sort of the existing business and infrastructure versus expanding your capabilities in fulfillment, like adding more inbound or last mile and\/or from entering new international markets where you need to invest ahead of growth versus just sort of keeping up and maintaining growth within sort of your existing footprint? And then AWS, you had some price adjustments in May, yet the Q2 growth was quite good. Can you just comment about the impact that those cuts may have had in Q2 and if you're modeling those also in your Q3 guidance, maybe the impact there? Thanks.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Yes. Let me start with the second one. So, yes, we've had numerous price decreases, and we continue to have that in the AWS business, both absolute decreases in service costs and also rolling out new services that may be cannibalizing more expensive other services that we provide. So, nothing really to note on Q2 or Q3 from that standpoint. The fulfillment investments, I can't split it out for you between Amazon logistics support sort centers and fulfillment centers. What I can say, the biggest dynamic going on again is that Amazon fulfilled unit growth of nearly 40%, which was last year and carrying into this year.","It's a global number and we are very glad to have the success of the FBA program. We are matching that with just over 30% increase in square footage, and you're right, that does include some shipping sort centers and things that are incremental and new functions for us, if you will. But that's about all I can say on that right now. I think we're very happy with the FBA program. It's impact on Prime and we think Prime and FBA are self-reinforcing. We know customers really like it, the additional selection that FBA provides. So we like those combined, and we are working very hard to match that with capacity in an efficient manner.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow up on AWS, and just on the back of the price cut, obviously 1Q being the first full quarter, but it looks like 2Q, as Mark said, things did stabilize some. Can you just talk about whether you're seeing more of a volume pickup response here and companies kind of more actively moving volume into the cloud at these lower prices? And then just secondly, on Prime, the value of a Prime subscription for the consumer seems to continue to increase as you add more features in there. Can you just talk about your view around the flexibility of the price of annual Prime subscription? Thanks.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Sure. On the price of Prime, I have nothing to add at this time. We think that the \u2013 we are increasing the value of the Prime program every day. So it becomes more and more valuable and again, as we've said, it's the best deal in retail. On AWS, yes, we are seeing great customer adoption. Again, as I said earlier, the run rate's gone up from $14 billion to $16 billion in Q2, and also we had the largest sequential and year-over-year dollar rise in revenues. Our usage in all of our large services are actually accelerating and they're growing at a rate higher than our revenue growth. So, you're seeing great adoption. We are seeing AWS customers migrate more than 30 databases over the last year-and-a-half.","We signed some very big customer wins, like Ancestry, High Tail, California Polytechnic State University and others, that we're very proud to have. So, yes, the momentum in the business is very strong. We continue to open new regions. We'll be opening five regions in the near future in France, China, Sweden, Hong Kong and a second government cloud region in the East. So, yes, we like the momentum in that business. Stepping back, I would say that while pricing is important, again, we're generally being selected because of our functionality and pace of innovation, the innovation keeps accelerating. It did in the first half of this year, the pace of new services and features. We also know the customers value our partner and customer ecosystem and really the experience we've had, we've been at this longer than anybody else.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. I want to stick with AWS, please. So the AWS revenue growth showed almost no change but the AWS operating margin was lower I guess than we've seen in, I don't know, six quarters or something like that. I find that a little surprising but then I also saw that the tech and content came in materially heavy, I think, versus our and I assume other expectations. So could you just talk about that a little bit, the profitability, if there's anything that's changed in the profitability of AWS? Thanks.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Sure. Those margins, as we say frequently, are going to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter and always going to be a net of investments, excuse me, price reductions and cost efficiencies that we drive. So I would say the biggest impact in the margin that you're seeing in Q2 is really around the 71% increase in assets acquired under capital leases. Most of that is for the AWS business. So we've really stepped up the infrastructure to match the large usage growth and also the geographic expansion. And that is showing up in tech and content. On the marketing, if you look under the marketing expenses, they are also up, and that is driven by the increases we're seeing in the sales team both in AWS and advertising. So I would point to those two as probably larger than normal impacts on Q2 operating margin.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, as you continue to add more Prime Now markets with one to two-hour shipping, can you just talk to some of the logistical challenges that you've already encountered and worked through? And talk to kind of if you really do see one to two-hour shipping become a larger piece of the business over the next year, what's the biggest challenge you have to make sure that you manage? And the second one on the subscription revenue, it looks like subscription revenue growth was strong again, over 50%. Could you just talk to what drove that acceleration? Was it Prime? Or is there something else in there? Thanks.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Sure. Let me start with your second question on the subscription revenue. It grew 53% year-over-year versus 52% in Q1. So, we continue to see strong Prime membership growth. That is the main thing. There's also \u2013 in that line item are also other monthly fees associated with some of our other subscription services like audiobooks, e-books, digital video and digital music. Again, I would say that we're very happy with the Prime membership growth and it has remained pretty consistent both in Q4 and then through Q1 and Q2 of this year.","On your second question on Prime Now, so Prime Now is now available in 50 cities across eight countries. We do learn. It's something to do in every city and have different \u2013 slightly different shapes and sizes of those buildings and different density profiles. And so we are learning as we go, learn as we grow internationally as well. That is a service that customers love. That's not an inexpensive service, though, and we also have \u2013 so we're constantly working on our cost of delivery and our route densities. And again, we like what we see and we'll continue to expand that and we'll be working very hard on making that not only a valuable Prime offering, a Prime benefit, but also a lower-cost operation as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey. Good afternoon, Brian. I think I heard you earlier say that your head count for advertising salespeople is growing faster than the company as a whole, or company's head count growth rate as a whole. I would just like to use that maybe as a springboard to talk a little bit about what you think the right mix is for how you sell in terms of self-service versus salespeople.","And then a second one would just be a quick one. I know it's early, but be curious to see what you're seeing with users of the Echo Show, with the screen on it, and if you're seeing any particularly different type of user behavior there versus the original devices with that one. Thank you.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Sure. Yes. It's early on the Echo Show. As you know, we just started shipping those in late June, but we're very excited about the potential and the addition of the video screen and the messaging capability and video capability. So it's \u2013 I've used mine, it's awesome. It's a big step up in my mind, but we'll get more customer feedback as we go along. On advertising, technically what I said is the sales force has grown higher than the rate of growth in the business itself, which was 42% regular head count and that sales force is primarily AWS and advertising. So, we built self-service tools and obviously we want to make those as efficient as possible for customers and advertisers, but we realize that we will need actual sales contact with the accounts as well. So it's a mix. I can't get into the split, really, but I would see both growing.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe two. One, with respect to international margins, is there anything there you can give us in terms of rank order or color, whether it be geographies or category expansion that we should be thinking about that are driving some of the cost curve in the international side of the business? That would be number one. Number two, stock-based comps stepped up a lot, both quarter-over-quarter and year-on-year. Wanted to know if there was anything either organic or inorganic that was driving that step-up in stock-based compensation. Thank so much.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","Sure. I'll start with the second one. Yes, as you noted in the press release or the 8-K, we had an absolute step-up from Q1 of $792 million to Q2 of $1.2 billion. So it increased 51% year-over-year in Q2 versus a head count increase of 42%. I'll also say that we generally see a step-up from Q1 to Q2 because we do our employee RCU grants in Q2 of each year. So that's a normal trend. But the 51% year-over-year is also \u2013 it's a combination of the hiring we've done but also an adjustment we made to our estimated forfeiture rate. We're seeing less forfeitures, which is a great sign for our employee retention, but you have to make adjustments to your reserves as you see that. So that was another influence in Q2.","On operating margins internationally, I would step back and say a lot of the investments we're making in North America we're also making in international. Prime benefits including Prime Video and remember we launched Global Video in Q4 of last year to 200 countries, Prime Now, Amazon Fresh, the general rise of FBA and added selection, both retail and FBA to make Prime more attractive, and the fulfillment and logistics costs that go with that, and the additional constant effort to reduce prices and accelerate shipping. So that all impacts both North America segment and international. The North America segment is a little further along in the Prime, excuse me, yes, the Prime membership growth curve. And so in some respects we are giving benefits earlier in the lifecycle to international Prime customers than we did in North America just because it launched later.","And there's also India, as I mentioned, we continue to invest in India. We're very hopeful with the progress we've made with sellers and customers alike in India and we see great momentum and success there, so we continue to invest and we have some of our best people in that business.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC","Thanks, guys. You mentioned before just stand of new fulfillment centers, it takes a bit of time for them to ramp optimization. How should we think about that path optimization over a year or so? As you continue to scale operations and you bring data to bear and robotics and Kivas and AI machine learning, are you finding that kind of new fulfillment center optimization curve is accelerating?","Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.","Hi, Brian. This is Darin. Yes. We're getting more efficient every time we put new capacity into the network, whether that's through automation or just through the experience we've gained over the years. We still say it takes up to three years or three peaks to get to kind of network efficiency for a new particular facility, and that's about the same although the whole network gets sufficient over time. So there's a big mix going on, and we like the new innovation that we're bringing to the capabilities, but that ramp still stays about consistent as it was.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from line of from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer and Company. Please proceed with your question.","Jason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks for taking my question. Just one, other slowed from 58% in the first quarter to 53% year-over-year. Anything to call out? And then just you made a comment about physical stores and reaction to one other question that was really about showcasing new devices. Is it fair to say that probably means locations would have small footprints versus large footprints if you're thinking about that? Thank you.","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","I'm sorry. What was the first part of your question?","Jason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","The other, other revenue slowed from 58% in the first quarter to 53%. Is there anything to call out around that?","Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.","No, nothing in that other line item. It's advertising and also other things like cobranded credit card agreements. I would say that advertising revenue growth has been strong and fairly consistent over the past three quarters. So that number will move around, but there's other things in it that more the variance and the volatility is in the other line items.","Your question on stores, we are \u2013 again, I personally think the new devices, the ability to see new devices is a great asset, but I don't want to shortchange the rest of the bookstore and the ability to have curated selection and the creativity we've had in taking new look at the bookstores. So we are experimenting with different formats, and we look at different sizes and we look at revenue cost per square foot just like any other physical retailer. So, we haven't essentially nailed the model yet, and we continue to experiment to see what works and how it differs by city or more suburban locations.","Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.","So thank you, Brian, and thank you all for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website through at least the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking to you again next quarter."],"897":["Amazon.com, Inc.

(Operator Instructions) Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Sean Boyle. Please go ahead.Sean BoyleHello, and welcome to our Q2 2012 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 26, 2012, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you'll find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2011. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom.Tom SzkutakThanks, Sean. I will begin with comments on our second quarter financial results. Trailing 12 months operating cash flow was $3.22 billion compared with $3.2 billion. Trailing 12-months free cash flow decreased 40% to $1.1 billion. Return on invested capital was 11%, down from 21%. ROIC is trailing 12-months free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long term debt over five quarter ends.The combination of common stock, stock-based awards outstanding, was 468 million share compared with 468 million shares. Worldwide revenue grew 29% to $12.83 billion or 32% excluding the $272 million, unfavorable impact from the year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. We are grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers.Media revenue increased to $4.12 billion, up 13% or 15% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $8.16 billion, up 38% or 42% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 64% of worldwide sales, up from 59%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 43%. Active customer counts exceeded to 180 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units were 40% of paid units compared to 36% of paid units in Q2 of 2011.Now I will discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $9.49 billion, or 73.9% of revenue compared with 75.9%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined, was $2.99 billion or 23.3% of sales up approximately 307 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $1.3 billion or 10.1% of revenue compared with 9.2%. Tech and content was $970 million or 7.6% of revenue compared with 6.3%. Marketing was $521 million or 4.1% of revenue compared with 3.3%.Now I will talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America\u2019s segment, revenue grew 36% to $7.33 billion. Media revenue grew 18% to $1.87 billion, EGM revenue grew 41% to 4.94 billion representing 67% of North America revenues up from 65%. North America segment operating income increased 61% to $344 million a 4.7% operating margin.In the international segment, revenue grew 22% to 5.51 billion adjusting for the $269 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 28%. Media revenue grew 8% to 2.25 billion or 12% excluding foreign exchange. And EGM revenue grew 34% to 3.22 billion or 42% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 59% of international revenues up from 53%.International segment operating income decreased 91% to 16 million or 0.3% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, international segment operating income decreased 74%.Consolidated segment operating income decreased 7% to 360 million or 2.8% of revenue down approximately 109 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange CSOI decreased 4%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 47% to $107 million or 0.8% of net sales.Our income tax expense was $109 million a 75% effective tax rate for the quarter and includes a one-time expense of $51 million related to the integration of Kiva Systems acquisition. Accordingly, our Q2 2012 effective tax rate is higher than both our current estimated 2012 annual effective rate and our 2011 effective tax rate.GAAP net income was $7 million or $0.01 per diluted share compared with $191 million and $0.41 per diluted share. Q2 2012 net income includes $65 million of estimated loss related to the acquisition and integration of Kiva Systems.Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities decreased 1.39 billion year-over-year to 4.97 billion. Inventory increased 36% to 4.3 billion and inventory turns were 10.1 down from 11.3 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in stock levels and introduced new product categories.Accounts payable increased 24% to 7.07 billion and accounts payable days decreased to 68 from 69 in the prior year. Our Q2 2012 capital expenditures were $657 million, the increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth consisting of investments in technology infrastructure including Amazon web services and additional capacity to support our funding operations.I\u2019ll conclude my portion of today\u2019s call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we have seen to-date and what we believe today to be properly conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors including a high level of uncertainties surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies among such subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters, and changes to our effective tax rate can all have a material effect on guidance.Our guidance further assumes that we don\u2019t conclude any additional business acquisition, investments or settlement, record any further revision for stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently.For the Q3 2012 we expect net sales of between 12.9 and 14.3 billion or growth between 19 and 31%. This guidance anticipates approximately 425 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates.GAAP operating income or loss to be between 350 million loss and 50 million loss down from 79 million income in the comparable prior year period. This includes approximately $275 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.We anticipate consolidated segment operating income or loss which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expenses to be between $75 million loss and $225 million in income, or between a 129% decline and 14% decline. We expect capital expenditures including capitalized software development to be approximately $0.8 billion to $0.9 billion. These anticipated investments are driven primarily by our expectations of a continued business growth consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon web service and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.We remain heads on focused on driving better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholder. Thanks. With that, Sean, we will move to questions.Sean BoyleGreat. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.Question-and-Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from Spencer Wang with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.Spencer Wang - Cr\u00e9dit SuisseThanks, good afternoon. Just one question on Kiva and a couple of parts, Tom. Now that you have closed the acquisition, can you talk about how you will deploy the Kiva technology? Is that for new fulfillment centers only or can you use that in your legacy fulfillment centers and perhaps what type efficiencies that could gain. And then last part would be, is there any impact on your 3Q guidance from the Kiva acquisition specifically? Thanks.Tom SzkutakSure. In terms of Kiva itself, we are very very excited to have Kiva as part of the Amazon team. You know we are looking forward to getting great productivity over time through the use. But again it\u2019s very early and you\u2019ll just have to stay tuned in terms of the plan. In terms of the impact, you mentioned Q3. Let me just provide a little bit of data on both Q2 actuals and Q3. In terms GAAP operating income in Q2, it was negative $25 million. For Q3 it\u2019s approximately negative $35 million. And then on the net income for Q2, it was a loss of approximately $65 million. And so those are the numbers for Q2 and Q3. But again we are very very happy to have them part of them and that we look forward to working with them going forward.OperatorWe will go next to Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.Heather Bellini - Goldman SachsQuestion on the gross margin, continues to climb up, and I was wondering if you could give any commentary there around how agency versus wholesale and eBooks is contributing to that?Tom SzkutakYeah, the bigger issue is not that, it\u2019s related to overall 3P, a number of factors of different factors certainly driving the improvement in product gross margins that you are referring to. But as it relates to 3P, it\u2019s on the broader 3P. So if you take a look at from a units perspective, third party was 40% of our total units in Q2. That\u2019s up from 36%. So it\u2019s approximately 400 basis points increase as a percentage of total units which is certainly one of the factors that you are seeing there.OperatorWe will go next to Herman Leung with Susquehanna.Unidentified AnalystThis is [Deepak] sitting in for Herman. So the question I had was on the hardware business. So how important do you think is the hardware strategy to you for the digital content? Now given that Kindle Fire has been out there for a while, so could you discuss about the strategy on the business and how it\u2019s driving the digital content?Tom SzkutakSure. You know we are very excited about both the hardware and the content of the business. We think if you take a look at our devices, certainly it\u2019s very integrated, which is great for customers. So we think it\u2019s incredible experience. And so we have been very excited about the progress we have made so far from both a device and content standpoint. And we are super excited about the road map that we have. So again, that\u2019s again, very, very happy with what the team is doing there.OperatorAnd we will go next to Brian Nowak with Nomura Equity Research.Aram Rubinson - Nomura Equity ResearchThis is Aram Rubinson sitting in for Brian Nowak. I notice your shipping cost was lower as a percent of sales for the first time in nearly three years. The driver it looks like it's shipping cost per unit which fell about 10%. Can you talk about how much of that might be attributable to proximity of distribution centers to metro areas, lower fuel, more favorable carrier pricing etcetera, and whether or not you see anything on the horizon that would change that course.Tom SzkutakYes, we are seeing, there is a number of different factors, but certainly one of them is we are getting closer to customers and that\u2019s just with our wide [multitude of film] networks, so that\u2019s really having an impact on that. And again we have a lot of opportunities to improve that overtime, but again the team is making good progress and you are seeing that reflected in the results so far.OperatorWe will go next to Justin Post with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.Paul Bieber - Bank of America\/Merrill LynchThis is Paul Bieber for Justin. Just going back for the gross margin question, I was wondering if you could give us some color on the relative impact of few different things; category, maturity, advertising, 3P, and maybe digital content on gross margins, which ones are impacting gross margins more than others. And then just quick question on the taxes. What were the impact of sales tax in Texas and California beyond gross margins?Tom SzkutakIn terms of your question on gross margins, we are not breaking that up but certainly 3P is having the impact, mix of businesses having an impact. We continue to try to work with our partners to get even better prices on the goods that we provide for customers which is certainly impacting it. Mix of business things like [AWS] is certainly impacting that as well, given the growth rate there. So, again those are things that are impacting. In terms of sales taxes, any impact that we certainly would expect to see would be included in guidance that we are giving for Q3, but one thing to keep in mind as it relates to that is we right now approximately 50% of our business around the world, we either collect sales tax or value added tax. We have very good businesses in those jurisdictions and so [keep that in mind] you should think about any upcoming changes.OperatorWe will go next to Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.Kaizad Gotla - JPMorganThis is Kaizad Gotla in for Doug. Just a couple of questions, can you discuss the international media deceleration, it looks like it decelerated from 22 to 12% on an ex-FX basis. And then can you maybe just give us an update on the fulfillment center plans for the rest of the year. Thanks.Tom SzkutakI\u2019ll take international in total first and then, you know that the same is true for media, and really I\u2019ll even start with the total business. Total business grew 32%. One thing to keep this on currency basis, one thing to keep in mind is for both the total business international growth and international media, we had a very, very strong growth last year Q2. In fact our total growth rate last year was 51% for the total business and on a local currency basis that was 44% growth, that\u2019s the highest growth quarter we\u2019ve had in over 10 years. And so when you look at that, when you are comparing ourselves in Q2 this year, we had very good growth given that compare to last year, and that some of which we are seeing also in international media as you mentioned. So, international media was up 8%, on a local currency basis so it was up 12 and certainly it's a challenging compare.Also there were some things just with, as we some timely things as we launched with the unfortunate events in Japan last year, we certainly did have some releases that with scope of relating the quarter obviously didn\u2019t happened, they moved into Q2 just from a supply standpoint those are certainly impacting that region and some other things. So it\u2019s, again, think of it in terms of the comparison point for last year is probably the best thing to do.OperatorWe will go next to Mark Mahaney with Citi.Rohit Kulkarni - CitigroupThis is Rohit Kulkarni filling in for Mark. Couple of questions. Can you talk about, or disclose anything about mobile, how that\u2019s affecting your business. eBay talked about mobile affecting their growth rates quite materially, perhaps even by a few percentage points and accounting for almost 10% of their revenues maybe.And second is, can you talk about the broad philosophy of management about short-term profitability versus long-term growth. Probably this is the first time in a while that you have bracketed negative pro forma operating income in your guidance. How should we view your short-term investment or the short-term profitability outlook.Tom SzkutakSure. First in terms on mobile. Clearly, smartphones and tablets are a significant tailwind for our business. While we are not breaking out the numbers, it\u2019s a big tailwind on our business and it\u2019s going great. So we are seeing a very nice impact from that and again it\u2019s a tailwind that we expect that will continue. In terms of short term versus long-term, you know we are all about trying to make sure we do the right long-term things for both customers and shareowners. But more specifically around Q3, you know Q3 is similar to Q2 and other previous quarters and that we are investing certainly for the long term.Yet, on the flip side, keep in mind, as you look at Q3 specifically, we are getting ready for a most seasonal quarter and we expect, given the growth that we have had, we are seeing very strong growth so we are investing heavily to get ready for that. In terms of capacity for example, we have announced 18 new fulfillment centers so far this year. We have actually opened eight of those already this year, out of the 18. And we are looking at potentially opening even more than that. I am sorry, six opened so far this year, out of 18. So those are certainly something are impacting the cost so far and you will be seeing that heavier in Q3 as we get ready for the most seasonal quarter.OperatorWe will go next to Mark Miller with William Blair.Mark Miller - William BlairHi, I was hoping, you could share some perspective on your URL expansion strategy. I\u2019d like to know, I guess some sense for the growth you are seeing there and how material it is in your overall numbers. And should we expect to see further expansion in those sites.Tom SzkutakYeah. There\u2019s not a lot I can you know help you with there. We are certainly looking as you would expect us to do, ways to continue to grow and certainly that will be part of our strategy.OperatorWe will go next to Scott Tillman with Caris & Company.Scott Tillman - Caris & CompanyTom, I was just curious, we have had a few quarters where operating income has far surpassed the upper end of your guidance range and we had a quarter here you definitely seemed to weaken as the months went by. Just wondering what you think is causing that divergence between sort of expectation at the beginning of the quarter and how things are playing out. Then just as a quick follow up to one of the other questions. You are looking at the fulfillment center network, just wondering if you are satisfied with the fee increases that were put in place in February that that business is now matching the margin for the rest of the business.Tom SzkutakI am sorry, could you elaborate on the months going by, I wasn\u2019t following your question.Scott Tillman - Caris & CompanyOn operating income, we have had a couple of -- a few quarters here where the numbers have come in far better than guidance. And we actually had a situation where Europe actually got worst as the quarter went on. So wondering what is driving that out performance.Tom SzkutakGot it. You know we, certainly as you look at, I will talk to Q2 since it\u2019s the most recent quarter, but we had a lot of strength across many different areas. One of the ones I mentioned that certainly helped our operating profit as well as our gross margin with the third party business continued to be very very strong. And certainly that was a factor. Again, there was a number of factors. One thing too, you do see some timing differences to some extent between Q2 and Q3 in terms of our prep for Q4, you see that knowing our operating results, but you see that in our CapEx. In the last 90 days ago we said that we would spend approximately 800 to $900 million of CapEx for Q2, we spent little less than 700. You see that number for Q3 being 8 to 900 as well. It's 900 million. So, again those are things that you are seeing just a little bit of a shift between Q2 and Q3 there.OperatorWe will go next to Ron Josey with ThinkEquity.Ron Josey - ThinkEquityI wanted to ask you a quick on 3P and given it's around 40% of sale this year, item sold. What point you believe the customer experience on Amazon is at risk given the rise of third-party sales. And any insight in terms of adoption on FBA by third parties would be very helpful. And then one quick follow-up just on your comments on CapEx, I think you said, it came in lower in 2Q, guidance is for another 8 to 900 million, is that guidance sort of consistent maybe going out, going forward or is this sort of one-time build around technology. Thank you.Tom SzkutakIn terms of the third party units, certainly FBA is having an impact on that, that\u2019s one of the drivers, certainly that\u2019s helping us have that percentage of total units go up. And we have looked at and we have been working very hard over a number of years on improving the experience for both customers and for sellers and FBA is an example of that. And what ends up happening is FBA sellers wants their part of the program, those units that FBA and our fulfillment network are eligible for all of our programs including free super saver shipping, prime. So, again those are great, certainly that\u2019s a great program for our customers, it's great program for seller and it's great program for investors.And I don\u2019t of it as a bad thing at all, I think of it as a good thing. We have a lot of retail units that we send directly to customers, we are offering a great experience on third party units which includes FBA and a number of other programs that we have. So, again we will continue to try to make that even better for customers overtime, but it's working very well, and again those are the benefit of having third parties on a platform is we get to [equate] some new selection. We also have competing offers directly on our detail pages, so when customers come they get to choose in terms of who they want to purchase from. So, it's a competitive environment on our platform. So, we think that\u2019s great for customers and for us.OperatorWe will go next to So Young Lee with SunTrust.So Young Lee - SunTrust Robinson HumphreyI was just curious about LivingSocial, it seem to be a bigger loss unusual, can you give us some color on what happened perhaps. And secondly, can you talk about the kind of traction you are getting with LOVEFiLM given all of the exclusive content you are getting there.Tom SzkutakLOVEFiLM business is doing very well. It's growing nicely as you mentioned we continue to add content there, and we plan on having more content there overtime. I\u2019m very excited to have that business at part of Amazon and the team is doing great. In terms of LivingSocial there is a not a lot, I can add to it other than what we have disclosed.OperatorWe will go next to Ken Sena with Evercore Partners.Andrew McNellis - Evercore PartnersThis is Andrew McNellis in for Ken. Somewhat related to other questions that have been asked, could you provide any update to your same day shipping efforts and how that relates to sales tax and performance in your investment?Tom SzkutakIn terms of delivery speed to customers, we are certainly trying to get geographically, always trying to get closer to customers, that\u2019s something that\u2019s not new, it's something we have been doing for some time. But in terms of same day, we don\u2019t really see a way to do same day delivery on a broad scale economically. But again we will continue to work on behalf of customers to try to figure out a way to serve them even better by getting product faster but in terms of same day, we don\u2019t see a way to do that on a broad scale economically.OperatorWe will go next to Anthony Diclemente with Barclays.Perry Gold - Barclays CapitalThis is Perry Gold on for Anthony. Can you please touch on the online sales tax issue and how it could affect your build out strategy for fulfillment centers?Tom SzkutakYou know as I mentioned earlier, we have -- we do collect in several states within the U.S. We do collect in a number of geographies that have an equivalent value added tax, approximately half for our business. We actually sales tax, the value added tax. We do very good business in those geographies. Those geographies reflected, for the most part, if you go back on the last several years, most of them have been included. We have also certainly added some new geographies or new jurisdictions that we clocked during that time period. But you see that we have seen very very strong growth even while collecting. So we are very supportive of collecting. We think the best way to do that is through a federal solution and we keep working with Congress and others to try to get that passed.OperatorWe will go next to Kerry Rice with Needham & Company.Kerry Rice - Needham & CompanyKind of sales tax issue again. Amazon signed a lot of bilateral agreements with several states on the collection of sales tax. And I know there is a federal effort also going on. Can you talk about if a federal sales tax is passed, how does that impact your bilateral agreements with the states. Does that supersede it or does that kind of have to continue to go on with those particular states and build those fulfillment centers and things in those states that you have agreed to.Tom SzkutakThere is not a lot I can add to that. So I can't be that helpful with your question, I apologize. But again, you are right, we do support federal legislation, we are working very hard at that. One thing to keep In mind to, we price our products irrespective of what sales tax is, that\u2019s a customer obligation and so we are pricing products very well. And so that\u2019s not something that we just started doing, that\u2019s something that we have been doing for a long time. And that\u2019s why we have a good business in those geographies and jurisdictions where we do collect. And because customers are coming to us because they want to have value which we offer irrespective of tax, there has been a number of different third parties that have certainly reported on that. They come because they want great convenience, they want obviously great service, and those are things we are focused and those are the things that we believe customers will still want over the long-term and that\u2019s why are focused on those areas.OperatorWe will go next to Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities.Matt Nemer - Wells Fargo SecuritiesThe international segment operating income has been under a lot of pressure. Is that primarily related to existing markets, growth in new markets? And would that be on the merchandize margin side of the P&L or is it more of an operating cost issue.Tom SzkutakKeep in mind with international, it\u2019s a mix of geographies and we are -- certainly there are some that we are investing in. We mentioned certainly in other calls, China is an area that is growing very fast but we are certainly in investment mode there. In recent years, we have launched Italy and Spain. We are certainly investing in those geographies and like what we see there. Those are certainly impacting. We are also adding a lot of fulfillment capacity. And so those are the things that are certainly impacting those numbers.OperatorWe will take our last question from Atul Bagga with Lazard Capital.Atul Bagga - Lazard CapitalI have two questions. One on guidance and the other one prime members. Can you give us some color on guidance, what you are baking for growth in international versus domestic? And guidance implies there is some compression in margin. Is it again mostly the function of the sales mix or is something else going on there. And then a second on prime members. Can you remind us the profitability of prime members versus non-prime member and in the longer-term where do you think the penetration of prime members within your overall base?Tom SzkutakIn terms of revenue, we don\u2019t break out the segments in terms of the split. But if you take a look at our guidance, it\u2019s to grow between 19% and 31%. And if you look at the impact of exchange, it\u2019s a little over 400 basis points and so rounded it's just under 36% on the high end and 23% on the low end. And so that\u2019s the range of guidance and so we are certainly pleased with what we saw in Q2 and certainly giving as we have in past quarters a wide range for Q3. In terms of the bottom line, in terms of operating income and CSOI guidance that we have given, as I mentioned earlier, certainly a number of different factors like the last several quarters, as we have been talking about we are certainly investing a lot in the business, but one thing to keep in mind is for the guidance in upcoming quarter to Q3. And we are certainly getting ready given the growth rates we had for our most seasonal quarter, that\u2019s certainly impacting the bottom line in terms of our guidance and as I mentioned earlier we opened a lot of performance centers, adding a lot of capacity for both our web service businesses as well as infrastructure support. Our retail business, so again we are investing across the business which is like all the periods, but again we are getting ready for Q4.OperatorThat will conclude our question-and-answer session. I\u2019ll turn it back over to our speaker\u2019s for any additional or closing remarks.Tom SzkutakThank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.OperatorThat does conclude today\u2019s conference.

Good day everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com Q3 2014 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded.","For opening remarks, I'll be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Phil Hardin. Please go ahead.","Phil Hardin","Hello, and welcome to our Q3 2014 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.","The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, October 23, 2014 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.","During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.","Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2013.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Szkutak","Thanks, Phil.","I'll begin with comments on our third quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 15% to $5.71 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $1.08 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.63 billion.","The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operation.","Return on invested capital was 6%, up from 3%. ROIC is trailing 12-month free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter-ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 481 million shares compared with 475 million one year ago.","Worldwide revenue grew 20% to $20.58 billion or 20% excluding the $13 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange.","Media revenue increased to $5.24 billion, up 4% or 4% excluding exchange. EGM revenue increased to $13.95 billion, up 26% or 26% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 68% of worldwide sales, up from 65%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 21%. Active customer accounts was approximately 260 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 42% of paid units.","Now I'll discuss our operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $14.63 billion or 71.1% of revenue compared with 72.3%. Fulfillment, marketing, tech and content and G&A combined was $6.09 billion or 29.6% of sales, up approximately 350 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $2.55 billion or 12.4% of revenue compared with 11.5%. Tech and content was $2.22 billion or 10.8% of revenue compared with 9.2%. Marketing was $961 million or 4.7% of revenue compared with 3.9%.","Now I'll talk about our segment results. And consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item.","In the North America segment, revenue grew 25% to $12.87 billion. Media revenue grew 5% to $2.73 billion. EGM revenue grew 31% to $8.79 billion, representing 68% of North America revenues, up from 65%. Other revenue grew 40% to $1.34 billion. North America segment operating income decreased 70% to $88 million, a 0.7% operating margin.","In the international segment, revenue grew 14% to $7.71 billion. Excluding the $21 million year-over-year favorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 13%.","Media revenue grew 4% to $2.51 billion or 3% excluding foreign exchange and EGM revenue grew 20% to $5.16 billion or 19% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 67% of international revenues, up from 64%. International segment operating loss was $224 million compared to international segment operating loss of $28 million in the prior period.","Consolidated segment operating loss was $136 million compared to consolidated segment operating income of $267 million in the prior period. Consolidated segment operating loss includes charges of approximately $170 million, primarily related to the Fire phone inventory evaluation and supplier commitment cost.","Unlike CSOI, GAAP operating income or loss includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating loss was $544 million compared to operating loss of $25 million in the prior period.","Our income tax benefit was $205 million, GAAP net loss was $437 million or $0.95 per diluted share compared with a net loss of $41 million and $0.09 per diluted share.","Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities decreased $806 million year-over-year to $6.88 billion. Inventory increased 21% to $7.32 billion and inventory turns were 8.9, down from 9.2 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 18% to $11.81 billion and accounts payable days decreased to 74 from 75 in the prior year.","I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions.","Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.","As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance.","Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlement, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they\u2019ve been recently.","For Q4 2014, we expect net sales of between $27.3 billion and $30.3 billion or growth between 7% and 18%. This guidance anticipates approximately 250 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income or loss to be between $570 million loss and $430 million income compared to $510 million of income in the fourth quarter of 2013. This includes approximately $470 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.","We anticipate consolidated segment operating income or loss, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense to be between $100 million loss and $900 million in income compared to $876 million in income in the fourth quarter of 2013.","We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareowners.","Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move to questions.","Phil Hardin","Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call.","Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Thank you. Our first question comes from analyst Brian Pitz with Jefferies and Company.","Brian Pitz - Jefferies","Great thanks. Two quick questions. Can you provide any color on the consumer over this year's back-to-school season and how do you view the outlook for the consumer as we head into the holidays?","And then separately you recently closed the acquisition of Twitch last month. Can you help us understand where does Twitch fit into your overall digital content strategy? Thanks.","Tom Szkutak","Sure, in terms of back-to-school, certainly the results are reflected in the Q3 results that you see today. There's a number of different impacts back-to-school has.","One thing I would like to call out, as you look at our North American media growth rates one thing that we are seeing is certainly a shift from a text book standpoint from purchase to rental and so we see a lot more customers renting. So you see that impacting the growth rate a bit the North American media.","But in terms of Q4 as in any Q4, when we look at it, there is a wide range of outcomes. We're giving a wide range of guidance. What we feel good about is we have a team that's been improving customer experience over the past twelve months.","We're very excited to serve customers. We've had a lot of unique selection. We've got inventory closer to the customers. Many, many different things that we're doing on behalf of customers. So we are very excited about the holiday season and look forward to serving customers.","In terms of Twitch, we're very excited to have Twitch as part of our overall team. We've been in video games for quite some time and we think that it's a very creative team.","They're doing some very innovative things on behalf of their customers and our customers and so we're excited to have them, be part of Amazon and look forward to working together with that team.","Brian Pitz - Jefferies","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Carlos Kirjner analyst with Bernstein.","Carlos Kirjner - Bernstein","Thank you for taking my question. Two if I may. International CSOI margin this quarter were the lowest they have been in years, maybe ever, I don\u2019t know. We know you have been investing internationally but has something changed fundamentally and if yes, what?","Secondly, I wanted to ask you about vast difference in revenue growth rate between your international and domestic business. What is fundamentally different between the U.S. and your main international markets and is this difference fundamental or temporary? Thank you.","Tom Szkutak","Thank you. Thanks for the question. In terms of the consolidated segment or the segment operating income, excuse me, for international, certainly versus what you'd have seen last quarter some notable changes, one is we're certainly getting ready for the holiday season, so as to get ready for the holiday season.","We are expanding from a capacity standpoint. We do see -- we've gotten great penetration and Fulfilled by Amazon customers. So you'll see that actually our growth rate -- unit growth rate is actually higher than our revenue growth rate and so that's what we've been experiencing so certainly adding capacity from a fulfillment perspective, adding capacity from a infrastructure standpoint. If you look at our overall operating expenses, we are certainly investing and with the slower growth rate you're not seeing as -- certainly not seeing as much leverage. We understand that we do have to get leverage over time, but we are investing right now. We're also investing in newer emerging geographies including India and Italy and Spain and continue to invest in China. ","And then one other call out, we -- mentioned in my opening remarks there was approximately $170 million impact related to inventory evaluation and supplier commitment costs, a vast majority of that was in North America, but there was about $25 million in international just to let you know that that's there.","In terms of the growth rate, it has been softer across a number of geographies. If you look back over the past really four quarters, we've seen a little bit of volatility between the quarters, but it's been softer.","We continue to focus on the inputs and we still think international is a very big opportunity for us in terms of growth. More recently if you look at the growth rate for Q3 and you see the 13% excluding foreign exchange, you may remember on the last call about 90 days ago, I talked about Q2 what had happened was we had seen -- in late Q1 we had seen a ramp up in Japan before the consumption tax increase happened on April 1.","We saw a pretty sizable drop off in Japan growth rates from Q1 to Q2, which brought that down. The only update again is the number of different puts and takes by geographies, but the only other comment I would say is that we really haven\u2019t seen Japan growth rates improving since Q2. So that's something that's there.","But in terms of the fundamentals, long term we're very excited about international as well as North America. We think it's a big opportunity. We continue to focus on the inputs. Some of those inputs are certainly on the media side working on the conversion from physical media to digital media.","We continue to work on that in a number of different ways. We continue to add new selection in those geographies and work on the retail basics and so again we're very excited about the opportunity.","Carlos Kirjner - Bernstein","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next call will come from analyst Scott Devitt with Stifel.","Scott Devitt - Stifel Nicolaus","Hey Tom, thanks. I had a question just broadly. A lot of the capital that's been deployed in terms of planting seeds and new businesses have worked out very well, but given what's happening right now in terms of the deterioration in the margin structure as growth is slowing, I am just wondering and I think a lot of investors have this question as well and in terms of when things don't go as anticipated in some of the bigger projects where there is not a revenue stream like areas maybe like some of the hardware projects and China and other markets, what's the process for determining whether to plough ahead or turn back capital and redeploy in another areas. Thanks.","Tom Szkutak","Thanks for the question Scott. With anything new that we do and obviously we've done -- as you mentioned we've done a lot of new things. There is certainly a wide range of outcome and we certainly understand that. We try to learn from everything that we do as we launch new opportunities and so that's something across things that go great and things that don't go as well as others. We try to learn from that.","And so the way I will describe it is from a looking forward standpoint we still think that we have a lot of opportunities. That said, we need to be very selective about what opportunities we pursue and so that's again the way we're thinking about it and probably not much more I can add to it than that.","Scott Devitt - Stifel Nicolaus","Okay. Thank you.","Tom Szkutak","Sure.","Operator","And we'll continue on to analyst Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.","Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets","Two questions please. That $170 million in charges related to the Fire phone, where was that put in the P&L and which are the OpEx lines or was it a COGS?","And then secondly on the media side, you talked about maybe seeing a negative impact or definitely seeing a negative impact from the switch towards owning to renting. Do you think that's a broader trend beyond just text books that affects all media retailers including Amazon? Could that have been -- could that be one of the issues behind the slow media growth in international markets and if so, is there really a solution to that other than your own rental -- your own rental models? Thank you.","Tom Szkutak","Sure. In terms of the first question, the $170 million, it's predominately in COGS and so it's the very vast majority than COGS and then in terms of the split about 25 million is in international and the remainder is in North America.","In terms of the growth, we certainly are seeing that in text books. We do see another - digital media, we're certainly seeing rentals being part for our portfolio more than we had probably during - certainly with physical, but in terms of some of the recent growth rates, the one that I called out related to book rentals are certainly impacting North American media.","One of the other things that\u2019s certainly impacting it too is we did had some things last year Q3 that were overlapping, that were positive in Q3 last year from a demand standpoint. One was certainly in physical books we had very heavy discounting, which helped our growth in Q3 last year. We're overlapping that in Q3 this year.","Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks Tom.","Tom Szkutak","Thanks Mark.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now go to analyst Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research.","Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research","Hey there and thanks for taking my question. Hoping we can go back to square one here if you don't mind, can you tell us or remind us what financial measures are important to you guys and which financial measures do you hold yourselves and the Board hold you accountable to because it's a little hard to see any of them making positive progress, so I just would love to get back to basics?","Tom Szkutak","Sure, we're looking at a number of different metrics over a long period of time and certainly where our goal is to maximize free cash flow over the long term, we don't focus on individual margins, but we do focus on the inputs that are going to help drive free cash flow and operating income.","We certainly will look at making sure that we're using our capital wisely so that over time we get good returns on invested capital and we certainly have been in several years now of what I would call an investment mode and because of the opportunities that we had in front of us.","And as I mentioned earlier there is still lots of opportunity in front of us and -- but we know that we have to be very selective about which opportunities we pursue and -- but we're encouraged by the opportunities that we have.","Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research","So cash flow and return on invested capital is where we should keep our attention.","Tom Szkutak","Yes.","Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research","Okay. And are the employees in the recruiting side, is that becoming more difficult as the stocks has [faded] [ph] a little bit and those return characteristics have [faded] [ph], how are you making sure that you're hiring the best people?","Tom Szkutak","We have -- we have processes in place to make sure that we have a very high bar on the hiring that we do, the people that we're hiring are extraordinarily talented. We're very fortunate to get to work with so many talented people here and we've been fortunate to be able to grow that employment base to work on the opportunities that we have.","Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research","Thank you.","Tom Szkutak","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go to analyst Colin Gillis with BGC Financial.","Colin Gillis - BGC Financial","Great. Thanks for taking my question. So just to get back to that North American media sales, what's the lowest growth rate in over 20 years -- are there \u2013 or 20 quarters, are there other factors beyond the text book shifts and sort of the Q3 strength last year? Are the digital media trends still intact?","Tom Szkutak","In terms of the principal drivers -- it's the two that I mentioned. So it's the text books rentals and also overlapping some of the strong discounting and strong titles that we had in some categories. So it's across a number of categories within media, but those are the two principle drivers.","Colin Gillis - BGC Financial","And you don't see this as a broader shift in that number?","Tom Szkutak","No, we're -- there's still both in terms of North America and international, there is certainly a shift that's going on from physical to digital and that's something that we're spending a lot of time on and trying to improve the experience for customers and we've been able to do that certainly over a period of time and so it's something we'll continue to work on.","Colin Gillis - BGC Financial","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Tom Szkutak","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll continue on to analyst Ron Josey with JMP Securities.","Ron Josey - JMP Securities","Great. Thanks for taking the question. Two please. If you could update us on this rotation center rollout, are all 15 online, and I would love to know maybe how they\u2019ve helped bridge the last mile and improve overall speed delivery.","And then the second question, sort of switching gears and just focusing on advertising, I believe a pilot was launched or beta was launched for Amazon's ad network called CPM Ads I think maybe last August. I am wondering if you can provide some commentary there. Thank you.","Tom Szkutak","Sure, in terms of the sort centers, we'll have over 15 sort centers in the U.S. by the end of the year. It's certainly helping us a lot. We have same day delivery in 12 cities. We'll have Sunday delivery in approximately 50% of the population and so we're pleased to do that.","And in terms of the ad network, there is a not a lot I can say there.","Ron Josey - JMP Securities","Okay. Thank you very much.","Tom Szkutak","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from analyst Aaron Kessler with Raymond James.","Aaron Kessler - Raymond James","Great. Thanks for taking my question. Can you just give us an update maybe on your views on original programming? It looked like Transparents had some good success. Also just from an international standpoint your views or may be the growth in China, India as well, are you seeing any -- signs of any increasing competition in the international, your key international markets today? Thank you.","Tom Szkutak","Sure. In terms of our original content, we're excited about it. We're investing as we talked about. Last quarter we spent approximately $100 million in the quarter. Keep in mind that that's expensed in the quarter and so that's included in the results that you see in Q3.","We're very excited about it. We have a number of pilots as well as a number of series launched. Transparent you mentioned is one of them. It's gotten very good reviews. The streaming on that series has been great. So we're very excited about it and we think it's an interesting area for customers.","We continue to invest heavily in video content including originals and there is a number of different metrics we're looking at certainly from a prime standpoint, but what we're seeing so far are those customers who are streaming are renewing at considerably higher rates at considerably higher rates at a rate that's already high.","So we like what we see there. When customers come in for new trials and they -- free trials and they engage from a video content standpoint, we see the conversion being higher. So we see that we're adding new prime members as a result of that and when those prime members, when those new prime members become prime members, the other thing we're seeing is they're buying physical product, which is a great impact for us.","We see very similar patterns in terms of how much physical product that they're purchasing from us and so we're still certainly in investment mode there, but we like what we see and we have a long way to go there, but we're concentrating on building great service and we see that customers are rewarding us with engagement on the content, both original and licensed and they're buying more from us on the physical side and becoming prime members when they do and have been doing at higher rates.","So those are the some of the early signs and we will continue to monitor very closely, but we're excited about what we're seeing there.","In terms of some of the international comments and I would say this for not just international, but I would say it for the U.S. as well, one thing that's not new is it's a very competitive environment. We have a lot of competitors both online and offline. That's not anything that's new. We used to operate in that environment.","We've been in that environment for really for 19 years and so -- but we're seeing a lot of competition and again that's not new.","Aaron Kessler - Raymond James","Great. Thank you.","Tom Szkutak","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our nest question will come from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.","Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs","Great. Thanks. Last quarter you mentioned that the AWS business saw a 90% increase in volume. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of what you\u2019ve seen so far this quarter.","And then in the highlight section of the release, the first six bullet points or so that you have there are all related to the hardware side of the business. if you can just sort of give us now that you have a little bit more time on the hardware side of the business, but behind if you can give us a sense of what you're learning in this category and where you think Amazon's long term position in hardware is ultimately going to be.","Tom Szkutak","In terms of AWS, we're -- we saw a very good growth in Q3 as well. From a usage standpoint it's very similar to Q2, close to 90% and so the team is doing just a fantastic job.","You can see our other revenue in North America went up a little bit sequentially and AWS is certainly the largest piece of that and is the vast majority of it and they're growing at a faster rate than that other line item.","So again the team is doing a fantastic job and not only serving customers, but launching many, many new features and services and you can see some of the detail on that in the Highlight section of our release today. So we're very excited about it.","In terms of devices, I can't speculate what we would do going forward, but we just launched a number of new tablets and e-readers that were excited about and there is some really great price point for customers on the tablet side.","We also launched a kid's tablet which is the first time we've launched. We've launched some new kindles including our premium kindle and it's a terrific product. We think it's the best kindle we've made to date for sure and so we're very excited about that. And we're excited to have these offerings for customers.","Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll continue on to analyst Ben Schachter with Macquarie Equities Research.","Ben Schachter - Macquarie","Hi Tom. You mentioned that you need to get leverage at some point. In the last call you also said something similar, but can you help us quantify the timing that in your internal modeling when do you expect to see more meaningful leverage and when you look at your three to five year's outlook, what does your leverage picture look like there and then also can you remind us of what your philosophy of stock buybacks is and what would it take to get you back in the market, thanks?","Tom Szkutak","In terms of leverage, beyond the guidance that we're giving today, there is not a lot of certainly I can give you, but again what I had mentioned earlier is we do have a lot of opportunities, but our job is to be judicious and selective about what opportunities we pursue.","And so that's the way we're thinking about it and I apologize I can't give you any more certainty in terms of timing, but certainly that's the way we're thinking about it.","And in terms of buybacks, we haven\u2019t opened buybacks right now. We have authorization to do that. I certainly can't comment on what price points we would or wouldn\u2019t do there.","Operator","Thank you. We'll continue on to analyst Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.","Justin Post - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you. If you look at the phone impact in Q3, it seems to explain some of the difference versus the Street, but when you look forward to Q4, it looks like you\u2019re guiding to about 15% to 16% growth ex FX and again profits maybe below some expectations.","Is the phone having an impact on profits in Q4 as well? And also when you think about the Q4 guidance are there any events or things you want to call out? Are you being especially conservative in Q4 giving recent trends? Anything different this year on holiday? Thank you.","Tom Szkutak","Yes. In terms of the holiday season just and if you look back the last several years, I've been giving wide ranges because it\u2019s again a more seasonal quarter, always challenging to predict precisely where we're going to be. So in terms of a dollar range I gave us $3 billion range last year.","I am giving a $3 billion range again this year from a revenue perspective again wide range. At the higher end of the range, excluding foreign exchange, it's approximately 21%. So it's a little bit higher than what we saw in Q3 and then you can see we're on the low end of the range.","In terms of -- but in terms of the season itself, we're very excited about it. And in terms of to serve customers, we feel great about the selection that we have added and are continuing to add for the holiday season.","We think from an operations standpoint each year we try to get better and we believe we'll be even better this year than we have had in previous years. And so we are super excited to serve customers.","In terms of the phone, the only other thing that I can comment on is at the end of Q3, we had approximately $83 million worth of inventory on hand. And so I can't comment on how that would impact guidance or not, but that's the amount of inventory we had on hand at the end of Q3.","Justin Post - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Tom Szkutak","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next analyst will be John Blackledge with Cowen & Company.","John Blackledge - Cowen & Company","Great. Thanks. Just a couple of questions. We saw that Amazon Fresh expanded into Brooklyn recently. Just wondering if we can discuss your decision to expand into New York City and how we should think about timings for expansion into other markets and then if you can update us on the number of fulfillment centers globally and in the year that would be great. Thank you.","Tom Szkutak","Sure, in terms of the number of fulfillment centers it's 13 net for the year and then on as I mentioned earlier in the U.S. we'll have 15 sort centers by the end of more than 14, excuse me, more than 15 sort centers by the end of the year.","In terms of, sorry the other part of the question was on Fresh, the team is doing a great job from a customer experience standpoint. As you can see we're in a few cities. Today, the team is just heads down focused on making sure that experience is great for customers. We continue -- customers like the service.","So we're seeing good pick up there and as you mentioned, we're expanding in the Brooklyn. I can't speculate on what we do beyond the cities that we have launched today, but we're excited about what we're seeing so far there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from analyst Eric Sheridan with UBS.","Eric Sheridan - UBS","Thanks for taking the question. Tom you guys put thorough a price increase on the prime services here. Was curious what you were seeing in terms of the impact of that price increase on both the rate of adding people into Prime and the ability to control churn inside the Prime subscription base in general.","And as you add additional functionality and layers into Prime like you\u2019ve done this year through the investments, whether you\u2019ve thought about maybe put in another price increase through next year. Thanks.","Tom Szkutak","In terms of what we do going forward it certainly wouldn\u2019t speculate. We had a price point since our initiation of, excuse me, since the launch of Prime. Its $79 and so it took us long time and we were very careful with that to increase it to $99.","But since we've increased to $99 we've had -- we've had great retention. We're very pleased with the -- the retention we've had from customers. The program is growing very fast. We're very excited about it and so we do think it's really good for customers and it\u2019s really good for us and shareowners over the long term.","You're correct in that we're investing in Prime in a number of different ways including video content as I talked about earlier that is certainly the way we'll get a return on that investment. Principally will be customers buying more including and especially physical products.","So again we're very excited about Prime globally.","Operator","Thank you. Our next analyst will be Brian Nowak with SIG.","Brian Nowak - SIG","Thanks for taking my questions. I have two please. The first one, fulfillment ex stock based comp was the highest it's ever been as a percentage of gross profit in the third quarter, can you just talk about the drivers of that? Is that for rotations centers or international growth, what's driving that?","And then as we think about this rotation centers, what's the impact of those over the next few quarters to fulfillment? Are they do they take a while to kind of get the inefficiencies out of the system like a standard DC would?","Tom Szkutak","Yes, in terms of fulfillment cost, you're right. Again we're adding 13 net fulfillment centers where we added -- we'll have over 15 sort centers at the end of the year. certainly one of the drivers for that is certainly the growth that we are experiencing, but in addition to that, what we're seeing is the FBA adoption continues to get better and if we get further penetrated with sellers adopting full by Amazon, we think that's really good for sellers and for us and for customers over the long term.","And what you're seeing is we're several years ago in terms of performance center planning we were adding less of them and it was much closer to the holiday season. With the sheer amount of capacity that we're adding, you're seeing more of that come in even before Q4.","So you're seeing that impacting us earlier and the benefit of coming in earlier is we get to serve customer and get up to the productivity rates that we want to, to serve customers in Q4, by having that capacity in a bit earlier than in the past.","So you\u2019ve seen that trend happen over the past few years with that coming in earlier than certainly historically we've been able to do.","Brian Nowak - SIG","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next analyst will be Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo.","Matt Nemer - Wells Fargo","Thanks so much for taking my questions. First Prime launched a referral fee recently and I am wondering if we should take that as any indication that the membership growth has slowed or you're seeing some higher churn and how does that referral fee get accounted for.","And then secondly, Target launched free shipping with no hurdle for the holidays versus your $35 hurdle, I am just wondering what your willingness is to leave that competitive gap during the holidays, thanks.","Tom Szkutak","Yes, can't comment from a competitive standpoint what we might or might do there, but in terms of the Prime referral fee, no, you should not read into that that Prime isn\u2019t growing well and in fact just the opposite.","We\u2019re seeing great growth and we like the fact that enabling customers because they like Prime to be able to refer others we think is great for us and so I can't actually maybe offline you can follow-up with Phil or Dave on the accounting. Top of my head, I can't remember how that's working, but I know they will be able to answer it for you.","Matt Nemer - Wells Fargo","Okay. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, our final question will come from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird.","Colin Sebastian - Robert W. Baird","Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. A couple of follow-ups. First off in terms of the Q4 revenue guide, are you giving any consideration to that forecast to some of the shipping issues that happened last holiday and the ability of your shipping partners to manage your growth.","And then secondly on paid units, can you provide a splits or color between physical and digital unit growth. Thanks.","Tom Szkutak","In terms of -- in terms of the guidance it reflects all of the assumptions that we think could happen for the quarter. So again it's a wide range to speak specifically to some of the issues last year. The team again -- we continue trying to learn from everything that we do and the team has done a great job learning from our experiences, coming out of Q4 last year as we do every year and are excited to serve customers.","In terms of the unit growth, there is not I can add in terms of split other than the overall -- other than the overall growth rate, but we are -- we are pleased with certainly we're seeing good customer growth, sellers are -- we're doing we think a great job for sellers. We continue to add a lot of unique selection throughout the year in terms of and we have customers.","We see FBA four sellers getting further, further penetrated. We've launched some interest in products for our customers. We think our web services team is doing a great job.","We realize that we have a lot of opportunities, but we need to be selective on which opportunities we pursue and I think beyond that, we're just overall excited and again ready for the holiday season.","So anyway thanks everybody for calling in today.","Phil Hardin","Thank you for joining us today on the call and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.","Operator","And again, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you all again for your participation. You may now disconnect."]}}
