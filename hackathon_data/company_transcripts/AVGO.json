Welcome to Broadcom Limited's first quarter fiscal year 2016 financial results conference call.","At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Ashish Saran, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Ashish Saran - Head-Investor Relations","Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me are Hock Tan, President and CEO, and Tony Maslowski, Chief Financial Officer of Broadcom Limited.","After the market closed today, Broadcom distributed a press release and financial tables describing our financial performance for the first quarter of fiscal year 2016. If you did not receive a copy, you may obtain the information from the Investors section of Broadcom's website at www.broadcom.com. This conference call is being webcast live, and a recording will be available via telephone playback for one week. It will also be archived in the Investors section of our website at broadcom.com.","As you are all aware, Broadcom Limited is the successor to Avago Technologies Limited. Following Avago's acquisition of Broadcom Corporation on February 1, 2016, the first day in our second fiscal quarter, Broadcom Limited became the ultimate parent company of Avago Technologies and Broadcom Corporation.","During the prepared comments section of this call, Hock and Tony will be providing details of our first quarter fiscal year 2016 results, which relate to our predecessor, Avago, only. They will then move on to providing background to our second quarter fiscal year 2016 outlook, which will relate to the combined company. We will take questions after the end of our prepared comments.","In addition to U.S. GAAP reporting, Broadcom reports certain financial measures on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the tables attached to today's press release. Comments made during today's call will primarily refer to our non-GAAP financial results. Please refer to our press release today and our recent filings with the SEC for information on the specific risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Hock Tan. Hock?","Hock E. Tan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Ashish. Good afternoon, everyone.","As Ashish mentioned, my comments on first quarter results relate only to classic Avago, while comments for the second fiscal quarter relate to the combined company, Broadcom Limited. Now the combination of classic Avago and classic Broadcom has produced a new, larger, and more diversified company. I'm very pleased to welcome classic Broadcom employees to the new company. They are truly a very talented group of people who bring a great deal of unique engineering expertise.","Talking of which, we are making very good progress on the integration front, have started to realize acquisition-related cost synergies, although we are only at the beginning of this exercise. We have also just started the process of pruning some non-core classic Broadcom product lines. Accordingly, my comments for the second quarter focus only on continuing operations, which do not include these non-core product lines, classified as discontinued operations.","From a segment point of view, we will continue to report results broken out by our four end markets, namely: wired, wireless, enterprise storage, and industrial. However, starting with our second fiscal quarter, the components of revenue will increase significantly for our wired and wireless segments as a result of the Broadcom acquisition. And I will provide additional color on these changes in my end market discussion. Our enterprise storage and industrial segments will remain unchanged from classic Avago.","Let me start with a short summary of first quarter fiscal 2016 results, which only refer to classic Avago. Revenue for our first quarter came in at $1.78 billion, a 4% sequential decline and in line with our guidance. Our tight control over operating expenses during the quarter helped keep Q1 operating margins flat sequentially at a robust 44% of revenue, despite the sequential decline in revenue. Earnings per share came in at $2.41, better than the midpoint of guidance.","Moving on to our expectations for the second quarter, which now include revenue contributions from classic Broadcom, we expect consolidated revenues to approximately double to $3.55 billion. We currently anticipate this quarter's revenue level to be the trough for the rest of the fiscal year.","So with this, let me now turn to a discussion by segment of our Q1 results as well as our outlook in Q2. Starting with wired, in the first quarter wired revenue grew by 2% sequentially, and the wired segment represented 22% of our total revenue. Growth in the quarter was driven by broad strength in our fiber-optic business, largely offset by a decline in our ASIC products, reflecting weakness in data center switching. However, starting with second fiscal quarter, in addition to classic Avago's custom networking, ASICs, and fiber-optic products, the consolidation of classic Broadcom will add Ethernet switching and routing, standard products, physical layer [PHY] copper, and optical standard products to this segment. In addition, it will also include classic Broadcom's broadband communication solutions for set-top box, cable modem, and carrier access.","In this second quarter, we are expecting strength, good strength on multiple fronts in the wired segment. We're expecting growth to resume in our custom ASIC business, driven by increasing shipments to wireless base stations and the start of a product ramp into the new data center switches. Our standard ASSP [Application-Specific Standard Parts] switching, routing, and physical layer products are seeing an increase from enterprise demand. Broadband carrier access is experiencing strong activity, driven by fiber-to-the-home and DSL deployments in multiple regions, including China. And finally, we expect our set-top box business to also benefit from some seasonal refresh cycles at key customers. In aggregate, we expect second quarter revenues from wired segment to be approximately 55% of our total revenue from continuing operations.","Moving on to wireless, in the first quarter revenue from the wireless segment declined by 15% percent sequentially and represented 32% of our total revenues. And just to remind you, that's just Avago classic. Last year, unusually high demand in first quarter from our North American customers offset the normal seasonality. This year, however, as we all well know, seasonality returned, and there was a product lifecycle related decline in demand from that key customer. We did see a small positive offset from an increase in shipments to our large Korean customer, driven by the launch of their new flagship smartphones, where we also increased our RF content.","Turning to the second fiscal quarter, in addition to Avago classic RF FBAR [Film Bulk Acoustic Resonator] filters and power amplifiers, our wireless segment will now include classic Broadcom's wireless connectivity and custom analog handset solution. And in this second quarter of 2016 that we're in, we expect the product lifecycle related decline in demand from our North American customers to continue to impact our combined wireless revenue. And in aggregate, we expect second quarter revenue from our wireless segment to be approximately 23% of our total revenue from continuing operations.","We expect the second quarter, though, to be the trough for our wireless businesses for the rest of the fiscal year, and we expect to start ramping up shipments late in our third quarter to support the increase in demand driven by the typical product cycle ramp at our North American customers. In fact, we have already started pre-building in significant quantities our RF FBAR filters to support this expected ramp. We expect the demand increase from this product ramp to be further enhanced by a substantial increase in our content in this new next-generation phone.","Classic Broadcom's combo Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, and custom analog solutions will further add significantly to our content in these Tier 1 OEM-leading smartphones. By the same token, of course, we expect the classic Broadcom wireless products to also benefit from the launch of new generation of phones later this year.","Let me now turn to enterprise storage. In the first quarter, this segment's revenue grew by 6% sequentially, better than expectations. And enterprise storage represented 38% of our total revenue, that's revenue of Avago classic in Q1. This was our largest segment in the first quarter. During the quarter we saw strong demand from enterprise and nearline hard disk drives. Our server and storage connectivity businesses also had a good quarter, led by seasonal growth from fiber channel shipments, while our RAID and SAS businesses largely sustained.","Going forward, the composition of this segment will remain largely unchanged. However, we expect a somewhat different picture in the second quarter, with seasonal declines impacting both our hard disk drive business and server storage. We expect second quarter revenues from this segment to be approximately 17% of our total revenue from continuing operations.","Finally, to the last segment, industrial, first quarter 2016 industrial segment represented 8% of our total revenue, as we had planned. In the face of lingering uncertainty in industrial end markets, we decreased shipments into distribution, and during the quarter our industrial segment revenue declined by 10% sequentially in the first quarter. Keep in mind we recognize revenue on shipment basis. So industrial resales, on the other hand, decreased only moderately, in the mid-single digits, on a sequential basis. By region, resales in Asia-Pacific were slightly up, Japan flat, Americas down moderately, while Europe declined in the low teens sequentially last quarter.","Our prudent approach to distribute those shipments, which lagged resales, resulted in a reduction in channel inventory. Please keep in mind, as I said again, we recognize revenue only on a sell-in basis. And as we look at the second quarter, the composition of this segment will also remain unchanged, Avago classic. But anticipating favorable seasonality to the start of the year, we expect a high single-digit sequential increase in industrial resales. However, we will continue to manage channel inventory and expect a more moderate increase in shipments into the channel, and by that, revenue.","We are also expecting a substantial increase in our IP licensing revenue due to a few deals we expect to close within the second quarter. And so in aggregate, we expect second quarter revenue from industrial to be approximately 5% of our total revenue from continuing operations of this combined company.","With that color, let me summarize for the second quarter. With the addition of classic Broadcom, wired now becomes our broadest and largest segment, and we are expecting a very strong performance from multiple product lines in this segment. Wireless also becomes broader but remains tied to a limited number of large high-end smartphone customers, and we expect this current Q2 quarter to be the seasonal trough for the rest of the year. We also expect a seasonal decline in enterprise storage, but something of a recovery in industrial.","We are very excited by the opportunities in front of us as a combined company to continue to drive our financial model on an even larger scale, with broader access to very attractive end markets. We continue to expect we will achieve the $750 million target in annualized cost synergies over the next six fiscal quarters, and we think we might be able to even beat that. We're also working on returning to our long-term financial model of driving operating margins back above 40% as quickly as possible.","With that, let me now turn the call over to Tony for a more detailed review of our first quarter financials.","Anthony E. Maslowski - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you, Hock, and good afternoon, everyone.","As a reminder, my comments on our first quarter results relate to our predecessor, Avago, while comments including guidance for the second fiscal quarter relate to the combined company. My comments today will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results from continuing operations unless otherwise specifically noted. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP data is included with the earnings release issued today, and is also available on our website at www.broadcom.com.","Revenue of $1.78 billion in the first quarter represented a decrease of 4% from the prior quarter. Foxconn and Apple were greater than 10% direct customers in the fiscal first quarter. Our first quarter gross margin from continuing operations was 61%, which was at the midpoint of our guidance range.","Turning to operating expenses, R&D expenses were $238 million and SG&A expenses were $68 million. This resulted in total operating expenses for the first quarter of $306 million, $8 million below guidance, as we were cautious going into the close of the acquisition. On a percentage basis, total operating expenses were 17% of revenue, a reduction from 18% in the prior quarter. As a percentage of sales, R&D was 13% and SG&A was 4% of net revenue.","Operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $783 million and represented 44% of net revenue. Taxes came in at $35 million, which is a 5% rate for the first quarter, a bit lower than our guidance at 5.5%. First quarter net income was $710 million, and earnings per diluted share were $2.41. First quarter interest expense was $41 million, and this does not include the ticking fees we incurred in the quarter related to the debt commitments we secured for the Broadcom acquisition. Other income net was $3 million.","Our share-based compensation expense for the first quarter was $57 million. The breakdown for the first quarter includes $6 million in cost of goods sold, $28 million in R&D, and $23 million in SG&A. In the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we anticipate share-based compensation expense will be approximately $195 million. Just as a reminder, the definition of non-GAAP net income excludes share-based compensation expense.","Moving on to the balance sheet, our days sales outstanding were 54 days, an increase of four days from the prior quarter, caused by linearity of revenue in the quarter. Our inventory ended at $490 million, a $34 million decrease from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. Days on hand were 64 days, a reduction of four days from the prior quarter, as we sold raw material and work-in-process inventories in conjunction with the sale of certain fiber-optic subsystem manufacturing and related assets to a third party.","We generated $474 million in operational cash flow and ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.2 billion, which increased by approximately $350 million from the prior quarter. During the first quarter, we also received $68 million from the sale of the fiber-optic subsystem assets.","In the first quarter, we spent $140 million on capital expenditures. For the second quarter, we expect CapEx to be approximately $210 million, which includes approximately $60 million for campus construction activity, primarily at our Irvine location, $50 million for ongoing capacity expansion for manufacturing RF filters at our Fort Collins fab, and $10 million of IT integration expenses related to the acquisition.","On December 30, 2015, we paid a cash dividend of $0.44 per ordinary share, which consumed $122 million of cash. This dividend was raised by $0.02 from the prior quarter. Since the inception of Avago's dividend program, in the second quarter of 2011 to date, our financial performance has allowed us to increase our dividend each quarter. As you have seen, our board has also declared a dividend of $0.49 per share to be paid on March 31 this quarter. As a reminder, our board reviews and determines our dividend policy on a quarterly basis based on our financial performance and condition, the contractual provisions related to outstanding indebtedness, and other factors deemed relevant by our board.","Now let me turn to our non-GAAP guidance for second quarter of fiscal year 2016, which include projected contributions from the combined Avago and Broadcom Corporation businesses. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions, and we do not intend to update this guidance. This guidance is from continuing operations only.","Net revenue is expected to be $3.55 billion plus or minus $75 million. Gross margin is expected to be 59% plus or minus one percentage point. Operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $832 million. Taxes are forecasted to be approximately $50 million. Net interest expense and other is expected to be approximately $161 million. The diluted share count forecast is for 443 million shares. And one balance sheet item, the ending cash balance, which is expected to be in the range of $1.7 billion to $2 billion, which includes the expected repayment of $300 million of our outstanding debt in the quarter.","As mentioned, this guidance excludes the estimated results of certain recently acquired Broadcom businesses, which have been classified as assets held for sale and will be reported as discontinued operations beginning February 1, 2016. In fiscal 2015, we estimate these businesses generated $295 million in annual revenue and consumed $282 million in annual operating expenses.","That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question is from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I guess, Hock, the first one is for you. It sounds like the wired side is particularly strong in your April quarter guidance. Can you walk through a little bit of the sub-segments within that that are driving that growth?","Hock E. Tan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. We've seen pretty broad-based strength both from Avago classic as well as the newer product divisions from Broadcom classic. One clear example is the initial ramp of \u2013 you probably heard the announcement on data center switching, where our ASIC business are coming in and starting to see a ramp at certain cloud guys to a fairly large OEM, and this has been successful and things are moving along very nicely. And the funny thing is, while the ASIC ramp is happening, the existing products, which is using standard switch products from Broadcom classic, is also seeing a lot of strength, especially in this case from enterprise. The one thing across the board and carrying along (25:33) that, of course, are physical layer products and Ethernet switching, which all move in the same direction. So that's pretty much \u2013 it's enterprise logic, to answer your question. A couple of product ramps, but largely enterprise.","Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great, and I guess as my one follow-up, one for Tony. On the OpEx side, it looks like a lot of cuts have occurred already to get to that $832 million. Can you just update us on the trajectory of that towards that \u2013 I believe the $550 million in total savings? On a quarterly basis it looks like you've gotten I think mathematically over 85% of it already in your guide.","Anthony E. Maslowski - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No, no, no.","Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So any color you could give would be helpful.","Anthony E. Maslowski - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No, no \u2013 so, Ross, the thing you're not putting in there is that we have about an $80 million reduction, if you look at those expense numbers I gave you, for discontinued ops. You have to pull that out because remember, we never counted that in what we thought was the synergies we're going after. The synergies we talked about was pure synergies, and then anything from discontinued ops was going to be added on top of that.","Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So I guess could you then, taking that out of the equation, can you just talk about the trajectory to your $138 million...","Anthony E. Maslowski - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. The trajectory, like you said, is pretty bowl shaped. So we get some immediate things in Q2 and Q3. We get a little bit of slowdown as we enter into the conversion that we're trying to pull off in Q1 \u2013 Q2. And then you see the rest of it come through in late Q1 \u2013 Q2, some in Q3, to equal the 18 months.","Hock E. Tan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","To be specific also, Ross, if I could expand on what Tony is saying, for the rest of this fiscal year, nine more months to go, we see barely one-third of that $750 million we projected on an end state as synergies to even come in, less than one-third to come in. And in the first quarter, which is this current Q2, it's barely a fraction of that one-third.","Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","That's great color, thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question and nice execution. Maybe just looking at the wireless segment, you talked about it bottoming, obviously a well-known customer having the correction. You said it was a substantial increase in content. Last quarter you talked about 20% growth in that business. Obviously, we've seen a correction since that call. Is that still the target for growth for wireless?","Hock E. Tan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Say that last part? What did you say, what's my target?","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Since your last earnings call, obviously that customer has gotten weaker. You talked about it bottoming. Is 20% the right growth to think about for wireless this year?","Hock E. Tan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. Probably we'll do better than that.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got you, thank you. And then, Tony, just a clarification. The businesses that are held for sale now that you reviewed, is that the extent of the \u2013 when you look at assets you may sell, is that the extent of it, or could there be other businesses you may sell as well? And then within that, is there any of the businesses that you may shut down? What's the right timeline in thinking about those assets going away?","Anthony E. Maslowski - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Like I said, this is our initial cut of the businesses as of close. So we're going to go aggressively and try to find buyers. And like I said, we go into our other modes of either harvesting or complete shutdown. It does not preclude us from adding businesses to the list as we go forward. So again, this is just part of the standard operating procedure around here, but this is the day-one list we're chasing.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Perfect. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Vinayak Rao - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, this is Vinayak calling in for Craig. My first question is on the Broadcom's multi-frequency business. What actually are you seeing for the 25G Tomahawk product lineup? That transition from 10G to 25G on the hyperscale side was something everybody was looking for.","Hock E. Tan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay, well, there's a lot of traction. The trend is definitely accelerating and in no small degree is pushing what we are seeing here and what I articulated in my remarks, very, very good traction of 25-gig at hyper-data center guys and even some enterprise guys who are building data centers of their own. That's what's driving a lot of strength also in the Broadcom classic business and even the ASIC business of Avago classic. It's 25-gig. And it drives not just only switching, which is what you mentioned here with Tomahawk. It also drives to a large degree the associated product related to Ethernet, though that's still early, but definitely physical layer products, which is a big chunk of Broadcom classic wired segment as well. So all of this is tending to pull it all along connectivity solutions.","Vinayak Rao - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it, that's helpful. And for my follow-up, turning to the broadband business from classic Broadcom, the neutral (31:03) STMicro, they're looking to exit the set-top box business. So what do you think the implications for profitability or share for you guys?","Hock E. Tan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Nothing, we don't think about those things. We don't dream about those things. We just put our head down and keep grinding away.","Vinayak Rao - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good, that's really helpful.","Hock E. Tan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd.","Hi, good afternoon and thank you for taking my question. The first question is on the RF business. Hock, you talked about content growth at your largest customer potentially being higher than 20%. But how would you size your content opportunity in the smartphone market overall going into the back half of the year and perhaps going into 2017?","Hock E. Tan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I said that in remarks in previous earnings calls, and so this is a bit of a \u2013 this is to reiterate or reaffirm what I said earlier before, which is typically year after year each generation we increase our content in this very high-end smartphone market, in excess of 20% content every year, regardless of unit increases. And we all know the units of phones in this very high-end top of the pyramid smartphones is maybe 20%, maybe 15% \u2013 20% of that entire market made by a few key branded manufacturers, and we are very well positioned there. And our growth rate is not about unit growth. It's about content. And if this continues the same trend, if the content keeps growing over 20% a year, this coming generation, and the back half of this fiscal and calendar year remains very much on track to follow that same trend.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd.","Okay, very clear. My second question is on M&A. I appreciate you just closed the deal, the Broadcom deal. But can you maybe talk about your appetite for further M&A going forward and how you would balance M&A versus debt repayment or returning cash to shareholders?","Hock E. Tan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Our first priority, and if Tony doesn't mind me opening my mouth (33:29), otherwise he will chime in and say what are you talking about? The first priority is we pay down debt, absolutely. Second priority is and simultaneous to it is evidenced by increasing our dividends. If we are confident about cash flow generation, which we are, we return excess cash we consider more than what we need to operate this company, even as it scales up, to shareholders, and evidenced by increasing dividends. And right now we're not doing much M&A. it would be furthest from our minds at this point.","Anthony E. Maslowski - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","And I agree.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd.","Okay, great. Thank you so much.","Operator","And our next question is from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Vivek Arya - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on the consistently strong execution, just one clarification and then the question. On the clarification on the sales guidance for Q2, I'm wondering, Tony. How much is excluded for the recent optics divestiture and then the $300 million that you said might be held as discontinued ops? Because I'm just trying to get apples to apples, of your guidance versus consensus expectations, and I want to make sure that I am excluding some of those things that are in discontinued ops or that you have divested already.","Anthony E. Maslowski - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So it's a two-part question. First off, on the asset sale, part of that was in Q1. So it's a tough compare to say exactly what it is from Q1 to Q2, but it was fairly insignificant, I would just say that, for the overall company. And as I outlined in my final statement was the disc-ops portion of Broadcom assets is sub-$300 million. So you can do the math on that for the full year and you're talking about $80 million-ish, $80 million or less.","Vivek Arya - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Got it. And then my larger question, I know, Hock, that you are focused on the current business right now. But one thing we often hear is that companies are trying to essentially balance the amount of exposure they have to the smartphone market. And I understand your FBAR business is doing extremely well. You're seeing the content gains. But when I look at the connectivity business, I don't see the same potential for content gains. So is that a fair assessment? And if it is, then do you think that perhaps there is the potential for divesting the business and perhaps focusing on other areas, whether it's wired or storage or others?","Hock E. Tan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And by wireless, you mean the wireless connectivity, which is Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, and all the related things inside high-end smartphones?","Vivek Arya - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","That's right.","Hock E. Tan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, we definitely highlight it. It's definitely not in discontinued ops, obviously. And we believe it is a sustainable franchise is how we would classify this business. It is one of our sustainable franchises, as is FBAR. And evolution of the technology of next-generation Wi-Fi in particular keeps coming in, improvement of performance issues of coexistence within Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and now cellular band, it's a major, major issue that Broadcom classic are very good at addressing. And as we especially start going to 5G Wi-Fi next-generation, and that is already starting to happen, and we start seeing those high-end smartphones run multiple channels simultaneously, we start to see that our expertise, our unique technology in FBAR would actually come to bear in even improving Wi-Fi modules that can surpass performance of anything else in the marketplace to date. So that to us is a very, very complementary product line to our cellular FBAR business. So no, it's a sustainable franchise.","Vivek Arya - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good afternoon and solid job on the quarterly execution. On the broadband connected home business, this is a business that's often thought of as a relatively slow growth segment. However, cable, they're going through a pretty big major upgrade cycle to DOCSIS 3.1. Hock, as you mentioned, you've got PON in China, which continues to be relatively strong. And then we have the pay TV service provider move to 4K UHD over the next several years. What's your confidence level on the growth prospects in the broadband business this year?","Hock E. Tan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","There are two parts to the broadband business. Good question on your side. One is a large part of it is mainly CPE, relates to set-top box in particular. For us though, there's some over-the-top stuff like Roku, which we participate in too, but truly set-top box is the primary chunk. So there's one chunk of it on our broadband. And the other chunk of it is what I call carrier access, which is really gateways, infrastructure gateways, which are the DSLs and the GPON mostly. And then there's the set-top box.","The set-top box business is \u2013 my favorite line again, a sustainable franchise. We are very well positioned. We have great technology, tie a lot of it to the fact that we have all the bits and pieces of technology, including DOCSIS 3.1. We're the only guy, the first and only guy certified in it. But we also have all the technology that integrates in one chip a digital solution. But we are not the only ones. But as somebody said, with the exit of STMicro, it even perhaps strengthens our market position and indicates how difficult this business is. But having said that, the client side set-top box, including satellite, is not something that we foresee any dramatic growth. But we do foresee stable sustainable levels, which is a big chunk of our business.","Now on the carrier access, which is gateways, infrastructure gateways, that's very exciting on growth. We see alt-evolution in new-generation 2.5G and even GPON going to 10G, applying same to us across DSL. All that is happening, and that requires new capability to generate new generation of products, which we have in ample supply. Broadcom classic, those guys are phenomenal. They're there, and they always generate products better, faster than anybody else, and we're doing it here too. And that business as emerging countries and even developed countries like regions like Europe upgrade their infrastructure towards more broadband capacity and connectivity, they're going for 10G now, and we're seeing an initial ramp to it. It's pretty cool. And we see it varies a lot of strength to it. And here comes the other complementarity to our Avago classic business. We also sell the lasers, the optics that go hand in hand with many of this carrier access stuff.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thanks for the insights...","Hock E. Tan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We feel very positive about this.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thanks for the insights there. And then, Tony, on the April quarter guide, looking at the combined entity and looking at your guidance for April, it looks like you guys are taking on about $120 million per quarter in OpEx. So how much of that is coming from the discontinued ops, and how much of that are the true cost synergies?","Anthony E. Maslowski - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Like I said, it's probably $80 million, and then you can do the math and that's what we have as savings. And like Hock said, it's still just the tip of the iceberg of the synergy.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. And, Hock and Tony, great job on execution. Hock, getting back to the classic Avago wireless business, the FBAR business, given the weakness in the North American customer in the near term, is there opportunity to transition some of that capacity into the Chinese smartphone market, or do you suspect there that North American customers' capacity needs in the second half of the year are going to be such that you're going to still be capacity constrained for most of this year?","Hock E. Tan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. To answer your question, and I did a passing reference to that in my opening remarks. Our fab today, eight-inch \u2013 half of it is eight-inch now, by the way, converted, and we continue to gradually convert it. It's full, virtually full. We are rebuilding products for FBAR filters in particular, for the expected ramp of our North American customer. We are. And so it's pretty full. And frankly, because of that, we do sell to other customers, but we obviously have a commitment, a very clear commitment to be sure that we continue to support this North American customer. And that's always very important, not least of which they're the ones who drive the most interesting content within their phones.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","That's helpful, Hock, and then a little bit on the combined wired business. Clearly, the acquisition of Broadcom on the surface is more than justified by the financial justification, but I'm just curious. When you look at the wired business and classic Avago and classic Broadcom, have you started to see opportunities for revenue synergies? And as you answer the question, I was hoping I'd get a better understanding of how your ASIC business compares\/contrasts with the Broadcom ASSP business.","Hock E. Tan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","They're not the same, actually. That's why I made a point to say it earlier. They co-exist \u2013 because I'll tell you this. We go to customers, and we love our customers. So we go to these OEM customers. And we basically \u2013 our ASSP switch, for instance, our router, it's a full turnkey solution. It's not just a piece of silicon. It needs to be architected in a certain way for us, and it has all the software specs that ties to it, so it's a full turnkey solution that can support a customer.","As opposed to that, all our ASIC business does is my customer has to architect the switch. They have to then \u2013 basically all they're buying from us is a piece of silicon. They even do some of the front end RTL sometimes, and we do the back end. And we do the supply chain, of course. By the end of the day, all the software, we don't do; they provide it. Our ASIC business has zero software. So what we sell is a piece of silicon, finished no doubt, but there's no \u2013 all it is is hardware, no software. So what we really are offering this thing and we sell both to the same customer very often, it's really up to the customer. Some customers look at it and say, I want to invest a lot of software, invest in architecture, and just buy the ASIC from us. And they spend a lot of operating spend, R&D to do that. Or they invest much less, very little; they build a box and they buy a turnkey SOC with software from standard switching.","So to the customer, it's not competition. It is two business model alternatives, one where they spend less R&D, OpEx, and maybe get time to market faster with a completed solution quickly. Or two, they spend the R&D, architect it, write the software, and go, often enough, later to market and basically try to put the secret sauce on their own, which they are at liberty to do, and we will support the customer on both models. To us and to them, it's a business model choice rather than competition.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","That was very helpful. Thanks, Hock.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Chris Caso with Susquehanna Financial Group. Please go ahead.","Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yes, thank you. I just had a follow-up question on some of the earlier questions with synergies, and specifically on the synergies on the COGS side. Can you talk about the timing in which you expect to see some of the COGS synergies? And from a COGS side, which I suppose is largely manufacturing, do you expect that savings would come faster or slower than the average of what you said, about a third of the total for the total year?","Anthony E. Maslowski - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Specifically, in Q2 here, there's very little COGS in there. If any, we'd get something late in the quarter. And I think you'd see more material COGS changes in the second half, and I think that's the way it will work on COGS. If you took COGS as its own line, it's probably going to implement itself in the middle of those six quarters roughly, but very little into Q2 right now.","Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay, great. That's helpful. And then with regard to the integration of the classic Broadcom business, clearly you're approaching the businesses a bit differently. Could you talk perhaps about how you plan to manage the businesses in terms of organization, how you're measuring against goals and management incentives, what you may be doing differently as opposed to how Broadcom has managed in the past?","Hock E. Tan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, what we have done, as you gather from the way we talked about discontinued businesses versus continuing operations, we have identified the core businesses that are extremely, extremely sustainable, key criteria, but also where Broadcom classic has extremely strong positions and continue to lead by technology leadership, which we encourage them to keep investing. And that's what we are like; we're very focused.","So we identify a bunch of these businesses and we put a general manager in charge of each of those businesses who are responsible for their own entire P&L except support functions on SG&A. Otherwise, they're responsible for product development, positioning their products, marketing their products, and developing their product. And each of them run by a management team under a general manager reporting directly to me, and they have specific targets and goals. And the biggest overwhelming goal for each of them is sustain their leadership, and that comes in two parts, market leadership and technology leadership.","So we let them invest as much as they need to sustain it, but we want them to be very focused on continuing to be very strong in the markets they are in, in the narrow markets they are in, so we define that very clearly with them, each other, and we continue that way. And so anything that is not those core businesses is what we really call discontinued operations.","We do not go to look at adjacent markets. We do not go shooting up into the stars and send people to Mars or stuff like that. No, we don't do that. We focus on the core business, and the key thing is sustainability and being a technology leader. And we have identified a bunch of them as we have in Avago classic. You just add it all together and we have a fairly flat organization, each business run by a management team with their own general manager and a set of goals.","Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","That's great.","Hock E. Tan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's really how we run the business.","Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","That's good color. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Srini Pajjuri with CLSA Securities. Please go ahead.","Srinivas Reddy Pajjuri - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you. Thank you. Hi, Tony. On the debt payment, if I look at your business, I think it's going to generate close to almost $5 billion free cash flow. I'm just wondering. How much of that free cash flow is available to you to pay off the debt given, if I recall correctly, with Broadcom, the majority of that was offshore. So I'm just wondering how that changes with Avago.","Anthony E. Maslowski - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Again, not much has changed on cash flow of the Broadcom business. So remember, about 70% of it is semi-trapped, meaning that it can't be used for probably general purposes, but we can use it for debt purposes on a worldwide basis. The other 30% is similar to the Avago cash flow, which is untrapped, and the Avago portion remains untrapped.","So you're right, we could probably take on bigger goals around the debt and so forth. But for right now we'll just post that on a quarterly basis to you what we're planning to pay off. And I think you can see that if we hit our goals on synergies and everything else, we'll quickly get back down to an EBITDA ratio of less than two times probably within a year or so if we execute on our synergies and so forth. So we're not too concerned about the debt we took on. And we took on debt at a lower ratio than we did even on the LSI time.","Srinivas Reddy Pajjuri - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay, great. And then on the non-core asset that you classified, Hock or Tony, it looks like it's coming off of the wireless segment. I'm just wondering if you can provide any more color as to why you decided this business to be non-core. And then also, do you have a potential buyer lined up? And if so, when do you expect the deal to close?","Hock E. Tan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","To answer your question, it's more than just one business that we put into non-core apparently, not necessarily from wireless. But really the truth is for obvious reasons, we really prefer and not at liberty to divulge more details because we are running a process.","Srinivas Reddy Pajjuri - CLSA Americas LLC","Got it, thank you.","Operator","And, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our Q&A session for today. I would like to turn the call back to Ashish for final remarks.","Ashish Saran - Head-Investor Relations","Thank you, operator. Thank you for participating in today's earnings call.

Please go ahead, sir.","Ashish Saran","Thank you, Operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are Hock Tan, President and CEO; and Tony Maslowski, Chief Financial Officer of Avago Technologies.","After the market closed today, Avago distributed a press release and financial tables describing our financial performance for the third quarter fiscal year 2015. If you did not receive a copy, you may obtain the information from the Investors section of Avago\u2019s website at www.avagotech.com.","This conference call is being webcast live and a recording will be available via telephone playback for one week. It will also be archived in the Investors section of our website at avagotech.com.","During the prepared comments section of this call, Hock and Tony will be providing details of our third quarter fiscal year 2015 results, background to our fourth quarter fiscal year 2015 outlook and some commentary regarding the business environment. We will take questions after the end of our prepared comments.","In addition to U.S. GAAP reporting, Avago reports certain financial measures on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the tables attached to today\u2019s press release.","Comments made during today\u2019s call will primarily refer to our non-GAAP financial results. Please refer to our press release today and our recent filings with the SEC for information on the specific risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Hock Tan. Hock?","Hock Tan","Thank you, Ashish. Good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019ll touch on Q2 revenue highlights, with a preview of our Q4 expectations and then Tony will provide a summary of our third quarter fiscal year 2015 financial results.","As a note, you may be aware we closed the Emulex acquisition on May the 5th two days into our third fiscal quarter and accordingly Q3 results include contributions from Emulex.","Now, it is ironic that volatility and recent weakness in the equity markets are in such sub-contrast to relative stability and predictability, I might add, of our end market demand. Revenue for our third quarter was $1.75 billion, a 6.4% sequential increase and above the midpoint of our guidance as all segments performed well.","I am very pleased with our execution which drove Q3 margins and earnings per share to the high-end of our expectation. We continue to see good demand driven by our diverse portfolio of highly differentiated solutions. We believe our focus on sustainable franchises provide us with a firm foundation to consistently deliver strong operating results.","Turning to a discussion of our segments, starting with wireless, in the third quarter, revenue from our wireless segment grew by 7% sequentially. Wireless now represented 35% of our total revenue from continuing operations.","As expected growth within the quarter was driven by the start of our ramp from our North American smartphone OEM as they transition to their next-generation platform and the continuation of our product ramp at an Asian handset OEM.","Looking at the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201915, we do expect revenue growth to continuing our wireless business with strong growth of over 10% sequentially. We expect this growth to result from the full ramp of the new phone model at our North American smartphone customer, partially offset by the product cycle rollover at the Asian customer.","We continue to make very good progress in increasing our FBAR capacity, which we anticipate will increase by approximately 50% by the time we end fiscal \u201815 compared to that of the prior year. This correlates perfectly well with our expectation for the year-over-year increase on our fiscal 2015 wireless segment revenues.","However, we have been unable to quite satisfy demand from Chinese LTE handset OEMs and only have been able to make limited shipments to them this year. But we do expect to further increase FBAR capacity by another 50% over the course of fiscal \u201916, which should hopefully enable us to better meet demand from these Chinese customers starting late 2016.","In addition, we remain focused on increasing our RF content in new handset releases and expect any new significant design wins could consume significant amount of planned capacity additions particularly towards the end of fiscal 2016, and as a result, our capacity for FBAR may continue to remain under pressure for an extended time period.","Moving on to enterprise storage, starting with third fiscal quarter, the enterprise storage segment includes Emulex fiber channel connectivity product. And in this third quarter, enterprise storage revenue grew 26% sequentially and enterprise storage represented 34% of our total revenue from continuing operations.","Much of the strong sequential growth was due to the addition of Emulex in the third quarter, but our other enterprise storage business also grew organically in the high single-digit sequentially.","We experienced strong sequential growth also in custom flash controllers, as that product line continues to ramp very nicely. Our server storage connectivity business continued to trend positively with solid demand for 12 gig RAID and SAS products, and strong shipment for our PCI Express Solutions.","Looking towards fourth quarter 2015, we expect enterprise storage to continue its momentum. Revenue growth is projected in the low to mid-single digits sequentially, driven by forecast seasonal uptick in the hard disk drive end market, but more importantly, sustained demand in our server storage connectivity businesses.","On to wired infrastructure, with the closing of our Emulex acquisition in the third quarter, our ASIC and fiber optics sales to Emulex have now become [complete] [ph] transactions and are no longer included in this wired segment revenue.","Reflecting this change, our wired segment declined by 3% sequentially in the third quarter, which otherwise would have been up slightly from that of the prior quarter. Wired revenue now represents 21% of total revenue from continuing operations.","Our underlying ASIC business declined moderately coming off a very strong second quarter, where we have seen double-digit sequential revenue growth. We remain very optimistic with our expanding ASIC footprint in the routing, switching and high performance computing end markets.","We saw strong sequential growth in fiber optics, driven by the start of the ramp in 100G shipments and the sustained increase in 40G fiber optic module shipments to the hyperscale data center market where we are supplying to multiple end customers. We have also added wafer capacity and increased shipment significantly to meet continued strong demand from the fiber-to-the-home market largely in China.","Okay, moving to -- turning to the outlook for the wired segment for the fourth quarter. We expect our ASIC business to resume growth, driven by continued strength in data center buildouts.","We expect demand from hyperscale and fiber-to-the-home market to sustain for our fiber optic business. Consequently, we expect wired segment revenues to grow in the mid single-digit sequentially.","Moving to industrial, for the third quarter industrial and other segment represented 10% of our total revenue from continuing operations. And as I mentioned previously, this segment does include our intellectual property licensing business. This segment had much stronger than expected second quarter revenue, as I disclosed previously, because of a significant IP licensing business transaction in that quarter.","As a result, going to the third quarter we saw an unusually large revenue decline of 21% sequentially in this segment. Without the impact of this single transaction, industrial revenue would have grown in the high-single digits sequentially as we replenish inventory at certain of our distributors in the U.S. and China.","Industrial revenues having put that in that context, industrial resales in the third quarter were down in the low-single digits as a result softness in Europe and Japan even though China was flat and Americas were up. But while we expect resales in the fourth quarter to improve in China and Europe, uncertainty in industrial market keeps our revenue expectation for this segment to be flat to marginally down sequentially.","So to highlight in summary, we believe we have build a very firm foundation for our company anchored by our four diverse segments. In Q3, wired storage and industrial performed to plan as expected. And we experienced a gradual startup of the typical annual wireless product cycle.","Now in Q4, we expect to gain from the full double-digit sequential growth in wireless. We\u2019ve continued and sustained performance from the rest of the company, resulting in aggregate revenue growth of approximately 6% sequentially.","The Broadcom acquisition continues to progress well and it's very much on track for closing as we indicated early next year. As I planned the integration of our two companies, I'm pleased to identify Tony Maslowski as the CFO of the combined company. Tony has done a superb job in Avago and will be great as we scale up the combined company.","And with that, let me now turn the call over to Tony for a more detailed review of our third quarter fiscal 2015 financials.","Tony Maslowski","Thank you, Hock and good afternoon, everyone. Before reviewing third quarter fiscal year 2015 financial results, I want to remind you that my comments today will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results from continuing operations unless otherwise specifically noted. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP data is included with the earnings release issued today and is also available at our website at www.avagotech.com.","Revenue of $1.75 billion in the third quarter represents an increase of 6% from the prior quarter. Foxconn was greater than 10% customer in the third fiscal quarter. Our third quarter gross margin from continuing operations was 61%, which was at the high end of our guidance range, primarily due to better revenue mix in fab utilization.","Turning to operating expenses, R&D expenses were $245 million and SG&A expenses were $85 million. This resulted in total operating expenses for the third quarter of $330 million, $5 million below guidance, primarily because cost synergies from the Emulex transactions being realized faster than expectation. As a percentage of sales, R&D was 14% and SG&A was 5% of net revenue.","Operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $733 million and represented 42% of net revenue. Taxes came in at $38 million for the third quarter, slightly below our guidance.","Third quarter net income was $660 million and earnings per diluted share were $2.24. This is a significant increase from the $347 million in net income and a $1.26 in earnings per diluted share from the same quarter last year, which was our first quarter that included results from LSI.","Third quarter interest expense was $43 million. Other income, net was $8 million resulting from a number of items including gains from foreign exchange hedging and interest income. Our share-based compensation in the third quarter was $63 million. The breakdown of the expense for the third quarter includes $7 million in cost of goods sold, $31 million in R&D and $25 million in SG&A.","In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we anticipate share-based compensation will be approximately $66 million. Just as a reminder, our definition of non-GAAP net income excludes share-based compensation expense.","Moving on to the balance sheet, our day sales outstanding were 42 days same as the prior quarter. Our inventory ended at $507 million, a $17 million increase from the second quarter, days on hand were 67 days.","We generated $592 million in operational cash flow and ended the quarter with cash balance of $1.4 billion, which declined by approximately $1.1 billion from the prior quarter, primarily due to the cash consumed by the conversion of our 2% convertible notes, the purchase of Emulex and the conversion of our Emulex notes as described in the earnings release.","In the third quarter, we spent $148 million on capital expenditures. On June 30, 2015, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per ordinary share, which consumed $104 million of cash. This dividend was raised by $0.02 from the prior quarter. Since the inception of our dividend program in second quarter 2011 to date, our financial performance has allowed us to increase our dividend each quarter.","As a reminder, our Board reviews and determines our dividend policy on a quarterly basis. Based on our financial performance and condition, the contractual provisions relating to our outstanding indebtedness and other factors deemed relevant by our Board. During the quarter, we did not repurchase any shares.","Now let me turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions. We do not intend to update this guidance and this guidance is for results from continuing operations only.","We expect net revenue to be $1.85 billion, plus or minus $25 million. Gross margin is expected to be 60.5%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. Operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $336 million. Taxes are forecasted to be approximately $42 million and net interest expense and other is expected to be approximately $38 million. And finally the diluted share count forecast is for 296 million shares.","That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question for today comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Vivek Arya","Thank you for taking my question. Hock, question on wireless, I think you guided to over 10% sequential growth. And I believe last year, Apple did some prebuilds and so some of the year-on-year trends probably distorted. So part A of the question is how should we think about content growth at your largest customer this generation, this upcoming generation, and how should we think about seasonality as we look out at Q1?","Hock Tan","Well, to begin with, in terms of content increase, I guess, my best way to describe is there has been no decline in content in our largest customer. To make it clear, number one. And number two, we do not really give guidance beyond the current quarter we are in. So I will have to refrain from giving you a sense of what would go on beyond into Q1 of fiscal \u201816. But in terms of content, do not expect any reduction in content at our largest customers in wireless.","Vivek Arya","I see. And then as a follow-up, Tony, congrats on your expanded role, how should we think about OpEx trajectory over the next few quarters and do you expect to take any cost actions before you close the Broadcom acquisition? Thank you.","Tony Maslowski","To answer your last question, first. Nothing until closed as far as the actions that would affect kind of the combined companies. But as far as OpEx going forward, as we said to you before, 335 and then a steady decline with Emulex getting further and further along the way on their cost cutting, I think is the way we look at it.","And then also remember, we have the bonus reset in Q1. So, we are ahead of plan above 100% right now. So, we are accruing above 100% and you will see that and it will tail off in Q1. So, flattish to -- again, as Hock said, we are not guiding Q1 but I think you can kind of see where it\u2019s headed for Q1.","Vivek Arya","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","John Pitzer","Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Hi, Hock and Tony. Congratulations on the strong results. I guess, Hock, I will go back and ask another question around FBAR, that\u2019s a follow-up from Vivek\u2019s question. But if you look, clearly in the fiscal fourth quarter you guys are benefiting from the ramp of a new phone. That ramp should probably be largely over by the end of October going into the January quarter but you still are clearly undersupplying the overall market for FBAR and you have a lot of confidence. You are building capacity at a pretty healthy clip for the next fiscal year.","So, I guess I\u2019m just trying to figure out to what extent did the North American guide does see some seasonality going forward, you can find homes for that capacity in any given quarter or is that not how the dynamics works, is it going to take time for you to get incremental content out of Chinese smartphones?","Hock Tan","I see what you mean. No, right now, our fab is -- as it has been for the past 12 months obviously, has been completely full and we expect it to continue to run full through to the middle of next year. That\u2019s based on what we can see in terms of line of sight. Beyond that frankly, I\u2019m not sure and as I pointed out correctly, it would give us any opening, any additional capacity coming on the line going forward, coming from additional capacity would be very welcome by us in terms of our ability to then ship to various other customers. And you point out one group obviously, some of the Chinese customers, which we feel we want to be able to support very well and which we\u2019ve been trying very hard to do as much as we can. But our capacity as I mentioned continues to be rather constrained.","John Pitzer","That\u2019s helpful, Hock. And then I guess as my follow-up. On the enterprise storage segment, you did a really nice job kind of going through the different product lines within that division. I might have missed it but I was kind of curios. Could you talk about what the HDD trends were in the just reported fiscal third quarter and then you talked about in the guidance for fiscal fourth quarter, the expectation of a seasonal uptick for HDD, just given some of the lackluster data points around PC builds, help me understand little bit better why you are confident you are going to see kind of that seasonal increase on the HDD side within enterprise storage? Thanks.","Hock Tan","Well, to begin with, a lot of our HDD revenues are coming from HDD products sold into nearline vertical data centers, enterprises. We virtually do zero products into notebooks, limited amount only into desktops and most of our revenues, most of our share resides in enterprise and what you call near line datacenters. So obviously that does have some impact with this entire seasonality that we\u2019ve seen over last several months as we mentioned last quarter too. As PC weakened, we have seen some of that.","But that impact has been mitigated by continuing demand from enterprise and data centers and so there is certain level of offset. Having said that, I'm not for second saying for the last several months that our HDD business is up, it's not. But yes, we believe we\u2019ve seen bottom and we believe that there will be some improvement as we head out over the next several months. And perhaps, part of it is due to our emphasis on enterprise and data centers.","John Pitzer","That\u2019s helpful. Thanks again, guys. Congratulations.","Hock Tan","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Craig Hettenbach","Thanks. Hock, in addition to just some of the broad-based uncertainty out there, there\u2019s also in recent months been some uncertainty about the data center. It look like your commentary was pretty strong on both ASIC and fiber optic. But I was hoping you can expand on that in terms of the trend you're seeing at kind of traditional data centers as well as with the Hyperscale customers?","Hock Tan","Okay. If I give the impression that data centers are booming, I apologize. It\u2019s not intended that way. But we do see our business of various products we have into the data centers, [bereft] [ph] from certain amount ASICs, fiber optics and certainty into enterprise storage for data centers. We do see stable and in many cases, uptrend demand over the last three months and we continue to see that trend continuing in this quarter. While I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s super strong but we do not see weakness either. ","Craig Hettenbach","Got it. And within the trend you are seeing is there anything from new customers? I know you -- I think you called out two customers. But is there something that might be helping you as well in terms of does it expand the customer base or traction at specific customers?","Hock Tan","Are you refering to the wireless segment?","Craig Hettenbach","Not just staying with data center.","Hock Tan","Data centers, it\u2019s an expanding base for us. But many of our customers are fairly large OEMs. Most of them are. Some of that are perhaps end users but most of them are OEMs and we do not see any dramatic shift in the selection of customers we service in this enterprise storage or wired segment.","Craig Hettenbach","Okay. And maybe just a quick follow-up for Tony. Just on the very strong gross margin performance. There could be some elements of mix in there, but also maybe from a manufacturing or cost perspective, can you discuss just the trend you\u2019ve seen in gross margins and sustainability in that segment?","Tony Maslowski","We are very happy with the gross margin performance. But as we've always said, we've got some -- when we actually report, there is a lot of perfection in our yields and the fab utilization. As Hock mentioned, we\u2019ve been 100% now for probably going on five to six quarters. So, again, we think there is good sustainability. The fab will stay full. We hope that yields will stay up. We won\u2019t hit any excursions but I think that we broke the 60 number. We are guiding to a 60 number. We are pretty confident that is something that's sustainable going forward.","Hock Tan","And if I could add to that, I think we also are benefiting from a fairly strong attractive product mix. If you look at our enterprise storage, industrial and wired networking business, the point I made is very stable. It continues to be on a steady uptrend and those are extremely good gross margin business. As they keep expanding, we get a benefit of operating leverage.","Craig Hettenbach","Got it. Thanks for that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Ross Seymore","Hey, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. I guess the first one Hock from the highest of level, you described that your business is stable when others are seeing severe volatility. I know you specify the customers, the segments, et cetera that you address.","But in general, what do you attribute that stability to, because it seems somewhat odd for example that your enterprise storage and your industrial business would be up high-single digits quarter-over-quarter on a core basis when others are seeing weakness? Can you talk a little bit about why you think it\u2019s different for Avago?","Hock Tan","Well, I guess, maybe the best way, we are now one single product end market business as you all know. And in fact, we\u2019ve 12 separate products in those four end markets throughout separate operating divisions and throughout separate product lines, somewhat even larger. And you might see each of them in a niche market of their own.","So when you -- not all up at the same time, not all down at the same time. Combined consolidated, or aggregated as a whole, we have been able to see and we have seen it now for the last 12 months, I would say four quarters, a very stable progression of our business.","What is more volatile as I point out in my closing remarks too is, in enterprise storage, why an industrial? Multiple segments, multiple natures of perhaps offset each other, but there is also end market largely that because of perhaps of the natures have been able to exactly stable.","And the only thing that is small, I would call it seasonal, and it recurs with fairly regular frequency now so far for the last few years is our wireless business. And that sits on top off of extremely firm foundation. And that\u2019s the best way to describe our business.","Ross Seymore","Great. Thanks for that. And I guess one that\u2019s a little bit more housekeeping for Tony. In the past, you talked about paying down some of the debt on our balance sheet. I know you had a bunch of puts and takes in this quarter itself.","But any sort of overall guidance you can give us on cash usage between now and when Broadcom is going to close. Is it a safe assumption to say you will be building up your cash balance? Or are there some other puts and takes like you had in this quarter that we should be ready for?","Tony Maslowski","Just one word matrix, just going straight to the matrix. So again, there is a few things that are going on, but it\u2019s really just marching towards the close. So don\u2019t expect anything too surprising. There will be some small immaterial things here and there where we pay for a pension and so forth, but again nothing material.","Ross Seymore","Perfect Thanks. Congrats again.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Harlan Sur","Hi, good afternoon. And congratulations on the solid quarterly execution. If I -- perusing your financial filings, 50% of your revenues get shifted China, but obviously this is somewhat of a misleading number because only a portion of this actually gets consumed in China, obviously the rest gets shipped to the rest of the world.","Do you guys have a sense of what percentage of your revenues actually gets consumed in China? China domestic smartphones, wired, wireless infrastructure and so on. I assumed it\u2019s a much smaller number than 50% of your revenues, but anyway you guys can quantify?","Hock Tan","It\u2019s definitely a much smaller number than what we report as where we ship our products. As you correctly pointed out, that\u2019s to a lot of contract manufacturers who produce and re-export. And to answer your question, what percent, not a clue, it\u2019s very hard.","Harlan Sur","Okay. Thanks for that Hock. And then on the storage and server connectivity segment within the enterprise storage business, obviously you guys are expecting good growth during the October quarter. Can you just help us understand the drivers? Is it 12 gig SAS, is it RAID, is it PCI, or is it your fiber channel-based products, or maybe a combination of all of the above?","And then I guess just a final question is, is your custom enterprise SSD controller segment also contributing to the growth in the October quarter? Thank you.","Hock Tan","Thank you. The past answer on enterprise storage, as you know, we have a broad portfolio of products, some going into servers and some going into external storage. So that\u2019s the degree of a mix here. But broadly, as I said, we do have a broad portfolio of products, which have been very helpful in basically balancing out the portfolio and the revenue mix.","And as long as that end market in enterprise networking but more so in data centers, hyper data centers build-out, we have been able to see sustained demand. I won\u2019t use the word strong demand, but we don\u2019t see a decline. We\u2019re seeing very, very stable demand that has been on this trajectory for the last six months.","We are not seeing it ramp, but we\u2019ve seen in stable and we have not seen it decline significantly for any sustain period either. So that\u2019s the best description of how I could characterize what we\u2019re seeing here today, which is why our forecast for Q4 is structured accordingly.","And as to your second question, would you mind repeating that?","Harlan Sur","Yes. Just wondering the team has seen strong growth in your enterprise SSD controller product line. I am just wondering if that\u2019s also contributing to growth in the October quarter.","Hock Tan","That\u2019s still a small part of our business and it\u2019s really not that meaningful. And while I did mention it and that\u2019s because of a sharp ramp-up, I would not say to be necessarily something that is very meaningful as to the fact the overall portfolio at this time.","But we do see significant ramp up in that business that we\u2019re in, which is very customized flash controllers for enterprises. And we have been able to benefit from that very nicely, but it\u2019s not that substantial.","Harlan Sur","Thanks, Hock.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Chin from UBS. Your line is open.","Steven Chin","Great. Thanks for taking my question. Hock, question for you if I could, in terms of competition in the wireless business, but I think it\u2019s still clear that your FBAR technology by the measurable leads on an apples to apples basis compared to other filtering technologies. But as some of your competitors introduced more highly integrated front end modules with either FBAR, TC-SAW filters combined with power amplifiers.","Can you talk about how those type of growth customers? Is that highly integrated, how that might compare to your overall pad solutions from a toll subsystem or front end module performance perspective? And what kind of locations they might have from a competitive standpoint longer term?","Hock Tan","Okay. Thanks for question. First of all, I want to clarify the RF solution we specialized in and that drives a lot of revenues as you correctly called them in front end modules. And within it comprises several discrete, multiple discrete elements, largely FBAR filters, one FBAR filter for each frequency band. And combined into a front end module, different discrete elements may constitute as you correctly call it a front end module pad for RF cellular as a receiver and transmitter.","And in this case, in this particular phenomenon, the physics is what dictated. The filters, certain filters, certain bands, frequency bands require FBAR filters in order to perform adequately. FBARs and certain other bands could do without FBAR filters and need only use SAW filters.","And where we excel and where we have a very strong market position, obviously are in those phones we requiring frequency bands that can only perform adequately with FBAR filters and that\u2019s where our market position is. For those bands and those front-end modules because of that that can do with SAW filters, we don\u2019t participate in it because well our performance is still far superior as SAW filters is adequate and go for much lower price.","So in that sense, you\u2019re comparing apples and oranges. There are certain bands, we\u2019re not competitive or we are not well-represented and are not competitive, even though our performance maybe very good. And for other bands, they require FBAR filters to achieve certain performance for the phone makers and we are very well-represented there. And that\u2019s how we compete. We differentiate ourselves from largely the SAW filter guys.","Steven Chin","Got it. Thanks for that color. And as my follow-up and I think question for Tony, in terms of the expected capacity increase for FBAR filters, you guided to another 50% growth for fiscal \u201816. Just wondering if you have any additional color on how that breaks down in terms of expected unit growth, in terms of mobile devices as opposed to certain content growth in existing or new devices incrementally?","Tony Maslowski","Well, again I think obviously, Hock said that we\u2019re continuing this 50% growth for next year. Not really have any comment on unit growth or anything like that.","Hock Tan","So we obviously belief and that has been to be our philosophy and our policy on capital expenditures is that we still have a line of sight towards specific demand before we put in that capacity increase and sometimes because of that as we\u2019re seeing over the last 12 months or more, we like demand. But having said that by putting 50% for next year, we\u2019re pretty certain we\u2019re going to meet that capacity and use it.","Steven Chin","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri from CLSA Securities. Your line is open.","Srini Pajjuri","Thank you. Hock, a question on wireless. On a like-for-like basis, what kind of ASP declines do you normally see in FBAR? And then as we head into next year, given that the hyper growth is probably behind us, what sort of ASP trends should we expect?","Hock Tan","We don\u2019t think very hard about ASPs in the products we\u2019re in. And its not just wireless typically, it\u2019s across most of our product lines. And a big part of it is our products are very highly differentiated and we offer performance, we offer solutions to our customer and not to mention, usually our products come in and it\u2019s good for few years, in the case of wireless maybe a year or so and then a new generation takes over. And when the new generation takes over it adds an additional features, addition capabilities, so it\u2019s very hard to do like-to-like. And we really have stopped looking at ASP degradation in our overall business.","Srini Pajjuri","Okay. Great. And then follow-up on China. You said you were still a capacity constrained. Given that China is driven by mostly reference platforms, I'm just curious as to how well you\u2019re positioned within these reference platforms? And as you get more capacity online, how quickly can you address this market?","Hock Tan","Okay. Typically, the products we sell, we sell the RF Envelope. I mean, this is the extreme of envelope performance kind of product. We sell RF Envelope. We do not sell additional mixed-signal platforms. And so as I mentioned and answer to an earlier question, our core focus products are filters. And there are some bands, even those in China that require FBAR filters versus the more ubiquitous SAW filters. And they would be required even in many kinds of platform as discrete solutions.","And we have obviously no issue about selling discrete FBAR filters to phone makers in China who require that filters in order to be able to perform well at those specific bands. On top of that, there is this phenomenon of what you call phone operators, trying to win multiple bands, trying to uplink or downlink as a single pipe and that\u2019s part of the phenomenon of carrier aggregation.","And they really do carrier aggregation very well, which we are very good at doing. You really want to have FBAR filters operating in that regard. So that provides us the additional opportunity to position our product. And that\u2019s something we obviously have been working on very, very vigorously.","Srini Pajjuri","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Amit Daryanani","Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys. Two questions for me. One, if I look at the October guide to gross margins, you are guiding it flat to down a little bit even though sales are up 6% sequentially and the wireless business, which I assume is a higher margin business is ramping the strongest. So what are the offsets in October that lead to your flattish or down gross margin trends when mix of revenues on your favor?","Tony Maslowski","Well, again, what we've always said is, our print on gross margin is usually against the backdrop of, there has been perfection in the fab. And so what we do is we just say, we\u2019re never going to price it for our perfection going forward, so that's all you're seeing there. There is nothing there that says that we\u2019re not confident, that we might be able to overachieve that number, but it just, that\u2019s not our way of thinking about gross margin on a go-forward basis.","Amit Daryanani","Got it. And then just in the enterprise side, could you talk about in dollars how much Emulex contribute in the quarter? And then you have $109 million assets held for sale on your balance sheet line item, just talk about what exactly that includes?","Tony Maslowski","Sure. So I\u2019ll answer the last question first. So through all the various acquisitions, we\u2019ve had a couple of building. So we have a building that we inherited from Emulex that was owned, which is about $45 million in that asset held for sale and a couple of small buildings as well.","And then also remember with the Emulex transaction we had a security business that is not core to Avago, a security appliance business called Endace and that\u2019s about another roughly $40 million of that.","And then as you might have seen we had a sale of a certain part of our business to on higher earlier this week and that makes up the remainder of that asset held for sale. It\u2019s a big number, because its $100 million, but it's roughly building businesses and its most recent transaction.","Amit Daryanani","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Doug Freedman from Sterne Agee. Your line is open.","Doug Freedman","Great. Thanks guys for taking my question and congrats on the strong results. If I could at least I want to make sure I fully understand the 50% increase in FBAR capacity. When you're measuring capacitor, you are talking about a 50% increase in wafer output and I would think that with the mix of business moving to higher frequencies in FBAR, those I believe use smaller amounts of die space? So are you looking for a larger increase in units than the 50%, if that 50% in fact is wafers? Can you just offer some clarity there?","Hock Tan","Yeah. There is a bit of mix dynamics and I don\u2019t want to answer it wrong a halfway and give you the wrong sense going forward. There are a couple of dynamics and we are not sure where this all thing will fall out. But you are right in that regard, each new generation of FBAR filters on our -- on every 6-inch wafer which we are still using, each of those filters do become typically smaller. But however there is a change in the mix, so because depending on which band is used, some of the filters are larger and\/or small -- and might be larger than even the mix than the bands, the other bands they are replacing. So there is one dynamic that goes the way.","Two, keep in mind this is, as we sell more and more of those bands, which in our phone you might add, which is a content increase in phones we've been espousing all this time and it\u2019s true, which is every the new generation of a phone either Galaxy or otherwise would tend to contain more bands.","The world phone concept, the broader roaming concept, more bands will get into a phone. The scale up is pretty substantial and the way we address this scale up is we make filters smaller which help, but also they than pull into a front-end module as I mentioned before of pad as we go, which basically was with power amplifier within the module. And as you will probably know, the number of power amplifiers remains substantially the same, even as more filters go into the same module.","So basically our leverage on revenues on those pads effectively become less which are mostly saying that that\u2019s a price discount the more bands of FBAR filters we sell in each quarter. And that does happen and that\u2019s counter obviously to in terms of a linear ASP increase as a number of bands increase. So there is these two mix of dynamics and end results of that is, yes, a 50% increase in capacity wafer does not necessarily mean a similar increase in revenue a year from now.","Doug Freedman","Okay. Terrific. Thanks for that color. If I could move to one of your smallest segment, Industrial, Hock, I believe you made the comment that you shift less into distribution and they shipped out that you reduced their inventory. Can you give us a sense by how much you believe you reduced the distributors carrying inventory in the quarter?","Hock Tan","I don\u2019t have the data on me. That\u2019s pretty specific and precise. Probably by almost a few weeks of carrying inventory is the best way to describe. Precisely, I don\u2019t have any. And it\u2019s not the same every location. As I say, China and Americas was okay for us so we probably reduced it less but in Germany -- in Europe and Japan, we probably pulled it back much more.","Doug Freedman","Terrific and again congrats on the really strong results. Thanks for allowing my questions.","Hock Tan","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the last question that we\u2019re going to be taking today is from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Kulin Patel","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. This is Kulin Patel for Ambrish. I have a question on the enterprise storage, the fiber channel portion of business. Your competitor saw weakness in their reported results. Can you comment on what you\u2019re seeing in fiber channel?","Hock Tan","Well, I mean, fiber channel is a business that is faced with roughly on a long-term gradually flat to declining trend. Don\u2019t kid ourselves there. Having said that, new generation pops up and hands us the ASP. So overall in dollar terms, this is not far from being flat and we have seen demand been flat is the best description I have, the best way to characterize it. It\u2019s flat.","Kulin Patel","Okay. Thanks. And question of store capacity, in the past call, you\u2019ve talked about moving from six inch to eight inch. Can you comment on your progress on that and when do you expect more of your production to be on eight inch for the FBAR?","Hock Tan","Well, right now and into fiscal \u201816 going forward, beyond this quarter, we will only have one line, maybe about 10%, 15% of our capacity going into 8 inch. And that conversion is going very nicely. We got the know-how technology kind of figured out and locked in and so not more than 10% or so. We won\u2019t get to the point where we will convert all to eight inch until 2017 is my belief and so whole new project. But what we\u2019re seeing now, which is in production or going to production is an ability to obviously do the conversion on one line.","Kulin Patel","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. That\u2019s all the time that we have for questions for today. So I would like to turn the call back over to management for closing remark.","Ashish Saran","Thank you, Operator. Thank you for participating in today\u2019s earnings call. We look forward to talking with you again when we report our fourth quarter fiscal year 2015 financial results.","Operator","That concludes Avago\u2019s conference call for today.

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Tom Krause, Vice President of Corporate Development. Please go ahead, sir.","Thomas Krause","Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are Hock Tan, President and CEO; and Tony Maslowski, Interim Chief Financial Officer of Avago Technologies. After the market closed today, Avago distributed a press release and financial tables describing our financial performance for the third quarter fiscal year 2013. If you did not receive a copy, you may obtain the information from the Investors section of Avago's website at avagotech.com. This conference call is being webcast live and a recording will be available via telephone playback for 1 week. It will also be archived in the Investors section of our website at avagotech.com.","","During the prepared comments section of this call, Hock and Tony will be providing details of our third quarter results, background to our Q4 2013 outlook and some commentary regarding the business environment. We will take questions after the end of our prepared comments. In addition to U.S. GAAP reporting, Avago reports certain financial measures on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the tables attached to today's press release. Comments made during today's call will primarily refer to our non-GAAP financial results. Please refer to our press release today and our recent filings with the SEC for information on the specific risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Hock. Hock, go ahead.","Hock E. Tan","Thank you, Tom, good afternoon, everyone. We're going to start today by reviewing recent end market business highlights and then Tony will provide a summary of third quarter fiscal 2013 financial results.","As I begin, let me remind you that our third quarter results included 5 weeks of contribution from CyOptics. With that, revenue for our third quarter fiscal year was $644 million, which included $21 million from CyOptics. Non-CyOptics-related revenues grew 11% from last quarter and were above the upper end of our guidance of 6% to 9%. Wired infrastructure was up 18% sequentially and industrial was also up 18%, both well ahead of our regional guidance. This more than offset weaker-than-expected results from wireless, which ended up 3% growth sequentially in the quarter.","Now, looking at Q4, we do -- we expect overall revenue to grow between 12% to 15% sequentially. This includes a full quarter, or 13 weeks, of revenue contribution from CyOptics, which is forecast to be approximately $55 million. I want to highlight too, that, excluding CyOptics, we expect to grow revenue, high single-digits sequentially, as well as year-over-year.","Let me provide more color on each of our target markets. Starting with wireless, over the last several months, as you are no doubt all aware, the smartphone market -- high-end smartphone market, in particular, has softened. Recent OEM smartphone launches have disappointed. I would note, however, that our wireless business is still up 19% year-over-year in Q3. The reason is simply content. The emerging proliferation of LTE, first, in North America, then Japan, and now gradually rolling out in Europe and soon to follow in China, drives the need for higher performance RF. With proprietary RF bar filters and pads, power amplifier duplexer, front end modules that is, Avago is focused on solving the most difficult RF challenges, and as a result, we believe we are capturing the most value-added sockets.","Now, having said that, the competitive landscape continues to evolve pretty much as we expected, as emerging players in filters are now showing up. But we believe our position remains very strong as we continue to invest in design innovation, process technology and capacity. As a result, I continue to be confident in our wireless growth prospects going forward.","Looking at Q4, interestingly, our 2 largest smartphone customers are ramping their next-generation platforms, and our content in both these platforms continue to improve substantially. As a result, we anticipate our Q4 wireless revenue to grow mid-teens, sequentially, on a percentage basis.","Moving on to wired infrastructure target market. Here, non-CyOptics wired revenue grew 18% sequentially in Q3, as I mentioned, and represented 28% of overall revenues. Data center related demand was particularly strong, helped by the accelerating transition from 10G to 40G. Our ASIC SerDes business had a record quarter. In the past, we have highlighted our increasing design wins at major networking OEMs and we clearly saw the benefits of that in the current -- in the recent quarter.","In fiber, after 2 lackluster quarters, due to flat, traditional enterprise spending, increased data spend -- increased data center spend, I should say -- also pushed up demand for our 10G, as well as our 40G optical transceiver products. Looking forward to Q4, we see data center spending continuing to sustain, including strong demand for 40G products.","Finally, we see core routing demand returning, driven particularly by backhaul build-outs in China. As a result, we expect wired infrastructure revenue, excluding CyOptics, to grow sequentially. Demand for CyOptics Edge Emitting Lasers and receivers is strong, due to the rollout of 100G coherent telecom networks and 40G single-mode fiber interconnects in large data centers. We are transitioning certain low-margin subsystem business into related higher-margin component sales. Notwithstanding this transition, helped by strong market demand worldwide, we expect that -- we expect CyOptics to contribute approximately $55 million in net revenue in Q4. In a nutshell, we anticipate overall wired infrastructure revenue, which includes for CyOptics, to grow approximately 20% sequentially.","Now switching gears to our industrial target market. Net sales grew 18% in Q3, which was much stronger than my expectation at the beginning of the quarter and accounted for 24% of our overall revenue. Worldwide industrial's resales were up again this quarter, led by China and Japan, which were very strong. We also saw some limited inventory replenishments in our OEM customers and the channel after 2 quarters of de-stocking, which we believe was related to our customers' confidence in the sustainability of current end market demand.","In China, we saw strength in transportation, as well as power generation and distribution. In Japan, we benefited from exports of silver dry [ph] by our Tier 1 OEMs and strong emerging demand for PV inverters in small-scale solar systems.","Focusing on Q4, we expect resales to continue to be up. However, after the robust revenue uptick and the inventory replenishment we saw in the previous quarter, we expect revenue from this target market to be roughly flat sequentially.","In summary, therefore, we exceeded our revenue expectations in Q3 and that -- as a -- sorry, we exceeded our revenue expectation in Q3, as a pronounced improvement in our wired and industrial businesses mitigated the underperformance in wireless. For Q4, we expect wired to continue to perform, while new generation smartphone REMs [ph] and our 2 largest customers give us confidence wireless will be very strong. As a result, excluding CyOptics, we expect to grow revenues high single-digits sequentially, as well as year-over-year. Including the contribution from CyOptics, though, we expect overall revenue to grow between 12% to 15% sequentially in Q4.","With that, let me now turn the call over to Tony for a more detailed review of our third quarter financials.","Anthony Maslowski","Thank you, Hock, and good afternoon, everyone. Before reviewing the third quarter fiscal 2013 financial results, I want to remind you that my comments today will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP data is included with the earnings release issued today and is also available on our website at www.avagotech.com.","Revenue of $644 million in Q3 represents an increase of 15% from last quarter and an increase of 6% versus the same quarter a year ago. Excluding the approximately 1-month contribution from CyOptics, which was slightly higher than expected, Avago's non-CyOptics revenue grew 11% quarter-over-quarter. The sequential strength from our non-CyOptics business was a result of much stronger demand in wired infrastructure and better-than-expected recovery in industrial compared to our prior expectation. As Hock discussed earlier, revenue from wireless target market was below our expectations.","FoxConn continued to be a greater-than-10% customer in Q3.","Our Q3 gross margin was 50.9%. Better product mix drove gross margins higher for our non-CyOptics business compared to the prior quarter, which was offset by the negative impact of CyOptics on our overall gross margins. I should note that the non-GAAP gross margin for CyOptics also outperformed our expectation.","Turning to operating expenses. OpEx for Q3 came in at $137 million, in line with our guidance when you include the guidance we gave for CyOptics business. R&D expenses increased by $3 million to $91 million as a result of higher R&D investment, as well as 1 month R&D spending for CyOptics. SG&A increased by $4 million to $46 million due primarily to higher offensive litigation expenses in addition to 1 month of SG&A costs related to CyOptics. As a percentage of sales, R&D decreased to 14% from 16% in the prior quarter and SG&A remained at 7% of net revenue. CyOptics' operating expenses came in at the low end of our expectation.","Income from operations for the quarter increased by $33 million sequentially to $191 million and represented 30% of net revenue compared to the $186 million for Q3 of last year, income from operations increased by $5 million. Other income was $4 million, which was a gain in fair value of marketable securities representing minority interests.","Taxes came in at $7 million for Q3, in line with our guidance.","Q3 net income of $188 million increased 23% from the prior quarter and Q3 earnings per diluted share of $0.74 was $0.13 higher than Q2. The sequential increase in Q3 earnings is attributable primarily to growth in non-CyOptics revenue, as well as earnings contribution from CyOptics. Compared to Q3 of last year, net income was $6 million higher and earnings per diluted share was $0.02 higher for similar reasons.","Our share-based compensation in Q3 was $20 million. The breakdown of the expense for Q3 includes $3 million in cost of goods sold, $8 million in R&D and $9 million in SG&A. In Q4, we anticipate share-based compensation will be approximately $21 million. And just as a reminder, the company's definition of non-GAAP net income excludes share-based compensation expense.","Moving on to the balance sheet, our days sales outstanding came in at 52 days. This was up 8 days from the prior quarter, primarily due to the timing of shipments in the quarter and unfavorable impact of CyOptics DSO. Impact of CyOptics is 5 days unfavorable. Our inventory ended at $248 million, an increase of $55 million from last quarter. In addition to $32 million of CyOptics inventory, which negatively impacted our inventory days on hand, we continue to build wireless inventory in anticipation of various product launches with our smartphone OEM customers. Days on hand were 82 days. Impact of CyOptics is 6 days unfavorable.","We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $863 million and we generated $137 million in operational cash flow. We spent $65 million on capital expenditures. We also spent $400 million of cash on CyOptics acquisition in the quarter. For Q4, we expect CapEx to be approximately $67 million.","During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1 million shares, which consumed $38 million of cash. We continue to be committed to a share buyback program that aims to limit dilution from employee-related stock issuances.","On June 28, 2013, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per ordinary share, which consumed $52 million of cash. This dividend was raised by $0.02 from the prior quarter. Since the inception of our dividend program in Q2 2011, to date, we have continued to increase our dividend each quarter.","Now let me turn our non-GAAP guidance for fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions and we do not intend to update this guidance. Total revenue is expected to grow by 12% to 15% from Q3. Gross margin is expected to be 50%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. Operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $145 million. Taxes are forecasted to be approximately $12 million, and finally, the diluted share count forecast is for 254 million shares.","That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of James Schneider with Goldman Sachs.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if we could start on the wireless side for a moment. Can you talk about the trends you're seeing right now, at your second-biggest smartphone customer and whether the well-publicized inventory correction that, that customer is essentially behind you at this point? And then, related to that, looking ahead of the smartphone launches you have across your customer set in the next quarter, can you talk about any trends you're seeing with respect to more discrete FBAR sales for you guys versus pads?","Hock E. Tan","Wow, lots of questions there. Let me try to parse that and go one by one. Let's talk about market trends short term, Q4 and specific to the rest of the year. What we do see is, other than our 2 largest smartphone OEM customers, in the higher-end phone range especially, we see a few other phone OEMs launching new phone programs. I mean you have seen that especially on -- we see about Optimus, we see Nexus coming out and we see a few other Lumias coming out, around that, later in the year. But, obviously, the 2 biggest high-end smartphones makers are making the news and we see both programs launching this particular quarter, definitely in the second half of this particular quarter. And right now, as we perceive it, inventory is the least of our problems, in that regard of excess inventory. We are ramping up very, very strongly to try to meet demand. Very, very strongly and very, very urgently just to meet demand of those several smartphone OEMs that we have to support at this stage, okay? That's pretty much what I would limit my discussion to, as to say. A lot of the bookings, a lot of the backlog is in place and what we're trying to do is really an interesting challenge to our supply chain to meet it all. But we'll get there. Then, as far as the second part of your questions on mix, in the short term, both are happening. There are quite a few satellites and discrete FBARs, satellite PAs and discrete FBARs that happens. We also obviously see, from our perspective, quite a bit of head architectures that are also happening. And it varies, obviously, from OEM to OEM, and the best way to answer is we see both. We are seeing both as we see right now. Obviously, increased FBAR architecture comes from increased LTE bands that are now put into a lot of these high-end smartphones, which needed to be supported and yet not some of them. Many of them are not supported as pads but rather supported on a discrete basis. So we see quite a considerable mix of both in this next 6 months, I guess the best way to describe it.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then to follow-up on the industrial business. Clearly, there, your results had been lagging a lot of your peers for a while, but now have caught up and then some it seems like. So can you maybe talk about the channel behavior, and specifically the distributors, what you're seeing from them? Is it a matter of their inventories got too low and they needed to replenish somewhat or they just feel better about overall demand? So do you feel like you're more or less shipping in line with any consumption at this point?","Hock E. Tan","Well, obviously, we're not trying to be too smart about it. Consumption, definitely showing consumption a bit tricky. But I'll tell you what we see in China. In China, a lot of customers are not huge and their management of supply chain is extremely short term. And what we do see, what we have always seen in China and continues that way, is when they perceive end markets to be not as strong, they'll be the first, our Chinese customers in industrial, will be the first to disappear from the demand horizon. And when things go turnaround, they're always the first to show up and they tend to probably replenish their de-stocked inventory level very quickly. And I believe a big part of what we're seeing in Q3 was exactly what happened. A lot of OEMs, small OEMs, midsized OEMs in China came in and bought, and bought pretty heavy. And our China -- revenue -- industrial business in China grew double digits, strong double digits I should say. As they did in Japan and yet Japan is different in a sense. There was a lot of exports in Japan perhaps helped by the yen, also helped by lumpy business related to machine-to-machine tool and automation investment or handset makers in China. And so we see a combination of that influence. As far as channel inventory is concerned, we didn't see -- keep in mind, for the last 2 quarters, we have been de-stocking our channel inventory. So what happened last quarter, we've -- especially Chinese customer jumping in and replenishing their stock, our channel inventory also went up. Overall, our total channel inventory went up about less than mid-single digits overall. So, while it did go up, it's in a limited basis. So most of the OEMs took on the parts.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Hock, again, starting on the wireless side. First part of the question looking a little bit backwards and the second part looking forward. Can you just talk through what you saw happen in the July quarter? The growth of about 3%, it was about 5 points less than you expected. And if we look forward beyond the October quarter, just for an idea of how you view seasonality in your wireless business.","Hock E. Tan","Seasonality, as it used to, in past years, seems to have largely, not totally, but largely disappeared. And frankly, it disappeared because the timing of phone launches, at least with the markets where we address, seems to have overridden that seasonal trends. So it's more the timing, and especially the timing of large phone OEM makers. In this particular case, I'll start with Q4, what we are seeing here is -- our strength here is seen by 2 of our largest customers in wireless are launching their next-generation phone platforms almost at the same time, very interesting. And so we are seeing, basically, revenue aggregating, I guess, in one quarter. Probably another quarter beyond that one. Not making a forecast here, but it seems it will probably run over, does it's effect of this quarter and you'll probably rollover to the quarter after that, but in a very, very strong manner. Now they're not the only guys who -- because we seem to see some other phone OEM makers, we're also launching new phone platforms somewhere over the current September, October, November timeframe also, especially September, October timeframe. So everybody seems to rush in and maybe that's also tied to seasonality for Christmas. I just happen to think that maybe a larger part of it is they choose to do it all at the same time, by coincidence or maybe not so coincident. And that's what's happening this quarter. Meanwhile, back to last quarter. Last quarter was, obviously, a different interest because there wasn't any particular large phone launches, that we see for ourselves, that would benefit us last quarter. It was more a broad-based sustainability of smartphone OEM customers coming in for demand. And it was pretty nice too, because it still enabled us to grow 3%, maybe less than what we had expected. But, all things considered, wasn't too bad from our perspective. But it was more a variety of the other multiple phone makers all sustaining, and in some cases, launching new programs that kept our revenue and then sustained our wireless revenue last quarter. This particular quarter is unusually impact of 2 big guys and several other small guys launching new phone programs.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. I guess, as my follow-up. On the wired side of things, if you take the CyOptics out of it, for answering this part of the question, seems like you grew about 17%, 18% organically quarter-over-quarter in July and you're implying guidance of 4% or 5% in the October quarter. Can you just talk through what drove the big upside and then why the slowdown, a little bit, from a sequential perspective? Is it inventory? What, did you fill a channel? Whatever the case may be.","Hock E. Tan","Now most of our -- excluding CyOptics, most of our wired infrastructure business, do not go through distribution, right away. Most of it goes right direct to our large OEM customers. The likes of Cisco, among others, in Juniper and there is others. And, well, I mean we saw pretty decent growth in Q3, in fact, very good growth in Q3, especially on the ASIC side. We probably expect to see a bit of a pause, as is typical, and we're going by that. Having said that, on the fiber side, we're continuing to see a lot of strength, especially now with the return of core routing this particular Q4 quarter. So, yes, when we weigh these 2 things together, which is basically a relative slowdown after very robust Q3 for ASIC but continuing strength in our fiber. And that hasn't slowed down, in our view, from Q3. We probably do not expect the 18% sequential growth in Q3 to be able to sustain in Q4. But it's nothing to do with any fundamental trends in the end market. The fundamental trend is data center spending. This continues to sustain and be strong and the conversion in this data center spending, the build out, rollout of data centers, not just in America, in China as well, is driving a lot of demand for","40G optical transceivers, as well as the switches and routing, the switches, especially data centers switches that go through a bid that will drive our ASIC business. So that's still there, that's the strength from Q3 to Q4 unchanged. And what is now thrown into the Q4 mix is core routing. But offsetting that is we do not expect our ASIC demand, our shipment, to be as strong in Q4 as it has been in Q3.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.","Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Hock, can you talk about traction in FBAR for the Chinese handset market, what you're seeing there from some of the larger suppliers in China and then also what the implications are for ASPs and margins in that market?","Hock E. Tan","Well, as I've always mentioned in prior conference calls, FBAR is used -- has been used -- continues to be used only because customers have really no choice but to use it and it's because of certain bands, SAW filter doesn't work as well and FBARs are used. And when you focus on China, the same thing does apply in the sense that TD-LTE does require FBAR as due because of the interaction coexistence, so to speak, with Wi-Fi. And so we are seeing demand for those FBAR filters in China very nicely, ramping up very nicely. And in some of those -- and in -- while it's -- basically, we -- we do see competition now. We expect to see competition. But that's not unexpected. And for us, our demand continues to be very solid in China as TD-LTE handsets starts to roll out more and more.","Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And do you see at some point any more diversification within the handset business from the 2 big suppliers today? Or how would you frame that looking out 12 to 18 months in terms of how the mix may evolve?","Hock E. Tan","You're talking about handset makers?","Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Your exposure to the 2 big guys, just...","Hock E. Tan","Oh, diversification, I don't know the answer to that. I'm really unable to comment on that because it very much depends on how those guys perform with their products out in the marketplace. And boy, if I do know that, I'll be doing another occupation eventually [indiscernible], but no, it's very hard. And so I do not know if it can be diversified. Right now, it's fairly diversified, I might add. The 2 largest handset OEMs, I might add, is -- represents what we sell to them, represents less than the rest of our handset revenues, our wireless revenues.","Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes. Maybe just a quick one for Tony on CyOptics. You mentioned OpEx a little lighter in the quarter. Can you just talk about, as you go forward, the operating leverage there? And then also, as you switch to components, do you still feel good about bringing their gross margins up?","Anthony Maslowski","Yes, so to go backwards on your questions, the gross margin plan is still intact. I think we started off of maybe a little better base than what we anticipated when we first purchased CyOptics. So we think that the vision we gave of leaving Q4 of 2014 with the 4 as the first digit is gross margin is very doable and we have line of sight to that. So I think that's going fairly well. I think on the operating expense side, it was -- we were thinking that it'd be 3 to 4. It ended up being slightly below 3 for CyOptics. And we don't see any specific operating expense growth there. So, again, R&D is they spend less than we do as a corporate average. In SG&A, they spend less than we do on a corporate average. So they leverage to our bottom line short of taxes, okay?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Hock, on the competitive landscape, again. Recently, TriQuint, as you saw, reported good results, gave very strong guidance. I'm wondering, are you seeing customers becoming more comfortable with that TriQuint solution? Or is it just that they are also reporting good results, you are also giving good outlook, that it's just a sign of the overall Bo [ph] and FBAR market being very strong? In general, what is the view around the competitive landscape as we look out over the next year?","Hock E. Tan","Well, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we see that competitive landscape in FBAR filters and filters, in general, particularly, be evolving very much as we expect it to. I mean, we will never expect they will be the only player in this market. I will always -- we want to be the best and most successful player in this market. And we have been to date and we expect to continue to do so. And to answer your specific first question on -- related to TriQuint, I mean, TriQuint is a competitor, a good competitor, I might add. And what I'm trying to get at is as far as what they guided, I can't comment on. But certainly, what we guided, we do not really see ourselves losing any market position, as I mentioned in my opening result. If anything else, we continue to strengthen our markets when we continue to see evaluated sockets that we are able to position ourselves very well in. And I should add, and we continue to hold our profitability in this business very, very well.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","All right. And as my follow-up, Hock, as I look back, in the first half, you had expressed confidence that all 3 cylinders of your business, right, wireless, wired and industrial, are growing. I'm curious, what is the confidence as you look out the next couple of quarters? Do you still see sort of broader base growth among your businesses? Or still, do you think wireless is going to be the main growth driver?","Hock E. Tan","Well, that's interesting. You're asking for a long-term thing, not just a couple of quarters that passed. Tell me out 1 year or out, and I'll be -- I'll tell you, we expect gradual industrial recovery because industrial, over the past and before this quarter and last -- especially before Q3 last fiscal quarter, industrial as an overall end market demand, has actually declined. And it's a secular decline, in my view. And I think we are seeing a gradual steady recovery of industrial that has happened with recovery of various economies. And with the fact that China needs to spend some money on infrastructure development, no doubt they are not -- maybe not as large as it used to be in 2010. But still, they need to spend, as we pointed out, this quarter for Q3. And they continue to spend this quarter on power distribution, power generation and high-speed transportation. We see -- and we see a recovery gradually of America and even the European economies. So I see industrial over the past -- next 12 months to gradually recover. We see from our end, we will go improve with the tide. As far as wired infrastructure is concerned, we have quite a few fairly exciting products that are very unique, very proprietary, very valuable to several of our OEM -- large OEM customers, which will launch over the next 12 months, which will enable us, we believe, to outperform even the enterprise networking industry. And so we see that as really a strong growth pattern. And within all this, in the context of all this, we see our wireless business, if you look at it year-on-year, grow at about 10% to 20% year-on-year. And we have been doing that around mid-teens for the last 3 years or so, and I don't see that changing. Is within a year, the wireless business does get rather seasonal, as someone put it earlier, I call it more volatile within a year as we move quarter-to-quarter. But when you look year-on-year, our wireless business has been steadily growing at around 15% a year. And the funny part about it is I do expect over the next 12 months or so that, probably, our wired infrastructure business might even outgrow our wireless business.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Let me put in one last one for Tony, if I may. Tony, could you remind us of the CapEx plans for your FBAR fab capacity? And as you begin to ramp some of those CapEx plans down, is there a possibility of increasing shareholder returns through dividends and buybacks?","Anthony Maslowski","Again, in reverse order, we're still committed to the dividend program, and we'll continue to look at that on a quarterly basis. And you've seen our history and what we've done with that. The share buyback program is something we're getting more consistent on. And I think you'll see after a couple of quarters the consistency there. So I don't think those will be necessarily impacted by anything we do on the CapEx side. As for our FBAR expansion plans, we're in kind of the last phase right now of the current expansion plan. And I'd like to remind everyone that everything we've spent pretty much in the wireless area has been for capacity. There has been no huge R&D, CapEx expenditure here to date. It's all been capacity adds. And we're finishing that up at the end of this year. A little bit will trail into next year. And we're actually going through the process of setting the plan for next year, so it's a little too early for me to comment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of JoAnne Feeney with ABR Investment Strategy.","JoAnne Feeney","I just wanted to get a little bit more of the detail of the competition that you might be seeing in your RF world. In particular, what's your view currently of the Asia suppliers of FBAR-type filters and the use of some of your competitors in power amps who don't have their own filter supply? How is that being addressed? And are you seeing increasing competition from some of the Asian suppliers there?","Hock E. Tan","Well, I guess, let me try to address it in a broader context, JoAnne. What you're really asking, if I could put it in a simple -- in a more direct context, is, are we seeing a lot of competition in FBAR filters? I would preface that by saying, we always have competition from SAW filter manufacturers, from SAW filters. SAW filters may not perform as well as FBAR, but in many, many bands, they perform adequately. And given the price differential between FBAR and SAW filters, many phone makers prefer to use SAW filter cost point of view. Having said that, the increasing number of bands, some of them in China and in Europe and even North America, where those bands require the use of FBAR filters or duplexes, I should say, or filters, in order to get -- receive signals in an adequate -- in a satisfactory manner to meet those specs. And in those areas, we have, as I mentioned in my remarks, seen some emerging players showing up and offering those kind of -- similar kind of FBAR filters, perhaps. That's true. Having said that, we are still, by far, larger. We are still also, in terms of technology and design performance, by far, well ahead of all those. But having said that, we are not taking that -- we are not -- we're obviously taking those competitions seriously, and we will continue to do that. And the way we do that and stay ahead of the game is we continue to design filters faster and better even in terms of next-generation filters for the same band, much better than our competition. And really, it's all about staying ahead in the marketplace. We do see some of that. But as I pointed out earlier regarding an earlier question related to the same thing, we're still very far ahead of the curve, and we intend to remain that way. And we certainly intend to differentiate ourselves either on a discrete basis by having very high-performing filters for some of the phones or bands in China that requires those filters in TD-LTE and Wi-Fi or that we couple it with, as you pointed out, power amplifiers, very good performing amplifiers, to create what we call front-end modules or pads, which takes away -- which removes a lot of competition from players who either do not have FBAR filters or do not have power amplifiers [indiscernible], okay? And that's -- there are not many players out there who have both FBAR filters and power amplifiers, and by that, I mean have those capability in a very, very advanced and technologically progressive manner. There are very few out there.","JoAnne Feeney","Great. And then for a follow-up question, with your wireline or wired infrastructure business, clearly serving some growing demand in China, I'm wondering if you could describe for us the way you serve that business. You have 2 main U.S. players, like Cisco and Juniper. I'm wondering at your exposure to other equipment suppliers.","Hock E. Tan","We believe -- JoAnne, to answer your question, as I mentioned earlier, most of our businesses in wireline or wired infrastructure, I should say, we sell both fiber optic transceivers and high-speed SerDes-based ASICs, tend to be direct to those OEM customers. And obviously, there are not that many of them around that does those kind of -- and we focus on enterprise networking, enterprise basically rather than telecoms for transport. And I conclude, as part of enterprise, data centers guides a new breed of players who are coming in and building their own data centers, people like Google, as an example, or Facebook or Amazon, among others. So there's a mix of players there. But having said that, our core customers are the likes of Ciscos, Junipers and a few other OEM names, which we support very closely, we develop products that are, in some cases, unique and proprietary to these people so that they can effectively provide a solution sale to the likes of Google, Amazon and others as well. And so it's a situation both in ASICs and fiber interconnects but particularly the proprietary version of fiber. They have very close engagement with those customers. And we continue to be very, very closely engaged, obviously because we do have technology that those customers value very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research","Hock, to put a little bit finer point on it, are you seeing demand for TD-LTE filters now? Or are most of your bookings still U.S. and European bands? And if you could maybe give us a feel for how is the revenue wait for the Chinese LTE bands, like 41, 30, 38 versus, say, 13 and 17, which are already out there now. And then I have a couple of follow-ups on the industrial side.","Hock E. Tan","To answer your question on that, on the waiting, don't have answer to you. I don't have that ratio in my mind. But it is increasing very fast. And obviously, to answer your question, yes, we do see demand for TD-LTE bands right now for filters and BAs [ph]. But in terms of ratio, sorry, I can't answer your question on that. I don't have the data.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research","And I know a lot of people have asked about the additional competitors, but other than TriQuint, which both has SAW filters and the gas amplifiers, have any of the new competitors combined those 2? Or are you looking at more or less pairings of gasoline houses pairing up with TDK or TAIYO YUDEN to try and roll into a pad? Is that the new competitors you're looking at?","Hock E. Tan","No. I don't think we have really seen any of that landscape, any of those changes in landscape happening yet. I'm speculating to some extent when I say that. But all I merely said was that if the architecture of phones move towards pads or front-end modules with both power amplifiers and filters within a single module, there are not many players out there with the way we've done, with the capability or capacity to handle in large volumes both in the same -- both power amplifiers and filters in the same front-end module. That might be a bit challenging. But that aside, even in filters, FBAR filters, in its own right, okay? As I mentioned, we're in generation #8 or 9 in FBAR filters. And now simple, simple strategy to stay ahead, way ahead of competition, is to keep innovating and developing products that are -- that gets better and better and more and more cost-effective for our customers.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research","I apologize, I'm a little confused then. Outside of the pad business, we'll just leave off the table for now. It's basically been you and TriQuint and the high-performance filter, you both expanded capacity. I'm sure you follow your competitors well. There always have been sampled filters from maybe 2 other vendors in Japan on Bo [ph]. But they've never really been competitive, and they never had any capacity to produce them in volume. Has that changed now? Is that what you're saying in terms of a third competitor? Or are you saying the landscape's always evolving and you've got TC SAW and you've got all these other technologies and that's providing competition? But in essence, the competitive environment in high-performance production Bo [ph] is the same as it's always been?","Hock E. Tan","SAW filters is still very prevalent. And we see people always -- or we see other emerging players always offering what we call similar Bo [ph] or FBAR filters. And by the way, TriQuint does it in Bo [ph], not FBAR filters, and fairly different in many ways. And we don't see the landscape changing that dramatically. It's evolving. There are new players and only new players coming in. And by the way, the SAW filter guys, we don't underestimate either, because they get their products out better and better every year as well. And we contend -- as we've been contending their reviews. But in terms of -- from a bigger perspective, overall landscape, has things dramatically changed? No. Answer is no.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research","Great. And then you've underestimated demand for a few quarters running now. Are you adjusting your mythology to track it better? Or are you satisfied with your more kind of conservative approach to it?","Hock E. Tan","We always try to be conservative, Ed, because it makes your plan -- makes the results of wrong planning come out better. So we do try to be a bit somewhat conservative.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ian Ing with Lazard Capital Markets.","Ian Ing - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","First question, optics from the data center, where are we in this 10 GB to 40 GB transition, I guess, to QSFP? And do you have any color around 100 GB, whether it's [indiscernible] business? And are you seeing Cisco's captive offerings as of yet?","Hock E. Tan","Let's start with 10 to 40. Well, when, right, I think, in the midst of -- for large data centers -- a lot of large data centers, we're in the midst of seeing build-outs of data centers that uses 40 GB, obviously, because there's -- it's 4x the bandwidth for every port. So we are seeing a lot of that happening. And it's interesting, simultaneous to that happening, we are obviously seeing a lot, as we have been seeing for the past 12 months, and continuing acceleration of doing conversion of 1 GB to 10G. Well, that's also happening. But certainly, what we've seen over the last several months is very, very strong surge for 40G. And that -- a lot of that are going to obviously large data centers, large build-out data centers [indiscernible] for social networking or just in some situations, perhaps, a traditional enterprise spending. But we tend to see a lot of it more in those guys doing cloud infrastructure. So that's very, very strongly happening. But within enterprise data centers, 100 GB, we are not seeing it, obviously. That's why 40 GB is happening. 100 GB, 100G in, I guess, equipment, 100G interconnect are just interconnect being for short-reach data centers as opposed to the telecoms, fiber optics, transport. From the enterprise point of view, very little of that, if any, has happened. I think there's more. 100G will be more of a 2015 event rather than right now. Right now, what we're seeing is more 40G.","Ian Ing - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay, helpful. And then in wireless, you mentioned that the high-end has softened a bit. I mean, looking at the design wins pipeline, do you see any downshift to some lower-cost, more mid-tier LTE phones? And how should we think of the content trends given the cut in ASPs? Would RF face some pressure here?","Hock E. Tan","Well, see, it's -- a really funny trend is happening, which might be a bit confusing, is we -- yes, I did comment in my prepared remarks that high-end smartphones have been growing very fast for the last few years, have certainly appeared to have slowed down as apparent from launches by a few large OEMs that have kind of disappointed. So maybe that -- so on the high-end side smartphones, high-end smartphones have slowed down, though I think low-end smartphones conversion from feature phones are still continuing very well. So that's one trend. But in the other side -- the opposite side of the trend is in a lot of smartphones, especially even the high-end smartphones that appeared to have slowed down, the content is accelerating. We are now talking about smartphones that has and going to 10 bands in 1 phone. And over the next 1 to 2 years, 2 years -- within 2 years, going to over 15 bands in 1 phone. And that's probably because of the proliferation of bands, LTE especially coming in, and the requirement for LTE phones, as I many times pointed out, to be backward interoperable with 3G, which has a whole [indiscernible] UMTS, which has multiple bands. And even back to EDGE, 2G or CDMA, which has itself its own set of bands. So when you add it all up, each phone, each smartphone begins to carry a fairly sizable amount of bands. And as you know, each of those bands require their own peculiar unique RF composing nature and components. So content is what drives it. That's what we are seeing now. Of course, I love for my 2 largest OEMs to keep growing share and grow bigger as other OEMs that has bought. But reality of what we are very good at is, as I said, we're getting more and more content in those same phones.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Doug Freedman with RBC Capital Markets.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Hock, you mentioned you're having some difficulty keeping up with demand. What are your present lead times? And is there any risk that as those lead times come in maybe next quarter, that we could see some related softness around that?","Hock E. Tan","I can't determine what's going to happen in the next quarter of ours. But what I have in this quarter is I'm ramping as aggressively as we could. And it's very fortunate that we have put in place our expanded capacity, as Tony alluded to, in our FBAR wafer fabs and related back-end lines that we are able to try draw that. But lead times for us is [indiscernible] -- we're trying to do it as fast as we can. Customers are not really asking -- these large OEM customers don't look for lead time, they look for supportability as fast as possible. And our capacity, our enlarged capacity, actually, is enabling us to address that.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then as my last question, my follow-up, really looking at the 40 GB market, we've heard from some peers talk about that market being a little weaker than they had expected. You guys clearly aren't seeing that. I'm having a little trouble reconciling that. But they also mentioned that they were seeing a little bit more price pressure in the 40 GB market. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing on the ASP front in that market?","Hock E. Tan","Well, let me be very precise here. When we stepped -- we sell -- when we referred to 40 GB, in particular, it's wired enterprise networking for us, which include data centers. There are 2 subsystems or components we sell in this market. There's the ASICs we support, selected OEM customers' ways. And many of these ASICs, especially, go into this new generation of switching switches and routers that are -- that -- which -- that supports 40G data transport -- data transfers, I should say. So that one, we are one step removed, but that's obviously what you're referring to as much because we don't sell boxes, we sell ASICs. And they are pretty much extended prices predetermined years ago. And then the other part of business we sell is fiber optics transceivers or interconnects, you want to call it that, that populate and allow data to be transferred from 1 switch -- from a switch to the server -- to another switch or router. And those -- where we sell those are in the enterprise short-reach data centers, as well as enterprise networking. And here, I'll be direct, we see very little competition, much less price degradation. Okay, maybe you're referring to 40 GB long-reach transport for metro networks and those stuff. And that, by the way, we now have visibility through our acquisition of CyOptics, whereas CyOptics sales do sell and continue -- has been selling the lasers and chip components to support module makers who make those products to sell into that space. And that's possible because 40G single mode for data transport, metro networks have been around now for a couple of years, at least, if not longer and for quite a while now. And those probably have seen some price competition, especially on the module side, but not on the enterprise networking side of the whole thing, where you're talking more short reach in data transfers.","Thomas Krause","Thank you, operator.

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Ashish Saran, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Ashish Saran","Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are Hock Tan, President and CEO; and Tony Maslowski, Chief Financial Officer of Avago Technologies.","After the market closed today, Avago distributed a press release and financial tables describing our financial performance for the first quarter fiscal year 2015. If you did not receive a copy, you may obtain the information from the Investors section of Avago\u2019s website at www.avagotech.com.","This conference call is being webcast live and a recording will be available via telephone playback for one week. It will also be archived in the Investors section of our website at avagotech.com. During the prepared comments section of this call, Hock and Tony will be providing details of our first quarter fiscal year 2015 results, background to our second quarter fiscal year 2015 outlook and some commentary regarding the business environment. We will take questions after the end of our prepared comments.","In addition to U.S. GAAP reporting, Avago reports certain financial measures on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the tables attached to today\u2019s press release.","Comments made during today\u2019s call will primarily refer to our non-GAAP financial results. Please refer to our press release today and our recent filings with the SEC for information on the specific risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Hock Tan. Hock?","Hock Tan","Thank you, Ashish. Good afternoon, everyone. Now I see all are aware today we announced the Acquisition of Emulex Corporation. Emulex is very complementary to Avago\u2019s enterprise storage businesses, and aligns very well with the Avago business model. It is a leading supplier of fiber channel and related products selling primarily into server and enterprise storage OEMs that Avago currently serves with our SAS rate and PCI Express switching and fiber optics products.","We expect this transaction to allow us to offer one of the broadest suites of silicon and software storage solutions to the enterprise and data center markets.","Now I would turn on to more mundane matters related to our recent business performance. And Tony will provide a summary of our first quarter fiscal year 2015 financial results.","Revenue for our first quarter was $1.66 billion, an increase of 3% from the prior quarter. In particular, wireless growth was much better than expectations with revenue growing sequentially versus the flat to slightly down outlook we had provided during our fourth quarter earnings call. Wired and enterprise storage held up well but industrial did show seasonal declines.","Now turning to a discussion of our segments, starting with wireless. In the first quarter, as noted, revenue from our wireless segment grew 6% sequentially. Wireless represented 40% of our total revenue from continuing operations. And compared to the last quarter last year wireless revenue grew 90%.","Within the quarter, we saw stronger than expected demand from our large North American Smartphone OEM, which shall remain nameless, and by which enable us to achieve another quarter of record wireless revenue. Given these levels of growth, coupled with our expectation for additional FBAR filter content in upcoming Smartphone generations, we expect to remain capacity constrained through the balance of this year even as we continue to grow our FBAR capacity over the next 12 months.","As you know, we have expanded our Fort Collins fab capacity multiple fold over the past few years but demand has continued to exceed expectations.","Turning to second quarter of fiscal \u201815, similar to prior years, we expect a sharp seasonal some even call it product lifecycle related decline and demand from our large North American Smartphone OEM. However, this decline is expected to be partially offset by product ramp and another large handset OEM where our designs have resulted in substantial RF content.","Nonetheless, we do expect wireless revenue to decline sequentially somewhat in the low-teens. Year-over-year however, we expect to maintain our trajectory of strong growth in this business with second quarter revenue projected to grow over 65% from the same quarter last year.","Our strategy and capability to offer highly integrated RF front-end solutions incorporating very high performance above filters has been a key driver of our success.","Moving on to enterprise storage. In the first quarter, enterprise storage revenue came in as expected growing about 5% sequentially driven by strength in enterprise and data center spend. Enterprise storage represented 29% of our total revenues from continuing operations. In HDD - in hard-disk drive, revenues grew by mid-single-digit sequentially.","In server and storage connectivity, we also had a good first quarter, with revenue growing in the mid-single-digit sequentially. This growth was driven by the start of the granularly-based server refresh cycle as well as a strong attach rate for our 12 gigabit SAS and rate solutions.","Looking forward to the second quarter, in server and storage connectivity, we expect strong growth from increasing adoption of our PCI Express switches and sustain SAS and rate shipments. While we expect to see seasonal decline in hard-disk drives, our custom flash controller business in NAND have been ramping. Putting these factors together, we expect low single-digit sequential revenue growth for our enterprise storage segment.","On to wired infrastructure and enterprise segment. Our wired segment performed somewhat below expectations in first quarter, revenue declining by 1% sequentially. Wired revenue now represents 21% of our total revenue from continuing operations.","ASIC revenue was up slightly on a sequential basis with strong growth in Ethernet switching, thanks to our various OEM customers, partially offset by declines in carrier routing and high performance computing. As expected, our fiber optics business declined from that of the prior quarter. We saw a growth in power optics shipments into carrier routing more than offset by expected declines from our Ethernet and standard Ethernet transceiver products, especially 40 gigabit, which took a pause after a strong fourth quarter.","However, the second quarter of fiscal \u201815 in this segment is looking very different. We expect growth in both our ASIC businesses and our fiber optics business. In our ASIC business, we actually expect very strong growth from enterprise switching and routing as well as in storage.","In fiber optics, we\u2019re expecting more moderate growth in 40G shipments driven by increase in demand from the hyper scale data center market. And we are also continuing to see strength in fiber optics demand from fiber to the home and LTE base stations especially in China. As a result, we expect at least mid-single-digit sequential growth for our wired segment.","And finally, moving to industrial, in the first quarter, our industrial segment performed below expectations with revenue declining by 4% sequentially. Industrial represented about 10% of our total revenues from continuing operations. Re-sales in this segment declined sequentially in this very seasonally weak quarter, with broad declines across all regions except Asia which remained stable from that of the prior quarter.","As you know, we recognized revenue on shipping - to our shipping bases to our distributors. And during this period our industrial product revenues that is shipped into our distributors also declined at a consistent rate to industrial resale as we maintain very tight inventory in the channel less than two-month\u2019s net inventory.","Looking in the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we expect sequential recovery in our industrial segment. In particular, we\u2019re seeing strength in North America and Europe, reflecting this recovery and the need to replenish and the need and demand I would add by distributors to replenish the very low levels of inventory at these distributors, we expect to see sequential revenue growth in the mid-teens for our industrial business.","With this, let me summarize. I\u2019m pleased to report that we had a very strong start to fiscal \u201815 with 3% sequential revenue growth in the first quarter due to strong quarter in wireless, good growth in enterprise storage despite flattish wired infrastructure demand and a decline in industrial.","Turning to second fiscal quarter, as in past years as you may know, we have only seen sharp second quarter sequential declines in our wireless business due to seasonal product cycles in the handset markets. This is no different, and we are expecting our wireless revenue to be down in the low teens from the prior quarter.","However, what is different this year is we expect it to offset most of the wireless decline with strength from our three other segments, wired up mid-single-digits, enterprise storage up low to mid-single-digits, industrial up in the mid-teens. And as a result, we expect our second quarter consolidated revenues to be roughly flat from that of the prior quarter.","With that, let me now turn the call over to Tony for a more detailed review on first quarter fiscal 2015 results.","Tony Maslowski","Thank you, Hock, and good afternoon everyone. Before reviewing first quarter fiscal year 2015 financial results, I want to remind you that my comments today will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results from continuing operations unless otherwise specifically noted. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP data is included in the earnings release issued today and is also available on our website at www.avagotech.com.","Revenue of $1.66 billion in the first quarter represents an increase of 3% from the prior quarter. Revenue from our wireless segment came in better than our expectations. The enterprise storage segment performed as expected, and we saw weaker than expected revenue from the wired and the industrial and other segments.","Foxconn was a greater than 10% customer in the first fiscal quarter. Our first quarter gross margin from continuing operations was 59%, which was just above our guidance range of 56.5% to 58.5%, primarily due to better revenue mix and higher manufacturing yields.","Turning to operating expenses, R&D expenses were $210 million and SG&A expenses were $83 million, driving total operating expenses for the first quarter to $293 million, $8 million below guidance, primarily because of the lower than anticipated spending on certain R&D engineering materials. Due to capacity constraints, some materials initially intended for R&D projects were instead used to build products for customer shipments. And we expect this to continue in the second quarter. As a percentage of sales, R&D was 13% and SG&A was 5% of net revenue.","Operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $681 million and represented 41% of net revenue. Taxes came in at $35 million for the first quarter, slightly below our guidance given a quarter ago. This was primarily due to a change in the jurisdictional mix of income and the retroactive reinstatement in the quarter of the U.S. Federal Research and Development tax credit.","First quarter net income was $596 million and earnings per diluted share were $2.09. First quarter interest expense was $54 million. Other income net was $4 million.","Our share based compensation in the first quarter was $49 million. The breakdown of the expense for the first quarter includes $6 million in cost of goods sold, $19 million in R&D and $24 million in SG&A. In the second quarter fiscal 2015, we anticipate share based compensation to be approximately $52 million.","Our annual equity grant will typically occur in the second fiscal quarter of the year. Starting this fiscal year, we\u2019re switching to a solely RSU-based equity award program, instead of a combination of option and RSU awards. Just as a reminder, our definition of non-GAAP net income excludes share based compensation expense.","Moving on to the balance sheet, our day sales outstanding were 39 days, an improvement from the prior quarter\u2019s 42 days. Our inventory ended at $500 million. Days on hand were 67 days, which decreased 3 days from the fourth quarter as we reduced inventory which we had built up in prior quarters to support the strong growth in our wireless segment. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.6 billion and we generated $481 million in operational cash flow.","Our first quarter is also when we pay our annual bonuses relating to the prior fiscal year. In the first quarter, we spent $162 million on capital expenditures. On November 18 2014, in our first fiscal quarter of 2015, we closed the sale of the Axxia business and received approximately $650 million in cash.","On December 31, 2014, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.35 per ordinary share, which consumed $89 million of cash. This dividend was raised by $0.03 from the prior quarter. Since the inception of our dividend program in second quarter of 2011 to date, our financial performance has allowed us to increase our dividend each quarter.","As a reminder, our board reviews and determines our dividend policy on a quarterly basis. Based on our financial performance and condition, the contractual provisions related to our outstanding indebtedness and other factors deemed relevant by our board. During the quarter, we did not repurchase any shares.","In the second quarter of 2015, we anticipate paying approximately $600 million towards reducing our outstanding term-loan which will reduce our annual interest expense by about $22 million based on current interest rates.","In addition, as we announced today, we expect to invest approximately $600 million for the Acquisition of Emulex Corporation. And we currently expect this transaction to close in the second half of our fiscal 2015. We expect this acquisition to be immediately accretive to earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis.","We plan to align Emulex with Avago\u2019s business model over the course of our fiscal year 2016 and once aligned, we expect Emulex businesses to contribute approximately $250 million to $300 million in annual net revenue with improved operating margins.","Now let me turn to our non-GAAP guidance for second quarter of fiscal year 2015. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business condition and we do not intend to update this guidance. This guidance is for results from continuing operations only.","Net revenue is expected to be in the range of down 3% to up 1% from the first quarter. Gross margin is expected to be 58.5%, plus or minus one percentage point. Operating expenses are estimated be approximately $294 million. Taxes are forecasted to be approximately $37 million. Net interest expense and other is expected to be approximately $49 million, which anticipates paying approximately $600 million towards the reducing of our outstanding term loan within the quarter. And finally, the diluted share count forecast is for 289 million shares.","That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","John Pitzer","Yes, good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on the strong results. Hock, I guess, my first question is around FBAR capacity and CapEx. CapEx in the January quarter was down sequentially, a little bit lower than I would have thought. Are you guys still on target for sort of that $600 million for the year and by how much do you think that that will increase your FBAR capacity and how do we think about linearity of that spend?","Hock Tan","Why don\u2019t I let Tony take that on, especially on your CapEx?","Tony Maslowski","So, we\u2019re still on track for full-year $600 million. We had probably about $15 million to $20 million that were right on the edge of the quarter that could have gone either way. And that\u2019s why we guided to the new number for Q2. And then, as we said before, we believe that FBAR capacity will increase significantly this year.","Hock Tan","By the end or to be more precise, by the middle of next year, we expect our FBAR capacity to be double what it is currently.","John Pitzer","Hock, that\u2019s very helpful. And then, I guess, maybe sticking on FBAR as a follow-up, so the North American customer comes down in the April quarter but that\u2019s offset by content growth at another customer. I\u2019m kind of curious if you can give us Hock, an update on what you\u2019re seeing relative to FBAR content in the China market specifically and how you think that might trend over time?","Hock Tan","Well, it\u2019s never a monotonic increase in capacity, but then it\u2019s a question that always we think about real hard. But it\u2019s just that as more and more phones become multiple band enabled, where you can roam multiple locations. And now, if you ask specific, that\u2019s broadly worldwide. But if you ask specifically China, there are multiple categories of those phones in China, even if they are Smartphone. They are those unique to China.","And for those phones that are smartphones that are unique to China, obviously the Chinese LTE bands, by the way, are very much bands that do use a very what I call friendly to FBAR usage. And couple that with the tendency to make them Wi-Fi enable and then you basically increase the number of bands requiring FBAR in those phones.","So to answer your question, the Chinese phones tend to be very FBAR friendly. Now it\u2019s not always that way because there are ways they can do to curtail performance and therefore substitute FBAR for, perhaps, lower performing SAW filters.","And they do, do that, and there\u2019s a mix of that going on right now, particularly with the capacity constraint. But over the long term, from phones that are basically multi-band three-mode phones, going to five-mode phones, as they call them in China, you just need a fairly significant increase in FBAR content.","John Pitzer","Very helpful. Thanks, Hock, and congratulations again.","Hock Tan","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","Vivek Arya","Thanks for taking my question. And, Hock, you once again managed to surprise us with your acquisitions. Now if I look at consensus estimates for Emulex, it shows around $400 million of revenues, at around $40-ish million of net income. But I believe, Tony, you said about $250 million to $300 million of revenue, so I just wanted to get some clarification around those numbers.","Hock Tan","Sure. So basically we\u2019ll still go through the same process where certain parts of the business work closely. And what we believe is that it\u2019s going to be closer to that as the exit of 2016. So, we believe that\u2019s the revenue that we can keep long-term. And as you can tell, what that number and then we improve some of the operating margin, it\u2019s definitely accretive to future numbers.","Vivek Arya","Got it. And as my follow-up, Hock, you mentioned additional FBAR content in Next Generation phones with your flagship customers. Is that due to additional bands or are just traditional filters being replaced by FBAR? I\u2019m just trying to understand, is overall RF content going up in these flagship phones or are you gaining more share?","Hock Tan","No, it\u2019s architecture. It\u2019s really related to RF architecture and it\u2019s an RF architecture that pushes a lot and allows a lot more bands to be crammed into very limited space in smartphones to be able to handle multiple, multiple bands for world-roaming phones. And it\u2019s putting them all into modules, front-end modules which both includes power amplifiers and FBAR filters.","So, it\u2019s really architectural related and ability to contain many more bands within the same limited constraint space.","Vivek Arya","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is Gihan [ph] calling in for Ross Seymore. Hock, I was wondering, if you can discuss and give a little bit more color on some of the strategic drivers behind the Emulex Acquisition?","Hock Tan","Sure. But I really don\u2019t have much at this stage to add on than what I provided in my opening remarks which is, we believe fiber channel is an interest and fiber channel over Ethernet as well, that includes then. It\u2019s a very interesting obviously connectivity protocol. And we are very big in enterprise storage as you know, particularly after our integration - acquisition integration of LSI.","So we do have SAS as I said, we do have a setter and PCI Express with PLX acquisition and the need for high density port solution on data center connectivity. So we come across fiber channel very often adjacent to the sockets, adjacent to the systems and chips that we provide to those same OEM customers in enterprise and data centers. So it\u2019s a very logical and strategic next step for us to add fiber channel and fiber channel over Ethernet into our suite of component solutions and software.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you. And in the quarter, the wired business was down a little bit more than you had expected. Given the performance of one of your customers Nexus 9000 products, we would have thought it would have come in a little bit higher. Can you discuss the growth that we should think about for the year in the wired business?","Hock Tan","Well, it\u2019s probably more where the quarter cuts over and the timing of shipments and all that. And by the way we\u2019re not really down more than we expect. We\u2019re down 1% overall. And I call that flattish more than down. And you\u2019re right, it didn\u2019t grow as much. But since we are making up for it, in this current Q2 quarter where we expect to see high single-digit growth in our ASIC shipments to our various Enterprise networking customers.","Ashish Saran","Can we have the next question please?","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Craig Hettenbach","Yes, thanks. And a follow-up question on Emulex. As you get that portfolio to where you see the business, the run rate exiting 2016, can you provide a sense of just how longer term, what the growth outlook could be for that? And then second, just kind of within Emulex, just your approach having gone to LSI, just some background there.","Hock Tan","Well, we see that this fiber channel business is really a fairly - a very sustainable stable business. We see that long term, well, medium term let me phrase that, in the mid-single-digit growth. It\u2019s a kind of business where we see a lot of barriers to entry, obviously. And we see a very unique technology which is very hard to replicate because of all the criteria that fits our business model.","And we basically see a necessity to focus on the strength of this business, fiber channel fiber channel over Ethernet. And all that ties together for a kind of business and particularly coupled with the fact that this Emulex sells to the same kind of the enterprise OEM customers that we currently sell, with our server storage connectivity solutions. And so, all that ties together to make sure it\u2019s a very natural extension to our enterprise storage business.","And we see that, our model is mid-single digit growth annually, and improving profitability as we manage this the way we manage the rest of our businesses as Tony indicated.","Craig Hettenbach","Got it. And if I could follow-up on the ASIC business, if I go back to the Analyst Day a couple of years ago, you had talked about gaining share. Since that time you even added LSI. So, can you talk about where you stand in terms of some of the expected share gains you expect in ASIC and then also the visibility to which typically tends to be a little longer term in that market?","Hock Tan","ASIC, I never think of ASIC in terms of market share. Fortunately I just think, ASIC, we pick and choose our ASIC customers very carefully. And we support those customers simply because we have very unique technology and very expensive technology in some ways.","And in ASIC as you know, the business is tough to scale, unlike standard or ASSB products. So, our business strategy in ASIC is very strong IP and we basically are rather selective about the customers, usually OEM customers and not necessarily OEM customers, we do support certain specific data center customers too, but very selectively.","And we tend to only select those where we believe we have opportunity to grow our business very well with the particular customer we support ASIC with.","And to answer your question, in the last three years, we have been very successful. And in integrating in the LSI ASIC business to Avago Classic, which is ASIC business before the acquisition has combined to provide a business that\u2019s pretty, that\u2019s doing very well in the sense that it\u2019s roughly $700 million to $800 million.","And it has financial criteria that, meets what we need that what we need to keep reinvesting. And generating really state-of-the-art technology in terms of process libraries, in terms of the bad service in a marketplace and the most robust set of IP in memories and processing.","So, it\u2019s a business model, we believe has been very, very successful. And we\u2019d like to see the same with, by the way our storage portfolio.","Craig Hettenbach","Got it. Thanks for that Hock.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Jim Covello","Congratulations on the excellent results. Maybe first picking on the Emulex theme, obviously there\u2019s been a pretty intense competitive environment over the years with QLogic in that space. When you think about that mid-single-digit revenue growth you\u2019re targeting, how much are you factoring in additional incremental competition and balance that against some of the incremental capability that you can add in filters or other things into that market?","Hock Tan","We do balance both in, and we believe by the way that the market is relatively stable, maybe you call the word bottom-out, but I call it stable. And what brings in a lot of stability to the market is Jim, as you probably may know is fiber channel over Ethernet as well, which sort of counteracts some perhaps slight declines in certain situations like Unix-based servers. But overall we think it is there.","And we believe we can bring in certain capabilities, certain features and performance that would enable us to grow this not much but we believe in the mid to low single-digits. That\u2019s pretty much where - what all we\u2019re looking for. And for us to be able to do that and focus on it totally, would also enable us to create operating margins, operating returns on our investment and operating margin as Tony indicated, close to the range of what we are used to for the rest of our businesses. And it won\u2019t happen over time, probably take a year.","Jim Covello","Sure, sure. And for the follow-up, you mentioned the 90% year-over-year growth in wireless. Can you help us disaggregate that between unit growth in the market and then against new customer wins and then that architectural dynamic that you talked about driving incremental growth with existing customers? So can we disaggregate it between market unit growth, Avago customer wins and then the third bucket being that architectural dynamic driving increased content? How would you break that 90% down?","Hock Tan","Well, Jim, you just answered your own question, impossible because we are comparing apples and oranges. There is definitely a change in architectural content. And as we go into new architecture of integrating into front-end modules, multiple bands of power amplifiers and filters in one module, you can compare it to a module that used to have two bands to one that now has nine bands.","And so the content increases, the dollar gets priced differently. It was, I\u2019m not trying to evade your question but I don\u2019t have an answer for you except to say that it\u2019s very different. And the market is evolving, is evolving into it\u2019s an architecture, especially where high-end smartphones, which is where a lot of our applications, a lot of our products go into - to be honest, into high-end phones. Those high-end phones can afford the rather high performance very space constrained architectures that our solutions, RF solutions provide.","In low-end smartphones, and some of them like Tri-mode phones in China, where there\u2019s only a limited number of bands needed. They can probably make do with discreet filters and power amplifiers. And they do.","And we don\u2019t really compete much in those areas. We tend to compete it towards the new architectural phones. So year-on-year that\u2019s been a distinct change.","Jim Covello","Sure; that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you and congratulations again.","Hock Tan","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Edward Snyder of Charter Equity Research. Please proceed.","Carlos Renegachie","This is Carlos Renegachie [ph] for Ed. One for Tony, there has been several comments over the last few quarters about your filter fab running full, but you\u2019ve also said that CapEx or expanded more capacity pays for itself well within a year. So given the rate of spending that you guys have had all through 2014, is it safe to assume that the capacity of your FBAR fab was materially higher at the end of 2014 than at the beginning?","Tony Maslowski","Yes, that\u2019s correct. And as Hock mentioned, we\u2019re going to go through another doubling here some time in \u201816 - mid \u201816 or so. So no, we still believe in \u201816, we still firmly believe that the CapEx spending in FBAR is wildly justified. And again, we\u2019re still very, with a cautious to eye to say that we only build what we need to build.","So, yes, this last year has been probably earmarked with kind of a 100%. And the current year is probably also as we\u2019ve mentioned, capacity constrained as well. So, not much of the dynamics have changed significantly there.","Carlos Renegachie","And then as a follow-up and along those same lines, about mid last year, you guys directed a lot of your capacity to your largest customers. Do you feel like you got enough headroom in FBAR to take back or expand your share of bar filter demand outside of your largest customer this quarter?","Hock Tan","I guess, the best way to answer your question is the honest way which is, we\u2019re very much on allocation of our FBAR capacity today. And we\u2019ve been that way now for the last several months. And we expect to be that way for the next several months.","Carlos Renegachie","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Doug Freedman","Great, thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on the strong results. I\u2019m going to ask an FBAR question as well and then I\u2019ll follow-up with a NAND question. On the FBAR, since you\u2019re doubling your capacity, if I look at your revenue run rate and you\u2019re continuing to run that capacity full, we could be looking at well north of $1 billion in a single quarter for your FBAR business.","That business does appear to run at above average corporate margins. Would you like to offer whether there\u2019s something wrong in the math that I\u2019m running and whether we should be thinking of a new peak gross margin number for your model next year?","Tony Maslowski","That\u2019s a lot of things you\u2019re throwing into same mix. Number one, $1 billion a quarter sounds fairly extreme and the reason is simply, this could be, first, we\u2019re nowhere close to $1 billion a quarter here as you know. I mean, 40% of our revenues right now is not quite there yet but I know what you mean by doubling of it. It may be one quarter but it\u2019s not the whole year.","So, I just want to make that point. You could get there in one quarter and at the right point at the peak season. But it won\u2019t sustain because of the seasonality of product lifecycles of the players in it. So, that\u2019s - I hope that answers your question.","In terms of gross margin, sure, we have never made any bones about whether that that has been a ceiling to our gross margin. All we have said is we don\u2019t know where it is, but over time as our product mix and our business became more and more efficient and our product mix hit the right spot, hit the sweet spot of certain markets.","And, sure, we do see continuing improvement or expansion of gross margin, and you see that last quarter. And you\u2019ll probably see that again in our guidance this quarter. And it\u2019s all related to product mix.","Doug Freedman","Absolutely, no, the numbers have been fabulous.","Tony Maslowski","Thank you.","Doug Freedman","The one thing I see investors have some questions regarding if the business that you sold off that services the NAND controller market versus your commentary on your introductory remarks that you have a custom NAND controller. Can you may be clear up a little bit or clarify what it is that you sold versus what pieces of the business you continue to invest in?","Hock Tan","Yes of course. Whether you pick up the little thing, but it is a fair question. Yes, we sold off our, we sold our business as well as intellectual property and capability in developing standard flash controllers for solid state drives and we did that. And we sold it off, and we do not have any standard flash controller capability of nor products nor revenues right now in our product portfolio, we sold it all off, happily too because we believe we are not prepared to keep investing into display which we believe could get very competitive.","Having said that we do retain, some intellectual property and capability within our hard disk-drive division - operating division when similar capabilities exist in terms of designs understanding how to develop flash controllers for custom flash controllers. And we do that for very selected customers sort of in a form of ASIC flash controllers for enterprise market specifically on low volume on specific customers.","And we continue to do that because that part of the business retains behind reverse. And we have the capability inherent within our hard disk-drive division, our SOC division. And if it makes money, we\u2019d be happy to do it. But it is really, it\u2019s really not the standard flash business, very different from the standard flash business which we sold off.","Doug Freedman","Great. Congratulations again.","Hock Tan","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Harlan Sur","Congratulations on a solid quarter. On the wired business, the team has been benefiting from the transition to 40 gig in the data center; however, with these new initiatives starting in the second half of this year around 25 gig and 50 gig, does this end up being another growth driver for you guys for both the ASIC and for your fiber optics business?","Hock Tan","Yes. I don\u2019t know about whether it can be a new growth driver but certainly a lot of demand for programs for us to look at develop, so these that will - and from service developing switching, fabric that dries 25 gig, and even 50 gigabit. We\u2019re by the way, we are I think one of the very few guys today with silicon, working silicon that can drive what I call 56 gigabit PEM4. I got to put in that little bit of propaganda and let you guys know that. And that drive the 50 gigabit standard that is now being promulgated through IEEE. So, this, obviously offers us opportunities given our capabilities in these specific areas, yes.","Harlan Sur","Thanks for that, Hock. And then on the enterprise storage, with the 12 gig SAS rate controllers and storage connectivity product segments, can you just kind of help us understand where we are in that upgrade cycle? Is this a tailwind for enterprise storage for the next 12 months or longer and just kind of more of the near-term strength coming from HPC or hyper scale or traditional enterprise or all of the above?","Hock Tan","A lot of it is coming from combination. Then, as you know, as you\u2019ve been hearing there is a momentum in enterprise spending and data center build-out and spending and going on. And as that happens. We couple that, we then launch of Intel Brantley that supports 12 gigabit from the previous generation 6 gigabit. So, yes, there is a tailwind as we go to that refresh cycle as it always happens would be the case and in this case, in service enterprise driving server storage connectivity.","So, we\u2019re benefiting from that. And that\u2019s partly why you see our business growing sort of mid-single-digit sequentially so far in the last couple of quarters or son. It\u2019s helped by this push that launch late last year.","Harlan Sur","Great.","Hock Tan","That doesn\u2019t - that won\u2019t sustain forever, but so far so good.","Harlan Sur","Thanks, Hock.","Operator","You next question comes from the line of Steven Chin of UBS, please proceed.","Steven Chin","Great; thanks for taking my questions, another question on the networking business, if I can. For your ASIC, I was wondering if some of the recent I guess, M&A going on in the foundry\/ASIC world, if that is benefiting you at all or not in terms of new conversations with potentially more ASIC customers? And also related to that, can you talk a little bit about how the BiDi optics at one of your customers, how that demand is proceeding so far?","Hock Tan","Okay, let me answer the first one. On the BiDi thing, I hate to say because it\u2019s exclusive to a particular customer. And I don\u2019t really want to comment on it, I\u2019m sorry about that. I hope you don\u2019t mind. But because it\u2019s exclusive to a particular customer, I prefer not to comment on it.","Now coming back to the ASIC consolidation, I don\u2019t really see that much of it on our side. And part of the reason for it is, as I say in ASIC we\u2019re not out there looking for market share. We have very unique capabilities in the sense of we are very low power, we are very leading edge process technology to working with TSMC, but we\u2019re very, very robust serializer, deserializer, very strong robust IP in memories, as well as processing.","A lot of that not just from Avago Classic but with LSI combined reverse and greater relationships with selected lease of OEMs. And who are somewhat winners in so far, in the enterprise networking business so, as they grow, we grow along with them and as I mentioned upon the remarked earlier.","So, as a particular customer announced a gain in share, we do see benefit of that. Having said that sometimes we\u2019re also supporting another customer who doesn\u2019t so they cannot balance themselves somewhat but because of our unique technology and our unique business model of trying to select various - be very selective of the customers we support, with tends to lend itself to very large successful OEMs. We do not see that much all these M&A activity you\u2019re referring to down at the ASIC business.","Steven Chin","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks, Hock. And just as a follow-up in terms of, again, the wired infrastructure business, looking a little further out beyond the current, at least mid-single-digit sequential growth that you\u2019re guiding for in Q2, I guess what kind of visibility do you have into later in the fiscal year in terms of this demand for your ASIC business, whether it\u2019s sureties or other products related to network? Thanks.","Hock Tan","Visibly it tends to be good for one to two quarters, that\u2019s it. And that\u2019s probably the lead time on our products what we demand for our products and supply chain to support those customers. One to one half quarters, that\u2019s as far as we go. Beyond that, no, we don\u2019t really have that great visibility.","Steven Chin","Great, thank you. And congrats on the strong results.","Hock Tan","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie of Raymond James. Please proceed.","Steve Smigie","Great; thanks a lot for the opportunity. Was hoping you guys could talk a little bit about the opportunity you see in the optical business this year? What sort of headwinds and tailwinds do you see off that business over the course of the year?","Hock Tan","What?","Tony Maslowski","The optical business.","Hock Tan","The hyper optics business, the transceiver business you\u2019re referring?","Steve Smigie","Correct.","Hock Tan","Well, it\u2019s a mixed bag. See, we are now we participate a lot in the data com, short reach data com. And that\u2019s nicely chugging along. There is price competition to be honest about it. But we try not to play as I\u2019ve said many times before in the standard fiber optics, lower bandwidth products, we tend to go up very fast.","We\u2019re now doing 40 gig, our sweet spot is pushing 40 gig including the BiDi that someone referred to earlier, which is 2 by 20 form of, unique form of 40 gig. And that standard 40 gig and we\u2019re pushing now 100 gig. And we\u2019re working on previous form of 100 gig and going even beyond 100 gig for our core outing. That\u2019s where our strength is, so I\u2019m really not a very good indicator of the broader fiber optics market. But in terms of data com our strength is up towards the high bandwidth.","On the lower bandwidth I can like 1 gigabit, 10 gigabit, and then for on some of the storage products like 8 gigabit and 16 gigabit, 16, is not so bad. You can mention anything below that it\u2019s a priced it\u2019s a very priced competitive environment. And we try to not be too engaged in it. I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re not. We can be because we have to support many of our OEM customers even though our share is very low.","We\u2019re now looking at - and our focus is really on higher end whether it\u2019s proprietary or not so proprietary, very high bandwidth data com. And that\u2019s growing very well. As in data centers especially, the larger data centers are pushing from 40 gig to in some cases leap-frogging 40 gig to go to 100 gig.","And of course somebody indicated 25 gig and 50 gig to provide additional opportunities. And when you start talking about 25, you\u2019re talking about having to drive short-reach or even longer reach native 25, which makes it very tough to produce laser, VCSELs, laser, so to speak, that does 25 gigabit. We are one of the few guys who can do it. And we happily sold it to guys who do 100 gigabit Infiniband today.","We are the supplier of the VCSELs for instance. So that was, is one part of it. Our other strength in telecoms is we don\u2019t do that much transceivers in long reach telecoms, except medium reach, few kilometers, in data centers.","Other than that for transport, we don\u2019t do much at all. We do provide local year-end transceivers but we do it at a component level. We\u2019re kind of like an arms dealer, and we do that very well. And for instance, we also do component level to fiber to the home in China. And that one we can provide enough products for the market, or not for the matter for LTE supporting base station fiber optics. We can provide enough of those components to those particular markets. That one, we have a pretty full set too.","Steve Smigie","Great; thanks for that color. And just as a follow-up, turning to the wireless market. You guys obviously have a lot of confidence in your business by ramping the CapEx pretty significantly there. I was hoping you could talk about this in the context of maybe four or five-year type range. Obviously, some of the great strength here has been driven by the move to LTE, or to serve LTE advanced. But it seems like, say 5G doesn\u2019t come for maybe till 2018 or 2020, so how do you keep in line adding capacity versus you\u2019ve got a lot of LTE switching over the next couple years versus the length of time before 5G starts to come in?","Hock Tan","Correct. 4G will be reversed for while LTE would be reversed as well as you know because Europe has barely begun to spend any big money. And now they are starting to U.S. already spending money and we\u2019re in the midst of China, so it\u2019s all good, not to mention the emerging countries.","But to answer your question more directly, kind of hate to disappoint you but our CapEx plan, we tend to build and I mentioned that many times before, a year ago or two years ago, so maybe a time to refresh that. But we tend to like demand in our capacity builds. We basically didn\u2019t see the whites of the eye in demand before we start rushing to build capacity. We don\u2019t build in anticipation of demand, we tend not to do that. We don\u2019t run off business that way.","Steve Smigie","Great, thank you.","Hock Tan","So if you\u2019d ask me about 5G, no, I\u2019m not even there, sorry. Not even there.","Steve Smigie","Got it.","Hock Tan","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Ashish Saran for closing remarks.","Ashish Saran","Thank you, Operator. Thank you everyone for participating in today\u2019s earnings call.

Please go ahead, sir.","Ashish Saran","Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are Hock Tan, President and CEO; and Tom Krause, Chief Financial Officer of Broadcom Limited. After market close today, Broadcom distributed a press release and financial tables describing our financial performance for the third quarter of fiscal year 2017. If you did not receive a copy, you may obtain the information from the Investor section of Broadcom\u2019s website at www.broadcom.com.","This conference call is being webcast live and a recording will be available via telephone playback for one-week. It will also be archived in the Investor section of our website at broadcom.com.","During the prepared comments section of this call, Hock and Tom will be providing details of our third quarter fiscal year 2017 results, guidance for our fourth quarter fiscal year 2017, and some commentary regarding the business environment. We will take questions after the end of our prepared comments.","Please note that starting with the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we will only provide sequential revenue guidance as a range at the consolidated company level. This is consistent with the majority of our peers and customers. Given the puts and takes at the segment level during the quarter, which often end up offsetting each other, segment guidance is often not the best representation of likely results at a company level. We will of course continue to report and comment on actual results by segment.","This fourth quarter will be a period of transition and we will provide you with some color on guidance by segment during this call before implementing our new approach to guidance in the first quarter of 2018.","In addition to U.S. GAAP reporting, Broadcom reports certain financial measures on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the tables attached to today\u2019s press release. Comments made during today\u2019s call will primarily refer to our non-GAAP financial results.","Please refer to our press release today and our recent filings with the SEC for information on the specific risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Hock Tan. Hock?","Hock Tan","Thank you, Ashish. Good afternoon, everyone. I am very pleased actually with our performance for the third fiscal quarter with solid contributions from all our segments. We delivered strong financial results with revenue, gross margin, and earnings per share, all above the midpoint of our guidance. Third quarter revenue of $4.47 billion, grew 6% sequentially and 17% year-on-year, with all segments delivering year-on-year growth.","On the income front, earnings per share were $4.10 growing by 11% sequentially and 42% year-on-year. We are also looking forward to completing the acquisition of Brocade and subject to the satisfaction of the remaining closing condition, we presently expect to close this transaction within our fourth fiscal quarter 2017. However, please note that our guidance and commentary today for the fourth quarter does not include any contribution from Brocade.","Let me now turn to a discussion of our segment results. Starting with Wired, our largest segment in the third quarter, Wired revenue was $2.2 billion, growing 5% sequentially, 7% year-on-year. The Wired segment represented 50% of our total revenue. Overall, this was a very good quarter for the segment, driven by seasonal strength in set-top boxes and robust demand from datacenters for both our merchant and custom silicon products. However, we did start to see softness in demand arising from Chinese operators for our optical and broadband access products.","Turning to the fourth quarter, we do expect Wired segment revenues to decline sequentially arising from the seasonal weakness in demand for our broadband access products industry-wide. Notwithstanding this softness, we foresee the Wired segment to continue to trend up very well on a year-on-year basis.","Moving on to the Wireless segment, in the third quarter, Wireless revenue was $1.3 billion, growing 12% sequentially and 27% year-on-year. The Wireless segment represented 29% of our total revenue. Third quarter Wireless growth was driven by the start of a ramp from our large North American smartphone customer as they started transitioning to their next-generation platform.","Revenue growth for us was further augmented by a large increase in Broadcom\u2019s total dollar content in this new platform. Ramp of this new platform is now in full stride as we begin Q4 fiscal 2017. We expect this to drive very strong sequential growth in Wireless revenue for fourth quarter and year-on-year would project strong growth in this segment as a result of our content gains.","As we also mentioned in our previous earnings call, our product shipment to support the rev this year of this North American smartphone maker were push out compared to prior years. As we look to the first quarter accordingly, our fiscal 2018. Unlike what occurred in the last two years, we presently expect Wireless revenue to hold up sequentially.","Turning to Enterprise Storage, in the third quarter Enterprise Storage revenue was $735 million and represented 16% of our total revenue. This segment grew 3% sequentially, 39% year-on-year. Growth in the quarter was primarily from our HDD products, while our server and storage connectivity business continue to hold up well.","However, as noted in our last earnings call, we do not believe this strength to be sustainable in hard disk drive and sure enough we expect a sharp decline in demand for our hard disk drive products in the fourth quarter, driven by the start of an anticipated correction in a hard disk drive market.","On the other hand, we expect our server and storage connectivity business to start to benefit from the [indiscernible] launch as it starts to ramp during the quarter. So despite these anticipated sharp correction in hard disk drive year-on-year, we expect this Enterprise Storage segment to show double-digit growth.","Finally, our last segment Industrial, in the third quarter, Industrial segment revenue was $238 million and represented 5% of our total revenue. Revenue share grew by 6% sequentially, 18% year-on-year, the strong year-on-year growth, however, included the impact from a large increase in our IP licensing revenue, which as tends to be quite lumpy in nature. Notwithstanding, the Industrial re-sales continued to trend up very firmly with high single-digit sequential growth and over 10% year-on-year growth and we expect Industrial re-sales to continue to trend up strongly in the fourth quarter.","So in summary, for the third fiscal quarter, the demand from all our markets continued to be firm and we delivered mid single-digit sequential revenue growth that was propelled by the start of the new platform ramp from a North American smartphone OEM. The operating leverage in our model enables us to drive double-digit sequential growth in our earnings per share.","Turning to the fourth quarter, even as we foresee sequential revenue declines in other segments, we project the strong wireless growth to accelerate our consolidated revenue growth sequentially by over 7%. Our year-on-year revenue growth in 2017 has been very robust with double-digit second and third quarter results and projected fourth quarter results in a similar range. Strong end markets more than just wireless have contributed to this growth, but it would not be prudent to expect this level of growth to sustain long-term.","We operate in a relatively matured end markets that we assume likely to grow over the long-term close to GDP rates or in the low single-digits. Given our strong position for our product franchises, we do not assume market share changes to contribute to our long-term revenue growth.","However, we do expect our technology innovations to continue to drive content gains and enable us to push our revenue growth rate above those of end markets. And this leads to our assumption around a very sustainable long-term year-on-year target revenue growth of mid single-digits as we have previously indicated.","With that, let me turn the call over to Tom for more detailed review of our third quarter financials and fourth quarter outlook.","Thomas Krause","Thank you, Hock and good afternoon everyone. My comments today will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results from continuing operations unless otherwise specifically noted. A reconciliation of our GAAP and our non-GAAP data is included with the earnings release issued today and is also available on our website at broacom.com.","As Hock mentioned, he went through, we did deliver very strong financial results for the third quarter, starting with the revenue at $4.57 billion, which grew by 6.3% sequentially. As he also just highlighted, year-on-year growth for the third quarter again was quite substantial at 17.5%, which is well ahead of our sustainable long-term growth rate targets of mid single-digits.","Foxconn was the only greater than 10% direct customer in the third fiscal quarter. Our third quarter gross margins from continuing operations was 63.3%, 30 basis points above the midpoint of guidance.","Turning to operating expenses, R&D expenses were $652 million and SG&A expenses were $116 million, totaling $768 million or 17.2% of net revenue for the third quarter. I would highlight that this was $19 million below guidance primarily due to lower than projected \u2013 lower than forecasted project expenses and the tail end of the synergies that we are realizing from classic Broadcom integration activities.","Operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $2.06 billion and represented 46.1% of net revenue. I am pleased that we are able to achieve our long-term operating margin target of 45% this quarter.","Provision for taxes came in at $88 million, slightly above our guidance. This was primarily due to higher than expected net income. Third quarter interest expense was $112 million and other income net was $12 million. Third quarter net income was $1.87 billion and earnings per diluted share was $4.10. Our share-based compensation expense in the third quarter was $251 million.","Moving onto the balance sheet, our days sales outstanding were 49 days, an increase of four days from the prior quarter primarily due to the ramp in wireless revenue late in the quarter. Our inventory at the end of the third quarter was $1.43 billion, an increase of $120 million from the beginning of the quarter, reflecting an inventory build to support the strong growth expected in Wireless in the fourth quarter.","We generated $1.66 billion in operational cash flow, which includes the impact of an increase in working capital. We also expanded approximately $50 million in cash on classic Broadcom restructuring integration activities in the third quarter. Free cash flow in the third quarter was $1.4 billion or 31% of net revenue. Capital expenditures in the third quarter was $255 million or 5.7% of net revenue.","I would highlight this includes approximately $90 million expended on campus construction projects. As you may recall, our CapEx have been running at elevated levels over the last several quarters, largely due to the construction of the partially built Irvine campus we had acquired as part of the classic Broadcom transaction.","I am pleased to note that earlier this month at the start of our fiscal quarter, we completed the sale and leaseback arrangement for the Irvine campus and received approximately $443 million in sale proceeds. We will continue to have CapEx expenditures at the Irvine campus as we complete improvements to the lease space throughout the balance of the year. We expect overall CapEx to decline meaningfully starting in 2018 and we\u2019ll provide more color on that topic on our next earnings call.","Moving on to additional items on the cash flow statement, a total of $438 million in cash was spent on Company dividend partnership distribution payments in the third quarter. We ended the third quarter with the cash and short-term investment balance of $5.45 billion. Our cash balance remains at an elevated level, which we expect will continue through the fourth quarter and anticipation of closing the pending acquisition of Brocade.","Now let me turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions and we do not intend to update this guidance. This guidance is for results from continuing operations only. Net revenue is expected to be $4.8 billion plus or minus $75 million. Gross margin is expected to be 63% plus or minus one percentage point.","Operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $780 million. Tax provision is forecasted to be approximately $96 million. Net interest expense and other is expected to be approximately $100 million. The diluted share count forecast is for 457 million shares. Share-based compensation expense will be approximately $261 million. CapEx will be approximately $230 million.","On the Brocade front, we have received regulatory approval in China. And as Hock mentioned subject to the satisfaction of the remaining closing conditions, we presently expect to close this transaction within our fourth fiscal quarter of 2017.","That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, if you could please open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Ross Seymore","Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Hock, I know this is our last shot at getting segment guidance, so forgive me for taking advantage of that. But as you talked about the Wireless segment, can you give a little bit more color about what you meant by the fiscal first quarter holding up? Is that mean better than seasonal, up or down sequentially, any more color there would be appreciated?","Hock Tan","Sure. Well from Q3 to Q4 as we have said that in the last earnings call, we expect probably to drive up our revenue, careful of my choice of word \u2013 but it drive up about 30% to 40% sequentially on Wireless alone. And because of the delayed shipment and everything just shifts further out, so we expect in Q1 that Wireless revenue would probably hold close to the same level as what we will see in Q4 fiscal 2017, hope that helps?","Ross Seymore","It does. That helps a lot. And then a question Tom for you a little bit longer term. You mentioned about the CapEx coming down as we go into next year. So not going to ask you for any more details on that, but as we think about a 35% free cash flow margin target and a 45% target for your operating margin, I know there's some deltas in between those two, but it doesn't seem like it should add up to quite 10 points. Can you talk a little bit about what might bring that free cash flow margin target a little closer to the 45% operating margin or is it not going to approach that?","Thomas Krause","No, Ross, I think that's very fair. As we've seen operating margins and EBITDA margins continue to expand and you look at sort of the one-time items this year around the campus activity, some of things we're doing in the backend, the restructuring activities we've taken on, and you're going to see that continue to converge. I don't see the interest expense levels or other items that would tax rate dictate any expansion in that number. So I think as we get into the New Year and we update you on the financial model, I think there is certainly room for more conversions.","Ross Seymore","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Toshiya Hari","Yes, great. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the solid results. Tom I had a question on gross margins. You're guiding Q4 gross margins down. I think about 30 basis points at the midpoint, despite the outlook for significantly higher revenue. I was curious if this is simply a function of customer mix and perhaps conservatism on your part? Or are there other factors at play here?","Thomas Krause","Toshiya, I wouldn't say its conservatism. If you look at the mix of business in the fourth quarter, obviously Wireless is a much larger percentage of overall revenue. Wireless traditionally, as I think you probably know does carry below average \u2013 below Broadcom average gross margins. And so when we see such a change in mix, you're going to see some pressures and headwinds on margins. I think despite all that, however, we're very confident that we can maintain relatively flat gross margins here, which are obviously running at record levels.","Toshiya Hari","Great. Thank you. And then as my follow-up Hock, I had a question on your appetite for further M&A. I realize you guys are still working on Brocade right now, but beyond that given what you see in the pipeline and given current valuation levels, I was curious how I guess hungry you are in terms of M&A. In the past you guys have talked about your 15 product groups, and I guess 19 including Brocade. But when you think about your pipeline and your team's capacity to run businesses, how many additional product groups do you think you can manage? Thank you.","Hock Tan","Good question. So far this thing \u2013 actually we have 19 product groups right now. Brocade would add a 20th one. And do we have capacity for more? Yes. Our machine is running very smoothly. We can certainly do more.","Thomas Krause","Yes, and Toshiya I think as you know in terms of capital allocation, we've focused on maintaining a balance between getting back 50% of free cash flow to shareholders in the form of the dividend and then focusing the balance of the 50% on M&A. And I think we continue to believe we can do that and do it successfully going forward, obviously Brocade is the latest instance of it, but we see an opportunity going forward to maintain that model.","Toshiya Hari","Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Craig Hettenbach","Great. Thank you. Hock, I had a question on the merchant silicon, particularly Jericho versus Tomahawk. One of your key customers recently spoke favorably about some momentum for Jericho. If you can just kind of update us kind of where both of those are and how you\u2019re feeling about the ramp in both Tomahawk and Jericho?","Hock Tan","Well, those are very good \u2013 those two products by the way is a whole \u2013 for each of them is a whole set of generation of Tomahawk switches and Jericho generally are router switches. So both are used in different place, and both are doing very, very well and are very well received in datacenters, both public datacenter \u2013 the public cloud datacenters as well as even private enterprises. And it's running very well. And in terms of ramp, see, we have constant upgrades to those products.","We have launched since last year, Tomahawk and Tomahawk plus that\u2019s Tomahawk I. We have launched this year Tomahawk II. We should be doing Tomahawk III by the end of this year. And it will keep going on as we engineer new innovative next-generation products for our cloud customers, especially our cloud customers who desire higher and higher throughput and bandwidth.","And same applies to Jericho, which is a newer product, which is a routing products using aggregation and spine. And that's also going in the same direction as we create generation and potentially future generation of those products. So we see those two to maintain a very, very strong market position in the networking connectivity business.","Craig Hettenbach","Got it. And then just as my follow-up, just your commentary around kind of being able to drive content growth to get to competitive growth mid single-digits, which is the target. Clearly we see a lot of the wireless growth coming through and you talked about that, but just more broadly across the organization, any areas that you more optimistic about the ability to drive higher content and market growth?","Hock Tan","I would say we are very, very broadly positive about content growth, because this is the underpinning of our business model, which is using technology, leading-edge technology in very proven markets to keep driving innovation and performance for our key customers in each of those applications. We see that in networking. We see that in Enterprise Storage. We see that in even in Industrial and of course Wireless very much so.","So that's the underpinning our business that every generation and every generation may spend annually to as long as, three, four years depending on the particular handset market segment it\u2019s in, but it will happen. And each time it happens, we provide performance, we provide good value to our customers and that allows us in term to create a return on the investment in R&D, we make to generate that basically in higher content in the premium prices.","Craig Hettenbach","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Vivek Arya","Thanks for taking my question. Hock, for my first one, when we look at your RF content, very strong this year, but broadly speaking RF overall is getting to be a bigger part of the bill-of-materials for large smartphone customers close to 10% or so. Is there a limit to how big it can be at some point? Do you think customers will start to complain? Or do you still see enough value being ordered by RF that we could consider this is a growth area for the next several years?","Hock Tan","That's the continuing challenge that applies not just to RF into our broadband access even into our networking business, which is the ability to deliver more and more value features and by extension content IP into our products. I do not see that stopping. Not visibility wise for the next three years.","Vivek Arya","Okay. And as my follow-up, I think Tom you mentioned do you have exceeded your non-GAAP operating margin targets already. How much more leverage is in the model? And more importantly, how do you trade-off sales growth versus driving towards certain operating margin, because when I look at many of your other peers in semi, a number of them are targeting perhaps faster growth, but at lower operating margins. So just conceptually, what is \u2013 how do you drive the right balance between driving to a certain level of profitability versus achieving above industry growth? Thank you.","Thomas Krause","Yes. Vivek, I think I\u2019ll piggyback of Hock. It all ties back to the business model. And I've been here about six years and Hock has been here obviously over 10 years driving this model. And I think margins started out in the 30s, and Hock got here as gross margins that were in the 40s and I got here I mean the model continues to focus on investing in value added product development and delivering better value for customers and for us. So I think what you're seeing is constant increase in margins both gross margins and then with revenue growth in our operating margins. So we expect that to continue going forward.","Hock Tan","Vivek, let me add to that. Tom is exactly right in saying that, think about it. We\u2019ve 19 product franchises. Each of them are in specific end markets. You might almost say niche markets in some cases. And we are always part of this niche markets and some of them end up as the mass market as the market moves to the niche we happen \u2013 to have picked. And it's about developing products using technology we have and continue to evolve the technology, which are the best, superb in those end markets we are in.","We are number one typically in those end markets. Number one in technology leadership, number one in markets. And we keep investing again and again over the years to develop new product generation. We do not manage this business by numbers. We just manage it based on this model, based on addressing market demands and let the numbers fall where they may, as long as we believe, we're getting value and a good return on investment we make in those niches we are in. We just sustain those niches. And the numbers you see us roll together is what arises as an end result of this business model. We don't try to trade-off revenue against margin, that doesn't work.","Is the basic business model that says in each of the 19 product groups we are in. We are the best than it is, and we get the bigger share and that market continues to need new product innovations and we supply it. And by doing that, the revenue is whatever the revenue turns out to be and the margin gets richer and richer as we provide more and more technology and the end result is consolidating all this 19 divisions, you get what we show you. And you get a gross margin that continues to expand as I mentioned because the nature of this technology markets enable us to keep evolving new products with higher content and a higher price premium.","Vivek Arya","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura. Your line is open.","Romit Shah","Thank you very much. That was helpful gross margin commentary. I wanted to ask about OpEx because for the quarter you're guiding, it's coming in a lot lower than what I was anticipating. And Tom, I think you've previously sort of guided OpEx closer to like 18%-ish as a percent of sales, and in October, we're going to be closer to 16%. So I'm curious if 16% is sustainable, what's the right way to think about OpEx going forward?","Thomas Krause","Yes. Rom, we'll update this a bit next quarter, but obviously revenue has exceeded our expectations this year and as well ahead of what we would anticipate as long-term sustainable growth. So whenever you do that over a short period of time, you're going to look better on the OpEx side as a percent of revenue.","I think if you focus on the dollars, what we've been saying, we continue to sort of hanging in around [7.75, 7.80] level. There's some puts and takes around project expense and when people come on board or leave, but at the end of the day, that's kind of where we're running and we'll give you an update on how we think about next year \u2013 next quarter.","Romit Shah","Okay. Sure. And then on Enterprise Storage just given how much is up year-on-year. Do you think it's reasonable for us to assume that this decline you're seeing in the October quarter may extend beyond this fiscal year that this inventory correction may go on for a couple of periods?","Hock Tan","Romit, you got a very good question for which I don't have a very certain answer. But you're right. We were saying for the last couple of quarters, be careful about hard drive, it looks too good to be true. It would begin to look that way. And so, yes I tend to \u2013 like to agree with you to say that you may extend beyond Q4 to even Q1 next year and that will likely happen.","Having said that year-on-year, our storage business seems to be what it should be, which is firm, but flattish. That's what we\u2019d like to see Enterprise Storage over the long-term. What we see this year 2017 appears to be a bit of divergence from that, but I think we'll get back to normality perhaps in 2018 and to see being sort of flattish year-on-year, which is where Enterprise Storage should be as a very stable sustainable volume business.","Romit Shah","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","John Pitzer","Yes, good afternoon guys. Hock, last conference call, you talked about content gains in the handset this year, I think approaching kind of 40% year-over-year and clearly, I think we all understand the RF story. I was hoping to get a better understanding, if you could talk about what's going on in kind of the combo chip wireless side of the market and other opportunities that you might have to be gaining content on the handset side?","Hock Tan","You\u2019re asking very difficult question for me to try to answer, as I mentioned in the last time, we have multiple sockets in those high-end flagship status smartphones, multiple sockets, doing multiple key functions in those phones. So to be able to pickup one versus the other, they are different, you\u2019re right.","The first answer, so I can answer for broadly across except to say that broadly across as you go from one generation to the next in those flagship smartphones. The functions we do \u2013 drives towards more and more complexity, more and more functionality and certainly more and more performance. And to do it, chips get \u2013 the chips we do, the [indiscernible] we do on the case of cellular connectivity, in the case of wireless Bluetooth integrated chip, the same thing applies as we go from 802.11am first to ac, ac second wave and in the next year or two to ax.","It goes for more and more performance, multiple users and with it, a larger and larger chip that require some more and more investment to make it performed and which allows us to ask for higher and higher price for the value we provide to the end-users. And the other thing, whether it's a WiFi, Bluetooth connectivity or GPS or RF analog which we also do or even the touch screen controller, all then have the same characteristics that each generation of phone requires more and more performance and complexity.","John Pitzer","That's helpful. Hock, and just my follow-up, in your prepared comments, you did call out kind of optical and optical China areas of weakness, can you just remind me again how big of the Wired business that is? Do you think this is a one quarter phenomenon and we get back to some sort of growth sometime in the January timeframe or how are you thinking about kind of the demand price you\u2019re seeing in that part of the Wired business?","Hock Tan","I could give you something, but I've been a selfish person that I am in the biggest scheme of things. Why we hotchpotch of bunch will stop together, all of them very strategic to us. On one side we have networking, on the other side, we have broadband from set-top box to broadband access gateways, networking switches, routers, whether it's much in silicon or ASICs to interconnects, Fiber Optic interconnects and building block Physical Layer products and embedded SoC \u2013 embedded CPUs what it called use and things like VOIP phones and what it call point-of-sale terminal, you can see how broad it is.","And to be honest, yes, we point out sort of always puts and takes and couple of product lines are strong, other products lines are strong and we'd like to give you a bit of color sometimes, I regret giving you too much color, because you will start thinking of new particularly and really it does \u2013 it have an impact in this particular quarter, but you may not impact the next quarter.","You get what I mean, so yes, broadly look at it as a broad spectrum of Wired combining networking as well as access product lines and that just moves along in a very, very stable manner growing and demand from 5% to 10% on an annualized basis, best way to look at it, because it involved in it our product lines that grow very slowly and some that are very more exciting as you guys are laid upon. If I talk about the exciting things, you might extrapolate to see the whole 50% of our revenue growing like weed, when it doesn't. So I do want to be very careful in making sure I clarify all this for you guys.","John Pitzer","Perfect. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Harlan Sur","Good afternoon and good to see the diversification in the business plan out here. I know your ASIC development pipeline is pretty strong that switching and routing service provider, AI, deep learning and a whole bunch of other mixed signal and analog stuff. It's very diverse like the business, diverse set of applications and markets. Can you just talk about the competitive landscape within your ASIC business and we all know the benefits of ASSP or off the shelf, but is the team seen an uptick in customers wanting to do ASICs and if so, what's driving this trend?","Hock Tan","Customers wanting to do ASIC. In order to be honest, it\u2019s harder and harder to do ASICs now from a broader industry trade. As you go from 28 nanometer, which seems our history to 16 nanometers to now, increasingly 10 and seven the costs of designing ASICs is exponentially growing.","And you can probably understand why, as the process, and the process technology and equipment goes up very, very sharply. So unless you are a player, a system guy with very high volume of system OEM or even end-user with very large volume of a particular part is very expensive for you to want to do ASICs for your particular needs.","And if you do, we're happy to address it, but we are finding out at this kind of the \u2013 at this stage a very high bandwidth because you need to address those high bandwidth, high throughputs, you need very advanced CMOS technology becomes very, very expensive. And to be honest, I think we can foresee a trend towards merchant silicon in those networking applications.","Harlan Sur","Great. Thanks for the color there. And then on the storage side, I didn\u2019t here you mentioned anything about your SSD business? You guys obviously are supplying into two of the top three enterprise SSD companies. I think on the enterprise SSD side, they are not seeing as much issues shortage wise is because that's where the highest profitability per bits are and I think some of your customers are growing these businesses like 30%, 50% year-over-year. I'm just wondering are you seeing this kind of trends in the business or do you think that this segment is also sort of subject to some of the supply constraints?","Hock Tan","You are obviously reading the signs out there all very correct that enterprise SSDs are very much in demand, very much in short supply, but nonetheless on the trend basis growing very rapidly and we are supplying a lot of the flash controllers into those assets \u2013 those SSDs among a particular \u2013 a few of those very successful SSD suppliers and ensure \u2013 and we are benefiting from the \u2013 and I agree we will. But again on the overall scheme of things, even in our storage business, it helps add to our total revenue of $700 million to $800 million every quarter, and we love that.","Again the puts and takes in the overall scheme of things, and it helps us get our revenues, doesn't move the needle some, but not tremendously. But back again we see because we are the lead in the enterprise flash controllers, so we do get the benefit from that back to the franchise model with the lead \u2013 we had one with the technology and we keep put our head down and continue to grind and benefit from that growth. So we do see that growth.","Harlan Sur","Great. Thanks for the insights Hock.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Your line is open.","Blayne Curtis","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Hock, I did want to ask you, obviously the focus is on North American customer. But if you could just comment on the Korean customer, your ability to hold share and grow content, they obviously just launched a new phone. But as you look into next year as well, if you just comment on your ability to continue to grow there as well?","Hock Tan","We have the same phenomenon, actually very powerful phenomenon. Well, the Korean customer, obviously, you have a range of phones from high-end flagship phones down to feature phones, low-end smartphones. And our products are very well represented in the markets we are good at. India flagship phones, still there. And our ability to keep driving away our new products, new technology continues unabated. Every year, new generation we\u2019re there.","Blayne Curtis","And I do want to ask you on the non-mobile WiFi side, 802.11ax, when do you expect to see some revenue from that? And what type of driver could it be for you?","Hock Tan","Well, that's very interesting question. We are sampling our chips now. We're enabling the enterprise access points markets and trying to enable the \u2013 basically the enterprise access and markets in ax. And we are sampling now and we probably won\u2019t get into production until around middle of next calendar year. And that's how long these things take because a lot of software, not just hardware, but we're very positive about it and we're pushing it very nicely.","Blayne Curtis","Okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Amit Daryanani","Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys. I guess to start off with, on the free cash flow side, you guys have obviously fairly strong free cash flow conversion this quarter despite some of the working capital inefficiencies you had. So maybe just help me understand, the working capital inventory uptick that you had this quarter, does that all sort of get rectified in the October quarter? Or given the fact this product was delayed a little bit, at least the launch was, does working capital normalize more in Jan and April for you guys for next year?","Thomas Krause","Yes. We'd expect things to normalize this particular quarter, given where we are with our fiscal year-end and we see a big ramp at the end of Q3 and then it normalizes in Q4, so we would expect that to shake out and be more back to normal in Q4.","Amit Daryanani","Got it. And then, I guess, just on the Brocade transaction, any change on the revenue and EBITDA contribution that you guys had expected when you announced the deal today? And could you just remind me what approvals are remaining at this point for you guys to get done, because I think you just got China approval recently.","Thomas Krause","Yes, no change. I think Brocade just came out with their earnings results this afternoon as well. And the SAN business, which is the business we targeted with Brocade, continues to perform well and in line with our expectations. And so it's going to be a business we think generates $1.3 billion plus revenue and $900 million plus of EBITDA on a run rate once integrated.","On timing, I think both Hock and I mentioned Q4, we're highly confident that we're going to be able to get there this quarter, obviously being delayed. No one likes that, but we are working through various approvals. We did get MOFCOM. What's left is CFIUS. CFIUS plays a very important role and we certainly respect that. And we\u2019re in active dialogue, we\u2019ve been through that with them multiple times before. And I think like we said, we\u2019re pretty confident we're going to be able to get there this quarter.","Amit Daryanani","Perfect. Thank you.","End of Q&A","Operator","Thank you. And with that, ladies and gentlemen, we conclude our Q&A session and program for today. Thank you for participating. You may all disconnect. Have a wonderful afternoon."],"4029":["Avago Technologies Limited (NASDAQ:AVGO) Q1 2013 Earnings Call February 26, 2013  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Thomas  Krause - Vice President of Corporate Development","Hock E.

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Tom Krause, Vice President of Corporate Development. Please go ahead.","Thomas  Krause","Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are Hock Tan, President and CEO; and Doug Bettinger, Chief Financial Officer of Avago Technologies. After the market closed today, Avago distributed a press release and financial tables describing our financial performance for the first quarter of fiscal year 2013. If you did not receive a copy, you may obtain the information from the Investors section of Avago's website at avagotech.com.","This conference call is being webcast live and a recording will be available via telephone playback for 1 week. It will also be archived in the Investors section of our website at avagotech.com.","During the prepared comments section of this call, Hock and Doug will be providing details of our first quarter results, background to our Q2 2013 outlook and some commentary regarding the business environment. We will take questions after the end of our prepared comments.","In addition to U.S. GAAP reporting, Avago reports certain financial measures on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the tables attached to today's press release. Comments made during today's call will primarily refer to our non-GAAP financial results. Please refer to our press release today and our recent filings with the SEC for information on the specific risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Hock Tan. Hock?","Hock E. Tan","Thank you, Tom. Good afternoon, everyone. We're going to start today by reviewing recent end-market business highlights, and then Doug will provide summary of the first quarter fiscal 2013 financial results.","Now revenues for our Q1 fiscal year '13 was $576 million, which was slightly above the midpoint of our guidance. This represented though a decrease of 7% from last quarter, but an increase of 2% from the same quarter a year ago. Excluding legacy consumer, revenue actually declined 5% sequentially but was up 8% year-over-year.","Wireless revenue only declined marginally in what would usually be a seasonally weak quarter for us as a result of multiple smartphone ramps with several OEM customers. As we also guided, wired revenue was down due primarily to continuing weakness in carrier routing from service providers.","Industrial was also down, below our estimate at the beginning of the quarter, mainly because of weaker distribution resales [ph], coupled with ongoing channel inventory reductions on our site.","Let me provide more color on each of our target markets. Starting with wireless. Revenue from wireless during the quarter was essentially in line with our expectations, declining 2% sequentially during Q1, but I do want to highlight that wireless revenue grew 22% year-on-year. Wireless represented 53% of our total revenues in Q1. Normally, our fiscal Q1 is a seasonally weak quarter for wireless. However, several factors contributed to our ability to sustain the healthy revenue level we achieved in fiscal Q4 and continue into this quarter.","For one, we had a strong follow on demand from our 2 largest smartphone OEMs, one in North America, the other in Korea. Secondly, several of our other OEM customers launched 4G\/LTE smartphone programs in the quarter. In fact, we noticed, for the first time in several quarters, strength from OEMs outside the top 2 from Taiwan, Korea, as well as North America. These results offset somewhat by weakness in China smartphone market due to customer supply constraints of certain components and in addition, we chose to walk away from certain low margin Chinese business.","Looking ahead to Q2. As expected, but a quarter earlier than when it occurred last year, we have seen the annual product transition at our largest North American smartphone OEM, which will act as a headwind in the quarter. However, this has been meaningfully offset by continued ramp at our large OEM customer in Korea. In addition, we see compelling demand in the quarter from the 2 OEMs who are both ramping new 4G\/LTE smartphone platforms. As a result, for Q2, we expect overall wireless revenue to decline in the high single digits on a percentage basis.","While the revenue headwind from our largest OEM may cloud the picture somewhat, I would highlight that the 4G\/LTE smartphone launches in Q1 and Q2 that I mentioned and that increasing FBAR content, which is helping support a more favorable wireless product mix.","Next, moving onto wired infrastructure target markets. Revenue came in with a 10% sequential decline. Much of enterprise networking during the quarter was flat but after double dip -- double-digit, sorry, growth in Q4, our SerDes ASIC business paused temporarily during Q1, as our major networking OEM began to transition from 10G switching platforms in data centers in preparation, in anticipation of launching next generation 40G systems.","Also as we expected during the quarter, fiberoptics [ph] continued to be weak tied to soft carrier routing spending, which impacted all 3 major OEMs that we serve.","Looking forward to Q2 though, we believe enterprise network and storage spending has bottomed. We also expect to see carrier routing continuing to be soft and do not see a recovery until the back half of the fiscal year.","However, we expect a strong ramp in the next generation 40-gigabit data center switching, as our largest networking OEM rolls out their platform Nexus 6000. Here we have substantial ASIC content, as well as next generation proprietary fiberoptic interconnects. As a result, we expect wired revenues to grow high single-digit sequentially.","Let me now discuss our industrial and other target markets. Just to remind you, starting from this quarter, we are now grouping our consumer royalty based revenues [indiscernible] into the industrial market. However, stripping that out and on a comparable basis to Q4 2012, industrial declined 8% sequentially, below our expectations at the beginning of the quarter, even though year-on-year we grew 6%. As most of you know, we recognize revenue on sell in and industrial sales are significantly weighted towards distribution. The weaker-than-expected sales were caused primarily by a sequential decline in the distribution resales -- slight sequential decline, I might add, as well as ongoing inventory contraction in the supply chain. Regionally, we saw China continue to recover and grow at low double digits, but we saw Japan and Europe decline significantly while the U.S. remained virtually flat.","Looking forward to Q2, while we believe channel inventory is now rather lean, we do not currently see a sustainable uptick in end demand. In fact, based on a review of our major OEM end customers in industrial, they forecast their revenues to decline an average low-single digits.","Now, I know several of our analog peers, component peers out there are forecasting an uptick in the business next quarter. I might note that this time, last year, we saw a similar phenomenon, which we interpreted as an uptick in distribution -- or where we interpreted an uptick in distribution orders as a recovery in end demand and ship products in anticipation. The expected recovery did not materialize and we saw destocking in the supply chain for the rest of the year. I'm focused on not letting that happen again. Given our review of end-market demand, we just don't think any inventory replenishment going on today is sustainable.","Therefore, we anticipate revenue in industrial and others will decline slightly, low-single digits, when compared to Q1, consistent with what we believe end market demand dictates.","Therefore, in summary in Q2, we expect a major product transition in wireless. Industrial continues to be challenging and pretty much flat, wired infrastructure provides an opportunity for revenue growth, though it's not expected to be enough to offset the other 2 target market declines -- weaknesses, I should say. Hence, we are guiding overall revenue to decline between 2% to 5% in Q2 from Q1.","Switching gears for a minute. As you probably saw earlier today, we issued a press release this afternoon announcing our CFO, Doug Bettinger's departure in early March. I do want to take this opportunity to thank Doug for the many contributions he has made to Avago over the last several years, including helping to transition us from a private to a public company. He has been a key part of delivering our financial performance and establishing our relations -- relationships, I'm sorry, with you, the investment community.","We are starting a formal search for Doug's replacement. In the meantime, Anthony Maslowski, VP and Corporate Controller, will serve as interim Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Maslowski has been with Avago since 2006.","With that, let me now turn the call over to Doug for more detailed review of our first quarter 2013 financials.","Douglas R. Bettinger","Okay. Thanks, Hock. Good afternoon, everyone. Before reviewing the first quarter of fiscal 2013 financial results, I want to remind you today that my comments will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results. Reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP data is included with the earnings release that we issued today and it's also available on our website at avagotech.com.","Revenues of $576 million in Q1 represents a decrease of 7% from last quarter and an increase of 2% versus the same quarter a year ago. The sequential decrease was roughly in line with our guidance for the quarter. And as Hock mentioned, revenue from our wired infrastructure target market came in a little bit better than we thought, so that was offset by weaker-than-expected revenue from our industrial target market. And finally, revenue from our wireless target market declined slightly, which was about in line with our expectations.","For the last 3 quarters, we've disclosed that Foxcon was a greater than 10% customer and they continued to be one again this quarter. After growing for 3 consecutive quarters, distribution resales paused and declined modestly in Q1, reflecting weaker end-market demand. Distribution inventory continued to contract as we expected at the beginning of the quarter. And as you know, of all of our end markets, the industrial target market is impacted the most significantly by distribution. We obviously saw our industrial market revenues decline to a larger extent from these 2 occurrences.","Looking into Q2, we expect resales will be roughly flat and distribution and inventory will likely decline again.","Our Q1 gross margin was 50.7%, which was slightly above the midpoint of our guidance. This was driven by a slightly stronger revenue in the wired infrastructure target market. Q1 gross margin declined 40 basis points from last quarter, primarily as a result of end market mix.","Turning to operating expenses. R&D expenses in Q1 increased by $11 million to $86 million and SG&A increased by $2 million to $44 million, pushing our OpEx to $130 million or up $13 million sequentially. And you remember from last earnings call, the increase was primarily due to higher variable compensation accruals compared with Q4 and secondarily, to our increased R&D investment. These expenses were in line with our guidance for the quarter. As a percentage of sales, R&D increased to 15% and SG&A increased 1% to 8% of net revenue.","Income from operations for the quarter decreased by $37 million sequentially to $162 million, and this represented 28% of net revenue. Compared to the $163 million for Q1 of last year, income from operations decreased by $1 million. We recorded a net gain of $2 million in interest and other.","Taxes came in at $1 million for Q1. This was lower than we expected, and it was primarily due to the retroactive reinstatement of R&D tax credits in the United States. Q1 net income of $163 million decreased 16% from the prior quarter and Q1 earnings per diluted share of $0.65 was $0.12 lower than Q4. Compared to Q1 of last year, net income was $7 million higher and for earnings per diluted share, it was $0.03 higher. Earnings are higher versus the prior year primarily due to higher revenues, as well as the lower taxes, which was offset by the higher spending that I described. The sequential decrease in Q1 earnings was primarily attributed to lower revenue and higher operating expenses.","Our share-based compensation in Q1 was $18 million. The breakdown of this expense for Q1 includes $2 million in cost of goods sold, $7 million in R&D and $9 million in SG&A. In Q2, we anticipate share-based compensation will again be approximately $18 million. And just to remind you as I always do, the company's definition of non-GAAP net income excludes share-based compensation expense.","So now moving to the balance sheet. Our days sales outstanding came in at 46 days. This was down 5 days from the prior quarter. Our inventory ended at $208 million, which was an increase of $14 million from last quarter. And this translated into days on hand of 72 days. Q1 inventory increased primarily because of a last time buy from one of our component suppliers, as well as the ramping of our Fort Collins facility.","We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.15 billion and we generated $185 million in operational cash flow. We spent $67 million on capital expenditures. This CapEx level was below our guidance for the quarter, mainly because of the timing of equipment delivery. For Q2, we expect CapEx will be in a range of $60 million to $70 million. And I'll remind you, the CapEx spending today is primarily due to the ongoing buildout of incremental FBAR filter capacity in Fort Collins.","For the quarter, we repurchased approximately 406,000 shares, which consumed $13 million of cash. And on December 28, 2012, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.17 per ordinary share, which consumed $42 million of cash. This dividend was raised by $0.01 from the prior quarter. And I just point out that since the inception of our dividend program in Q2 of 2011, we've continued to increase this dividend each quarter. And as I mentioned last quarter, we also continue to evaluate potential strategic investments and acquisitions as another way of deploying cash to maximize return to our shareholders.","Now let me turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2013.","This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions and we do not intend to update this guidance. Revenue was expected to decline by 2% to 5% from Q1. We expect lower wireless sales to one of our large customers will be partially offset by a return to sequential growth in wired infrastructure. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 50.75%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. Operating expenses are estimated to again be approximately $130 million. I'm forecasting interest in other to be a gain of $1 million. Taxes are forecasted to be approximately $6 million. And finally, the diluted share count forecast is for 254 million shares.","And just to remind you, starting with this quarter, we stopped reporting the consumer and computer peripherals target market as a standalone market. We've combined the remaining revenues from that market, given the small size of the remaining IP royalty revenue into the industrial target market. And we're calling this new market, simply, industrial and other. That combined target market declined 14% sequentially in Q1.","And as Hock mentioned, had we been reporting only the former industrial target market, the decline would have been less at 8%.","And finally, you heard from Hock that I'm moving on to another opportunity. I'd like to pause and take the opportunity to thank the Avago management team, the board and especially my finance and administration team for the support over the last 4.5 years. I'd also like to assure our investors that Avago remains in the hands of very capable finance and management teams.","That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please go ahead and open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Well, I guess, first of all, Doug, sorry to see you go but congrats on the new gig. Moving beyond that, onto the wireless side of things, Hock, you mentioned that the product transition is happening 1 quarter earlier than it did a year ago. Is it safe to take away from that, that you believe that is just a 1-quarter product transition?","Hock E. Tan","We believe so, yes, from all indications we are seeing. Yes.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then I guess sticking in the wireless side of things. One of your pretty active partners recently on the base end side just announced that they're going to enter into the RF market. Can you walk us through what you think those implications may or may not be for Avago?","Hock E. Tan","Well, I guess the most of this one, Ross, is as we've always said, we're in the wireless business as we are in many of the other end markets we are in. Not as a mass-market supplier of standard commoditized components, but rather of specialized high-performance components, which typically ends up in relatively niche market applications in those areas we target. And no different in wireless. And here, our area of focus has always been, as we indicated, filters and duplexes. The FBAR duplexes that we are proprietary technology over. To the extent we sell power amplifiers, we sell it to facilitate our sale of duplexes. And either as a front-end modules, sell them on discrete basis. But really to push either FBARs as a package deal or, as I mentioned, paths or front-end modules. That announcement by one of this out, a very important partner for Avago on this product called RF 360 is largely a multiband, even multimode power -- largely power amplifier gain. It doesn't have filters, it doesn't have duplexes and we don't believe it would have given the unusual nature of filters and duplexes. So far from our point of view, Avago, it's  not something we view obviously as intersecting or conflicting with the model we have. In fact, if anything else, we continue to see an interesting evolution of the wireless market and now particularly in the RF market given that the content in RF, be it power amplifier, switches or more so, duplexes, are exponentially increasing with the complexity of bands that comes on 4G\/LTE implementations. So we do not see it having any major -- any significant impact on us. I don't know, and definitely not on our business model.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Good luck, Doug, on your future endeavors. Just wanted to ask a question on the networking side, if I could. You talked about the increase next quarter being driven by some new products that your OEM customers are ramping. But with respect to the overall level of spending by enterprises or those markets that you serve, can you talk about what your customers are telling you in terms of any extra visibility, either for the next quarter or for the rest of the year, in terms of recovery in that spending level?","Hock E. Tan","Well, what I can tell you, Jim, is, which is the kind of input we get from our customers tends to be 3 months at a time. I don't think they have a very good visibility beyond that now, even if they do tell us, it doesn't necessarily mean that's what they will stick to or have any clear indication what it is. But what we do see for the rest of this quarter in our view is, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, spending in enterprise, be it networking or storage, is flat, very flat by and large. While we are obviously guiding significant and meaningful step up in our shipment -- in our revenues, in wired infrastructure is largely driven, as I mentioned, via a product launch. In a way, a product launch and the decline in 10G and data center switching towards 40G -- the new generation of 40G data center switching. And then increased content -- substantially increased content we have in this new product launch. That's what's driving it. So other than that, no, I think much less you said it. Things are kind of flat at least for the next 3 months. Beyond that, I don't know. We do expect, I might add, that in carrier routing, especially building out back hauls in 4G\/LTE networks, be it particularly in China, we do -- and even in the U.S., we do expect an increase in the levels of such spending. We have not seen -- we have seen spending trough, I should say, since over 6, 9 months ago. And -- but we also believe that it's time point to slowly step up. We start to see signs of that in China with China mobile, China telecoms. But I expect that build out to start coming in, in the second half of our fiscal year.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful color. And then as a follow-up, if you looked at the industrial market, Hock, I think you talked about the fact that you don't want to kind of the expectation for the same kind of head fake recovery that we saw last year, which is understandable. But if you kind of -- can you maybe just give us more color on your thinking there, both in terms of the linearity to orders in the industrial and the distribution that you saw throughout the quarter, what you're seeing right now? And then what would give you a little bit more confidence that either restocking or end demand was more sustainable?","Hock E. Tan","Well, it's a tough question to answer. All we do see is, it's -- and there's a lot of some volatility, not a huge amount of volatility, but there's some -- there is definitely a certain amount of volatility in demand, in end demand as on -- as you run through each quarter and from quarter-to-quarter. And we do see that even on the resale side. Even though we recognize revenue on shipping, as I mentioned. But region wise, as I mentioned, we do see, on average, daily uptick in demand in China. However, what we unfortunately see on the other side of the picture is Europe and Japan is somewhat declining in that -- in those areas. And U.S., if there's a recovery, it is very slight. And as -- I won't use of word sustainable, maybe. But what we often see is there's a spike and it goes away. It's almost a specific applications, specific customers, specific programs might create a spike only to end, and something else created. But then so you -- you are seeing some level of volatility. And so when we mention all the things considered, all -- taking it all together, it's not the kind of uptick in demand that we saw after the downturn of 2009 that ran all the way to 2010. You had seen nothing like that at all. And maybe I am being conservative. But after, as you put it, the head fake of 2012, beginning of 2012, we're very careful about looking at this market in terms of claiming sustained bottom or sustained recovery after that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Good luck, Doug, from my side also.","Douglas R. Bettinger","Thank you, Vivek.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So first question, Hock, can you give us a sense, I think you did explain in your prepared remarks, but why is there that difference between the industrial pickup seen by some of your peers versus the trends that you are seeing? And is this something that can be resolved by making more acquisitions, expanding the breadth of your product line? Like how -- when should we start to see your industrial sales get more in line with what your peers are seeing?","Hock E. Tan","That's -- it's almost the same question of how many times I've beaten my wife. I don't know, I can only tell you what we saw and we have a pretty broad industrial product line. It's not that narrow, Vivek. We don't -- we not only do isolation, optical isolation, for inverters, server models [ph] and factory automations. We do motion encoders for all kinds of application, for all motor applications. We do industrial fiber for not only galvanic isolation but also across the board for, basically, factory controls and automation. And we do base LEDs that goes across a full range of industrial signage and indicator lights. I hate to say it, but we have a pretty full range of product that enters into a lot of end markets in industrial. And we know to track them very closely. And what I'll say, is we do not see industrial necessarily as collapsing. We see it as relatively, all things considered, flat. Why our revenue is not flat is because we have continued to destock at our distributors. And so since we recognize revenues from shipping, we see that the decline. But resale is not necessarily collapsing, but it's not recovering either. So the question is, is that strong sustained demand? I don't know. I mean, depends on the line -- if you have bookings out for the next 6 months that are firm, maybe you can make an indication on bookings for the next 3 months. I will tell you this, we have bookings but it doesn't show a positive uptrend on the nature we saw in the recovery in 2010 or that lead to part of 2009, when there was a clear recovery from an industrial downturn.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And as a follow-up, Hock, at your Analyst Day, you gave some very interesting information about FBAR and the expanding TAM for that capability. Outside of your largest customer, can you give us a sense for what kind of FBAR filter attach rate that you're seeing with smartphones today? Are you seeing new customers come in to adopt that capability? Because what I'm trying to get to is you are installing a lot of FBAR capacity, almost quadrupling over the last -- from, say, 2011 onwards. What does that imply in terms of how many FBAR filters we should see in a given smartphone for you to adequately utilize that capacity?","Hock E. Tan","Okay. Well, to answer your question, the simplest way to answer it is, I think, is a simple fact that we've indicated during Analyst Day. And you may recall that, Vivek, which was 3, 5 years ago, we would say that 2 bands. As you know, the spectrum for wireless communication is divided into bands. And there are bands in 2G, there are more bands in UMTS. And they're even more bands in 4G\/LTE. And 3, 5 years ago, probably I would say 2, 3 bands would use FBAR on a regular sustained basis. Today, I would say that we probably have sockets that covers around 10 bands roughly, maybe even more. And so you can see the fairly significant or substantial increase -- and, of course, there are more phones being used out there but there are also more bands being used out there. But what's even more interesting as we pointed out, again and again, is there are those -- it's the same amount of space we have out there in terms of ether for carrying those  microwaves. But the bands are multiplying very rapidly. Each band requires its own different modulation schemes. And so they are basically starting to interfere with each other, which increases the requirement for a much better filter or duplexer than has been required in the past, where we're running 2G with much less bands. So to put in a nutshell, you can see the increase in the requirements for much better filtering out there. We see that in many OEM customers, especially as they launch 4G handsets. And as they start using bands that start to interfere or squeeze into existing, I guess, spectrum. One clear example of that is WiFi, WiMAX. The WiFi, WiMAX spectrum frequency is squeezed by a couple of frequencies for cellular bands used in China, used in Europe. And what we're seeing is a lot of demand for smartphones that need to operate and roam in China, as well as in Europe. And I'm talking specifically on those bands. So to answer your question more particularly, the reason we are building more and more capacity is simply because we have designs, we have won designs, we have requirements from customers on designs that we are winning requiring us to put in -- to be able to supply more of those FBAR filters out there. And frankly, we're trying to expand as fast as we can to meet the time frame for which those demands are coming in.","Operator","We have Romit Shah back on the line from Nomura.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","The wireless guidance for next quarter looks pretty much in line with other companies that have a similar mix of use, so no surprise there. I had a question though on design wins. Hock, if you look at your largest volume opportunities in North America and Korea, do you have visibility at this point in the design wins that would theoretically go into production this year?","Hock E. Tan","Yes, we do. Great visibility, I might add.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And how -- I guess, we know RF is a very competitive space. We'd love to hear just how you feel overall about the pipeline.","Hock E. Tan","Okay. We feel actually very, very good about that about -- in both situations. We feel very good about our design win pipeline with those 2 large OEM customers.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And can you talk a little bit about pricing? I'm guessing that your content is increasing, but curious just on the like-for-like basis, is the pricing environment relatively benign or are you seeing a little bit more pressure this year?","Hock E. Tan","In handset RF business, in general, as a statement, Romit, you know as well as I do, the pricing environment for RF components, which is a huge market, huge TAM with few buyers, relatively speaking, is an extremely competitive environment. I mean, is extremely competitive. And interesting enough, as I say, within the context of our business model, which is to basically go in and charge price premium, we participate in this market because we have been, and we believe we continue to be able to develop and sell particular components, in this case, filters or filter combined power amplifiers, that provides much higher performance, unique performance characteristics over our competition. And that's how we've -- we compete and we can still compete very effectively. But outside of that, yes, we face a very competitive environment and we have always faced them. Romit, it hasn't really changed dramatically.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. I just want to say, Doug, thanks for all your help over the years and wish you all the best.","Douglas R. Bettinger","Thanks, Romit, I appreciate that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Danely from JPMorgan.","Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess if we look after this quarter, after all that transitions, Hock, do you expect your wireless business to be back growing in line with seasonality? And maybe you could also comment on the rest -- or how you expect the rest of your end markets to trend after this quarter?","Hock E. Tan","Well, we generally don't give you guys guidance beyond 1 quarter, largely because we could be wrong. We don't want to give you that kind of impact because of the nature of the business. But broadly, we can look back at events and probably see themselves repeating. And the product transition, 1 interesting question that was asked of me earlier on in this Q&A session, that we see occurring this quarter, Q2, occurred in Q3 last year. And if you look at context of what happened after Q3 last year, you see the launch of the -- and the ramp of the new generation products, which ramped very nicely, very strongly. And we showed -- we presented a very strong set of results for wireless business in Q3 and Q1 and the 2 quarters following their product transition. We do not see any reason why there is not a similar pattern or trend for this year as well, which is after transitioning Q2, we do not see why Q3 and Q4 would not follow the trend of what happened last fiscal year. And that's for wireless. In the case of wired to hover back [ph] and indicate, again, this is not a forecast but I'm just, in a sense, amplifying on the comments I made to earlier questions, which is simply that we see carrier routing to probably start to improve in the back half of the fiscal year. As I mentioned, we started to -- we have started to see some signs of that happening, especially in China back haul LTE spending as it is. We probably start to see some of that in North America as well in the back half if the carriers launch their forecast CapEx plans on -- more bandwidth and more routing. And we see some of the new programs coming in data center spending. We see a lot of interest build outs of large-scale data centers, which, because of its scale, will require launch of new programs, new platforms in data center switching, which we are very well embedded with our ASICs and proprietary fiber. So I like to see that opportunity -- I probably like to see that opportunity happen in the back half or later part of the fiscal '13. In industrial, I've no basis to one way or the other to tell you where things will hit, other than to say that China is continuing to recover, offsetting it seems to be a weakness in a couple other regions. And they both -- they kind of washout. We kind of seen -- or will likely see close at hand and probably no reason to see otherwise a flat industrial as we progress through the rest of the fiscal year. But again, this is just a guess. This is not a forecast.","Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","That's perfect and then for my follow-up, just a quick clarification. So when you give -- when you look at your assessment of the overall semiconductor market and you talked about the comparisons to last year and clearly, it's nothing like 2009. Is there anything out there that gives you confidence that it's going to be any different than last year, i.e., a head fake? Are you seeing like anything that makes you a little more encouraged or it's just too early, to cloudy out there to tell.","Hock E. Tan","You're talking specifically industrial, right?","Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","No, no, just the overall semi market.","Douglas R. Bettinger","It's hard to break it apart for us, Chris. I mean, we really do think about in 3 discrete end markets.","Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Then feel free to comment on industrial then that would be great.","Hock E. Tan","Well, industrial, as I've indicated to you guys, sitting here right now, I mean, we see increased demand, doesn't mean we believe it. We still believe it's a bit of a head fake. We could be wrong. We are playing in the side of conservatism now and basically saying things will be kind of flattish.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ian Ing from Lazard Capital.","Ian Ing - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","First, Doug, best wishes on your transition.","Douglas R. Bettinger","Thank you, Ian.","Ian Ing - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","So for the China market, you talked about some weakness in the smartphones there and some customer supply constraints. So quarter-to-date, is that still the case after Chinese New Year? And where's your exposure in China? Is it flagship, is it low-ends? There was a big TD supplier this morning that's sounded okay, I thought.","Hock E. Tan","Well, our market in China is largely simply twofold. One is we do the high-end smartphones, as you would have guessed. And be they in China and some of it exports but a lot of in China, like [indiscernible] and among others. And then we also do -- because of historical requirements on CDMA for FBAR, we do CDMA, as well as PCS kind of opportunities. Outside of that, which is a lot of UMTS 3G business and obviously, 2G business, we do very little.","Ian Ing - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. And also you talked about some broader success at handset OEMs, not just to your largest places like Taiwan, Korea, North America. Are component lead times now sort of the same in wireless or is there some more stretching out of lead times in front of major ramps? And if so, by how many weeks?","Hock E. Tan","Okay. Well, in this season of -- well, in this time of relative weakness and seasonality, which is this first part of the calendar year, lead times are pretty -- are relatively short. I would say lead times are about 4 to 6 weeks in that range, it may have pulled in slightly from what was pre-Christmas. But it's not -- there's no shortage of parts at this point, let's put it is this way.","Ian Ing - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","So there's no handset OEMs asking for 8-week lead times in front of major ramps?","Hock E. Tan","There are. There always are. But it's unusual and it's a spike that will go away very fast.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chin from UBS.","Steven Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","First one is since you have FBAR filter products. I guess a new technology that's coming down the pipeline for 4G and also for more advanced HSPA+ advance is carrier aggregation. I was wondering if carrier aggregation as that feature starts to make it into 4G and maybe in 3G handsets, does that represent any incremental demand for your FBAR technology? And secondly, is that also something that's a higher performing soft filters that kind of address that as well?","Hock E. Tan","I'll take that in 2 parts. Carrier aggregation has been talked about a lot and will likely happen. We haven't seen much of that happening yet. And we are obviously very hopeful it will add more requirements in terms of performance required -- demanded of the component, the RF components and we're pretty sure we do need higher performance. Whether this will be translated into higher demand and revenue for FBAR products, we will see. We don't have -- we have not experienced that uptick yet. But that's probably because carrier aggregation is still a dot in the eye of many of us. But it will probably happen. It will happen sooner or later. And we are hopeful that it has -- it will drive -- it will be a good tailwind to demand for high-performance FBAR products. And will soft filters do it? Yes, some of it depending on the bands. Again, it's a very complex answer to answer. Some soft filters will work on part of it. But on an overall basis, the need for high-performance FBAR will increase.","Steven Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And the -- I have a question with regards to the networking ASIC products. I was wondering if you could offer a little historic perspective on what the typical lead times are for your networking ASICs. And also as your networking customers ramp new platforms, what the -- how long the products, which typically ramp [indiscernible] before it reaches a more normalized run rate?","Hock E. Tan","Yes. Let's take the second and final question first. Very, very slow in typical enterprise manner. They'll launch a program and it will take a while for that program to gear up to speed. Some of these programs have launched 6 months ago and we are starting to see real activity now. And that's part of what we're experiencing here and you'll probably see some of that out in the marketplace. It's a long lead time kind of business and usually. It's usually a big ramp followed by -- and that may last for 2 quarters followed by a slight rollover and then it stabilizes and starts -- increasing over time as it replace existing generation system. That's typically the cycle that it follows. No different, I believe, in what we are seeing now. With 40G data center switching platforms that's coming into play, which a lot of this big data center build-out guys are very, very interested in buying. And in terms of the ASIC that goes in those products, as many of our product, like typical enterprise products, our cycle here is 18 weeks, typically, 1-8. Very complex, very, very difficult products to build, not to mention, design. Manufacturing cycle time can run from 15 to 20 weeks. So I'm giving you a midpoint of about 18 weeks. So we get backlog in place in a fairly extended timeframe.","Steven Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Perfect. Thanks for the color, Hock. And I want to wish Doug the best of luck on his next endeavor.","Douglas R. Bettinger","Thanks.","Operator","We have Mr. Mark Lipacis back on the line.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Doug, first of all, thanks a lot for all the help over the last several years and best wishes to you. Two questions. One, what is the growth -- the guidance at the midpoint, what does that assume growth of the core business, excluding the legacy consumer business?","Douglas R. Bettinger","Right now, on a sequential basis, Mark, that business is running pretty flat, call it $4 million, $5 million a quarter, so it's pretty flat. So what you see, the down $2 million to $5 million, is pretty much the core business.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","How about on year-over-year basis?","Douglas R. Bettinger","Yes. A year ago, and you can see this in our filings from a year ago. I think Q2, the consumer business was about $30 million and now it's down to $5 million, so you can do the math on that.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Great. And the quadrupling of the FBAR capacity, what does -- is there an implication on the gross margins that we should be thinking about as we look at the model out as you guys execute on that?","Douglas R. Bettinger","FBAR gross margin, Mark, by and large is better gross margin product. So more important than I think you're asking kind of about fab utilization question, but that kind of a tactical quarter-by-quarter. We believe in the future, we will be shipping a greater percentage of FBAR in terms of the total mix of wireless and that's good for margin.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I understand about the fab utilization. But I mean, is the idea here that you're going to build a bunch of capacity and just hope to fill it up. Or do you kind of boot strap it up as you go along and I guess my view is that, the FBAR capacity would be fairly full as you're adding capacity? But, please, correct me if I'm wrong.","Douglas R. Bettinger","Yes, that's our expectation. When you run fabs, you kind of like to run them around 80% utilization on average, and you never get it perfect. And we'll have quarters where we're running over 100%. And we may be building a little inventory for a ramp in the back half of the year, that's kind of typical. You saw us do that last year, you may see us do it again. But on average, to run fab and manage your resources properly, 80% is kind of where you want to be. And hopefully, that's how we're going to manage Fort Collins.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman from RBC Capital Markets.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I'll echo the best of luck, Doug, on your future endeavors.","Douglas R. Bettinger","Thanks, Doug.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","If I could dig in a little bit on FBAR and a comment that was made, Hock, where you said you had passed on some business that was available to you in China because it was unattractive. Is there anything that you guys can do to drive down your cost structure, thus, opening up the market opportunity for you to some of that China content?","Hock E. Tan","Oh, well, we keep doing that. By the way, our FBAR unit cost keeps going down as we progress every year. And as we scale up in capacity, that drives it down even more. But more than that, we go into new processes. Every year, we have a new generation of FBAR process that enables us to shrink the die, to make it much more competitive. And we need to do it simply because, I mean, the demand we are seeing and we are anticipating will -- is fairly significant -- substantial versus the capacity even we are putting in place. And as I'm sure you all know, we don't build the capacity with the hope of demand showing up at the front door. We have a pretty clear line of sight of what we're earmarking this increased capacity for and we're building towards that. So -- and we have plenty of demands for those products that we make on those things. But when -- we talked about lower margins and all that is, as I mentioned many times before and is particularly true in 3G UMTS, we sell FBAR, we also sell power amplifiers that goes hand in hand. Either in the front end modules or sometimes in a bundle. And so the power amplifier does dilute our FBAR margin, no surprise, as you can see there. And where we don't feel that, that dilution is warranted is when we walked away from the business.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Great. You also mentioned that clearly we're going through a product transition at one of your larger customers. Can you comment on the content or the volume that you expect to see when that business ramps back up? Are you guys going to secure the same content per unit? Or is there an expectation that we might actually see greater units in the next generation?","Douglas R. Bettinger","Yes, Doug, we can't comment on that. That stuff is too confidential. We're confident in the back half revenue, I think, is all we're going to say.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","All right. Could I try one last one then with you. On the channel inventories that you are working down, assuming you hold or that industrial stays relatively flat, Hock, as you defined it, will you be comfortable with the inventory level exiting this quarter?","Hock E. Tan","Yes, we will be.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So from thereon we take an expectation of what the market does and hope to see that reflected in your revenues?","Hock E. Tan","We anticipate doing that, yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Walkley from Canaccord Genuity.","Siddharth Sinha","This is Sid on for Mike. Just a housekeeping question. Doug, you talked about quadrupling your FBAR capacity and basically doubling it to about some time right now from 2011. Firstly, has that doubling been done? And second, you said that the subsequent doubling will be based on demand. So is it fair to say that obviously you're seeing the demand and there will be that subsequent doubling?","Douglas R. Bettinger","We have no change in plans based on what we previously told you.","Operator","All right. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the Q&A portion. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Tom Krause for closing remarks.","Thomas  Krause","Thank you, operator. Before we close, I would like to remind everyone that Avago will be presenting and meeting with investors at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media & Telecom Conference in San Francisco this week on February 28, and we'll be meeting with investors at the UBS Trends in Wireless Conference in New York on March 6.","Thank you for participating in today's call.

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Tom Krause, Vice President of Corporate Development. Please go ahead, sir.","Thomas Krause","Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are Hock Tan, President and CEO; and Tony Maslowski, Interim Chief Financial Officer of Avago Technologies.","After the market closed today, Avago distributed a press release and financial tables describing our financial performance for the second quarter fiscal year 2013. If you did not receive a copy, you may obtain the information from the Investors section of Avago's website at avagotech.com.","This conference call is being webcast live and a recording will be available via telephone playback for 1 week. It will also be archived in the Investors section of our website at avagotech.com. During the prepared comments section of this call, Hock and Tony will be providing details of our second quarter results, background to our Q3 2013 outlook and some commentary regarding the business environment. We will take questions after the end of our prepared comments. In addition to U.S. GAAP reporting, Avago reports certain financial measures on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the tables attached to today's press release. Comments made during today's call will primarily refer to our non-GAAP financial results. Please refer to our press release today and our recent filings with the SEC for information on the specific risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Hock. Hock?","Hock E. Tan","Thank you, Tom. Good afternoon, everyone. We're going to start today by reviewing recent end market business highlights, and then Tony will provide a summary of the second quarter fiscal 2013 financial results.","Now revenue for our Q2 fiscal year was $562 million, which was at the upper end of our guidance. This represented a decline of 2% from last quarter and a decrease of 3% from the same quarter a year ago. Here, wireless revenue declined 9% sequentially, in line with our guidance, as we expected the negative revenue impact from a major U.S. smartphone product transition, was partially offset by new platform launches at certain other OEM customers. Wire revenue was up as we expected. Surprisingly, industrial was also up slightly and above expectations, thanks to slow, but steady improvement in the industrial end market demand.","Let me now provide more color on each of our target markets starting with wireless. Revenue from wireless was essentially in line with our expectations, declining 9% sequentially during Q2. Wireless represented 50% of total revenues. A significant product transition at our largest North American smartphone OEM was the primary reason for the Q2 sequential decline. However, this revenue headwind was partially offset by the launch of the Samsung Galaxy S4 platform, as well as certain other OEMs that ramped 4G\/LTE smartphones during the quarter. We have significant FBAR content in these devices and we do see increased opportunity to expand FBAR content in next-generation smartphones.","Let me elaborate on this further, if I could. As many of you know, LTE is proliferating and LTE operates in bands that are pushing traditional SAW filters to technical limits. We also now are seeing envelope tracking being adopted in some new smartphone designs. The benefit of envelope tracking or ET, as it is known, is better power amplifier efficiency. However, ET creates a noisier RF environment. As a result, we generally believe that FBAR provides isolation, which will improve the performance of the future ET-enabled phones.","Finally, service providers are also starting to adopt a technique known as carrier aggregation led by the combined different bands to achieve much higher data rates. We see the use of FBAR multiplexers that efficiently combine multiple signals as the preferred approach for smartphone OEMs to successfully implement carrier aggregation. Given these trends, we expect FBAR filtering will continue to be the key driver of our wireless business whether it be discreet FBAR duplexes or higher ASP front-end modules integrating FBAR with power amplifiers and other RF content.","Now consistent, as you may know, with our earnings higher gross margin with our FBAR products, I would also highlight that a mix of wireless has gone up from low 40s, as a percent of revenue a year ago, to 50% this last quarter. But yet our corporate gross margin has remained basically unchanged at around 51% on a non-GAAP basis.","Now looking towards Q3. We see the start of a very strong ramp from our North American smartphone OEM customer as they transition to the next-generation platform. Demand outside of this large customer is also expected to continue. As a result, we anticipate Q3 overall wireless revenue to grow in the high-single-digits on a percentage basis.","Next, wired infrastructure. Wired revenues grew 7% sequentially and represented 27% of total revenue. During the quarter, we saw an early recovery in enterprise spending, mainly though from data center applications and build-outs. While the traditional, more traditional enterprise networking market remained virtually flat. As you may now, many data center customers are today moving to the next-generation 40-gigabit per second switching platforms. We believe our design win momentum and many key OEMs is allowing us to gain share in this important growth area. We believe we have strong growth opportunities for our ASIC SerDes business on 40G data center switching platforms, in particular with our largest networking OEM. On the other hand, I would also note demand from carrier routing is still weak.","Looking forward to Q3, however, we expect data center spending will continue to improve, creating a tailwind to our SerDes business. We also expect an uptick in 40G parallel optic interconnects, which will follow this equipment installations, driven by this new data center platforms. These 2 demand drivers, we believe, will allow our wired infrastructure revenues to grow mid- to high-single digits sequentially in Q3.","Finally, let me discuss our industrial target market. You may recall last quarter, we guided low-single digit decline, actually, in industrial. It turned out, we were somewhat conservative. Revenue grew 4% sequentially and accounted for 23% of the total revenue. During Q2, industrial orders actually improved, but at a gradual pace, driven primarily by slow but very steady demand -- increase in distribution resales in the industrial market. In fact, industrial resales for us grew 3% -- over 3% sequentially, in line with our initial revenue growth.","In all geographical regions, except Japan, resales, in fact, grew quarter-on-quarter. Looking at Q3, we continue to see an improvement in end market demand across all regions, driven through multiple applications. We therefore, anticipate revenue in industrial will continue to grow mid-single digits when compared to Q2.","In summary, Q3, we expect broad-based improvements in all 3 target markets. Similar to Q2, wired and industrial should continue to trend up, but at a somewhat higher pace. The big swing factor for us is from wireless with the ramp of the product transition at our major North American smartphone OEM. With that in mind, we expect consolidated revenue for Avago to grow between 6% to 9% over that of Q2.","Okay. With that, let me now turn this call over to Tony for a more detailed review of our second quarter 2013 financials. Tony?","Anthony Maslowski","Thank you, Hock, and good afternoon, everyone. Before reviewing the second quarter fiscal 2013 financial results, I want to remind you that my comments today will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP data is included with the earnings release issued today and is also available on our website at www.avagotech.com.","Revenue of $562 million in Q2 represents a decrease of 2% from last quarter and a decrease of 3% from the same quarter a year ago. The sequential result was at the upper end of our guidance for the quarter. Q2 results were helped by improvement in demand from our industrial end market, where as you know, we sell primarily through distributors. These results compared to wired revenue that came in slightly lower than our guidance. Revenue from our wireless target market was in line with our expectations. Both Foxconn and Samsung, were greater than 10% customers in the quarter.","Our Q2 gross margin was 51.2%, approximately 50 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance. This was driven by stronger revenue in the industrial target market and better gross margin performance in our wired market. Q2 gross margin increased 50 basis points from last quarter for similar reasons.","Turning to operating expenses. R&D expenses for Q2 increased by $2 million to $88 million as a result of higher R&D investment. However, SG&A decreased by $2 million to $42 million resulting in flat operating expenses of $130 million compared to Q1. These expenses were in line with our guidance. As a percentage of sales, R&D increased to 16% and SG&A decreased to 7% of net revenue. Income from operations for the quarter decreased by $4 million sequentially to $158 million and represented 28% of net revenue. Compared to the $171 million for Q2 of last year, income from operations decreased by $13 million. Interest expense for the quarter was $1 million, which was offset by a $1 million gain from other income.","Taxes came in at $5 million for Q2. Q2 net income of $153 million decreased 6% from the prior quarter. And Q2 earnings per diluted share of $0.61 was $0.04 lower than Q1. The sequential decrease in Q2 earnings is primarily attributable to lower revenue and higher taxes.","Compared to Q2 of last year, net income was $15 million lower and earnings per diluted share was $0.05 lower. This was a result of lower revenue and higher spending. Our share-based compensation in Q2 was $17 million. The breakdown of the expense for Q2 includes $2 million in cost of goods sold, $7 million in R&D and $8 million in SG&A.","In Q3, we anticipate share-based compensation will be approximately $20 million. And just as a reminder, the company's definition of non-GAAP net income excludes share-based compensation expense.","Moving on to the balance sheet. Our days sales outstanding came in at 44 days. This was down 2 days from the prior quarter due to our efforts in the collections area. Our inventory ended at 229 million, an increase of 21 million from the last quarter. Days on hand were 76 days. We continue to build wireless inventory in anticipation of various product launches with our smartphone OEM customers. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.22 billion and we generated $191 million in operational cash flow. We spent $47 million on capital expenditures. We spent approximately $37 million on an acquisition in the quarter. For Q3, we expect CapEx to be approximately $67 million as we continue to spend on our fab capacity expansion in Fort Collins, Colorado.","During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 318,000 shares, which consumed $11 million of cash. On April 4, 2013, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per ordinary share, which consumed $47 million of cash. This dividend was raised by $0.02 from the prior quarter, and I point out that since the inception of our dividend program in Q2 2011, we've continued to increase our dividend each quarter.","I'd like to make a comment about our capital allocation strategy going forward. Supported by a healthy balance sheet and strong quarterly free cash flows, our focus will be to continue to maximize the return to our shareholders. Our board will continue to consider increasing our quarterly dividend in line with what we have done in the past. We also plan to be -- to more consistently repurchase shares to limit dilution from employee-related stock issuances. In addition, we will continue to evaluate potential strategic investments and acquisition as another way of deploying cash to maximize return to shareholders.","Now let me turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2013. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions and we do not intend to update this guidance.","As we stated in the press release, the guidance does not include the acquisition of CyOptics business. However, we do plan to provide additional guidance for the acquired business after the transaction closes. So first, revenue is expected to grow by 6% to 9% from Q2. We see broad-based strength across all 3 end markets. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 51%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. Operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $133 million, interest and other is projected to be a gain of $1 million, taxes are forecasted to be approximately $6 million. And finally, the diluted share count forecast is 253 million shares.","That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Hock, just a question following up, first of all, on the wireless business, you mentioned that you're going to have an initial product launch that's helping in your July quarter. How should we think about seasonality in your wireless businesses? Last year, it seemed like all that goodness fell in one single quarter. Is it going to be a bit more spread out this quarter? Or any color you can give us would be helpful.","Hock E. Tan","Well, I think the question -- you have multiple points in this question, so let me try to address of them one by one. Seasonality in the smartphones business, I believe, still exists. Though, very much muted these days. [indiscernible] A few years back, frankly. It's more driven by product launches, major product launches, of large smartphone OEMs more than anything else. And what we were referring to, in our guidance for this July quarter, is the fact that we will be experiencing -- or we are experiencing, I should say, we are in the midst of it, the initial -- just the initial ramp of this large smart -- North American smartphone OEM in this quarter, but it is just the initial ramp. We expect the bulk of that ramp to actually occur in the following quarter.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. And then as my follow-up, switching gears over onto the wired side of the business. You gave a lot of good color on the SerDes side. The parallel optics side and specifically, the core router side, can you just give us some color about when you think that can rebound and how much of a headwind year-over-year that still represents?","Hock E. Tan","Well, if you look at it year-over-year, as I say, time starts to smoke things up, we do expect service provider spending to be back half-loaded this year, especially this fiscal -- even for our fiscal year. We -- what we see is a stream of smaller orders these days. But especially in Q2, things kind of look -- still look weak compared to Q1. And we expect Q3 right now in our guidance to be not much different. We could be pleasantly surprised. But we certainly expect, as we move beyond June, July, for service providers in China and even North America to start putting in place core routing backhaul infrastructure, which will then drive a stronger demand for our parallel optics. And that's great. That will -- and that will be a very positive development, but we do not see that so -- as much this quarter, as perhaps, subsequent quarters.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the industrial business. What kind of booking trends do you see as you progress through the quarter? And are there any specific geographies or sub-verticals where you think you're doing better than others right now?","Hock E. Tan","Okay. Jim, industrial, as you know, is -- up to 2 quarters of -- of not very great movement in trends, we started to see last quarter, actually, a reversal in resell. And I'm referring to resell globally. And as I mentioned, industrial actually grew 3% recently last quarter sequentially. We expect -- and what we're seeing in order patterns is we feel we very much expect the same to happen this quarter. The important fact for geographies, North America was strongly recovering. North America sequentially was growing high-single digits last quarter and momentum continues today. Euro and Asia-Pac was also growing at least mid-single digits in industrial. The only market that was down last quarter was Japan, and it's because of the yen. Now that the yen have kind of stabilized at a fairly weak level, we actually seeing industrial turn around this quarter, in fact, for Japan. So industrial looks like an improvement, but the way we see it, it's a very gradual but steady improvement.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great, that's helpful. And then as a follow-up, on the networking side, you talked about several of the product cycle drivers like 40 gig that are benefiting you in the July quarter, can you talk about how much of the benefit for the July quarter is product cycle versus end demand-driven and whether you think you can sustain momentum in that segment into the October quarter as well?","Hock E. Tan","Well, it's -- I'll tell you what we see, it's almost like the -- and maybe they are really not 2 markets, but we almost see like 2 segments to this enterprise networking market. There's this new or mega center build-out -- data center build-out by people providing like cloud computing, social network -- basically, social network stuff like that. And then there is the more traditional corporate enterprise of what we corporate enterprise site. That site, the latter, is still pretty flat. We find companies are still not spending that strongly, but holding -- sustaining. But on the data center side, we still -- we see a lot of build-outs. We're seeing increasing level of build-outs and that's showing -- and that's giving a lot of growth to the business we are in because these guys are adopting, for a large part, of these new-generation products in 40G and where we have a lot of market share. And I think we're benefiting from -- so the best answer is a combination of both.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Terence Whalen with Citi.","Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","If I could add, like to just take a little bit of a step-back regarding the FBAR business, in particular, you provided a slide at your Analyst Day that showed collective or cumulative unit shipments of FBAR. And what that showed is periodically over the past 2 or 3 years, you shipped about 1 billion or between 1 billion and 1.2 billion pieces. My question is, is that an accurate understanding of that slide presentation? And can you help me understand that within context of your plans to quadruple capacity between '11 and '13, because that would then imply that your unit output would go from about 1 billion per year to several billion per year. I just want to understand if this is an accurate understanding, if you could help me refine that.","Hock E. Tan","Okay. I guess, the point of what you're trying to say is the volume -- our volume shipments of FBAR is that increasing pretty strongly or dramatically. And answer is, yes. It has been and especially with more and more LTE rollouts in more and more countries beyond North America, definitely, yes. And so also with the coming into place of technics, as I mentioned, by envelope tracking and -- down the road, next year probably -- next year, carrier aggregation and adoption of carrier aggregation by handset OEMs to enable that, even more so. So yes, that's a good reason why we're increasing our capacity. Now to be fair, we should also say that penetration of FBAR 3 years ago was at a much lower level than penetration of FBAR today. So it's -- our volume increase that you are kind of highlighting and is kind of a demonstrated with our capacity increase that we just put in place is also a factor, not just of end markets growing, as I indicated here, but also the fact that the -- and the fact that number of smartphones are increasing, is also a reflection of the fact that the content of FBAR in each smartphone is also increasing.","Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then if I could ask a follow-up related to that. So if I do the math then, it's clear that pricing on FBAR is coming down because obviously, the volume growth of quadruple is so far ahead of the revenue growth of FBAR. So I guess my question is, as pricing is coming down, it seems like you're able to maintain margins. So I guess my question is, as we go forward, looking even outside of the top 2 customers, what's your perspective on the growth potential outside of top 2? Is it potentially greater? And also, what's the implication for margins for business overall, given the pricing dynamics going lower on really sort of extraordinary volume growth here?","Hock E. Tan","Let me try to answer that as simply as possible. The drive to more and more FBAR usage in handsets is largely driven by requirements, it's driven by changes in the -- technology changes in the industry, now architectural changes in the industry for making smartphones, less so specific OEMs. Though certain specific OEMs may show preference for FBAR versus SAW filter because of performance. It tends more -- from our perspective, to be driven more by the fact that LTE, as a global thing, is happening and to replace 3G, or carrier aggregation, as I mentioned, is happening as in by -- and when it happens, it will take -- it will do something that most service providers, carriers will adopt as envelope tracking because it saves power on handsets. So that -- on that -- all those issues are driving just like we mentioned in the last conference call, certain bands like in Europe, the European band, LTE band, drives at 100% into FBAR. Like coexistence problems between TD-LTE and the WiFi and WiMAX band in China also drives it into FBAR. Those are technological trends, not unique to any specific OEM. So to answer you, the fact that 2 large OEMs may use it now, it does -- it's just a reflection of the fact that the entire industry will be trending towards it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Hock, I think you mentioned Samsung was a 10%-plus customer. If I'm not mistaken, it's for the first time, or at least it's been very infrequent, that they have been a 10%-plus customer. The question is, do you see them adopting more FBAR across their portfolio as they are much larger than Apple, but they have not used FBAR as much because of their product mix. But the question really is do you just see them adopting more FBAR in future products?","Hock E. Tan","To answer the 2 parts, the first part, I didn't say it, but only the -- and but it's still true. Yes, they -- last quarter, Q2, they became a 10% customer. And number two, and then by the way, it doesn't mean they'll stay there forever, and by the way, it's the first time they showed up for us. And now to the answer to your bigger part of question, I cannot really respond to it, not because it is proprietary to our customer, which it is, as much as the fact that it's the architectures will be what they choose to adopt. Having said that, they, obviously, they do adopt what industry technology architectures will drive them to do, but it's not for me to say whether they are going to use more FBAR or not. Frankly, I'm -- this thing might change over time. But it's more a function of where the industry trends, technological trends, tend to drive them more than anything else.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And as my follow-up, one more on your analog industrial business. As I look over the last few quarters, I think your reported sales have either been much stronger or much weaker compared to the original guidance. And I'm curious, what causes that disparity? Is that purely macro, is it a function of just that you have to go through a distribution channel? Is it anything in the forecasting process or -- but the question really is, do you think you have enough scale and breadth of product in that business to be successful longer-term?","Anthony Maslowski","Again, I'll answer this question. This is Tony. Is that, yes, we've seen probably more of the follow through with resales. So again, some of the predictability is a little tougher for that and then also, again, we wanted to see kind of steady trends from our distributors as well, so that's what caused that.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I see. And in terms of just the breadth and scale in that business? Do you feel comfortable with that? Or do you think more inorganic drivers will be needed for that?","Anthony Maslowski","Well, I think, again, the business is solid, but also we're looking at opportunity.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura Securities.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Hock, can you talk a little bit about your acquisition of Javelin Semiconductor, why you did it and how this strengthens your position in wireless?","Hock E. Tan","Well, it's really is about a technology acquisition. It's we acquiring 15 very, very good, very experienced, very solid RF CMOS designers. And that's really the main reason we're acquiring it.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And what are the RF CMOS designers do in terms of expanding your opportunity on wireless?","Hock E. Tan","Well, yes -- good point. And well, as you may have seen in some of the architectures, your roadmap to architectures, there are more than just power amplifiers and duplexers in the RF, what people call the RF front-end between antenna and the baseband on a transceiver baseband. There are a lot of other components. And as you put in more and more bands, operating within each circuit in any handsets, you start to need things, among other things, things like switching, tuning, various other things that will be very helpful and also interfaces. As you know, to operate envelope tracking, you need a certain kind of interface. In fact, people call it MIPI interface. That requires pretty tricky CMOS designs. And those kinds of CMOS designs are pretty tricky because a lot of it is done in not your normal traditional CMOS process, but RF CMOS process, which is slightly different and obviously, requires some expertise and experience in it. We figure, we do not have enough expertise in-house and this is a good way to acquire those pool of talent at a fairly inexpensive price.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I got you. I guess, rightly or wrongly, I think of FBAR is the answer for high-end phones. Having said that, your -- there's been a lot of reports that would suggest your largest customers are trying to broaden their flagship models into the mid-tier segment of the handset market. And I was just wondering if you could talk about how you're positioned for those opportunities down the road?","Hock E. Tan","Well, people use FBAR in handsets or smartphones whether they be high-end, mid-range, handset -- smartphones, even low-end smartphones, a lot of times, very often because from a technical perspective, has limited choice. If it doesn't work, you don't get a signal, you won't get a signal and the phone may cost of $1,000 or $200, it just won't work. And in many -- as I mentioned in an answer to an early questions, a lot of the drivers towards increased use of FBAR over SAWs over the last few years, especially, has been driven by technical considerations, not just PR preference in performance, as much as technical considerations. Because if you can make it work in Band 7, if you can make duplexing work well in Band 7, LTE in Europe except with FBAR, you have no choice. You've got to put an FBAR in. And the same applies when you try to run TD-LTE in China with WiFi. You're going to have a lot of interference, has no getting out of it. And in fact, it's pretty recognized in the industry today, which is exactly why you need an FBAR filter just to be able to address that, what we call that issue of coexistence of 2 spectrum. So it's mainly driven technically, less by economic considerations.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay, that's good to hear. Just lastly for me, can you give us an update on how the CFO search is progressing? And do you think you're close to making a decision on a permanent CFO?","Hock E. Tan","We're still moving along. This has only been 2 months -- 3, maybe. Still, we're in the thick of it. But thank you for asking.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a question, I think you answered this but you're clearly seeing the strong demand for FBAR. Do you the mix to move further to FBAR? And then, Hock, if you can just talk about if you've seen any indications, there's a lot of talk about other competition versus yourself and TriQuint. Have you seen any of those products in the market?","Hock E. Tan","Oh, we do. On FBAR on your latter question, I guess, well, with -- SAW is our biggest competitor, frankly. SAW filters, by the way. I mean, FBAR today in a total environment of handsets market, of which they are like over 1.3 billion, 1.4 billion units per year. By far, the vast majority of handsets uses SAW filters. So in my guess, our approximate guess for FBAR penetration, is probably only about barely 20% at this point. But it's hard because in the same phone, you're going to have -- with multiple bands, you can have both in the same phones, SAW filters and FBAR, which makes it even more tricky to estimate it. But the fact of the matter is, SAW guys and there are people like Virata, TAIYO YUDEN, OpCos. They're all largely SAW guys. They're still here in this area. We do see some FBAR on -- entrants, as we mentioned correctly. We have license TriQuint to do it, and we are probably best -- 1 or 2 other guys who tried to do it. But do keep in mind, obviously, 2 things: one is we have lots of IP around it, huge thickets of IP on FBAR, but more importantly, in my view, we've been doing this thing now for 15 years. We are now in our eighth generation of FBAR process. We like to believe we will outrun, outcompete anybody in this market in the straight marketplace. But just in case it doesn't work, we will -- we have pretty strong IP to fall back on.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then regarding -- I was surprised to see European LTE band which had FBAR on a U.S. phone, seemed a little early for LTE roaming. I was just curious you thought that was one-off for you, that you would see more LTE roaming in European bands and more global phones?","Hock E. Tan","Well, we are -- we do see LTE -- the European Band 7 been used increasingly and that's much more than Europe.","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman with RBC Capital Markets.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Hock, if you could talk a little bit, you mentioned your TD-LTE. We're looking and waiting for China Mobile, the world's largest carrier to roll this out. What is your exposure both to the base station side of the business and to the handset needs that they'll have when they move to TD-LTE they over there? Any update you can offer us as far as timing and expectations would be fabulous.","Hock E. Tan","Well, I think I know as much as you do, really. And everyone of us now do -- in regard to that, I think we are pretty sure that there is a big, large installations happening, that it will be -- that will be, as we put it, as they call it, term it, trials. And these are very large volume that they're putting -- installing for trials currently and it's interesting how they're building it up. But they definitely are. We think -- our exposure to it comes in 3 ways, interesting enough. We sell components something from -- our multi-RF multi-market components, our low-noise amplifiers, maxes, even small-single amplifiers occasionally into those base stations that are being installed. So something like 200,000 is a war that's going on for trials. That's still going on. We are -- that's fought and won. We also see, and related to that structure, that once those base stations are in and things are starting to operate and the license are in, they have to do backhauling of those signals. And that's where a lot of our core routing would have an opportunity to participate in. And finally, of course, with TD-LTE, handset needs TD-LTE handsets operating in those bands, those spectrum tend to have very strong coexistence issues with WiFi, which is also a very prevalent spectrum and very common spectrum in China, among other things. So great opportunity of coexistence for FBAR. So we're going to get in 3 ways. Right now, when we think it will happen? I don't know. My guess, actually my guess one effort, as you many of you have heard is probably later part of this year.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","All right, if I could change gears and look at your industrial exposure, what do you think we should consider the industrial market growth to look like this year and next? And are there any product cycles or inventory coverage changes that could impact your growth rate in the time period?","Hock E. Tan","Well, that has not been very good to predict, as evidenced by last quarter. We were thinking last quarter continued to be soft -- or relatively flattish to a slight decline, which is what we guided. And lo and behold, we were somewhat wrong, I call it conservative. I mean, we showed a low-single digit 4%, I guess, not that low, increase sequentially in our industrial business. And we're predicting around the same, maybe slightly higher this quarter and it's more a reflection of a sense of conservatism than anything else, I'll be honest, because we could do better. But we could be bigger debt. But what we're seeing, the rate of orders, rate of resale, I should add, that we track through our distributors worldwide, which is where most of our industrial are sold is running around that pace, mid-single digit. Okay?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ian Ing with Lazard Capital Markets.","Ian Ing - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Hock, you mentioned in wireless, improving gross margins to 50%. Is that largely mix, more FBAR, less PAs or there's some structural changes there? And could the mix, going forward, potentially shift back to PAs, given that you sell pads, which is a key building block and also with the CMOS PAs with Javelin?","Hock E. Tan","Wow! You've got 1,000 little points in there. I don't know where to start, but let me start with number one, I didn't say my gross margin has been at 50%. I'm sorry, you may have misheard. What I meant was perhaps whether 50% was used was that -- the mix of our wireless revenues last quarter versus the same quarter a year ago was 50% versus low 40s. And in spite of that mix of wireless, our overall corporate gross margin remained at 51%. That's just to clarify that, but our gross margin in wireless, I didn't not say at all that it was 50%. It doesn't mean it isn't, it's just that we do not disclose separately gross margin by product in segments, if you don't mind. But to answer your question, yes, I think it's definitely improving gross margin in our wireless business as the content of FBAR increases and it is whether it is increase of content through discrete duplex -- FBAR duplexes or filters versus in the form of a pad, it helps. Obviously, we've a pad, as you call it, has been a power amplifier duplexer module, the mix -- it somewhat dilute the overall mix, but the trend is all in the right direction. And what we do see and recognize is and that's a point I was trying to show -- make in my opening remarks earlier is that even as our wireless business as a percent of total revenues do grow, the improving gross margin, we are seeing in our overall wireless business because of a favorable product mix will continue to improve. And that we definitely are seeing -- have been seeing, which basically reestablishes our longer-term model, which is that we will grow as a company long-term and we will, over time, expand our gross margin. Okay, now, will things group revert back to more power amplifiers? That's never say impossible, but all indications are architectures of next-generation smartphones as we foresee, as we have visibility on, is obviously, pushing in a direction that we view as very favorable from our overall product mix in wireless.","Ian Ing - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then for my follow-up on the wireline said, there is a lot of noise around silicon photonics, whether it's from Cisco, Arista or Mellanox. But my specific question is, Arista, it looks like in their latest offerings in SDN, they did went -- they did go with a VCSEL solution. So do you see it basically transitioning to silicon photonics once the technology is ready or other scenarios where they stick with the current incumbent solutions?","Hock E. Tan","By the way, that VCSEL solution you mentioned is my solution. You know that, right?","Ian Ing - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","We know, yes.","Hock E. Tan","Thank you by saying that, but -- no, I don't know. We think they may think about that, but silicon photonics while there's a lot of splash on it, is still a very difficult technology to implement and best description is it's still being implemented. I mean, there are products being sold in silicon photonics, I would daresay there are more talk about it, headlines about it, than there are actually lots of products about -- around it. It's -- and it could be very expensive as opposed to a VCSEL solution. Important fact, we believe the VCSEL solution we are providing to Arista in this recent launch is -- which we think is a very, very proprietary and creative solution, is a very low-cost affordable solution, which is the benefit of parallel optics as we implement right now.","Thomas Krause","Okay. Operator, we've got time for 2 more questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Chin.","Steven Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Hock, just a couple on the wireless growth opportunities ahead in terms of some technologies coming down the pipeline. So you mentioned carrier aggregation as an important technology that the service providers may be implementing in the near future. I was wondering if that would provide an opportunity in terms of 3G smartphones that may use the HSPA+ type technologies and includes carrier aggregation. Does that extend the time for FBAR beyond LTE once it's done?","Hock E. Tan","I'm not sure I understand your question. Could you, perhaps, rephrase it? I may have heard some of it, but would you mind, perhaps, rephrasing it to make it clearer?","Steven Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Sure. No problem. So I think some of your comments regarding carrier aggregation as a wireless technology that may be included in future phone networks may be a positive for FBAR adoption and I assume that's a primarily -- that you're primarily returning -- referring to LTE 4G. But for 3G technologies, I believe that carrier aggregation may also be included in future revisions of the HSPA+ in newer technologies. Is that something that is also included in your comments about FBAR growth opportunities or is it only 4G that you're referring to?","Hock E. Tan","That's what I thought you heard -- you said. Well, I appreciate it you making it clear. No, when I say that, I include both 3G and 4G.","Steven Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And I guess, how soon would you expect there to be some mid- to high-end smartphones that are 3G only that support carrier aggregation to start using FBAR?","Hock E. Tan","Well, see the challenge -- a lot of the challenge -- a lot of the right to put in place carrier aggregation because implementation of carrier aggregation is not a trivial process, is driven by 4G or LTE spectrum because, as we all know, 2G was very easy. All the big, easy chunks of spectrum were given, 3G followed thereafter and a lot of the big chunks were given away. What's left when we -- by the time we reached 4G, was a sliver and chunks, a little bit here and there scattered all over. And that's when the challenge of -- to the carriers shows up. Because for LTE or 4G, you don't have chunks of it, you have little slivers of bandwidth of spectrum scattered all over the spectrum, some of them very far, but none of them quite combined to a fast channel. And that's when carrier aggregation really drive it. So it is -- it's true, if 4G or LTE is what creates the impetus towards looking at carrier aggregation because carriers have multiple slivers that you need to put together and make into one big set pie. In 3G and 2G, there's less necessity to do that.","Thomas Krause","Okay. Operator, we'll take one more question. Thanks, Steven.","Operator","Your last question comes from Vijay Rakesh with Sterne Agee.","Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Just one question here. If you look at the FBAR side, obviously we're getting -- making some nice strides there. I'm just wondering how do you see your content in smartphones now? I mean, last year versus this year and how do you see that next year as you see envelope tracking, carrier aggregation and all of that come in? And also, if you could comment on CapEx for next year, how that's looking, too?","Hock E. Tan","I'll answer the first part. Tony will take the second part on CapEx. Well, it is increasing, there's no question. The content of smartphones, but it varies from OEM to OEM, how they design, how many bands they want to stick into 1 smartphone, which varies between low-end smartphones and high-end smartphones. But on average, across the spectrum of smartphones, because of more and more bandwidth, special -- more and more bands as LTE comes in and you have to inter-operate with 3G and 2G, CDMA, all that stuff in and coexistence, WiFi and a few other things that comes in television broadcasting, the content will increase and we have been seeing that, which is why I say the penetration of FBAR into smartphones will continue to increase, not just because, obviously, not because of the high-growth of smartphones, but also the content in every widget [ph] and on every smartphone will continue to increase.","Anthony Maslowski","And then regarding CapEx, for this year, we're above $200 million. We're just starting to look at our next expansion plans, which would go into next year for FBAR capacity and that's probably the biggest single swing in it. So we're either going to be slightly below 200 for the coming years and then we'll plateau from there, okay?","Operator","I will now like to turn the call back over to Tom Krause for any closing remarks.","Thomas Krause","Okay.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Ms. Beatrice Russotto, Director, Investor Relations. Ms. Russotto, you may begin.","Beatrice Russotto","Thank you, operator and good afternoon everyone. Joining me today are Hock Tan, President and CEO; and Tom Krause, Chief Financial Officer of Broadcom. After the market closed today, Broadcom distributed a press release and financial table describing our financial performance for the second quarter of fiscal year 2019. If you did not receive a copy, you may obtain the information from the Investors section of Broadcom's website at broadcom.com.","This conference call is being webcast live and a recording will be available via telephone playback for one week. It will also be archived in the Investors section of our website at broadcom.com.","During the prepared comments section of this call, Hock and Tom will be providing details of our second quarter fiscal year 2019 results, guidance for fiscal year 2019, and commentary regarding the business environment. We will take questions after the end of our prepared comments.","Please refer to our press release today and our recent filings with the SEC for information on the specific risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call.","In addition to U.S. GAAP reporting, Broadcom reports certain financial measures on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the tables attached to today's press release. Comments made during today's call will primarily refer to our non-GAAP financial results.","So, with that, I'll turn the call over to Hock.","Hock Tan","Thank you, Bea, and thank you everyone for joining in today. Let me touch on the second quarter results after which I will update you on the current environment and our outlook for the second half of the year.","Looking at the second quarter just passed, it really went as planned. Networking continued to perform very well, and our broadband business started to recover. This was offset by the anticipated sharp decline in wireless and the ongoing softness in storage.","On the other hand, the infrastructure software business delivered solid topline results, benefiting from sustained enterprise demand for our mainframe and distributed software as well as SAN switching products.","The integration of CA is progressing well. Just last week, we reached a major milestone with day two, which is the integration of the CA business processes onto Broadcom's IP platform.","We remain confident that we can meet, if not exceed, the long-term revenue and profitability targets that we laid out for CA to you last year. Renewals in our CA business are strong, and the dollar commitments from our core customers continue to grow.","Now, let me address the current business environment and our outlook for the remainder of the year. We have, as I indicated, performed very much to plan in the first half of fiscal 2019. And in the second half, we had expected a recovery. However, while enterprise and mainframe software demand remained stable, particularly in North America and Europe, with respect to semiconductors, it is clear that the U.S.\/China trade conflict, including the Huawei export ban, is creating economic and political uncertainty and reducing visibility for our global OEM customers.","As a result, demand volatility has increased and our customers are actively reducing inventory levels to manage risks. This leads us to believe the second half of 2019 will be more in line with the first half as opposed to the previously expected recovery. We now anticipate fiscal 2019 semiconductor solutions segment revenue of $17.5 billion, which translates into a year-over-year decline in the high single-digits.","CA software continues to perform above our original expectations while SAN switching is slowing down after a very strong first half. As a result, we are maintaining our fiscal 2019 infrastructure software outlook at $5 billion.","While this scenario has been playing out, I should emphasize the fundamentals of our business remains very much intact. We continue to execute on the very rich roadmap for next-generation network switching and routing in the cloud and enterprises, including the leading-edge Trident 4 software-defined network switch just recently announced this week. We've also secured the next two generations of RF front-end at a large North American OEM, which positions us very well for the transition into 5G.","We continue to win increasing numbers of compute off-load accelerators in the hyper cloud operators across AI, video transcoding, encryption, and networking. We are pleased with the ramp of our new-generation Wi-Fi 802.11ax, otherwise called Wi-Fi 6, in enterprise gateways and carrier access [PONs][ph]. All this leaves us confident that we will able to continue to drive sustained long-term revenue growth and increasing free cash flow.","Let me now turn it over to Tom who will provide you with more color.","Thomas Krause","Thank you, Hock. Consolidated net revenue for the second quarter was $5.5 billion, a 10% increase from a year ago and EPS came in at $5.21, a 7% increase from a year ago off of a 448 million weighted average fully diluted share count. In addition, we have record free cash flow of $2.54 billion or 46% of revenue. Free cash flow grew 20% year-over-year.","The semiconductor solutions segment revenue was $4.1 billion and represented 74% of our total revenue this quarter, which was down 10% as expected year-on-year on a comparable basis. Our infrastructure software segment revenue was $1.4 billion and represented 26% of revenue.","Let me now provide additional detail on our financial performance. Operating expenses were $1.02 billion. Operating income from continuing operations was $2.95 billion and represented 53.5% of net revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.11 billion and represented 56.4% of net revenue. This figure excludes $142 million of depreciation.","Receivables in the quarter decreased $193 million, and inventory decreased $40 million from the prior quarter. I would also note that we accrued $136 million of restructuring and integration expenses and made $218 million of cash restructuring and integration payments in the quarter. Finally, we spent $125 million on capital expenditures.","In the second quarter, we returned $2.4 billion to stockholders consisting of $1.1 billion in the form of cash dividends and $1.3 billion for the repurchase and elimination of 4.7 million AVGO shares. We ended the quarter with $5.3 billion of cash, $37.5 billion of total debt, 399 million outstanding shares, and 447 million fully diluted shares outstanding.","We also refinanced our $18 billion of term loans that we put in place at the beginning of fiscal 2019 to finance the CA acquisition. Via a combination of $11 billion of investment grade bonds and a new term loan, we're able to extend our average debt maturity to approximately five years and substantially reduce the quantum of debt due in any one year. As of today, our average cost of borrowing stands at approximately 3.7%.","Turning to our fiscal year 2019 guidance, as Hock discussed, we are updating our full year revenue guidance to $22.5 billion, including approximately $17.5 billion from semiconductor solutions and approximately $5 billion from infrastructure software. IP licensing is not expected to generate a material amount of revenue.","On a non-GAAP basis, operating margins are expected to be approximately 52.5%, an increase of approximately 150 basis points from our prior guidance. Net interest expense and others are expected to be approximately $1.3 billion. We do not contemplate any debt pay down in fiscal year 2019.","The tax rate is forecast to be approximately 11%. Depreciation is expected to be approximately $600 million. CapEx is expected to be approximately $500 million. As a result, free cash flow is expected to be approximately $9 billion, which takes into account projected restructuring and integration charges of approximately $1.1 billion.","Stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $2.2 billion. And finally, we expect weighted average diluted share count to be 444 million for Q3 and 443 million for Q4 and this excludes any impacts from share buybacks and eliminations.","Now, on to capital allocation, our capital allocation strategy remains the same. We plan to maintain the current quarterly dividend payout of $2.65 per share throughout the year subject to quarterly Board approval, which means we plan to pay out over $4 billion in cash dividends in fiscal 2019.","In addition, we remain committed to buying back and eliminating a total $8 billion of stock in fiscal 2019. In the first half of the fiscal year, we have spent $4.8 billion for the repurchase and elimination of shares.","That concludes my prepared remarks. During the Q&A portion of today's call, please limit yourselves to one question each, so we can accommodate as many analysts as possible. Operator, please open-up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]","Our first question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.","Vivek Arya","Thanks for taking my question. Hock, in the $2 billion or so reduction in the semiconductor outlook for the next two quarters, can you give us some sense how much of that is Huawei, how much is outside of Huawei and just any segment level impact so we can calibrate our models? Thank you.","Hock Tan","Well, it's an interesting way to figure that out because in terms of full disclosure, Huawei represented last year about $900 million of revenues for this company by itself. But the other part of the picture I should add is that guide down that we're providing, as you put it, of $2 billion obviously extends beyond just one particular customer.","We're talking about uncertainty in our marketplace, uncertainty because of the -- of demand in the form of order reduction as the supply chain out there constricts -- compressed, so to speak.","And because we do see, to some extent, end users in the U.S., particularly North America and Europe, continuing to be there. But what we do see in between is the uncertainty of the environment has put in place a concern about placing additional orders and actively a reduction of inventory out there. Basically, compression of supply chain is what's driving this reduction more than anything else and it's broad based.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays.","Blayne Curtis","Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Maybe I could just follow-up on to that question, Hock. Just kind of curious, as you look, I mean I think markets were soft and you saw a lot of revisions last quarter. You guys kind of maintained your forecast. I'm kind of just trying to figure out when you saw this slowdown, if you can give us any idea of that.","And then if there's just any more color you can add for end market, is there any end markets that you're not seeing this weakness? And if you can point to any particular product, that would be helpful.","Hock Tan","Well, we started seeing this softness as we -- basically, the beginning of this quarter, like Q3, very much so a dramatic reduction, and it particularly accelerated with [denial] [ph] order that was imposed on Huawei.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. On the networking side specifically, that's been a strong area for the team, growing double digits year-over-year for the past few quarters. And it's an area where you guys actually do have some pretty strong product cycles like Tomahawk 3, Jericho 2, some of the compute offload ASICs.","In the revised outlook ex-Huawei, how is the macro uncertainty impacting this segment and some of these programs? And again, ex-Huawei, would you expect the networking business to grow second half over first half?","Hock Tan","Harlan, very good question. Our networking business, which I think is what you're referring to, continues to be a very strong business. Year-on-year, we expect our networking -- total networking business, to grow double-digits year-on-year. It's strong, particularly with new product ramps and new product cycles that we've seen both in switching, routing related to that. It is one of the brightest areas in our portfolio in this environment and continuous to be strong notwithstanding the export ban on Huawei.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.","Ross Seymore","Hi Hock, thanks for letting me ask the question. I wanted to go into the wireless side. I know you just signed a supply agreement with a large North American customer. They typically have positive second half seasonality. And most of us believe you actually were reaping in some share.","So, if I put that all into the mix, how are you getting -- especially given what you just said in networking growing double-digits, how are you getting the second half to be relatively flat with the first half? Is there some offsets in other areas or are some of our assumptions in wireless incorrect?","Hock Tan","Well, I don't know what the assumptions are, Ross, on wireless. But networking is about really the -- is about the only area of strength in this current environment, and that's because it coincides with very strong product cycles we are seeing. In just about broadly any of the end market segments, we do not see, in terms of year-on-year, improvement from 2018.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS.","Timothy Arcuri","Hi. Hock, I actually just had a question about the competitive environment for your RF front-end business as we kind of move into 5G and particularly around a large modem maker now that's talking about having a complete RF package and sort of being able to sweep that in with their modem. So, can you kind of talk about the competitive environment and your position as you can get into 5G? Thanks.","Hock Tan","That's a very interesting question. We continue to believe we are very, very strongly positioned. And it's in many ways validated by some of the data points I just mentioned. We have, by far, the best technology and products out there in RF front-end components. They're typically the filters and the integrated front-end modules. We are, by far, the furthest ahead technology-wise and in terms of capabilities. And we continue to believe we are still very much in front.","And as I said, it's been validated and continues to be validated by the value we give to our very critical customers and the fact that they continue to be very supportive of our business.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.","Toshiya Hari","Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question. I had a question on RF as well. Hock, can you remind us what kind of content growth are you expecting or assuming into the back half, both on the RF side as well as the Wi-Fi side of your business within wireless?","And then you also talked about 5G or rather how the recent win positions you well into 5G. As of today, what you know based on what you heard from your customers, what kind of content growth on the RF side are you expecting as we transition to 5G over the next couple of years? Thank you.","Hock Tan","Thank you. Well, asking year-on-year is actually very difficult, so I appreciate you asking me what do I see over the next two, three years on content growth. And I mean the best way to describe content growth in RF, and we have seen that and we have empirical evidence of that for the last five years, even longer and not the same every year, is that, annually, we probably see in the 5% to 10% range content growth and with -- in terms of the products we ship.","Now, for the entire, I guess, our further available market, our -- yes, the further available market, it's probably a smaller growth percentage.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John Pitzer","Yes, good afternoon guys. Hock, I just want to go back to Ross' question about the wireless guide for the balance of the year. I'm just curious, relative to 90 days ago when you guys were kind of guiding the overall semi business well above normal seasonality for the balance of the year, now you're talking about a flat half-to-half.","To what extent did your content expectations come down to the back half of the year versus just this really being a unit issue on the wireless side of the business?","Hock Tan","Well, that's an interesting question that lays out that -- keep in mind; we're taking a very conservative stance here. And very frankly, even as we see the ramp-up and we do see the ramp-up, we are -- we've also been forecasting a fairly dramatic set of numbers before. And when you -- and that is more than offset by the fact that for the rest of the broader markets, we're just seeing a demand environment that is extremely uncertain.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.","Craig Hettenbach","Yes, thanks. Hock, just coming back to the compute offload you talked about at hyperscale. I know a little while back, you guys talked about some initial traction in ASICs. Just wanted to get an update in terms of the breadth of that particular hyperscale is and how -- to the extent that you're extending that to multiple customers as we look forward.","Hock Tan","Well, I have mentioned before in previous calls -- earnings calls about our focus in increasing traction in what we call compute offload engines or I call it, compute offload accelerators in multiple areas, including AI, of course, and virtualization, orchestration from the compute servers, and expanding that now to video transcoding and encryption. And we continue to see that and it is an emerging space from our perspective.","But nonetheless, it's a space that seems to be growing very steadily and continuing to trend up very significantly. And this is a space we believe at the end -- in a matter of three to five years could be a significant percentage of the total compute spend within any large scale data center.","And we're talking about potentially getting to perhaps even as high as 25% or more of total spend in the computing environment of a large scale cloud data center.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Danely with Citi.","Christopher Danely","Hey thanks guys. Just looking at the overall environment, Hock, do you think your guidance incorporates the proposed next round of $300 billion in tariffs, i.e., if that thing does go through, do you still feel good about your guidance? Or do you think there could be more downside if that does go through?","Hock Tan","I think at this point, we try to capture everything including that proposed next round into the picture. We have the belief that things are -- environment is very, very nervous. And that's why we see a very, very sharp and rapid contraction of supply chain and orders out there from our customers, especially our global OEM customers even as we believe, as I mentioned in North America and Europe, end demand hasn't reflected that. So, we are seeing a very reactive mood here. And so I got to believe that includes the sense that this $300 billion of next round of potential tariffs could be in place.","Also keep in mind, something I should add is that even as we see some -- there are two parts to this. One part is what's the impact of the Huawei ban on a company like us selling components and technology?","Well, short-term, keep in mind, we'll see a very sharp impact simply because there are no purchases allowed, and there's no obvious substitution in place from other OEMs replace -- taking over end demand, which may exist, which may continue to exist.","Give it a few months, give it six months, if those end demand still remains out there, mostly other OEMs qualified to take over those, to replace Huawei on those demand and other OEMs will come in, and those OEMs will continue to buy our products. And so we have a rebalancing and readjustment in demand from our side. But short-term, we do not expect to see that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust.","William Stein","Great. Thanks for taking my question. On a brighter note, I'd like to ask about CA a little bit. Last quarter, Hock, I think you talked about at least one proof point with regard to sort of deeper engagements with CIOs around a deal that might involve both sides of the business. Anything similar to that? Were you seeing more proof points around traction in sort of the strategic approach in that acquisition? Thank you.","Hock Tan","Well, yes. One of the things we are doing is -- as we said last time, is as we focus on core accounts -- as I said, these are the largest enterprises in the world who buys a lot of software infrastructure and infrastructure software.","And given the broad portfolio of products CA has that we bring to bear between mainframes, and these largest companies mostly runs a lot of mainframe capacity and distributed software infrastructure, and our ability to offer this as an enterprise and portfolio-wide transaction, we have been very, very successful in securing such enterprise-wide contracts with significant uplift in booking dollars in the form of larger amount of renewals with, right now, over 20 large accounts in the six months since we've taken over and closed on this transaction.","And we foresee that rate being even higher over the next six months. So, that's working. And that's working very well, which allows us to give you a fairly positive tone to how the CA business has been trending as far as we are concerned.","In a nutshell, and I said that earlier, the amount of dollar commitments we've been able to achieve compared to what expires has increased quite significantly.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Ramsay with Cowen.","Matthew Ramsay","Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Hock, wanted to ask a little bit about -- obviously, we talked about the demand environment and the trade environment a bit, but I wanted to ask a little bit about the M&A environment as you see it.","Obviously, CA took the company in a little bit of a different direction, but we've seen some semiconductor mergers announced here very recently. I wonder if you might give us a little bit of a view on the M&A environment as you see it right now on the semiconductor side. Thank you.","Hock Tan","You are saying the M&A environment in the semiconductor space? Yes. I see what you see there, which is some level of activity that seems to go on. And it's quite interesting, in a way quite encouraging, for us to see that the direction we have taken, a large part of this industry seems to be making sense to a lot of our peers, too. And from our point of view, we welcome it.","And as I've indicated before in previous earnings call, for us, it's what's makes sense, what's actionable in terms of businesses that are franchises that we see as very sustainable and that are -- that we are able to acquire.","And -- but right now, we see a lot of movements, but we -- and we continue to be very interested in opportunities that may present themselves and we continue to be very active in assessing those opportunities.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question will come from Chris Caso with Raymond James.","Chris Caso","Yes, thank you. Hock, I just wanted to return to some of your questions -- some of your comments rather regarding inventory, and you talked about the customers reducing inventory. Do you think that the inventory levels at the customers were elevated coming into the quarter or is this just a situation where the customers are reducing inventory proactively because of the uncertainty? I guess the question is how much of the weakness you see here is driven by inventory reduction as opposed to demand.","Hock Tan","I think what we are seeing a lot here -- because overall demand weakness or uncertainty probably started even before this quarter began, but the sharpness in terms of demand contraction -- demand reduction, I should say, is coming from the fact that customers are even more aggressively now trying to reduce inventory out there and a lot of it is customer inventory that we're talking about directly.","As you noticed, on our balance sheet, our inventory has been very well-managed, tightly managed and we continue to be very, very consistent through all this, in the range of 65 days of inventory.","So, this reduction is very much the action of the supply chain of the end user, which really reflects on our direct customers where there's been a sharp reduction of inventory out there. And are we talking significant? Yes. We believe it is -- what we've seen is very significant and we anticipate that to continue, which reflects in our revised guidance for the rest of this year, which is the next less than six months out there. Beyond that, who knows?","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's Q&A session as well as today's conference call. This concludes the program. You may all disconnect and have a wonderful day."],"4200":["Avago Technologies Ltd (NASDAQ:AVGO) Q2 2014 Earnings Conference Call May 29, 2014  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Ashish Saran - Investor Relations","Hock Tan - President, Chief Executive Officer, Director","Tony Maslowski - Chief Financial Officer","Analysts","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank","Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley","Romit Shah - Nomura","Joanne Feeney - ABR Investment","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets ","Blayne Curtis - Barclays","Operator","Welcome to the Avago Technologies Limited Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2014 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Ashish Saran, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Ashish Saran","Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are Hock Tan, President and CEO; and Tony Maslowski, Chief Financial Officer of Avago Technologies."," ","After the market closed today, Avago distributed a press release and financial tables describing our financial performance for the second quarter fiscal year 2014. If you did not receive a copy, you can obtain the information from the Investors section of Avago's website at www.avagotech.com.","This conference call is being webcast live and a recording will be available via telephone playback for one week. It will also be archived in the Investors section of our website at avagotech.com.","During the prepared comments section of this call, Hock and Tony will be providing details of our second fiscal quarter results, background to our Q3 2014 outlook and some commentary regarding the business environment. We will take questions after the end of our prepared comments.","In addition to U.S. GAAP reporting, Avago reports certain financial measures on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the tables attached to today's press release. Comments made during today's call will primarily refer to our non-GAAP financial results.","Please refer to our press release today and our recent filings with the SEC for information on the specific risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Hock Tan. Hock?","Hock Tan","Thank you, Ashish. Good afternoon, everyone. Now, we are going to start today as we always do by reviewing recent business highlights in our end markets and then Tony will provide summary of our second quarter fiscal 2014 fiscal results.","Before we do that, a couple of housekeeping items, as you all know, we closed the LSI acquisition on May 6, one day into our fiscal Q3. I am very pleased to welcome LSI's employees, customers and partners to Avago. Since then, we have been hard at work integrating the two companies and accordingly any comments made on fiscal quarter third quarter and beyond will applying to the combined Avago-LSI businesses. Q2 commentary will of course only applying to classic Avago.","Also earlier today, Seagate announced they will be acquiring the LSI flash businesses, which includes the standard flash controller and PCI express flash adaptor product line, $450 million in cash. We are divesting this LIS think product line as they do not strategically fit with our long-term [business]. The impact from this divestiture to our total revenue on an Avago-LSI combined basis is not material.","Okay. Starting with our Q3 fiscal quarter, our mix of revenue will change and will now include a new end market, enterprise storage in addition to the previously defined Avago wireless, wide infrastructure and industrial markets. I will provide additional color on the changes in the end market discussion.","Revenue for second quarter was $701 million and represented a decline of 1% from last quarter and an increase of 25% from the same quarter a year ago. Q2 revenue came in high than the upper end of our guidance, and the primary driver of our better than expected revenue performance was very strong wireless shipments into Korean and Chinese handset OEM.","Let now proceed to provide much more color on each of these end markets. Starting with wireless, the composition of our wireless end market remains unchanged post the LSI acquisition, basically comes from Avago classic and for fiscal Q2 revenue from wireless came in significantly above our expectations and was flat sequentially compared to our prior expectations for mid-teen decline on a percentage basis. Wireless represented 50% of our total revenue, and on year-on-year basis, wireless grew 25%.","As mentioned during our Q1 call, we had expected our Q2 revenue to decline sequentially as we worked through the normal annual product transition and are large North American OEM customer. While we did experience that anticipated product transition related decline, we were able to fully offset that decrease with a strong product ramp at another smartphone OEM and strong demand from LTE-enabled Chinese smartphone. We are also achieving high penetration with these Chinese OEMs who our industry leading FBAR technologies. The growth in FBAR related revenue help us to continue to expand our gross margin.","Looking at Q3 fiscal 2014, and clearly this end market is only classic Avago. We expect mid-single digit sequential growth in our wireless business with the beginning of a ramp from our North American smartphone customer as they transition to their next-generation platform and we continue to also see very strong demand for our FBAR related products from the Chinese LTE smartphone OEMs. We also expect to see additional Avago content for handset-enabled by our FBAR technology and taking advantage of all the expected increase in RF content across both, traditional high-end smartphones as well as even entry-level solutions.","For Q3 revenues from our wireless end market will be a little over 25% of our total revenues, which would have included the impact of the LSI acquisition.","Moving onto Wired Infrastructure for fiscal Q2, in which we talk only about Avago classic, Wired revenue decreased 4%, sequentially, performing below our expectations at the beginning of the quarter and represented 31% of overall revenues. However, we continue to see a fair amount of strength in this end market as on a year-over-year basis we still grew 43%.","ASIC was flat sequentially as data center switching remained relatively soft, but we are starting to see a rebound at a major data networking OEM. We saw sequential decline in our fiber optics with slower than expected shipment for our 40G products, which are also influenced by data centers switching softness.","Please note too that starting fiscal Q3, in addition to Fiber Optics and SerDes-based ASICs, our wired infrastructure end market will now also include LSI's ASICs as well as standard [Xia] based products. In this regard, we expect Q3 revenues from our combined wired infrastructure end market to be a little over a quarter of our total revenues.","Looking forward, we expect strength on a number of fronts, we expect a significant ramp in our ASIC revenue from shipments into base stations patient as well as enterprise and data center switching platforms.","ASICs increases will come from both, Avago and LSI design wins, and we are expecting recovery in Fiber Optics as it relates to enterprise switching. we believe that the combination of LSI and Avago positions us extremely well to take advantage of next-generation data center switching and LTE transitions and our network upgrades on the wireless infrastructure side.","Onto enterprise storage, this is a new market for Avago addressed by LSI's hard disk drives and servers and storage connectivity product lines. Accordingly for Q2, we have no discussion as it relates to Avago classic. For Q3, however, we expect to continue the momentum and leadership LSI had established across all the storage product lines and expect some strength in Q3.","For hard disk drives, against the backdrop of a fairly stable market especially in our focused areas of 3.5-inch and enterprise SaaS, we expect to continue to benefit from a strong design win positions in three channels and PreAmps across all hard drive OEMs.","Our server and storage connectivity business, which includes our SaaS and rate silicon, adapter and Software Solutions, are now entering the seasonally strongest second half of the calendar year for the server and external storage market. We remain very enthusiastic with our progress in 12G SaaS design wins and ramps across multiple OEM customers and we expect Q3 revenues from enterprise storage to be approximately one-third of our total revenues. For now, we expect enterprise storage will be the largest end market for us.","Finally, moving onto industrial, fiscal Q2 industrial re-sales were very strong in the quarter, with double-digit sequential growth on a percentage basis, which was in line with our expectations for this end market. We saw strength especially in Europe and Japan. However, we reduced shipments to our distributors to reduce inventory levels in the channel. This resulted in industrial sales increasing only 2%, sequentially, during Q2. Way below what we had guided at the beginning of the quarter at up 3% from a year ago.","Industrial sales represented 19% of our overall revenue in Q2. In Q3 through, we expect to replenish inventory, the low-level inventory at many of our distributors to support expected growth in the high single-digit level, sequentially, as a result of continuing worldwide recovery in industrial activity.","Now, starting Q3, we will also included in the industrial is the LSI intellectual property licensing business. Combined with this, our Q3 revenues will be approximately one-eighth of total revenues in this segment.","In summary, for Q3, this is how we would see our business. In the beginning of a strong product ramp in wireless a rebound in wide infrastructure and continued stability and slight growth in enterprise storage and industrial. We expect overall revenue for fiscal quarter Q3 therefore to come in between $1.32 billion to $1.4 billion.","As you know this is the first quarter for the combined Avago-LSI businesses and integration activities are still progressing, but progressing very well. Our restructuring activities to achieve forecast annual cost synergies of $200 million have just kicked off, but we remain very much on track to achieve these by the end of our fiscal 2015, the first full fiscal year after closing. We are also working to drive the combined LSI-Avago businesses long-term towards a non-GAAP operating margin model that is consistent with the Avago classic business model.","With that, let me now turn the call over to the Tony for more detailed review of our second quarter fiscal 2014 financial.","Tony Maslowski","Thank you, Hock, and good afternoon everyone. Before reviewing the second quarter fiscal 2014 financial results, I want to remind you that my comments today will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP data is included with the earnings release issued today and is also available on our website at www.avagotech.com.","Revenue of $701 million in Q2 represents a decrease of 1% from last quarter and an increase of 25% compared to the same quarter a year ago. Overall, Q2 revenue came in higher in the upper end of our guidance. Revenue from our wireless target market came in better than our expectations, though it was offset by weaker than expected revenue from our wired infrastructure in industrial end market.","Foxconn and Samsung were greater than 10% customers in fiscal Q2.","Our Q2 gross margin was 54%, which was above our guidance for the quarter and also higher than the prior quarter, primarily due to higher than expected FBAR revenues, which have favorable gross margin.","Turning to operating expenses, R&D expenses increased by $3 million to $101 million and SG&A increased by $3 million to $47 million driving total operating expenses for Q2 to $148 million or $1 million above our guidance. As a percentage of sales, R&D remained unchanged at 14% in SG&A was 7% of net revenue.","Income from operations for the quarter increased by $9 million, sequentially, to $233 million and represented 33% of net revenue compared to the $158 million for Q2 of last year, income from operations increased by $75 million helped by higher revenues and better gross margin.","Taxes came in at $9 million for Q2, $2 million above our guidance. This was primarily due to higher income than forecast as well as a change in the jurisdictional mix of income and expense. Q2 net income of $223 million increased by $6 million from the prior quarter.","In Q2 earnings per diluted share was $0.85 or $0.01 higher than Q1. Compared to Q2 of last year, net income was $70 million higher and earnings per diluted share the $0.24 higher. Our share-based compensation in Q2 was $30 million. The breakdown of the expense for Q2 includes $3 million in cost of goods sold, $10 million in R&D and $17 million in SG&A.","In Q3 2014, we anticipate share based compensation will be approximately $79 million and this includes the impact from the LSI acquisition. Just as a reminder, our definition of non-GAAP net income excludes share-based compensation expense.","Moving onto the balance sheet, our day sales outstanding remained at 42 days, same as the prior quarter as we observed stable revenue linearity throughout the quarter. Our inventory ended at $301 million, an increase of $15 million from our last quarter. Our wireless inventory increase in anticipation of a continued strong demand throughout the remainder of the calendar year, particularly for our FBAR product.","Days on hand were 86 days, which increased 10 days from Q1 due to this planned inventory build. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.3 billion and we generated $251 million in operational cash flow. We spent $73 million on capital expenditures. For Q3, we expect CapEx to be approximately $125 million which primarily relates to spending to support our continued build-out of FBAR capacity and also the impact from the LSI businesses, which include a campus rationalization.","During the quarter, we did not we purchase any shares in anticipation of completing the LSI acquisition which closed on May 6. Our 2013 share repurchase program has expired and the board has not as yet authorized any new share repurchases while we digest the LSI transaction. However, it is something that we and the board look at regularly.","On March 31, 2013, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.27 per ordinary share, which consume $68 million of cash. The dividend was raised by $0.02 from the prior quarter. Since the inception of our dividend program in Q2 of 2011 to-date, we have continued to increase our dividend each quarter.","Now let me turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2014. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions and we do not intend to update this guidance. Our Q3 guidance includes the LSI acquisition, which closed on the second day of the quarter. This guidance is not adjusted for the business divestiture announced earlier today.","Total revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. Gross margin is expected to be 55%, plus or minus one percentage point. Operating expenses are estimated be approximately $386 million. Taxes are forecasted to be approximately $20 million. Interest expense is expected be approximately $54 million. Finally the diluted share count forecast is for 276 million shares.","That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","All right. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you for taking my question. I actually had two questions. Hock, maybe the first one for you, what's your sense of the wireless market. You know you had a very strong quarter in Q2 and you are guiding to mid-single digit-type growth in Q3, partly related to China as the deployment. Do you think there is some kind of bubble or inventory building up in China or do you think just the growth trends that you are seeing are more sustainable in the second half also?","Hock Tan","I don't know the answer to that to be honest. I know though, the demand continues to be very strong. As you know the band - and it's obviously related to LTE build-outs in China, because of the bands and strong demand for our FBAR products, which are particularly strong as it relates to LTE and Wi-Fi, I should add, and this strength we saw beginning of Q2, middle of Q2 to be precise and has continued till now and we have very strong backlog, but we have very strong demand and the question is how long it will continue. I don't really know. While we do see within our lead times, which runs out over 10-week is continued strength.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Then as a follow-up, the divestiture of the plant sale of the flash business, how do we think about first of all the benefit that you might get from a profitability perspective? Is that included in the $200 million cost synergies you had given out before? Would it be incremental to that? Then also sort of related, I think, Seagate is being roughly three times sales for that division. Is that a fair price? It seems like I think Western Digital paid more like six-seven [times], so any color around the operating sort of savings from divesting the division and just the price you are getting for that division would be helpful. Thank you.","Tony Maslowski","First off, I will answer the first part of the question, which says that the $200 million of cost savings we've always talked about never included any divested businesses. We believe that we could drive $200 million of cost savings from whatever business we would inherit, so that is not included.","Now, I qualify that by saying for us to [march] to our long-term business model of the Avago operating margin that did contemplate some divestitures and I will let Hock comment on the part of your question that says did they pay too much or whatever.","Hock Tan","We obviously believe that there is a fair value on both sides in making this transaction happen as I articulated in my opening remarks. We do not see this business in the long-term being very strategic to our business model. You would require continued level of investments. Obviously, this business has great capability that would continue for the investments to sustain that capability and given it is not part of our long-term plan to make those kinds of investments, we obviously chose to divest it and I think it was a very fair deal both sides. We will benefit as will Seagate.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank","Hi, guys. Congratulations on the strong reporting. First question Hock, one for you on the Wired business, a little surprise given what the data points were that we have seen beyond Avago that that business actually missed in the quarter. Can you give us a little more color on what [below] your expectations and then why the confidence and reacceleration heading into the July quarter please? Then I have a follow-up. Thanks.","Hock Tan","Well, a big part of the business these days, especially on fiber optics side of it relates to - demand comes a lot from this hyper data center guys, the big cloud guys and the guys who build huge data centers or social media, cloud and all that stuff and there they start behaving a lot more like service providers than traditional enterprises, where demand is more stable and more predictable. It did a bit less predictable.","We are not looking at this miss in the 2Q obviously on fiber optics, which is what this is, because our ASIC business sustained and one might remind fiber optic is simply because at the leading edge especially on 40G interconnect fiber transceiver interconnect, which is where we largely see a miss and that's probably because either state-of-the-art data center build-out that requires a use of those 40G, and the fact that we don't hit all the demand - what we thought we should hit in the quarter, that demand is likely to reappear in the following quarter. Hence, our expected rebound in Q3 what we missed in Q2.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank","Great. Thank you. Then there's one follow-up, Tony. One for you on the OpEx level that $386 million that you are guiding to, how should we think about that going forward? If you want to include the announcement that you put today otherwise, what's the sort of trend we should think about in that in achieving that $200 million cost synergies that you have prior set out to the target? Thank you.","Tony Maslowski","Well, as Hock mentioned, we were off to a good start, so we believe that you know there is easily several million that we are going to realize in Q3 and you will see kind of an acceleration in Q4, because those will be the quarters where especially people costs are fully gone for a full quarter, so we are really confident on the acceleration on removal of cost. As we mentioned, most of it is going to come from the R&D and SG&A line. Now, I won't comment at all on the divestiture just yet, but you we will break that down in the future as we complete the sale and so forth.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank","Simply put, fiscal fourth quarter OpEx should be down - sale side?","Tony Maslowski","Yes. Again, which is small caveat that I always give you, Ross, is that that for example if we over perform on some of our bonus metric that sometimes in Q4 we have a little bit of a catch up there, but everything else held equal, we should trend down over time quite significantly.","Hock Tan","I think we did indicate to you guys in our last call, I think, that you should expect to see the OpEx on our first $200 million therefore go down by $50 million a quarter by the middle of fiscal '15 or by the end of fiscal '15.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank","Yes.","Hock Tan","\u2026and we are very much on track on that.","Tony Maslowski","We always said, Ross, is we will have immediate benefit, we will go through flat kind of quarter three and four and then we will see this reacceleration as we complete some of our integration.","Hock Tan","We don't expect and that would not include the divestitures we are announcing here.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank","Thank you very much.","Ashish Saran","Our next question please?","Operator","All right. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley.","Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley","Yes. Thank you. Question on the gross margins, in the quarter Avago came in above the high end of your previous targets. Then LSI will be a little accretive to that. Can you just talk about the sustainability in terms of some of the things you have seen from mix in wireless as well as maybe the growth in comm. and how you are thinking about gross margin longer-term?","Tony Maslowski","Well, I think we've always commented that we have had the benefit the last couple of quarters of a very slow fab in wireless and good strong demand on our higher wireless product namely FBAR. We believe that's something that can continue well throughout the calendar year. However, we do have some CapEx coming online, so depreciation in the fab will go up slightly, but utilization in the fab is pretty much fact that 100% even as we add capacity throughout the year, so we think the tailwinds to our gross margin is still pretty good mostly driven by kind of our wireless, especially wireless mix.","Then the overall wireless division is again closing that gap on the corporate average pretty quickly as well, so we are very positive on those things and the rest of businesses are holding up well. I would say it's mostly a wireless-focus right now.","Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley","Got it. Then as my follow-up, Hock, on the comm. business outside of the variability quarter-to-quarter in fiber side, do you have a view in terms of where you think we are on the 10G to 40G upgrade cycle?","Hock Tan","On the 10G to 40G for enterprises, traditional enterprises, is still very early. For the large data center guys with certain few exceptions, again is still very early in that upgrade cycle, hence once we get to see some of the variability on this particular 40G product line that we so position ourselves very well. Probably we see more sustainable 40G going forward over the next 6 to 12 months.","Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","All right. Our next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura. Please proceed.","Romit Shah - Nomura","","Yes. Hi there. Thanks so much for taking my question. I want to go back to the announcement this morning. Hock, the sale of the LSI flash business, I am curious what you think this means for your HDD business.","Hock Tan","I am not sure what you are trying to address is, but there - very different businesses.","Romit Shah - Nomura","","Just what we are seeing in the marketplace?","Hock Tan","Sorry?","Romit Shah - Nomura","","What we are seeing in the marketplace is that SSDs are replacing HDDs, where things like, speed, power, durability are important considerations in both, notebook and desktop platforms. To the extent that you don't have an SSD product line, I would think that this would negatively impact your HDD business.","Hock Tan","I think that there's some level of - Romit you are correct in that respect that, flash SSDs that is, are replacing HDDs in certain segments of the market. One big part of which is obviously notebooks, which fortunately LSI is variable represented - not at all represented, hence the emphasis has been on 3.5-inch to SaaS hard drives.","Also in certain parts of data centers, where you want really fast very good - latency excess. That is an element of our replacement in that regard. We see that and we do support that those enterprise markets through customized flash controllers that we develop for specific OEM customers of our. That continue to happen and we continue to be able to participate in that.","What we are moving out of by this divestiture is the merchant market for flash controllers on SSDs, which is a big part of it will be obviously in the prime market and which we do not see our position to be very strategic in the first place.","Romit Shah - Nomura","","Okay. Thanks for that. Then, Tony, just a question of stock option expense, when I look at Avago standalone, it's been about $30 million per quarter. That's about $0.10 to $0.12, and with the inclusion of LSI, it jumps up to about $80 million, which is more like $0.30, so how do we model that going forward? Is the $0.30 over time going to come down? How should we think about stock option expense going forward?","Tony Maslowski","Well, again, there's two pieces in that $79 million. There is the traditional Avago piece, which we had a grant in March, so if we were to strip that out separately, it probably has increased probably from $30 million to roughly $40 million. Then for the LSI piece is the remainder, so it's $39 million. Now that is impacted as well by the early exit of certain executives, where they were accelerated, so we will see that trend down pretty significantly, pretty quickly over time to maybe a run rate of something closer to 20 in out orders like five or six quarters out.","However, I still qualify that, because again we need to bring on the LSI people onto our plans for stock comp and so forth, so I don't really have a real long-term, but the $79 million is really somewhat of an anomaly for kind of this quarter and maybe next, because we this huge overhang from some of the exits that we have to pay for.","Romit Shah - Nomura","","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","All right. Our next question comes from the line of Joanne Feeney from ABR Investment. Please proceed.","Joanne Feeney - ABR Investment","Yes. Thanks. I was hoping we could go back into the Wired discussion a little bit. The 40G transition is underway, I am wondering if you have orders in place in backlog and placed it, that gives you that confidence that you talked about a little bit earlier. Then also what you are seeing on the 100G transition as well.","Hock Tan","On the 100G hundred for short, which is basically for data centers as opposed to transport or long reach, on 100G short-reach it's still very early. It won't probably happen for at least a couple of years for most of the data center guys or enterprise guys on transporting short-reach data. 40G is happening right now and yes we do have substantial backlog on those businesses.","Joanne Feeney - ABR Investment","Okay. Then on the wireless backhaul, and seems - talk to more generally. We have heard that that strengthened and you confirmed that. I am just wondering how much visibility you have there. There's some concern that we might get a short versus spending and then a sharp decline. Do you have any insight into how that might play out through the rest of the year?","Hock Tan","Not really. A large part of this growth driving is obviously happening in China as the Chinese carriers blew out their 4G networks. In so doing at the same time, I believe, they are obviously pushing the use of that network by being very aggressive in promoting, so deployed terminals. I guess, we call it handset devices that 4G-enabled. All that is happening which is a big part of driving our wireless business between which we announced Q2 and which continue to see strength in Q3, because of the proliferation of the LTE-based handsets in China both, from local Chinese OEMs as well as benefiting some of the global OEMs who sell into China and we see both of that happening.","As far as the infrastructure side, there is some strength, especially on the backhaul and it seems to move from backhaul to front-end on the base station side, and we have seen that vary quarter-to-quarter. As far as how long they'll keep sustaining, rest of this year? Don't know. We can only have [heresy], but in terms of actual line of sight, we probably don't more than one quarter at a time.","Joanne Feeney - ABR Investment","Okay. Thanks. That's helpful.","Operator","All right. Next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets ","Thanks for taking my question guys. Hock, can you maybe give us a little bit of your view on the growth outlook of each of these segments now that we have got the combined company?","Hock Tan","Okay. Broadly speaking, and it would take us long-term, and long-term being six months perhaps. Well, you are saying realistically, while we see the highest growth drivers for our business is in wireless and wired infrastructure.","In wireless the reasons are quite obvious, is that 4G comes into play more and more of what's also more clear it comes into play not just in China. Now that North America is very 4G enabled, but more slowly beginning into Europe and other places, we see content in handsets, smartphones in particular increase.","While we are riding more than unit growth, content growth in smartphone is very strong and very short-term practically, the ramp this third quarter, the beginning of the ramp this third quarter of our largest North American OEMs customers. It's just the tip of the iceberg in our view, so it would drive our wireless business very nicely I think over the next 12 months our line of sight.","On wired, we see a combination that helps. Some of it relates to China too. As I mentioned, I talked along in replying to earlier question, we see that 4G phenomenon, the convergence to be sustainable thing. Quarterly, you might see variability as we talked about, but over the next 12 months, we are very well positioned as evidenced by the size of our designs, but also the size of our existing backlog underway that would drive our fiber business and will also drive a whole generation of SerDes-based ASICs that we and LSI combine has been able to secure in data center switching as I articulated in my note.","That coupled with more a local phenomenon in China metro network and backhaul, especially in areas in exits through MSA, where we have a very strong position. I see all that again China, build-out their expanded network especially in fiber, access and fiber networks through backhaul as augmenting the strength in our wired infrastructure business. We are seeing that today and we see that continuing through the end of this year in China, so those were two will-be businesses we see growing probably at least in the double-digit over the next 12 months.","Against that, we stable businesses, and by stable I mean, business that may grow in the single-digit, mid-single digits slightly in both, enterprise storage and industrial. Low-to-mid single-digit, so we have an interesting combination of two businesses, two end markets that will growth double-digit and two that as we see now are very stable, if not, stably growing. The end point, when you combine all four together in a fairly balanced mix, is a business that probably what is what we had forecasted before, which was the business that will grow in the high-single digits to probably low double digits over the next 12 months.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets ","Great. Thanks for all that detail. If I could, can you talk a little bit about the mix of business that you are seeing in the wireless segment in terms of maybe diversity and any trigger point that you may have that are required to support it from a capacity standpoint.","Hock Tan","I do not equate wireless to diversity. The consolidation more than 80% are wireless business, about 80% relates to handsets, and a bulk of it in handsets are triggered are tied to FBAR one way or the other.","Power amplifiers that put into front-end modules with filters, FBAR filters or whatever, but it is. As you know the handset in this business, especially smartphone business has been very much consolidated. We are very well represented by the way in spite of the consolidations, but it is not that diversified in that regard.","The positive side of looking at it though is that it's driven not by necessarily unique phone architecture related to specific OEMs. That's really by the fact that 4G whether it would be in U.S., Europe, China increases dramatically the use of FBAR focus, which we are very [position].","It also implies with 4G an increased number of band required on almost every smartphone around, whether they would be China, Europe, or the U.S. and increase content in three gives challenges to power, gives challenges to coexistence of different bands running on the same phone and just challenges to - which leads to architectures that favor our designs and therefore lead to increased content in our handset businesses.","That's not necessary an issue of diversity as much as a technological trend, architectural trend that has favored our businesses.","In terms of capacity, we continue to invest and whether we invest in CapEx or as Tony articulate, whether we invest by building product wafers early to handle sharp active ramps as evident in our inventory level growth in Q2. It is intended to be to able to ensure our capability and our capacity in addressing fairly substantial demand and ramp up by several of our large OEM customers.","Ashish Saran","Can we get the last question please?","Operator","Of course, and our last question comes from Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Please proceed.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays","It's Blayne Curtis. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe you could talk about the CapEx that you mentioned it was mostly FBAR and the increase. What was the catalyst behind that? Then Tony, what are you looking at for the full fiscal year?","Tony Maslowski","Well, again, we didn't give a full fiscal year on CapEx. We are doing it quarter-by-quarter and the FBAR portion of it is probably a good third of what we are talking about in this $125 million. Just a reminder, the FBAR capacity teaser itself well within a year, so you know these are things we have line of sight that we have won, that we are excited about and we need the capacity desperately, because we can't build any more ahead than been we've been building ahead right now. For the full-year, again, we are not giving a full forecast yet and we will talk about it quarter-by-quarter until we get from stability both, in digesting LSI and in our outlook in FBAR.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays","Great. Then as a follow-up, you saw nice mix to FBAR driving your gross margin higher. That continues in the guide. How do you look at this level of gross margin and is this mix of FBAR sustainable when you look out at the ramps you have, the CapEx that would suggest that - just curious.","Hock Tan","As I mentioned earlier on a trend basis of our wireless business, the mix of FBAR, relates FBAR in terms of discreet FBAR particularly in our business, particularly driven with China, but also more than China is that it has as is evident in our financials, been driving our overall gross margin to a level that we have never seen before, and because of it is on our wireless business as Tony indicated the gross margin from our wireless business product is pretty much running close to our corporate average at this point.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays","Okay.","Operator","Okay\u2026","Ashish Saran","Thank you, operator. Thank you for participating in today's earnings call.

Please go ahead, sir.","Ashish Saran","Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are Hock Tan, President and CEO, and Tom Krause, acting Chief Financial Officer of Broadcom Limited.","After the market closed today, Broadcom distributed a press release and financial tables describing our financial performance for the second quarter of fiscal year 2016. If you did not receive a copy, you may obtain the information from the Investors section of Broadcom's website at www.broadcom.com. This conference call is being webcast live, and a recording will be available via telephone playback for one week. It will also be archived in the Investors section of our website at broadcom.com.","During the prepared comments section of this call, Hock and Tom will be providing details of our second quarter fiscal year 2016 results, background to our third quarter fiscal year 2016 outlook and some commentary regarding the business environment. We will take questions after the end of our prepared comments.","In addition to U.S. GAAP reporting, Broadcom reports certain financial measures on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the tables attached to today's press release. Comments made during today's call will primarily refer to our non-GAAP financial results. Please refer to our press release today and our recent filings with the SEC for information on the specific risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Hock Tan. Hock?","Hock Tan","Thank you, Ashish. Good afternoon everyone.","Well, we delivered strong results for second fiscal quarter of 2016, the first quarter of operations as a combined company. Revenue $3.56 billion came in just a shade above the midpoint of our guidance while earnings per share were significantly higher than guidance.","As you all are well aware, demand for hard disk drives and premium smartphones was weak this quarter \u2013Q2, however we experience strong product cycles from switching and broadband in a wide segment enabling Company revenue to come in line with expectation.","Our large scale and greater diversity enabled consolidated results to be resilient, mitigating fluctuations in our individual end markets. Earnings came in significantly above expectations enabled by delivering gross margin at a high end of guidance and driving faster than expected ongoing realization of acquisition related cost synergy.","Let me now turn to a discussion of our second quarter segment results. Let's start with wired, in addition to classic Avago's custom networking ASIC and fiber optic products, the combination of classic Broadcom has added Ethernet switching and routing and routing ASSPs, physical layer, copper and optical products and in addition in this segment it also includes now classic Broadcom's broadband communication solutions for set-top box, cable modem and carrier access.","In the second quarter, wired revenue came in at $2.06 billion and this represents a 58% of our total revenue. This is now obviously our largest segment and it performed better than we had expected in the second quarter. We saw strength across various product lines. We experienced robust demand in switching and routing, standard products including very strong traction for our new Tomahawk switching and Jericho routing platform especially from the cloud and service provider customers.","In fact as some of you may know, key customer today announced a new lead - universal lead switch and routing platform for next generation data centers which is based on the Jericho product platform.","We also saw strong demand for broadband products from set-top box refreshes driven by the start-up adoption of 4K Video. Service providers continue to invest in broadband access infrastructure including ongoing fiber-to-the-home build-out in China, as well as DSL and cable modem build-out in Europe.","As we look into the third quarter for our wired segment, we expect the strong demand to sustain from the prior quarter and project wired segment revenues to be up in the low single digits sequentially. We're also working on resolving a few potential supply constraints in this particular segment.","Moving onto wireless segment. In addition to Avago's FBAR filters and power amplifiers, our wireless segment now also includes classic Broadcom's wireless connectivity and custom analog handset solution. In this second quarter, wireless revenue came in at $792 million and the wireless segment represented 22% of our total revenue.","As expected we did see a decline in demand from our large North American smartphone customers including the anticipated impact of just seasonal product lifecycle related reduction in shipment. This was partially offset by an increasing shipment to a large Asian handset OEM. As we have said before, this second quarter was the trough for this segment for the rest of this fiscal year. ","Moving onto third quarter, we\u2019re expecting a very different picture for our wireless segment and expect strong sequential revenue growth in the mid-20% range. The expected growth is driven by the start of a ramp from a large North American smartphone customer as they transition to their next generation platform enhanced by a substantial increase in Classic Avago's RF content in this new handset.","Classic Broadcom's wireless connectivity content will also increase in this new handset. We anticipate our wireless connectivity business to continue to drive significant innovation for mobile Wi-Fi and Bluetooth applications and expect this product line to be a very key long-term contributor to our wireless segment.","Let me now turn to enterprise storage. In the second quarter, enterprise storage revenue came in at $525 million down 23% sequentially, enterprise storage represented 15% of total revenue, this segment experienced a sequential decline in revenue driven by large drop in hard disk drive, unit TAM and seasonal weakness in the enterprise server storage connectivity market.","Looking to the third quarter lastly due to further hard disk drive unit TAM declines, we expect enterprise storage revenue to decline in the low single digits sequentially. We currently project the third quarter to be the trough for enterprise storage revenue this fiscal year. Regardless of fluctuations in unit TAM, we also expect to continue to gain share in our hard disk drive business.","And let me now move to the last segment industrial. As I mentioned previously, this segment does include our IP licensing business but in the second quarter industrial segment revenue came in at $182 million up 30% sequentially and represented 5% of our total revenue.","Industrial resales grew sequentially mid-single digit and our revenue here increased as well by the same level as we replenish channel inventory to keep up with the seasonal increase. Looking at the third quarter, we expect the trend to sustain from the prior quarter and expect mid single digit venture growth industrial product revenue driven by continuing high retail projection.","However in IP sales after strong and lumpy second quarter, we expect revenue to drop in the third quarter and as a result we expect revenue in industrial segment to decline mid-single digit sequentially after a 30% increase in 2Q.","In summary therefore, what we expect for the third quarter is sustained performance from networking and broadband, a trough in enterprise storage but a strong seasonal ramp in wireless, driving sequential growth in consolidated revenue of over 5%. We expect earnings to grow even faster, and we are projecting earnings per share to grow sequentially and almost double the rate of revenue growth driven by lower operating and interest expense as a percentage of net revenue. This in a nutshell is the leverage and power of our business model.","With that, let me now turn the call over to Tom for more detail review of our second quarter financials. Tom?","Tom Krause","Thank you Hock and good afternoon everyone.","Before I start with my comments today, will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results and continuing operations unless otherwise specifically noted. A reconciliation of our GAAP and our non-GAAP data is included with the earnings release issued today, and is also available on our website at broadcom.com.","First before I get into the second quarter results, I would like to take a few minutes to review progress we're making towards our long term financial model as we work through completing the integration of classic Broadcom. Fundamentally just to review the financial model with the output of the business model that Hock is driving, the most important element of our model is sustainability of the franchise as we invest in over the long term.","When we set out to acquire Broadcom, we recognized our collection of well established businesses with leadership position. [Indiscernible] on the back of proprietary and highly defensible technologies we believe that these franchises were critical to enabling rapidly evolving wireline and wireless ecosystems.","While we only have one quarter under our belt, we think that this piece is very much intact. Another key element is discipline. We are actively managing the portfolio to stay focused on investing in the core franchises while monetizing businesses to do not have clear long term sustainability. This is an ongoing process to continue to allow us to maximize returns on our R&D investment.","Finally we keep things simple and focus on critical business processes given our now larger economies of scale, we can be even more efficient across our global supply chain and sales platforms, as well as our general administrative function. This takes us to the three key elements in our financial model starting with revenue.","But we don't expect the broader semiconductor industry to grow much over the long term, we do believe that our franchisees will benefit from some very positive trends including what seems to be an ever increasing demand for mobility bandwidth and storage. We believe that we have the right set of technologies for these needs which gives us confidence in our long term annual revenue growth rate target of approximately 5%.","On the gross margin front given the market needs for our technology and the leadership positions we have, coupled with ongoing cost reductions in our supply chain, we see potential opportunities overtime to push gross margins beyond 60% we've already delivered this quarter.","Turning to operating expense. We believe the completion of integration activities and our focus on return on investment will allow us to drive R&D expenses to 16% of net revenue within the next few quarters. Looking at the target portfolio in the set of core projects, we want to report \u2013 we feel 16% is currently the appropriate long term target for R&D expenses. And finally on SG&A, we clearly see potential opportunities to drive these expenses below 4% of net revenue.","In summary, as we look at the second half of fiscal 2016, we expect to see solid revenue growth from the second quarter which we believe will help drive operating margins to 40% as we exit the year.","As we work toward completing integration and the full achievement of cost synergies in fiscal '17, we think we can drive operating margins north of 40% and sustain those margins longer term.","Let me turn to our capital allocation strategy moving forward. As many of you know over the last several years we\u2019re focused on M&A and the returns have allowed us to drive significant value for shareholders. Going forward we believe acquisition opportunities will continue present themselves that under our business model will drive return that far outlay, the alternative use for our capital.","As a result, we currently intend to limit the paid down of outstanding term loan into our gross debt is approximately two times EBITDA at which time we intend to start pulling excess cash with the purpose of M&A, as well as review our capital structure generally including our long term debt alternative.","As part of our capital allocation strategy, we plan to remain committed to our dividend program and are currently targeting approximate 10% per year increase. However as a reminder our board reviews and determines our dividend policy on a quarterly basis, based on our financial performance and conditions and contractual provisions relating to outstanding indebtedness and other factors being relevant by our board.","Now let me turn to a quick review of our results for the second quarter. Revenue for the second quarter came in at $3.56 billion which we believe will be the trough for the rest of this fiscal year. Foxconn was greater than 10% direct customer in the second fiscal quarter.","Our second quarter gross margin from continuing operations was 60% which is at the upper end of our guidance range primarily due to better revenue mix with the stronger than expected wired segment and higher fab utilization as we pre-build filters to supports the expected second half ramp in wireless revenues.","Turning to operating expenses, R&D expenses were $663 million and SG&A expenses were $146 million. This resulted in total operating expenses for the second quarter of $809 million, $23 million below guidance. This was largely due to faster than expected realization of acquisition related to cost synergies.","On a percentage basis for the second quarter total operating expenses were 23% of revenue, as a percentage of sales R&D was 19% and SG&A was 4% of net revenue. Operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $1.3 billion and represented 37% of net revenue. ","Taxes came in at $53 million slightly above our guidance. This is primarily due to higher than expected net income. Second quarter net income was $1.1 billion and earnings per diluted share were $2.53.","Second quarter interest expense was $150 million and other expense net was $6 million. Our share based compensation expense in the second quarter was $186 million which included the impact from new grants issued to classic Broadcom employees approximately half a way through the quarter.","In the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we anticipate share based compensation expense will be approximately $221 million and this anticipates the full impact of the new grants for the quarter. This is a reminder our definition of non-GAAP net income excludes share based compensation expense.","Moving on to the balance sheet, our day sales expanding were 47 days reflecting the combined company. Our inventory ended at $1.47 billion and days on hand were 72 days which includes the impact of an inventory built supporting the strong growth expected in our wireless business.","We generated $622 million in operational cash flow which reflected the impact of approximately $300 million of cash expanded on restructuring activities. We ended the quarter with the cash balance of $2 billion. We believe that we currently need approximately $1.5 billion to operate the business.","During the second quarter we were paid approximately $565 million of outstanding term loans. We currently intend to repay approximately $1 billion in the third quarter part of which we expect to fund using proceeds from the two previously announced divestures which are expected to close in the third quarter.","In the second quarter we spent $158 million on capital expenditures. For the third quarter we expect CapEx to be approximately $230 million which includes approximately $75 million for ongoing capacity expansion for our manufacturing RF filters and $45 million for campus construction activity.","We expect CapEx to run at in elevated level over the next several quarters driven by campus construction our Irvine, San Jose locations ongoing RF filter capacity expansion and integration related operations in IT investments.","A total of $204 million of cash has spent on company's dividends and partnership distribution payments in the second quarter. As you've seen our board has declared a dividend of $0.50 per share to be paid later in this third fiscal quarter.","Finally, let me turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the third quarter of fiscal year 2016. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business condition and we do not intend to update this guidance. This is guidance result from continuing operations only.","Net revenue is expected to be $10.75 billion plus or minus $75 million. Gross margin is expected to be 60% plus or minus one percentage point. Operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $809 million.","Taxes are forecasted to be approximately $59 million. Net interest expense and other is expected to be approximately $141 million. The diluted share account forecast is for 449 million shares.","That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse.","John Pitzer","Good afternoon, guys. Hock, Tom, congratulations on the strong results and thank for letting me ask a question. Hock, I guess my first question pertains to the wireless guidance for the July quarter. I'm kind of curious about a couple of things. Do both the North American and the Korean customer grow sequentially in July or is it just mainly the North American customer.","And when you look at that North American customer, does the July guidance reflect a four quarters worth of build benefit of their new high-end phone? Or is it only a partial benefit in the July quarter with really a full benefit coming in the next quarter?","Hock Tan","All right. Are you getting very sticky and picky, all right, but to answer your question, it's largely from the certain North American customer that's driving the bulk of the growth. Having said that, the Korean customers does show growth as well on its own, but obviously not to the extent the North American customer is doing because it\u2019s a ramp.","It\u2019s the beginning, I could use the word, beginning of the ramp, for their next generation phone and tied to that is this July quarters, our two current quarter Q3, will not show them the full impact of an entire quarter of revenue ramp. It's just the beginning and very back loaded.","John Pitzer","That's very helpful. Thanks Hock. And then Tom as my follow-up I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about the OpEx guidance for the fiscal third quarter. You are showing sequential revenue growth in the fiscal third quarter. Your guiding OpEx effectively flat on a dollar basis.","I'm just kind of curious just given more of the opportunities you have to realize M&A synergies why only flat and not better than that. What are the offsets?","Tom Krause","Yes. Good question John. It\u2019s really the timing of the realization of synergies, obviously we did better than we thought we'll do out of the gate first quarter and you saw that in the results. A lot of [indiscernible] to a certain extent is tied to system integration and lot of the back office activities that's very much on target to be completed early in the first quarter of next year.","And so, I suggest we will see a bit of a pause here this quarter and perhaps a bit in the next, but as looking at the first half of next year you'll see the full realization.","John Pitzer","Perfect. Thanks guys. Congratulations again.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays.","Blayne Curtis","Hi guys, I will add my congrats as well, just in wireless can you talk about connectivity business. There was some concern of share loss. You talked about content potentially going up. Can you just walk through where you see opportunities for content to go up and just the barriers around your mobile connectivity business?","Tom Krause","Okay. You broke up every few seconds, but if I get it right you're basically asking are we seeing content increase in our wireless revenue in terms of participation in all those premium handset. And as I've always said, year-to-year generation, obviously there are fluctuations in the level of content increase, but over a period of time we have experienced, we have seen and we'll continue to see a steady increase in content.","And this is not just about FBAR front-end module content as more and more bands and carrier aggregation features comes into high-end phones. Now that we have Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, wireless connectivity, we are seeing the same phenomenon apply, exactly. I mean the parallel between those two product lines is pretty amazing from our perspective, and it is not coincidental.","It's part of the reason it attracts us to our acquisition of Boardcom is the fact that wireless - we see wireless connectivity as a very strategic product line in handsets, particularly in high-end handsets, for instance, fully 80% of data [moves] [ph] to Wi-Fi today in most handsets, not LTE but Wi-Fi, and so the importance of improved Wi-Fi connectivity performance, particularly in form of capacity bandwidth becomes more and more demanding. Improvement becomes more and more needed. And as each generation occurs, our belief is that increasing bandwidth capacity, that increase in performance will follow for the same reasons that increase in requirements for FBAR filters show the same kind of improvement.","So we expect \u2013 I've seen in FBAR filters that over the last few years content has grown by about 20% fairly steadily and I might almost apply the same principles to wireless connectivity for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.","Blayne Curtis","Thanks for that. And I apologize for the connection, I\u2019m in Taiwan, but could you also talk about the strength you're seeing in switching and where are you in the ramp of Tomahawk and do you expect to see growth in the switching segment as a whole?","Hock Tan","All right. Well, we are seeing very strong booking, very strong demand for our switching and routing product line and along with that we carry related product, related products like you know, PHY, Retimer, all the stuff that are needed to connect various parts, elements of a data centre. So it\u2019s a one big set of content, one might say that, and particularly obviously the switching and routing.","Tomahawk as you know launched much earlier than the new Jericho. So Tomahawk is still on a ramp, it\u2019s still on a pretty decent ramp I should say. And we are seeing very strong demand for it this quarter particularly on application, obviously it is used for top of the rack switching for data centers among the cloud and service provider guys.","While we're also seeing very interestingly enough that was recently launched by some of our OEM customers, some more advanced OEM customers, is the use of our Jericho product line, [indiscernible] routers, or other way to describe it is a deeply buffered switch and that is increasingly been launched to use as the [spine] [ph] of the data center architecture. And why I put emphasize to the [spine] [ph] is today we just start to see the launch of their same product line deeply buffered on the leaf of that same data centre.","So, and that's on an -- both on an accelerated revenue ramp as we're experiencing today. So, big part of this could be a product upgrade cycle we think -- we also believe, there's also very strong underlying build up demand in cloud computing data centers, be they in North America or among the hyper data centre guys or in China.","Blayne Curtis","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley.","Craig Hettenbach","Yes. Thank you. Just following up on wired and the comments of resolving some supply constraints, does that implication as you go out into kind of Q4 in terms of the ability to work through those and what type of visibility do you have there?","Hock Tan","Yes. Visibility is increasing by leaps and bounds everyday actually. Yes. There is supply constraint in certain areas and that does extend our lease time somewhat which we are working very hard to improve simply because we believe the demand is real out there. And yes, it does extend to Q4 and we are starting to have visibility on bookings and backlogs in Q4 as we sit here right now.","Craig Hettenbach","Got it. And then just as a follow-up in wireless, can you provide any update on the transition from 6 inch to 8 inch in FBAR in terms of how that's going? And then as part of that as you guys have been PHY constraint, there is the wild card kind of China in terms of you get enough supply coming online, the ability to service those customers. Now how does that outlook looks like into fiscal 2017?","Hock Tan","I'll move from 6 inch to 8 inch in wafer fab for FBAR in Fort Collins is progressing very much on schedule. Our capacity having very much on track to what we've indicated to you guys right now. And we believe we have build constraint in been able to supply all our customers as we approach the seasonal peak this second half of this year.","Craig Hettenbach","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America.","Vivek Arya","Thanks for taking my question. Hock on wireless, you mentioned content growth have been around 20% or so a year for the last few years on your FBAR RF filters. As you look out the next few years what kind content growth opportunity do you see for the combined FBAR and connectivity portfolio that you have now?","Hock Tan","Very good question and looking at what is always a very scary proposition obviously, because I'm guessing and technology changes. I don't call disruption, I call evolutionary even if very evolutionary DCs and we have a very clear roadmap all three years. And I won't even say we'll go beyond three years. It's still hard to predict, but my estimate and guess will be, we will continue to keep doing the same level on a combined basis for the next two three years.","Vivek Arya","And as the follow-up Hock, as the biggest setback and I think about where you guys are in when I look at other larger cap semiconductor companies most of your larger cap peers are dedicating 100% of the free cash flow to dividends and buybacks, and your preference has been to conduct -- to prefer more M&A so far. So again as you look out the next two three years do you see Broadcom continuing to prefer M&A versus dividends and buyback or do you think there will be a mix between the two as you have said?","Hock Tan","Well, it\u2019s a very good question and as Tom articulated I think very, very anecdotally at the beginning of his remark. We've given it \u2013 we have been very thoughtful about this basic issue, I call in an issue, its in a way its bit of a high class problem because we thing they are still opportunities, significant opportunities out there for us in Broadcom limited to continue to pursue a strategy we've adopted over the last several years of creating shareholder value by acquisition in this space.","And we believe that. Hence as Tom articulated we are positioning ourselves. We are creating a capital allocations strategy that will enable \u2013 they'll position us very well to do that. But to answer your question in one, yes, we think the opportunities out there. They are very interesting and opportunistically and care properly, carefully we will keep pursuing that strategy.","Vivek Arya","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.","Ross Seymore","Hock, I had one for you on the wired business that you mentioned what was going on in couple of the different areas, but you never mentioned what was happening on the traditional Avago ASIC business. So, I guess the first part of it in wire, what was going on in that and how do you see that going forward? And then as we look into the July quarter, the Broadband segment can you talk about the puts and takes within that sub component of your wired business as well?","Hock Tan","Sure. Thanks. Oh, no, on those traditional, you call it traditional, I call it a classic Broadcom as networking ASIC and fiber optics business, is still charging along very nicely. And we're still seeing growth both on fiber optics as well as on traditional ASIC.","The reason we don't say it's much about it is because what we are seeing in comparison to the standard switching product portfolio that we're seeing out of classic Broadcom is very strong by comparison in this area of standard switching and routing is extremely strong and probably as I indicated driven by data centers in the cloud guide who are speaking standard solutions versus the enterprise side which is more driven driving towards using ASIC based solutions by the OEM.","Ross Seymore","Great. Thanks. And I guess this is my follow-up switching back over to the wireless side momentarily. The pace of the ramp you said is very solid in the July quarter and sounds like it will continue in October. Is there a timing difference in the start of that ramp between the classic Avago and classic Broadcom side?","Hock Tan","No, really isn't. There isn't. You know like moving from one to the other, no, I don't think so. We have not finished. I think it's still -- they are firm factors that are strong now. I know you mentioned your asset question earlier about both the Broadband, set-top boxes example of Carrier Access and the areas we are seeing lot of strength, one I mentioned is standard switching and routing.","The other area we're seeing a lot of strength is Broadband Carrier Access which is PON and DSL and associated with it enterprise, wireless access point, all those connected together in basically pushing into infrastructure to some extend as well as campus environment and we think its streams through in that area.","Similar to what we're seeing the level of strength in standard switching and routing. So, I see more specific areas, specific segments or niches in the overall wide market, not all are growing at a same rate. Some are going to less as I indicated and in netbooking ASIC, or fiber optics interconnect, but in carrier access and standard switching and routing we think very strong demand.","Ross Seymore","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur","Hi. Good afternoon and great job on the quarterly execution, we also heard demand is pretty high but Tomahawk and Jericho and then other product called Kumron. You talk about the supply constraint, I just wanted to confirm, are the supply constraints associated with Tomahawk and Jericho and Kumron are these little bottlenecks and when do you anticipate this situation to get better?","Hock Tan","Yes. Well, we are working through it and big part of it is lead time from the wafer fab have extended somewhat. And these products also take a more like standard period of time to go through the manufacturing process front end and back end. And with working to obviously accelerated, compress this cycle time and we believe we should be able to get there within a matter of couple of months, maybe no more than three months, but again it is a process.","And a big part of it is demand that came within the lead shorter than the lead times necessary to produce those products.","Harlan Sur","Great, thanks for the insights there. And then this is just a follow-up from last Ross's question. So the broadband products are obviously a good part of the mix in wire both the tops and access, looks like you had seasonal growth and some product cycles you mentioned prior earnings Q2, so within the growth outlook for wired in Q3, is the broadband business contributing to this growth as well in fiscal Q3?","HockTan","Well we'll like to put it this way. If you saw the forecast I have provided, the way we are putting our forecast together, we see very it's strong even in Q2, we saw that in terms of revenue the numbers been very strong. We're not saying that Q3 will continue on the same trajectory, we just saying that Q3 will sustain at a high level that we achieved in Q2 for both broadband and wireless. We're not saying will continue on that trajectory of growth that we saw in Q2.","One other way we're saying in Q3 broadband wired is not growing much, but sustained at a high level we saw in Q2.","Harlan Sur","Got it, okay. Thanks for that Hock.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs.","Toshiya Hari","Hi thanks for taking my question and congrats on a strong quarter. My first question is on cost synergies. Could you maybe quantify what you realized in Q2 for us and what the outlook is for Q3, and related to that have you buy any chance discovered any incremental opportunities to cut costs beyond your initial target of $750 million?","Tom Krause","So let me take that, I think when we talked about the deal announced that in my comments since we closed our target has been $750 million of line of sight synergies, so it\u2019s a gross margin line relative to operating margin line.","I think by enlarge we're still committed to that target. When you think about quarter-to-quarter sometimes all that difficult to articulate, but let me put it this way, I think by the time we finish the year exit this year will be roughly halfway through our target, which is a bit of ahead of plan, and then we'll realize the rest in the first half of fiscal year. I hope that gives you a little bit of support. ","Toshiya Hari","Okay, that's helpful, thank you. Then my follow-up, I think over the past couple of quarters you've talked about potential opportunities to raise pricing in the classic Broadcom business. Have you already taken action in some areas and if not when should we expect you to do so, and what's kind of the likely impact of gross margins as you kind of take those actions over the next couple of quarters or year two? Thank you.","Hock Tan","To correct you, we don\u2019t take any rates. I don't think we ever mentioned about raising prices in classic Broadcom AVGO for that matter, we never did that. What we made mistake is that when we sell to the same customer multiple product lines and because of the - I guess the thing under benefit have been able to supply multiple products to the same customer at a same time fall platform sale, we're able to increase revenue known as pre-pricing top of that and so we\u2019ve done and nothing of that.","Toshiya Hari","Okay, I appreciate that, thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Romit Shah from Nomura.","Romit Shah","Yes, thanks. I'm just trying to better understand how to think about wireless for the second half of the fiscal year and I believe it's unusual that the July period as it is this year is the big quarter for wireless even in fiscal 2014 where you had big content gains it was October where you saw, that was really the quarter we saw the big sequential growth, and I'm just - first question is I\u2019m just I\u2019m curious why seasonality in wireless appears to be different this year? Why is July the big quarter instead of what's normally been October?","Hock Tan","Okay. Romit, July has never been the big quarter, July in Q3 has never been the big quarter for us if you look back multiple years. Never has been. The big quarter has always been the October quarter, Q4, and never been July, simply because July is the initial ramp up.","Okay, and in the back half of the July quarter precisely in the month of partially July, that we start to see shipment because of lead time taken to manufacturing \u2013 manufacturing we shift to the old to the contract manufacturers, all our OEM at that time and so you see a small part of it in the July quarter you see a full quarter of impact virtually in the October quarter and potentially if you look back two years ago you will continue to see in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 that end January 2017 before it rolls over the typical seasonality rollover \u2013 rollover where the trough will be the second fiscal quarter that we just finished. ","So no different we are seeing there now, one May household you perhaps when you say wireless revenue ramping twenty odd percent in Q3 this year perhaps might be the best way to describe is for the various reasons I mention and you guys are very well aware of, Q2 this year for that particular generation of phone with something referring to has seen particular weakness known to everyone, and so you're stopping off from a bottom that cheaper than Q2 last year or the \u2013 audited for that method.","So when you come up for such a bottom to a new generation of phone, which is still have the ramp up in the same fashion with the same kind of profile to reach a certain level of the possibility of supply. ","So we suddenly see this big mid-20s ramp up. You're right, prior years Q2 to Q3 may not be that twenty odd percent. You'll take Q3 to Q4 to get that but this year is really not Q3 that different perhaps Q2. ","Romit Shah","So should we take your comments to mean that October for wireless would accelerate quarter-over-quarter versus July?","Hock Tan","Yes, that would be the normal condition, yes.","Romit Shah","Okay. All right. That\u2019s helpful.","Hock Tan","Not the main focus, if I think that in, but if I say by the person or by which the four components are consumed and phones are produced and then shipped, sure Q4 is usually the big quarter of the any year rather than Q3. ","Romit Shah","Yes, when you mean peak you're talking quarter-over-quarter change instead of absolute dollars?","Hock Tan","Right. Absolute dollars obviously depends on how many phones of that particular generation what their goal.","Q \u2013 Romit Shah","Okay. And then just one other question. I think I have a sense of what the answer is, but I just wanted to hear your rationale for selling the wireless IoT business, it's an opportunity we hear that\u2019s measured in tens of billions of units and I think some of your competitors have highlighted IoT as being one of the more significant growth drivers over the next few years? ","Hock Tan","Okay, well. Remember some of the criteria for one term fall it\u2019s a franchise product, we only have products that we consider meets within very discipline and very tight criteria of franchise. The most important is sustainability.","We\u2019re building a business for ten years, we\u2019re not building a business for as well for 24 months, and I\u2019d be direct most of the IoT products out there early \u2013 initially on in the cycle obviously are very much consumer driven, and we obviously saw things very hard and are very discipline or make thing sure, we preserve, we invest in product lines, we invest and we invest a lot in product line that are very sustainable for many, many years rather than product lines where we have to keep investing as the product line changes every year, every other year.","And from our viewpoint because of that and because of the tight discipline we put ourselves under, we believe that this is a product line we prefer to have someone else. We have a different set of perspective investing and nurture then for us to deal with. Doesn't mean that they are wrong, we are right, or we are wrong, they are right, all it is beauty lines in the eyes of the beholder. ","Romit Shah","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we have time for one more question. Our final question for today comes from the line of Amit Daryanani from RBC.","Amit Daryanani","Thanks for squeezing me in guys. I guess two questions for me as well. On the wired segment, could talk about how much incremental backlog of the building or how much revenue did you leave on the table because of the supply constraints that you have in the segment, certainly get a sense of is there a potential to pick this back up in October quarter when things normalize?","Hock Tan","This is a very hard question to answer. And the fact that matter is, no we don\u2019t know how to answer that question, I would be honest, because if you rather speculate and many of the designs are very full source design for particular OEM, so obviously there is no switch around.","Having said from the bigger microscopic system, doesn't mean that design \u2013 that opportunity doesn't disappear to somebody else who are able to find a different set of boxes as opposed to component. So if something we're not able to predict for them at the estimate. ","Amit Daryanani","Got it. I guess just a follow-up. In your 10-K, you guys disclose you have signed a multi-year agreement with your largest customer. Can you just talk about what let to that development and what sort of parameters are there that give you comfort around maybe the content numbers or your allocation over the next several years along with pricing?","Hock Tan","No it's a combination of several factors. One is our overall business model in this company and it applies across the multiple product lines we sell franchises like call it \u2013 we compete basically on technology.","We have technology. I mean we're walking example of lots and lots of technology in various areas on all areas but in various areas that we feel we are very strong in. Technology includes engineers and IP.","And we pride ourselves in therefore using that technology to create develop product which are very differentiated for leading customers in the market we participate. We really do and those customers we take very seriously.","We are very loyal. We go 100% in for the customer, and we invest to develop those products. In return we ask for certainty, we ask for partners and we tend to like to enter into long term strategic partnership with a customer where they will continue to use us for future generations of products which enables us to continue to invest into developing technology and products, which enable them to be successful and that investment is not just technology in the case of the 8-K filing, the 10-K filing sorry, that we talked about, it was also capacity, unique capacity in as far. ","So it's fit very, very nicely, but this is not an unusual kind of transaction. We do that with many of our major strategic customers, who we like to call partners but they'll more rather presumptuous because they are customer and we are the supplier.","But we give them technology, we give them balance and we hope we do enough of that that they will sign up for long term partnership with us, which enable us to continue to invest and sustain that franchise and technology and that\u2019s just a many frustration of one of many customers.","Amit Daryanani","Perfect. Thank you, and congrats on the quarter guys.","Ashish Saran","Thank you for participating in today's earnings call. We look forward to talking with you again when we report our third quarter fiscal year 2016 financial results. ","Operator","Thank you. That concludes Broadcom's conference call for today.

Please go ahead, ma'am.","Beatrice Russotto","Thank you, operator, and good afternoon everyone. Joining me today are Hock Tan, President and CEO; and Tom Krause, Chief Financial Officer of Broadcom.","After the market closed today, Broadcom distributed a press release and financial tables describing our financial performance for the third quarter of fiscal year 2019. If you did not receive a copy, you may obtain the information from the Investors section of Broadcom's website at broadcom.com. This conference call is being webcast live and a recording will be available via telephone playback for one week. It will also be archived in the Investors section of our website at broadcom.com.","During the prepared comments section of this call, Hock and Tom will be providing details of our third quarter fiscal year 2019 results, guidance for fiscal year 2019, and commentary regarding the business environment. We will take questions after the end of our prepared comments. Please refer to our press release today and our recent filings with the SEC for information on the specific risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call.","In addition to US GAAP reporting, Broadcom reports certain financial measures on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the tables attached to today's press release. Comments made during today's call will primarily refer to our non-GAAP financial results.","I'll now turn the call over to Hock.","Hock Tan","Thank you, Bea. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. Looking at the third quarter, consolidated net revenue was $5.5 billion, a 9% increase from a year ago. Semiconductor solution revenue was $4.4 billion, down 5% year-on-year and up 6% quarter-over-quarter. Networking continued to perform well, driven by strong demand for our merchant switching and routing platforms, and as we also expected, shipments of custom silicon solutions in AI, SmartNIC, and video transcoding to cloud datacenters were strong.","Wireless is of course seeing the beginning of a typical seasonal uptick and initial positive effects of increased content. These tailwinds were partially offset by weaker demand in storage and broadband. Revenue for infrastructure software was $1.1 billion. The CA business is running above our expectations, benefiting from sustained enterprise demand for our mainframe and distributed software. However, SAN switching demand has paused as our partner OEM supply chain compressed in these uncertain conditions.","Now, let me address the current environment and outlook. Enterprise and mainframe software customer demand continues to remain stable, particularly in North America and Western Europe. SAN switching demand will likely continue to be down another quarter, while inventory in the OEM channels are being worked down.","As it relates to semiconductors, although the US-China trade conflict continues, we have not seen further deterioration in our business, both specific to China as well as globally. Accordingly, we continue to expect to achieve over $22.5 billion of revenue in fiscal 2019, including $17.5 billion from semiconductor solutions and $5 billion from infrastructure software.","Looking to next year. Infrastructure software is stable as renewals among our core customer base continue to be very solid. However, visibility continues to be very limited on the semiconductor side. So, we are managing the business with an expectation that we will continue to operate in a very low growth uncertain macro environment for the foreseeable future.","Fortunately, the fundamentals of our semiconductor business remains strong. As you know, our business is all about connectivity from CPUs to memory in data centers, core to edge in networks, central office to client devices in distributed systems, and here we continue to benefit from the underlying trend in the IT world, and insatiable need for increasing bandwidth to connect things.","In data centers, Tomahawk switching have gone from 3.2 terabits per second just three years ago to 12.8 terabit per second today. In cloud computing, as the limits to Moore's Law constrained CPU and GPU performance, the pipes linking computing cycles to the network and storage expense. PCI Express Gen 4 today at 16G replaces Gen 3 with the likes of next generation Rome CPU. Legacy network interface controllers, NICs as they say are becoming really intelligent, and what we now call SmartNICs and takes on the task of accelerating workloads offload from non-optimized CPU within cloud computing.","Even in SAN, that\u2019s storage area network, fibre channel progresses its bandwidth at 32 gigabit per second in Generation 6 today to Generation 7 at 64 gigabit per second next year to reap the full benefit of all flash arrays in enterprise storage. And to truly connect computer storage replacing direct attach copper, fiber optics running in 100 gig -- 100 G channels are moving to 400 G as our hypercloud customers scale out data centers with Tomahawk 3 today.","Turning to telco networks. Call routing has gone from 1.6 terabit per second a few years ago to 9.6 terabits as represented by our Jericho 2 router today. In broadband, cable modem with DOCSIS 3.0 at 1 gigabit today will move to DOCSIS 4.0 at 10 gigabit over the next few years as cable operators need to compete against 5G networks.","So it is with DSL, digital subscriber line, we're at a mere 500 megabit per second of data flow today, you will upshift to over 1 gigabit per second in G.Fast, which may seem inadequate, so we need GPON at 2.5 gigabit, and even with that we are poised today to launch into mass markets with 10G xPON. Of course, wireless connectivity too has seen the most headline.","And in enterprise access gateways, the protocol has moved from 802.11ac to the new OFDMA enable 802.11ax, otherwise called Wi-Fi 6, and we are at the cusp of cellular communication migrating from 4G to next generation 5G in radio access networks and smartphones. We are enabling these fundamental trends in the marketplace. This gives us confidence that we will continue to sustain and grow our semiconductor business over the long term.","Moving on, let's talk about software, first the CA. As we mentioned, our model for CA is to focus on the 500 largest enterprises in the world, the biggest users of our infrastructure software. Based on experience through fiscal third quarter 2019, we expect our core customer business, that's up for renewal in fiscal year 2019 to grow over 20%. Meanwhile, the attrition rate of business from the long tail of customers behind this core group is anticipated to be over 10% for fiscal 2019.","We have another two plus years to turn over the CA customer contract, but But based on the trends of renewal growth from these core customer base in excess of the attrition of non-core business over the last nine months, we're confident that we can meet if not exceed the long-term revenue and profitability targets that we laid out for CA to you last year when we acquired that business. Our integration activity is largely complete with operating expenses to support CA approaching target levels.","Finally, let me take a few more minutes to talk about our planned acquisition of the Symantec Enterprise business announced in August. Acquiring Symantec furthers our efforts to build one of world's leading infrastructure technology platforms. It allow -- it is the logical next step in Broadcom's infrastructure software strategy, and adds $160 billion cybersecurity market to our -- to the Broadcom's addressable TAM.","We will gain a portfolio of mission-critical security solutions that are deeply embedded among our core customers. There will be meaningful cross-selling opportunities with Brocade and CA solutions, and we believe this acquisition will enable Broadcom to gain a larger share of the wallet of this core customers and we expect this transaction to add more than $2 billion of sustainable run rate revenue with this leading franchises in cyber security and we also expect to achieve in excess of $1 billion in run rate cost synergies within 12 months post close.","And importantly, this transaction gives us the opportunity to achieve -- our ongoing financial objective of double-digit cash on cash returns. The integration planning process is well underway, and as you likely saw, we cleared HSR last week. We remain on track to close the transaction in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 subject to antitrust approvals in the European Union and Japan, as well as of course customary closing conditions.","To sum, a broad and increasingly diversified portfolio of leadership, technology franchises has allowed us today to sustain revenue and increase cash flows even in this challenging market environment.","Now let me turn this call over to Tom.","Thomas Krause","Thank you, Hock. Consolidated net revenue for the third quarter was $5.5 billion, a 9% increase from a year ago. The Semiconductor Solutions segment revenue was $4.4 billion and represented 79% of our total revenue this quarter. This was down 5% year-on-year on a comparable basis. Our Infrastructure Software segment revenue was $1.1 billion and represented 21% of revenue. Free cash flow was 42% of revenue or $2.31 billion and grew 8.5% year-over-year.","Let me now provide additional detail on our financial performance. Operating expenses were $1.01 billion, driven by further reductions from CA-related activities. Operating income from continuing operations was $2.91 billion and represented 52.8% of net revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.06 billion and represented 55.6% of net revenue. This figure excludes $141 million of depreciation.","In terms of working capital, our payables increase of $237 million was somewhat offset by receivables increase of $55 million, and an inventory increase of $57 million from the prior quarter. I would also note that we accrued $110 million of restructuring and integration expenses, and made $164 million of cash restructuring and integration payments in the quarter. Finally, we spent $112 million on capital expenditures.","In the third quarter, we returned $2 billion to stockholders, consisting of $1.1 billion in the form of cash dividends and $977 million for the repurchase and elimination of 3.5 million AVGO shares. We ended the quarter with $5.5 billion of cash, $37.6 billion of total debt, 398 million outstanding shares and had 442 million fully diluted shares for the quarter.","Turning to our fiscal year 2019 guidance. As Hock discussed, we are maintaining our full-year revenue guidance of $22.5 billion, including approximately $17.5 billion from Semiconductor Solutions and approximately $5 billion from Infrastructure Software. IP licensing is not expected to generate a material amount of revenue.","On a non-GAAP basis, operating margins are expected to be approximately 52.5%. Net interest expense and other is expected to be approximately $1.3 billion. The tax rate is forecasted to be approximately 11%. Depreciation is expected to be approximately $600 million. CapEx is expected to be approximately $500 million. As a result, free cash flow is expected to be approximately $9 billion, which does take into account projected restructuring and integration charges of approximately $1.1 billion.","Note, as of the end of the third quarter, $6.9 billion of free cash flow has been generated and includes $969 million of restructuring and integration charges. Stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $2.2 billion, and finally, we expect average diluted share count to be 440 million for Q4 and this excludes any impact from share buybacks and eliminations.","Now on the capital allocation. As many of you know, Broadcom has a business model that generates a very healthy amount of free cash flow across an increasingly diverse and stable set of mainly infrastructure technology franchises. Over the last few years, we have worked to create a more transparent and balanced capital allocation policy.","First and foremost, we have committed to return half of our free cash flow to shareholders each year in the form of cash dividends. In essence, this allows the AVGO stockholder decide how best to reinvest 50% of the free cash flow that we generate.","In return, we have, in effect as the Broadcom struggle to put trust and management to optimally reinvest the remainder of the free cash flow after the dividend is distributed. Fundamentally, we think that we have a unique M&A strategy that allows us to consistently reinvest these excess cash flows that will drive returns well above our free cash flow yields.","Over the past few years, we have developed a road map primarily around Infrastructure Software starting with Brocade, and then with CA and now Symantec that will allow us to continue to execute on the strategy for many years to come. So going forward, our plan is to use this excess cash for acquisitions and\/or to pay down debt that we borrowed to make these acquisitions.","Now over the last years, we have bought back a lot of stock. We had an opportunity to buy stock at depressed prices following the CA announcement. We also want to limit the dilution from the one-time multi-year grant we did earlier this year. In all, we have invested $13.1 billion to repurchase or eliminate a total of 54.5 million shares at an average price of approximately $240 per share over the last 16 months through the end of our fiscal Q3 '19.","So in summary, we think this decision made a lot of sense. That being said, maintaining our core capital allocation strategy of dividends and M&A while pursuing meaningful buybacks in parallel has caused us to increase our leverage and leverage multiples pretty substantially.","Especially in light of the weak macro environment we are seeing today, we're conscious of the risks that a more levered balance sheet creates and are very focused on managing those risks. As a result, we have started to transition our focus to deleveraging the balance sheet following the recent Symantec acquisition announcement.","That concludes my prepared remarks. During the Q&A portion of today's call, please limit yourselves to one question each, so we're going to accommodate as many analysts as possible. Operator, please open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Harlan Sur","Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. Good to see the business bottoming here in the second half of the year. Hock, you know we continue to hear that Tomahawk 3, Jericho 2 are seeing strong demand for the 200 gig and 400 gig cloud networking adoption, also your revenue and design win pipeline on compute networking and security off-load acceleration ASICs is pretty strong with guys like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, etcetera.","Last earnings call, you had anticipated full year double-digits growth in your datacenter networking, compute off-load businesses. Question is, are you still tracking to that and despite the muted growth outlook for the overall business looking into next year, given your design win pipeline, do you expect continued double-digits growth in the datacenter networking and compute off-load looking into next year as well?","Hock Tan","I guess, the bottom line answer is, our outlook, which we shared with you much early on has not changed materially at all. Yes, we do see continuing improve -- ramp of ship deliveries into hypercloud gains [ph] on those various networking as well as computing off-load silicon, and that hasn't changed and that has in fact given quite a lot of buffer to otherwise been a fairly uncertain and difficult markets at this point.","Harlan Sur","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivek Arya of Bank of America. Your line is open.","Vivek Arya","Thanks for taking my question. Hock, you started mentioning something about next year and I just wanted to flesh that out. I know you're not giving next year guidance per se, but on the positive side, you're saying business is bottoming, you outlined the number of product cycles or so, but then you sound a little bit cautious on just the environment.","So, I was curious how you were thinking conceptually about next year, pluses and minuses. And then as part of that, if you could also give us some indication of how Huawei figures into that both kind of in the near-term Q4 and next year? Thank you.","Hock Tan","Well, you actually answered my question for me in many ways, which is you're -- you implying -- which is correct that the US-China trade dispute is turning into an extended affair with lots of twists and turns and uncertainty. And we are assuming things on conditions, environment is not going to change from what we're seeing now. And if we make that assumption next year, you probably see a very uncertain 2020.","But as we sit here right now and we probably have another three -- at least another three months before, we probably give you a much more clear 2020 guidance, but as we sit here right now over the rest of this calendar year, if not fiscal year, what we're seeing is, you're right, which appears -- it appears we have hit bottom at least in the semiconductor -- as it relates to the semiconductor solutions side, we have hit bottom and we are kind of looking ahead and saying that we're paying right here more or less with little seasonality that pops up every now and then as we\u2019re seeing to some extent probably in the next few months as we see ramp up of our North American -- large North American OEM customer in handsets. But other than that, broadly, we're kind of staying at the bottom.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","John Pitzer","Yeah, good afternoon guys. Well, thanks for letting me ask question. Hock, I realize that you're trying to stay away from giving too specific guidance by business line, but I'm just kind of curious relative to your comment on the wireless side of the Semi business, how should we think about this build cycle for you this year prior -- relative to past years when -- there is a view that you're gaining content on the RF side, you've got Wi-Fi 6.","Your largest customer is also not staggering their phone launch this year. They've got some tariff issues that they might want to pull in some builds, so I just -- as you look at the results for the July quarter, were they up sequentially kind of in that mid-teens level, how do we think about October and how long is this build and what's the seasonal look into January? So if you could give us any sort of color that would be helpful.","Hock Tan","Well, it's always in this kind of -- even in this kind of program, we have limited visibility as provided by our customers how far we can go. And to be very specific about what we are asking in wireless, as -- as we\u2019ve always done in previous years, we see beginning of uptick seasonality in Q3, which is the July quarter, and we'll see more of it in our last quarter of the fiscal year, which is October quarter, and we fully expect to see that.","And frankly that\u2019s as far as we see in this typical kind of outlook, because it obviously depends at the end of the day on reset of our OEM customers. But we do see that this year, we do not see any major departure from that; and you know year-on-year, things are quite predictable in this respect.","But having said that, as you know, we are a Company much more than just wireless today. In our -- even in our Semiconductor Solutions, we have broad areas where we participate in and there are multiple puts and takes as I kind of indicated in terms of what happened in Q3 and while we see continuing strength in networking, computing offload in the data centers, we do see some weaknesses in storage and broadband, and it will probably -- things might probably look better next quarter for wireless, but maybe there are some other areas of mitigate and that will go the opposite way.","But broadly, given our large portfolio and broad diversity and the fact that we are very fundamentally strong in each of those areas we are in, which we are saying -- what we are seeing and what we're saying here is that in the semiconductor macro market, which is where they are pretty well represented on average, we are not as strong as it was same time last year.","And if you look at our data so far this year-to-date, we're down probably on average of about 8% year-on-year or thereabouts, which is in my view, what we are seeing -- what the market -- what we think the market is on a broad basis excluding memory of course. And the fact that we were year-on-year down more in Q1, Q2 this fiscal year and probably less down in the back half of fiscal '19 should not be taken as a fact that that\u2019s the bottom and there is possibly a recovery.","That's why we made the statement. We know we are pretty confident we are at the bottom. The question is, there is not much clarity or visibility yet or certainty that any sharp recovery is around the corner.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Danely of Citigroup. Your line is open.","Chris Danely","Hey, thanks guys. Hey Hock, can you talk about the expected timing of the 5G ramp, especially for your ASIC and ASSP business. When you think that starts? Is this has been pushed out at all? Is it about as good as you thought it would be three or six months ago or has the forecast changed and how much?","Hock Tan","Well, that's a tough question in terms of that, because to be honest with you, you know we do not participate that much on 5G ramp on radio access in a broad perspective. We thought -- we thought at the handset level, we touched someone at the radio access, but we believe we probably touched most at the backhaul, the networks. And I think each of them ramps -- will ramp 5G at different times.","So our -- in our perception -- in our ability to see what -- how big that ramp is at any particular point in time, it's also dependent on the fact that -- the fact that different operators in different countries were probably want to ramp up at different points in time, different parts of the network, whether it's a front side ramp or the backhaul. And my guess is probably, you won't see much of it until later this year, early part of next year. As far as we are concerned, which is more of the backhaul where it affects our numbers.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein Research. Your line is open.","Stacy Rasgon","Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to know, you've had a growth target for semi's of mid-single digits, and obviously we're in an uncertain environment. But you also talked a lot about, I guess, company specific drivers and product cycles that fundamentally can still drive.","So I guess, are those fundamental drivers are enough to keep the semi business growing at least somewhere in the ballpark of that sort of mid-single digit long-term guidance even in an environment that's uncertainty. I guess, maybe even put a different way, could you maybe talk about specifically some of the product cycles and trajectories that are may be unique to Broadcom that you see kind of ramping next year and maybe compare with what we had this year across your different businesses?","Hock Tan","Well, yeah, when I went on this quantification of the various trends driving the fundamentals of our product lines and our semiconductor business, I really wasn't thinking necessarily and if I give the wrong impression, I do apologize, one year. This is our ongoing trend. And I was using examples, because these are examples ongoing that we see today, recent past and going forward in the future.","But what I do see is that, yeah, then all this areas we participate in from -- as networking in data centers, routing in core and metro networks, in cable and broadband where we all are -- one thing is clear, which is the nice thing we see in technology, especially the semiconductor technology, there is a constant evolution of the products we do, that's constant demand for improved performance or if I put it increased bandwidth, in essence, we do connectivity.","And depending on a -- in a particular applications, some may spend a year, some may spend three years to make a transition, but they do happen and they continue to happen and that one keeps demand sustain for our technology, for our products, and that's what underpins as reported a long-term growth forecast in semiconductors for us of mid-single digits. And I don't mean a year, I don't mean necessary even two or three years, I mean over the next five years, 10 years, because think about it right.","In 2018 fiscal, our semiconductor business organically, take out all acquisitions, grew 12% year-on-year from '17. And in '17, we grew another -- over 16%, about 10% organically. So I frankly do not expect that high rate to double-digit rate in this business where we have pretty well represented across a broad area to be able to continue at that rate of growth. And so we see in '19, a decline from a -- from a strong '18 as I said, probably mid to high-single digits. Not unexpected and -- but taken over a period of multiple years, we believe we have -- we will achieve that mid single-digit compounded annual growth rate but I won't do that every year. Thank you.","Operator","Thanks. Your next question comes from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Ross Seymore","Thanks. Tom, I had one for you on the capital return side of things. In the past, that 50% dividend policy you have, it's very clear, but the free cash flow that generates that at times has been a little more subjective due to one-time charges finishing the classic Broadcom campus, etc. So how does restructuring charges, how do they fit into the math of free cash flow. And then the investment grade target where you want to keep it there, what sort of leverage target should we think about with you guys more aggressively paying down debt as opposed to repurchasing shares in the near future?","Thomas Krause","Yeah, I think on the cash flow side, Ross, what we've tried to do is create somewhat of a formula, because we do typically have acquisitions and we do have investments we make to get to the synergy targets. And in fact what we're trying to do is deliver the benefits to the stockholders the year with which we are able to achieve those synergies. So what we've done, as we said, look, what would it be free cash flow from operations, which obviously includes was restructuring charges and what's add back those for the purposes of calculating the dividend.","So when we get to the end of the year, we will take the cash flow from operations, we will add back the restructuring, integration charges and in fact will divide by 2 to get to the number that we use to calculate the dividend. This year we don't have any specific one-time large campus initiatives of things like that that we would also want to back out. So that should be a fairly good proxy for how we think about the dividend and the recommendation of the Board at the end of this year.","In terms of investment grade, I think we've talked about this before, but maintaining investment grade similar to the dividend policy is a core principle here, and I think the reason for that, Mark and I discussed it many times internally is, it provides maximum flexibility for us to continue to pursue our strategy. It's always been very important. And so over time, we had this one-time event.","We bought back a bunch of stock as I talked about in the prepared remarks, that's pushed leverage up more so than we normally would. We think based on the economics and the results so far that was the right decision, but we're really looking forward to going back to the playbook we pursued in the past which is following the distribution of the dividend.","Now we still have a lot of cash flow and that cash flow we think based on our strategy is best use for M&A because that's where the returns are most optimal. But as part of that, we often borrow money to finance those acquisitions, and then we go and pay that debt down. So I think we're going back to a more traditional playbook and as part of that given the size and the scale and the increasing diversity of the business and the share profitability and the cash flows, we're very much an investment grade company and we're going to be very focused on maintaining that investment grade status going forward.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Blayne Curtis of Barclays. Your line is open.","Blayne Curtis","Hey guys, thanks for your question. Tom for you, just on the annual guidance for OP margin would suggest a tick down into October, I just want to make sure how literally to take that, and if so, can you talk about any drivers as to why profitability to be coming down in October? Thanks.","Thomas Krause","Yeah, it's a good point, and maybe we're a bit conservative to be honest, when I think the reality as you see the mix shift in the second half of the year. We've got a couple things going on. One with wireless ramping seasonally as Hock discussed, those margins are not as high as the rest of the portfolio. And then on top of that, we are giving back some on the SAN switching side in the back half which is fairly high margin product. So we thought it made sense given the mix to stick to that number and that's why we're staying there.","Blayne Curtis","Got you. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Toshiya Hari","Yeah, hi guys. Thanks very much for taking the question. Hock, I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about what you're seeing in the hyperscale cloud environment. A couple of your peers are -- quite a few of your peers have talked about signs of recovery into the back half and potentially into 2020 following a pretty extended period of weakness. I appreciate you guys have drivers that are very specific to the Company. But in terms of customer sentiment on spending and capacity expansion, what are your thoughts there? Thank you.","Hock Tan","Okay. Well, it's a very interesting question. And I guess I put it two ways. One is touching on cloud spending. We pretty much see some of what a lot of people out there are saying in common lately, which is an improvement in cloud spending in multiple areas, especially in scaling out new generation datacenters as they expand their business. We obviously benefit from that in our switching, routing in some of our specific custom off-load programs in AI or just SmartNIC. So -- and we see that, but as we all know these days, cloud spending is starting to be a bit like telco spending very lumpy.","What we see on the other half of our business in infrastructure is we've enterprises, end users, and here from the viewpoint of an opportunity to see end users directly and we see end use -- enterprises or end users who are the end users, especially the largest bunch of our core customers, their spending continues.","Their IT budget is pretty strong and they're spending continues because they need that digital transformation as their business continues fairly decently and that hasn't impacted, which is why our infrastructure software business, renewals continue to grow very nicely. And that's not an issue. It's when we sell components to OEMs, who then make it into systems to sell to these same end users, then we see a difference.","And the difference is simply that, I think given as far as we could gather -- given uncertainty in this environment that everybody is constraining -- all our partners are constraining their supply chain and compressing the supply chain, so to speak, and then action of compressing is really a reduction in orders, a reduction in what appears to be demand. So it's really interesting as we see it.","That on our software side, things are direct sales to large enterprises continue fairly unabated. But when it comes to selling components through partners to the same end users, we're seeing a different perspective, slowdown, a constrain, and it's reflected obviously in the numbers we are showing here. And it also is reflected in the outlook that we are giving to you guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Craig Hettenbach","Yes, thank you. Hock, switching gears to CA in the software side. Can you talk about just some of the efforts around portfolio license agreements, specifically what kind of sales efforts you have in place there and what this could mean for the business over the next couple of years as you try to gear it that way?","Hock Tan","Yes. Well, it is in the portfolio licensing arrangements as soon as a sales model or business model we apply to our infrastructure software business, which is CA at this point. In my mind, and to be fair, it's less than a year since we launch it, but I -- we since we took over CA only the last November has been I would call it very successful. It has been very encouraging and a big part of why we think it is encouraging the way it works is, because we just focus on the largest 500, 600 customers of CA.","These are guidance where we have large decent signs for large footprints to begin with, and as we go towards renewals, with our ability to offer a portfolio-wide licensing arrangement, a limited capacity on the full range of products -- broad products that we have that extend beyond -- from mainframe to distributed software is extremely attractive and cost effective to those large enterprises who buys a lot of those Infrastructure Software. So we have done multiple deals as rental multiple renewals and we continue to be very engaged with those companies.","So I guess my conclusion is by focusing on these largest customers we've large -- where we have large footprint that exists and where they ability to consume more of those software we have is mix a lot of sense. And as I put in some of my comments earlier on and this -- and this ability to focus on these largest guys and put the sales motion technically and commercially very effectively on this large customers and possibly not focus on the long tail of non-core customers is a key part of the whole model and what makes the whole model works simply because conceptually we are reviewing those contracts with larger footprints on portfolio licensing agreements as I mentioned at a rate of over 20% annually.","While we are probably because of lack of focus, reducing or attriting smaller non-core customers at 10% and those core customers represent 80% of our overall revenue where the long tail represent only 20%, ends up in a situation after one year -- almost one-year where we show a net gain of over 10%. Keep that going, three years later, we reached the average term of every contract we put in place. We would see a clear step up in our revenues from this business of -- we'd like to believe double-digit growth.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."],"4331":["Avago Technologies Limited (NASDAQ:AVGO) Q4 2014 Earnings Conference Call December  3, 2014  5:00 PM ET","Executives","","Hock Tan \u2013 President and CEO","Tony Maslowski - CFO","Ashish Saran - Investor Relations","","Analysts","","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital","Romit Shah - Nomura Asset Management","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets","Ryan Carver - Credit Suisse","","Operator","Welcome to Avago Technologies Limited Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2014 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Ashish Saran, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Ashish Saran","Thank you, Operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are Hock Tan, President and CEO; and Tony Maslowski, Chief Financial Officer of Avago Technologies.","After the market closed today, Avago distributed a press release and financial table describing our financial performance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2014. If you did not receive a copy, you may obtain the information from the Investors section of Avago's website at www.avagotech.com. This conference call is being Webcast live and a recording will be available via telephone playback for one week. It will also be archived in the Investors section of our website at avagotech.com. During the prepared comments section of this call, Hock and Tony will be providing details of our fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year 2014 results, background to our first fiscal quarter 2015 outlook and some commentary regarding the business environment. We will take questions after the end of our prepared comments.","In addition to U.S. GAAP reporting, Avago reports certain financial measures on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the tables attached to today's press release. Comments made during today's call will primarily refer to our non-GAAP financial results. Please refer to our press release today and our recent filings with the SEC for information on the specific risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call.","At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Hock Tan. Hock?","Hock Tan","Thank you, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us. We are going to start today by reviewing recent business highlights and then Tony will provide a summary of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2014 financial results.","So revenue for our fourth quarter was $1.61 billion, an increase of 25% from the prior quarter. The sequential revenue increase was above the upper end of our guidance, which was 18% to 22%. Wireless growth was better than expectations, with revenue growing 73% sequentially, driven largely by product ramp of new smartphone generation at a large OEM. Enterprise storage also performed significantly better than expected, even before considering contribution from our recent acquisition, PLX.","Now before I provide more color on each of our segments, let me quickly provide a short update on the integration of the Avago and LSI operations. As you know, we have completed the sale of two non-core businesses, the LSI flash and Axxia businesses which had NOIs operating spend of approximately $200 million. This has been a key contributor to the significant improvement in our operating model. We have also made great progress in extracting synergies from integrating LSI onto the Avago platform. We\u2019re now more than halfway through this process and expect to complete the balance of the integration program as we exit our fiscal 2015. Clearly, the financial benefits from the integration program and the divestiture of non-core businesses, are being achieved faster than we had originally planned and has definitely given us flexibility to step up R&D investments in certain core businesses.","Now turning to the discussion of our various segments, starting with Wireless. In the fourth quarter, revenue from Wireless was much better than expectations said earlier, growing 73% sequentially. Wireless represented 39% of our total revenue from continuing operations, and on a year-on-year basis, grew 83%. Within the quarter, growth was largely driven by the ramp of a new smartphone generation and a large North American smartphone OEM. We also benefited in this from a significant increase in our content. We also saw strong double digit sequential revenue growth from our FBAR related products across the board, and in particular from multiple Chinese LTE smartphone OEMs. In fact, over 805 of our Wireless revenue is now FBAR related which has driven significant improvements in Wireless gross margins.","Not surprisingly though, we continue to be very capacity constrained, even as we have been investing in additional capacity to meet demand. Looking towards first quarter fiscal 2015, we expect sustained demand from a large North American smartphone OEM to mostly offset broad based seasonal declines for many other global handset OEMs. We\u2019re not sure how this will play out in the quarter. So for now, we expect Wireless revenue in Q1 fiscal 2015 to be flat to perhaps slightly down on a sequential basis.","Moving to Wired infrastructure, which consists of our [indiscernible] based ASIC business and our Fiber Optics business. Here, the wide segment performed close to expectation in the fourth quarter, with revenue growing 1% sequentially. Wired revenue represented 22% of total revenue from continuing operations. You may recall we saw very significant strength in our ASIC business in the third quarter and that strength sustained into this fourth quarter. Overall, ASIC revenue was fairly flat on a sequential basis, with growth in Ethernet switching and routing products, largely offset by declines in base station and high performance computing.","In fiber optics, we grew moderately from the prior quarter. In particular, we had very strong shipments of our 40 gigabit BiDi fiber products as the exclusive customer build up their supply chain to support their new product launch. We also benefited from stronger demand for 16G fiber channel transceivers in storage markets, and very strong fiber to the home deployment in China. Against these, we see declines in 10 gigabit and other standard transceivers. ","Looking forward to first quarter 2015, we expect growth in our ASIC business to resume, partially offset by softness in our fiber optics business. In ASIC, we expect a strong ramp of next generation LTE base station ASIC and a large Chinese OEM. And we expect a stable enterprise and data center Ethernet switching market. However, in fiber optics we expect recovery in parallel optic shipments into routers, call routers to be more than offset however by declines from our other Ethernet transceiver products, especially as 40G takes a pause. As a result, we do expect low single digit sequential revenue growth for our Wired segment.","On to enterprise storage. Here in this segment, our enterprise storage products include our hard disk drive business and our server and storage connectivity product lines. Starting this fourth quarter, this segment will also include products from our recent PLX acquisitions, which will be part of our server storage connectivity business. In this fourth quarter, enterprise storage revenue, including contribution from PLX, came in stronger than expected and grew 15% sequentially. To provide you with some continuity from the prior quarter, enterprise storage revenue without PLX grew 8% sequentially. This segment represents 29% of our total revenues from continuing operations. The HDD, or hard disk drive end market had a seasonally strong quarter with a large increase in enterprise shipments and our HDD revenue grew mid-single digits sequentially on a percentage basis. ","In server and storage connectivity, we also had a very strong fourth quarter, with revenue growing double digits sequentially on a percentage basis. This growth was driven by our server customers staging supply lines in anticipation of a strong [indiscernible] driven server refresh cycle and accordingly purchased significantly higher amount of our 12G SaaS and rate solutions this quarter. Looking forward to Q1 fiscal 2015, we expect data center and enterprise demand to continue driving growth in server and storage connectivity business. We also expect these similar trends to also drive growth in our HDD business. As a result, we expect mid-single digit sequential revenue growth for our enterprise storage business.","Finally, moving on to industrials, fourth quarter our industrial segment performed below expectation, with revenue declining by 2% sequentially. Industrial represented 10% of our total revenues from continuing operations. Re-sales were weaker here than expected in all regions, except the Americas as we saw a cautionary stance from customers in those various other countries. On a sequential basis in fact, re-sales in America were up 2% but declined 9% in Asia Pacific, 6% in Europe and 13% in Japan. Regardless, our industrial product inventory at our distributors remains very tight. In Q4, we will also expecting some revenue related to our last time purchase for legacy program, which is now expected to push out through the first fiscal quarter. ","Looking into the first quarter fiscal of 2015, we expect mid-single digit decline on a percentage basis in industrial product revenue due to planned customer shutdowns late half of December. However, this we expect to be more than offset by the anticipated last time buying I referenced earlier. As a result, we expect low to mid-single digit sequential growth on a percentage basis for industrial segment. ","So in summary, for Q4 and for fiscal 2015, we have a very strong finish with 25% sequential revenue growth in the fourth quarter, driven by strong growth in Wireless, robust demand in enterprise storage, flattish Wired and a small decline in industrial. For first fiscal quarter 2015, we are expecting mid-single growth in enterprise storage, low to mid-single digit growth in industrial. However, low single digit growth in Wired offset by a flat to down Wireless segment. As a result, we expect consolidated revenue growth in the low single digit sequential growth sequentially on a percentage basis. ","With that, let me now turn the call over to Tony for a more detailed review of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2014 financials. Tony?","Tony Maslowski","Thank you, Hock, and good afternoon everyone. Before reviewing the fourth quarter and fiscal 2014 financial results, I want to remind you that my comments today will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results from continuing operations unless otherwise specifically noted. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP data is included with the earnings release issued today and is also available on our Web site at www.avagotech.com. ","In prior quarters, we have provided revenue results for our four target markets, Wireless, enterprise storage, Wired infrastructure and industrial and other. Starting with this quarter and going forward, these four target markets will become our reportable segment, aligning our financial reporting with how our management views the business. We will provide certain segment level results in our SEC filings starting with our upcoming Form 10-K. the business composition of our reportable segments remains the same as previously defined target markets. Please note that our fourth quarter results include contributions from the PLX acquisition which closed on August 12, 2014.","Revenue of $1.61 billion in the fourth quarter represents an increase of 25% from the prior quarter, and came in higher than the upper end of our guidance. Revenue from our Wireless and enterprise storage segment came in better than our expectations. The Wired segment performed close to expectations and we saw weaker than expected revenue from the industrial and other segment. ","Foxconn was a greater than 10% customer in the fourth fiscal quarter. Our fourth quarter gross margin from continuing operations was 58%, which was above our guidance range of 55% to 57%, primarily due to better revenue mix and fab utilization. ","Turning to operating expenses, R&D expenses were $214 million and SG&A expenses were $89 million, driving total operating expenses for Q4 to $303 million, $4 million below guidance, primarily because of some anticipated spending in R&D which is not expected in the first quarter. As a percentage of sales, R&D was 13% and SG&A was 6% of net revenue respectively.","Income from operations for the quarter was $636 million, and represented 40% of net revenue. ","Taxes came in at $42 million for the fourth quarter, $4 million above our guidance. This was primarily due to higher income than forecast. ","Fourth quarter net income was $556 million and earnings per diluted share were $1.99.","Fourth quarter interest expense was $54 million. The other income and expense line was $16 million, resulting primarily from gains on the sale of non-core LSI portfolio investments which had a positive impact on EPS. ","Our share based compensation in the fourth quarter was $49 million. The breakdown of the expense for the fourth quarter includes $6 million in cost of goods sold, $19 million in R&D and $24 million in SG&A. in the first quarter fiscal 2015, we anticipate share based compensation will be approximately $51 million. Just as a reminder, our definition of non-GAAP net income excludes share based compensation expense.","Moving on to the balance sheet, our day sales outstanding were 42 days, an increase from the prior quarter\u2019s 39 days, primarily due to linearity of revenue during the quarter. Our inventory ended at $519 million. Days on hand were 70 days, which decreased 9 days from the third quarter as we reduced inventory in our Wireless segment which had built up in prior quarters to support the strong ramp in fourth quarter shipments. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.6 billion and we generated $381 million in operational cash flow.","As a reminder, in the fourth quarter we closed the PLX acquisition, which consumed approximately $308 million in cash close. And we closed the sale of our flash business for which we received approximately $450 million in cash. On November 18 2014,in our first fiscal quarter of 2015, we also closed the sale of the Axxia business and received approximately $650 million in cash. ","In the fourth quarter, we spent $189 million on capital expenditures. For the full year fiscal 2015, we expect CapEx to be approximately $600 million, of which approximately $200 million is expected to occur in the first quarter. As a reminder, our first quarter is generally a weaker quarter for cash generation due to the payment of our annual employee bonuses related to the prior fiscal year. ","As you may recall, last quarter we mentioned our intent to use a significant amount of our net proceeds from the sales of the flash and Axxia businesses towards paying down a portion of our outstanding term loan before the end of this calendar year. We are still evaluating our capital needs over the next 12 months and for now, we see investment of these proceeds in the business as a better short term use of our cash, including potentially investment in our internal fab capacity to support continued demand for our Wireless products. ","On September 30 2014, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.32 per ordinary share, which consumed $81 million of cash. This dividend was raised by $0.03 from the prior quarter. Since the inception of our dividend program in second quarter of 2011 to date, our financial performance has allowed us to increase our dividend each quarter. As a reminder, our Board reviews and determines our dividend policy on a quarterly basis based on our financial performance and condition, the contractual provisions related to our outstanding indebtedness and other factors deemed relevant by our Board. During the quarter, we did not repurchase any shares.","Now let me briefly recap our fiscal 2014 full year results. Net revenues increased by 71% year over year to $4.3 billion, benefiting primarily from two quarters of contributions from continuing operations of the LSI businesses as well as strength in our Wireless business. Gross margin increased by 5% year over year to 56%, driven by an improvement in product mix with higher contributions from our FBAR related Wireless products on the classic Avago side, as well as comparatively higher gross margins from the LSI continuing operations. Net income for 2014 increased to 41.343 billion or $4.90 per diluted share as compared to $731 million or $2.89 per diluted share in fiscal 2013.","Now let me turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the first quarter of 2015. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business condition and we do not intend to update this guidance. This guidance is for results from continuing operations only. Net revenue is expected to be flat to up 4% from the fourth quarter. Gross margin is expected to be 57.5%, plus or minus one percentage point. Operating expenses are estimated be approximately $301 million. Taxes are forecasted to be approximately $38 million. Net interest expense and other is expected to be approximately $56 million. And finally, the diluted share count forecast is for 283 million shares.","That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator"," [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please proceed.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital","Thanks for taking my questions, great quarter. I was wondering if you could just comment on the Wireless business. You\u2019re looking for a very flat guidance. You saw flat guidance last year. I was wondering if you just -- looking at the inventory levels and the ramps, how -- if you had to relate it to a normal seasonal -- I know it's hard in Wireless, how would you compare? You probably don't want to give guidance for April, but how does it relate as you look into April in terms of normal or not? Thanks.","Hock Tan","We don\u2019t really have visibility that far out, Blayne all the way out to April, but we do have pretty clear visibility frankly in this Q1 fiscal 2015 in terms of backlog from customers, forecast some certain customers. And particularly when you have a fab that\u2019s running full, you get pretty good -- you get very good visibility for the quarter of that period. Right now Q1 as we see it, we see sustaining the levels pretty much of what we saw in Wireless of Q4. And that\u2019s not dissimilar from what we saw a year ago.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital","Thanks. And then just the outlook. The gross margin is very strong in the quarter and the outlook is also very strong. Obviously, you're running your fabs fully utilized, but also adding capacity. I was wondering if you could talk about when do you get back to some normal supply\/demand with FBAR? And then if you could just comment on the competitive landscape. Obviously, others are trying to chase this market that's been so good for you in terms of TC-SAW or others pursuing [BAW]. Can you just comment on both of those? Thanks","Hock Tan","Again to try to give you -- to try and answer your question in a couple of sentences, the answer is the demand for I guess high performance filters is the best way to describe it, very high performance filter, especially into LTE bands, be they China or beyond China is very strong, has been very strong since last quarter. It continues to be extremely strong, particularly with the full launch in late Q4, in Q4, our Q4 that is of the next generation smartphone from the North America, that certain North American OEM. And that demand has -- as far as we see, continues to sustain. ","So the strong demand for high performance filters and we know there are competitors out there, be they BAW or on a limited basis, TC temperature compensated source. And I mentioned it on a limited basis because obviously with our fab full, we can only supply so much short term, though our plans to increase the fab will enable us as time progresses fairly rapidly to be able to address the markets in a normal basis. But short term is not or as the seasonal uptick is not happening, which basically lead some certain other customers, potential customers to perhaps look for alternatives and they do. Having said that, we believe the performance of our FBAR far surpasses anybody else and if there\u2019s a choice, we do get selected. If not, good enough might do.","Operator","Our next question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura. Please proceed.","Romit Shah - Nomura Asset Management","Thanks a lot. Great results. Your Wireless business for this calendar year looks like it will exceed 50%. And Hock, we know that content was a major force behind that. Looking into next year and the platforms that you're designing too, how do you think your content will improve into 2015?","Hock Tan","The overall trend towards pad architecture as RF architecture using pads as you all know, power amplify duplex modules that is, is increasing. The trend towards this will occur more and more and won\u2019t be just restricted to any particular phone maker. And the simple reason is simply because while the overall number of phones out there are kind of flattish to maybe single digit growth, the switch, the conversion of feature phones, low end phones towards smartphones is happening fairly rapidly and especially smartphones which goes higher and higher end. People require roaming features which means importing bands that are not just unique to a particular local country or carrier, but multiple carriers globally. And the content in every smartphone will have to increase. ","So RF components as we all know and has been evident the last 12 months, RF component demand has been very strong. And even within RF components, filter demand is still particularly strong because while in semiconductor processes or in semiconductor typical trend, you can and do integrate chips functionality together. For instance multiple -- one power amplifier can support multiple modes, multiple bands. In filters, you need one separate filter for every single band. And as more and more bands enter smartphones, which are expected to roam multiple continents, multiple carriers, the sheer content of filters in each smartphone will increase, especially when you go to 3G, 4G now and potentially forward in the future. So the trend is towards more and more content increase. ","Romit Shah - Nomura Asset Management","Okay, thanks for that. And second question on operating margin, I might have missed it, Tony but do you guys have a new long term target model for operating margin? You came in at slightly below 40% this quarter and the prior target of 28% to 32% feels like it\u2019s a bit stale.","Tony Maslowski","Again remember like I said, we\u2019re going to update it after we get a couple more quarters under our belt. So it\u2019s still a little early for us to do the long term model so just \u2026","Hock Tan","We want to be pretty sure, Romit. We can\u2019t [indiscernible] outrunning us.","Romit Shah - Nomura Asset Management","I guess tied into that, how do you guys get away with spending 13% of your revenues on R&D? is it that enterprise networking or enterprise storage and industrial don\u2019t require much R&D? Because if I look at some of your networking comparable, nobody is spending less than 20% on R&D. Analogue is a little bit better than that, but you could argue the model is different. So maybe you can just talk about R&D here at 13%. Can you sustain that without compromising future growth?","Hock Tan","Let me get your first point first. You think 13% is too low, right?","Romit Shah - Nomura Asset Management","It\u2019s low compared to most of your networking comparable. Most analogue companies, with the exception of TI which we would argue is a totally different model.","Hock Tan","Yes, we are and we have quite totally different model from the rest of the world too by the way, Romit. To answer you seriously, we have a range. We have four end markets as you know and give you a sense. One extreme side which is Wired or enterprise networking on the ASIC side, especially on service side, of course we\u2019ll be spending R&D in the mid-20s. Really not much different from many of our peers in that area. We do spend that. And then on the other extreme, industrial which tends to be very analogue, in our case extremely 35 compound semiconductor analogue, not just silicon analogue, we spend single digits in R&D of revenue. And the others are somewhere in between. So we average out 13%, 14%. ","A big part of it frankly is on the standard products we drive in Wireless as an example, we get huge revenue scale up, real operating leverage in specific areas where the volume is high. So when you look at this range of products we are in and obviously enterprise storage and Wireless falls in between the extremes of industrial and networking, ASIC especially. All the rest fall between, we just average out 13%, 14% R&D spend. And we believe we\u2019re spending at a fairly comfortable level because the comment I made at the beginning of my remarks, we\u2019re running ahead of our financials, achieving financial synergies with this integration. ","We\u2019re running ahead of it and it also, because of that, allows us a lot of flexibility, not that we need that to do it because we always have the habit of investing a lot more even into our core businesses to defend it and strengthen it even more. We\u2019re not being -- we\u2019ve never been cheap about doing it. Where the difference we don\u2019t see the business, we developed it. We divest it then we don\u2019t spend it anymore, but where the businesses that are core, believe me we will invest what we need to continue to lead in technological leadership, which is central to this entire business model.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please proceed.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for taking my question. Maybe Hock first one for you, I know you\u2019re not guiding to Q2 Wireless, but in general given the large contribution from your North American customer, do you expect your Wireless segment to show more volatility or more seasonality going forward? Because I\u2019m trying to offset that against some of the content growth you\u2019re seeing in China. So the question really is, do you see your Wireless segment being more or less seasonal than before? And if it is more seasonal, what does that do to your FBAR capacity utilization and gross margins?","Hock Tan","To be direct and I made the comment right upfront when I talked about Wireless, we don\u2019t know. We don\u2019t have that clear visibility. I like to say that this year repeats from last year and you know how last year\u2019s cycle is and I get that\u2019s why you\u2019re driving this particular question. And so keeping that in mind, I\u2019ll answer you this which by itself tells you something, we don\u2019t know. We don\u2019t really know. And that\u2019s why even in Q1 as we forecast Wireless, and please don\u2019t read too much in what I\u2019m trying to tell you then, when I purposely stated in my Q1 Wireless for this particular quarter. Right now our sense is Wireless is flattish. It could be down slightly, but you\u2019re talking about a fairly substantial number either way. Right now, sitting here right now, we think it\u2019s flattish. I could be wrong even then sitting here right now. And I definitely would be in no position to give you a sense of what Q2 is at this point.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And then as a follow-up, maybe one for you, Tony, can you remind us what your target debt leverage ratio is and what do you plan to do with the cash that's coming in and the cash flow that you are generating? I know that you have been increasing your dividend consistently. You\u2019re investing in CapEx. But do you see leverage getting to a point where you feel comfortable expanding the buyback plan or considering more M&A, maybe another home run, like an LSI?","Tony Maslowski","Yes. So just to be very clear that our priorities on cash usage hasn\u2019t changed. So it\u2019s number one, it\u2019s internal investments and that includes as Hock mentioned, some of the things that we\u2019re opportunistic with or strengthening our product portfolio. Second is really the dividend and then also the debt pay down. The debt pay down I want to be clear is that our leverage ratio at the beginning of the transaction was roughly a little over 3. And if you look at some of the models you guys have out there, we could end up in the twos quite easily this year. So really once we hit around two is that when we\u2019ll go back to our board and say hey, do we want to change our capital structure and put some more longer term debt on the balance sheet. The pause that I talked about in my speech was really just to say hey, we\u2019re thinking about it still. So think about it more as a one or two quarter pause only in the debt pay down that we\u2019re thinking about. Of course, we don\u2019t comment on any M&A.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Or buyback, is that also \u2026","Tony Maslowski","Buyback is like fourth or fifth.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs","Congratulations on the terrific results. Could we get a little bit more color on the one-time item, or nonrecurring item, or end-of-life item that's impacting the Industrial sequentials? Thank you.","Hock Tan","It\u2019s really not very significant material and in fact all of the foregoing. We just have to say it\u2019s a one-time non-recurring thing. It\u2019s our last time buying on a legacy program by a customer, which won\u2019t recur. It\u2019s just significant enough for industrial to tweak the thing, which is why I took pains to explain that for industrial, we expect Q1 to be declining low single digits sequentially. Instead, with this thing thrown in, becomes increasing single digit sequential. So you can probably guess at the size of the number of this particular item. And I really don\u2019t mean it to be anything to be misleading or anything else. It\u2019s just not worth talking about. ","Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs","No, that's very helpful. Thank you. And for a follow-up, understanding you're capacity constrained and the fabs are full, have the lead times changed meaningfully over the course of the last couple of quarters? Because obviously your business has been terrific for a while now. Are you seeing any change in the lead times or capacity constraints, recognizing that you're running full out? Thank you.","Hock Tan","And you\u2019re referring I assume just to our FBAR related products, right, Wireless products?","Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs","Correct. Thank you. Yes.","Hock Tan","We\u2019re on product allocation as we sit here right now. So I guess yeah, the lead times have changed pretty significantly. It has extended up.","Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs","And do you think that's causing -- do you worry at all about double ordering that sometimes happens when folks are on allocation, or how are you managing that?","Hock Tan","We are managing that very closely and managing that very tightly because we have pretty good sense for -- one of the benefits is that a large part of our revenues are coming from a few large guys and believe me we support these few large guys extremely well when we know what they need precisely. There\u2019s also other portion of it that might not be so well managed simply because they\u2019re more fragmented and that\u2019s the area obviously that we do worry about. The positive side to it is it\u2019s a relatively set of minority in terms of the size of business rather than the larger part of our business. ","Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs","Thank you very much. Congratulations again.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank","Echoing everybody else, congrats on another strong quarter and guide. Hock, I want to switch gears away from Wireless onto the Wired side momentarily. With the combination of your ASIC business with LSI's and then one other big player in that space getting out, I just want to see roughly what your expectations are for the growth potential of that business? And has there been any lash back from your customers because the combination of Avago and LSI now can be so dominant?","Hock Tan","First let me rephrase. We\u2019re not dominant. We have a scale now and we certainly have scale that allows us to benefit from investing in a lot more capabilities than we had previously. Our claim to fame used to be in Avago 30s. we now have very, very strong IP. It\u2019s still in 30s but beyond 30s into memory and better processing, all the nice stuff that many of our ASIC customers love to have in communications Wired and Wireless infrastructure. That\u2019s why we tend to focus our ASIC business in networking, but also Wired and Wireless infrastructure on a more focused basis, but still very much ASIC. ","And yeah, that business as I reported over the last couple of quarters, has been growing very nicely. A big part of it, having said that, is product ramps. Product ramps in new generation edge routers, new generation of this software defined network switches like the Nexus 9000. We\u2019re in those very much. We\u2019re in all the edge routers that I\u2019m aware of, almost. And we even have ASIC base band in one Chinese base station OEM. And all that is driving very nice growth, not huge growth. That\u2019s not the nature of this business, but it\u2019s more -- I best call more direct growth. And that\u2019s the way we like it. So we do see potential growth opportunity on a very moderate basis that is more sustainable over the next two, three years.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank","Great. My follow-up question, really quickly for Tony, is on the OpEx side of things. Can you remind us where we are in the integration path as far as getting to the $200 million originally you talked about? And I guess the angle I would put on it is more on an absolute basis. That's the $301 million you're guiding to. Is that the new base off of which we increase or decrease according to revenue? Or do you still have some of those, after last quarter, 1,100 people that had yet to exit the Company and therefore that would make OpEx actually decline?","Tony Maslowski","So we still have some opportunities for OpEx decline. Remember is that the original base was like this 390 number on the combined company. So, the goal would have been 290, but then you\u2019ve got to add in PLX, a couple of million. So really as Hock mentioned in his speech, we\u2019re done with the divestitures which contributed that $50 million a quarter. And we\u2019re probably about, as you can do the math yourself, $40 million towards the $50 million of the other. But as Hock mentioned as well, it gives us great flexibility to beef up other areas our R&D as these final stages happen. So those will happen as we combine the systems, the IT systems, which again is planned for the end of the first half, beginning of the second half of this current fiscal year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Unidentified Analyst","Hello. This is [Denai] calling in for Craig. I had a question on gross margins. Gross margins are benefiting from strong growth in FBAR. Are you seeing any benefit or any improvements in other segments of the business as well?","Tony Maslowski","As we mentioned, there are other improvements. When we started with the whole LSI acquisition, we\u2019re quite surprised that we\u2019ve seen some upside to their businesses as well. So again we always focus on FBAR because that\u2019s the headline you guys want to hear about, but we also do mention the other thing, that there\u2019s a constant improvement here across most of the divisions.","Hock Tan","There were two supply chains from two companies. There\u2019s now one single supply chain organization. So that, we call that manufacturing overheads. That has significantly reduced for the combined company and that does add to the gross margin improvement. ","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. That's helpful. And as a follow-up is on Wired Infrastructure. In your view post-LSI, how do you feel about your portfolio when you're trying to adapt the ASIC market and fiber optics? And how do you feel about the competitive dynamics in both businesses? ","Hock Tan","This combination as I mentioned earlier has given us a lot more capabilities in terms of a lot more capabilities, lots more IP to offer key customers as we compete for ASIC programs at major OEMs. If anything else, you\u2019re right. One concern might be customers thinking we serve certainly larger and a larger percentage of their ASIC spend, silicon spend. But on the other side, there\u2019s a lot of ASSP FPA out there that definitely provide very, very strong completion for us, not just ASICs. And it\u2019s just that we\u2019re very good at ASICs and we focus on that. By natural self-selection, customers want their own differentiator products picks us. Having more capabilities obviously makes us a more formidable competitor as against the FPGA guys or against vendor products. But we do see all that competition out there.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Congrats once again on the solid quarter, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Freedman with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks for taking my question. And if I could dig into a little bit on the $600 million in CapEx, can you give us some sense of how much capacity addition that is buying you?","Tony Maslowski","Again, of the $600 million, the majority is going to the continued build out in the FBAR facility and including some of our attempt to go from 8 inch to 12 inch. So again it\u2019s hard to tell the actual capacity add because again depending on the success of that 8 to 12.","Hock Tan","6 to 8.","Tony Maslowski","I\u2019m sorry, 6 to 8. Sorry. I apologize. 6 to 8 conversion that we\u2019re going through. So again I think it\u2019s difficult to give an exact percentage. This will depend on how successful that is and how quickly that ramps.","Hock Tan","It will be a substantial increase in our capacity. For competitive reasons, we hesitate to give you a specific on that, but it will be a fairly substantial increasing capacity that we will achieve by end of fiscal 2015 compared to where we are today.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets","Great. And if I could, for my follow-up, just talking about maybe some of your other businesses, there was a lot of concern in the broader semiconductor market this quarter about linearity of bookings. And maybe if you can give us some sense of what you've seen in your other businesses in terms of trends in the overall business in booking patterns, and maybe what you might expect for the quarter you're presently in. ","Hock Tan","Good question. Moving aside wireless for a second, we still have the rest of our three end markets, which are very large. The best way to describe it is bookings for those three other end markets, which is Wired largely enterprise, enterprise storage and industrial. Best description I\u2019ll put of it is very stable. It has grown from Q3. Q4 showed a sharp growth, especially late Q3, early Q4 was a sharp ramp in bookings, increasing bookings, stabilize and remain fairly stable.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Ryan Carver - Credit Suisse","This is Ryan Carver in for John. Appreciate you taking the questions. Not a lot of mention, I think a lot of focus on the Cupertino customer. Can you talk about what you're seeing in your large Korea customer? I think, obviously, a lot of understanding about their weakness in units, end part of this year. Are you seeing any indications, as you guys see the January month of any new flagship ramp? Andi guess maybe more broadly on that Korea customer, they've talked about potentially reducing SKUs going forward. Does that trend potentially benefit you guys as fewer SKUs are required to support maybe more territories around the world?","Hock Tan","I\u2019m loathe to answer that question because we usually don\u2019t want to comment on any particular customer. I appreciate it if you accept that as basically my answer. I\u2019ve heard about them coming down to lesser SKUs and that is true I believe from all indications I\u2019ve seen .they\u2019re doing all they can obviously to recover ground. And I assure you they are and they\u2019re very big, important customer which we love dearly. But other than that, I can\u2019t comment anything more than that.","Ryan Carver - Credit Suisse","Okay. But maybe I can ask a different way. Relative to what is a typical expectation for new product launches seasonally in the first part of a year, are you guys starting to see any indication of what is a normal seasonal trend for you guys there?","Hock Tan","Nothing unusual about that from that Korean customer you\u2019re talking about is well known that they do two large product launches as you know on their two flagship products of interest to us. But yeah, they do the Galaxy S series in the spring and they do the Note series in the fall. All indications and all our engagements are they\u2019re planning to do exactly that. ","Ryan Carver - Credit Suisse","Got it, great. If I could just squeeze one more in. You mentioned seeing some ASIC ramp within some of the base station customers. Can you comment a little more about the application of those ASICs? I think that there's a general understanding \u2013 ","Hock Tan","Base station you mean that I was referring to that\u2019s helping drive our Q1 revenue in ASIC? Yeah. We have an ASIC that is pretty much in the base band of the base station. It\u2019s basically the -- it\u2019s a base band and nothing much more than that. But it\u2019s unique and differentiated for that particular customer","Ashish Saran","Thank you, Operator. Thank you for participating in today's earnings call.

Comments made during today\u2019s call will primarily refer to are non-GAAP financial results.","Please refer to our press release today and our recent filings with the SEC for information on the specific risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over the Hock Tan. Hock?","Hock Tan","Thank you, Ashish, good afternoon everyone. I'm actually quite pleased with our performance for the second fiscal quarter with solid contributions from a broad number of our franchises. We delivered strong financial results with revenue, gross margin, and earnings per share, all above the top line -- top end of our guidance.","Second quarter revenue of $4.2 billion, grew 1% sequentially and 18% year-on-year. The seasonal sequential decline in our Wireless segment was less than expected and more than offset by contributions from all other segments. All segments, even wireless delivered year-on-year revenue growth. On the income front, earnings per share were $3.69, growing by 2% sequentially and 46% year-on-year. ","Let me now turn the discussion of our results by segment. Starting with Wired, our largest segment. In the second quarter, Wired revenue was very stable at $2.1 billion, growing 1% sequentially and 3% year-on-year. The Wired segment represented 50% of our total revenue. Wired continued to remain a very consistent end market and performed in line with expectations.","As you may recall, in the preceding quarter, Wired revenue included approximately $16 million of revenue related to the assignment of certain manufacturers right to a customer. This did not repeat in the second quarter; however, we were able to more than make up for this amount with growth- from enterprise networking and start of a seasonal increase in demand for our broadband access and set-top box products.","Turning to the third fiscal quarter, though we expect seasonal strength in broadband and sustain cloud data center spend, and consistent with this outlook, we expect Wired revenue growth to accelerate into mid-single digits sequentially.","Moving onto Wireless. Second quarter, Wireless revenue was $1.15 billion, declining by 2% sequentially, but growing 45% year-on-year. The Wireless segment represented 28% of our total revenue. The low-single-digit sequential decline in revenue was better than expected due to stronger than anticipated end-market demand. The sequential decline was driven by the bottom of the annual product cycle transition at our major North American customer, offset by the ramp of the next generation phone at our large Korean smartphone customer. Generation to generation, we also benefited from significant increase in Broadcom cellular and WiFi connectivity content.","Moving on now to the third quarter. We expect to see the beginning of the second half seasonal growth in our Wireless segment revenue. We expect this growth to be driven by the start of a ramp from a large North American smartphone customer as they transition to their next generation platform. On top of this, we are also expecting a substantial increase in our total dollar content from the eight Broadcom products we will be supplying into this new platform.","The national ramp of this next generation platform; however, appears slower this year, compared to prior years. But we believe, this will likely accelerate in our fourth quarter. Our third fiscal quarter outlook reflects this expectation and notwithstanding the 40% content growth. We project sequential growth in our Wireless revenue to only approach double digits on a percentage basis. This outlook also reflects an expected decline in shipments to our last Korean smartphone customers.","Let me now turn to Enterprise Storage. In the second quarter, Enterprise Storage revenue was $712 million, growing 1% sequentially and 36% year-on-year. Storage segment represented 17% of our total revenue. Surprisingly, this segment continued to hold up and perform as expected. Hard disk drive and custom SSD shipments grew while SaaS and RAID sustained, offset by a seasonal decline in Fiber Channel shipments.","During our previous earnings call, we express a cautionary tone around enterprise storage for the third quarter; however, we continued to see stability in most of all sustain bookings. We expect storage revenue to grow in the low-single digit sequentially into the third quarter.","And finally, our last segment Industrial. In the second quarter, the Industrial segment revenue was $223 million, growing by 24% sequentially, much better than expected primarily due to higher IP, intellectual properties that is licensing revenue from a large deal we closed in the quarter.","Industrial revenue grew 23% year-on-year and represented 5% of our total revenue. Re-sales of our industrial products continued to trend up very firmly in the second quarter, and we expect this to continue to be strong into the next quarter. As we look to the third quarter, we expect Industrial revenue to grow in the mid-single digits sequentially.","So in summary, demand in the second quarter, historically our weakest seasonal quarter, was stronger than expected. For the third fiscal quarter, end markets in Wired, Enterprise, Storage, and Industrial continues to be strong, while wireless turns out and starts a slower than usual seasonal second half ramp , although, we do expect it to accelerate dramatically in the fourth quarter. This leads to up projection of consolidated revenue growth of around 6% sequentially for the third quarter.","With that, let me turn the call over to Tom for more detailed review of our second quarter financials and third quarter outlook.","Tom Krause","Thank you, Hock, and good afternoon everyone. My comments today will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results from continuing operations unless otherwise specifically noted. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP days is included in the earnings release issued today and is also available on our website at broacom.com.","For the second quarter, starting with the revenue of $4.2 billion, which grew by 1% sequentially. Year-on-year, growth for the second quarter revenue was 18%, which I would notice continues to be well ahead of our long-term growth rate targets of mid-single digits. Foxconn was only the greater than 10% direct customer in the second fiscal quarter. Our second quarter gross margins from continuing operations were 63.1%, 70 basis points higher than our prior quarter and 110 basis points above the midpoint of guidance. The improvement in gross margins is primarily due to higher revenue and better than expected IP licensing revenue within our industrial and other segment. I would note, we do expect to be able to sustain these gross margins going forward.","Turning to operating expenses, R&D expenses were 677 million and SG&A expenses were $122 million, totaling 799 million or 19% of net revenue for the second quarter. This was slightly higher than guidance as we accrued for a larger projected annual bonus compensation expense, driven by better than expected operating income. As I mentioned last quarter, we are comfortable at this relative level of operating expense given our current portfolio of businesses. Operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $1.85 billion and represented 44.1% of net revenue.","We now have line of sight to achieving our long-term operating margin target of 45%. Provisions for taxes came in at $78 million slightly above our guidance. This is primarily due to higher than expected net income. Second quarter interest expense was a 112 million and other income net was 3 million. Second quarter net income was 1.67 billion and earnings per diluted share was $3.69. Our share based compensation expense in the second quarter was 216 million.","Moving onto the balance sheet, our day sales outstanding were 45 days, an increase of two days from the prior quarter due to a reduction in linearity of revenue in the quarter. Our inventory ended at 1.31 billion, a decrease of 25 million from the beginning of the quarter. We generated 1.58 billion in operational cash flow, which does include the impact of an increase in working capital. Expenditures on classic Broadcom restructuring integration activities continues to decline as expected, as we expanded approximately $50 million in cash on these activities in the second quarter.","Free cash flow in the second quarter was 1.33 billion or 32% of net revenue. I would note, we are making very good progress towards our long-term target of 35%. Capital expenditure in the second quarter was 256 million or 6.1% of net revenue. As a reminder, we do expect our long-term CapEx to decline to about 3% of net revenue. A total of 437 million in cash was spent on company dividend and partnership distribution payments in the second quarter. We ended the second quarter with cash and short-term investment balance of 4.45 billion. Our cash balance is running at elevated levels, which we expect will continue through the third quarter anticipation of close and depending acquisition of Brocade.","Now, let me turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the third quarter of fiscal year 2017. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions and we do not intend to update this guidance. This guidance is for results from continuing operations only. Net revenue is expected to be 4.45 billion plus or minus 75 million. Gross margin is expected to be 63%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. Operating expenses are estimated to be approximately 787 million. Our tax provision is forecasted to be approximately 86 million. The net interest expense and other is expected to be approximately 100 million. Note, this reflects anticipated interest expense on our long-term debt of 112 million offset, largely by other income including interest earned on our cash balance.","The diluted share count forecast is for 456 million shares. Share-based compensation expense will be approximately 255 million. Capital expenditure will be approximately 240 million. As you have seen, our Board has declared a dividend of $1.02 per share to be paid later in this fiscal -- third fiscal quarter. We\u2019re looking forward to completing the acquisition of Brocade, which is proceeding as planned and subject to the satisfaction off the remaining closing conditions. We presently expect to close this transaction on or about July 31, 2017.","That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Blayne Curtis","Just want to follow up on the Wireless side you said it\u2019s slow ramp . I was just kind of curious, is this the timing or magnitude? I think you have meant that it\u2019s going to be more in Q4, but if maybe you could just wrap some color around that?","Hock Tan","It\u2019s timing. I think, it is timing; last year, the similar ramp was earlier -- was stronger in Q3 probably because it was earlier. And here the initial volume in our fiscal Q2 was smaller, made up with content on our side, but definitely Q4 is forecasted to be larger.","Blayne Curtis","And then, you mentioned this from the Storage side, you had some conservatism on the second half and you're seeing growth. Maybe if you can just talk about, what you're seeing on the Storage side that is growing? And then, what are you seeing. I think the hard drives where you're most concerned, what\u2019s making you feel better about that market?","Hock Tan","Well, it's growing -- it\u2019s growing as we mentioned pretty much single digit, low-single digit. I would say it's at a high elevated level and kind of staying there for now in Q3. Q4 of course as we expressed in a cautionary manner is a whole new game. Visibility is -- obviously, we are not booking everything in Q4 here, but we pretty booked Q3.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Vivek Arya ","Thanks for taking my question and great job on consistent execution. So my first question Hock, can you please address these recent media reports about the potentially large bit for Toshiba's assets? I realized the details are not public, but there is a very large amount of money involved. And I think investors are keen to know how you're thinking about it conceptually and whether you are still committed to being disciplined around maintaining your free cash flow returns and not taking big technology risks when you consider M&A.","Hock Tan","We are very committed to our business model of only having franchises, very much though. And as I mentioned, all 18 of our product lines are product franchises in connectivity solutions. We are also very committed to not only those franchises but generating lots and lots of free cash flow which we top of -- which we will return to shareholder. All that up on model, no change. Bottom line, don't believe everything you read out there, please.","Vivek Arya ","I see. And then secondly on the Wireless business, I think you gave some good color for Q3. Just one question on Q4 and then maybe longer term, Q4 when I look in the last 5 years, the median sort of sequential growth has been close to 30%. So, is that the kind of level that you're thinking about this year or maybe even better given the delayed shipments of those phones and a higher content you've suggested? And then longer term on that same Wireless theme, I think one of your competitors, Qorvo recently outlined some plans to perhaps take some share at your large customer with the High Band PAD. And I wanted to see, how secure you think your competitive position is on next year's phone models? Thank you.","Hock Tan","There is a lot of questions and content. I\u2019ll start with the serious one. We don't forecast beyond one quarter you know, bad practice frankly because we could be very sadly wrong. But obviously, what we are also seeing is from the limited visibility we see, we see the ramp beginning in our fiscal Q3 which as you know is an off calendar ramp by one month, July. So, we captured a part of that ramp, we believe it is a small part, and we expect to capture the substantial part of that ramp in Q4. But keep in mind always when you compare year-on-year, we have different content levels from a year ago substantial as I pointed out. So, that my kind of confused the numbers somewhat.","But suffice to say, Q3 as we outlined since the beginning of the ramp may not be the same level of ramp if you compare to a year ago for the couple of reasons I mentioned. But we also see Q4 to even ramp up, even more substantially obviously because if Q3 is slower, it\u2019s more than likely Q4 in any product ramp would just show a stronger quarter compared to Q3. So, that said, but other -- the specifics really, I am not really at liberty to disclose it because we just don\u2019t go look that far out. As far as the trash talk you hear out there, seriously, we don\u2019t prefer to -- I prefer not to comment on that.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Craig Hettenbach","Thanks. I have just follow-up on Wireless on the content side. Can you give maybe a little bit of context, if you split kind of the legacy of Viago and RF relative to the Broadcom kind of connectivity and maybe touch piece?","Hock Tan","I am already stretching a lot to say, there is a certain North American customer. We have very good content to customer we daily value. I prefer not to give you any more details other than that. Thank you.","Craig Hettenbach","Okay. I\u2019ll try another one on the networking side. Can you talk about just the trajectory in the merchant silicon business and any new kind of customer adoptions or ramps to think about there?","Hock Tan","Well, we feel very good about our merchant silicon in switching and now routing as we call it, which is the DNX series and the Jericho, Jericho plus all the -- and we have launched that. And their use not just -- its routers, they use as aggregation switching in the spine. And so, it\u2019s a very good aggregation, solidly much cover in our merchant silicon even at the high performance, high competitive top of the rack switching. We pretty much cover a full range of requirements. And so that\u2019s going to alone very well. In fact, as of penetration especially in the cloud guys is very, very good. Adoption among the hyper-scale cloud guys is extremely strong, extremely well used. And well, all this is going on, some penetration and enterprise is happening. But here in enterprise tradition enterprise our fixed switch and routers continue to run very, very well through our OEM partners.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Ross Seymore","I just had a couple of questions on your Wired segment. One of the larger customers in their guided recently and although weaker than expected for their June quarter and talk about some weakness on the service provider side, so other than by product type, can you talk about customer types? Are you seeing any change in the customer behavior that undercover is within that mid-single-digit growth that you\u2019re talking about?","Hock Tan","No, we don\u2019t. We see in this third quarter, very good data center spending. And I said this, a lot of this -- I assume when you say service provider, you mean the cloud guys. And the cloud guys are very much focused on using merchant silicon on the switching and routing connectivity solutions. So -- and we see very strong spent, which is part of the reason why we are raising our sequential growth in Q3 from Q2 in Wired to be mid -- to up to mid-single digits. Off course, it also helped by the seasonal uptrend we\u2019re seeing in broadband access and set-top box, which is CPE. And that's because of the seasonality, but in some entirely that is also a switching and developing in datacenters. ","Ross Seymore","And as a follow-up still within that same segment on the broadband segment that you just talked about. Talk a little bit about DOCSIS 3.1 can mean for you. With that rolling out, is there a chance the things can be a little better than seasonal in your broadband business as we go ahead to the second half of the calendar year or are there offset that needed to appreciate?","Hock Tan","I never try to be too optimistic. At this time of the year -- at this time of the year, we see always the typical seasonality and by we seeing it now and bookings out Q3 and the beginning of Q4, very strong booking, but I'd like to consider that seasonality rather than unusual seasonality this is normal.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Amit Daryanani","Couple of questions from me as well, I guess to start off with, as you look at your operating margin target around 45%. You guys are 44.1 right now and I think Brocade loan ones closes get you north of that. So, how should we think about margins as you go forward? Is there a desire to keep ticking margins higher? Or do you think this price lasting for this market where you perhaps keep margins the way they are drive revenue grow faster?","Hock Tan","Well, you asked very complicated strategic question.","Amit Daryanani","We try to be specific.","Hock Tan","I know you do, very impressive question, but you won't get as impressive answer through I have to say that because all we are doing is, we sell based on the where you added we provide our very key customers specially what it is. And we believe, we deserve and get the value added we provide in our products to the solutions of our customers. And we think, it will drive us to 45% as a fairly, fairly decent way to get there.","Tom Krause","Amit, I get this point. We're not updating our financial model. We're not updating our operating margin targets. We're very comfortable at 45%.","Amit Daryanani","Fair enough. I guess, if I just follow up -- as I think of your gross margin guide for the upcoming quarter. You have a nice 6% uptick in sales but you\u2019re talking the gross margin being flat even though I think the headwind from Wireless not being up as much, should be a benefit. And lastly I think the gross margin up like 40 to 50 basis points in July. Why can\u2019t we see the same level of leverage given mix might be better this July versus last July?","Hock Tan","Well, we kind of give you what we see. We hit to meet focus guys as you probably know. So, we kind a give you something that we feeling very comfortable with and we are very comfortable at the midpoint of 63% which you're right, we achieved it last quarter. ","Tom Krause","And Amit, I think we're going to be able to sustain in around that number. I think you're right, there is some wireless mix with slightly headwind. We've also work through a lot of the Broadcom synergies and the benefits we receive there, but I think we planned to sustain that going forward.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Toshiya Hari","I had a question on the long-term revenue growth target. Obviously, you guys are committed to the mid-single-digit target that you put out a couple of quarters ago, but as you pointed out, you grew 18% in the quarter. If we take the mid-point of your July quarter guides, I think you guys have, with the quarter growing about 17%. I realize the growth rate and enterprise for example it\u2019s not necessarily sustainable, but what prevents to you from raising the target to say high-single-digits on a long-term basis?","Hock Tan","On a long-term basis, no, because don\u2019t forget -- the characters of our product guidance all 18 events even the 19 eventually locate. They are very sustainable, that\u2019s a single most important product like sustainable franchisees. I mean the deliver value added and you give delivering new generation of the generation. They\u2019re not there to grow like we, they\u2019re not. But it grows like GDP pretty much economic growth. We\u2019ve added for the fact that each generation provide further value added, which entitled us to have slight premium, but not much. And hence it\u2019s mid-single-digit, which is GDP but like premium. No more in debt and that is long-term sustainable basis because it\u2019s a nature of the products we invest in, nature of our business model.","What is seen now? I think is a short-term event, which is driven 18%, 17%, 18% as you mentioned year-on-year in Q2 from last year. It is driven by two part is my view on this matter. One is while the Q2 of a year ago, it\u2019s on because the Q2 this year is strong as much as a Q2 and there is only wireless was unusually weak for good reasons menu, which are not going to, but you all know that. And this quarter is more of a normal Q2, perhaps somewhat buttress by a strong launch of our Korean customer. But it\u2019s kind of stronger than we expect that as I mentioned. So, there is a \u2013 a big part of that double digit growth is wireless growth driving in and that\u2019s a 30% of our total revenues approximately.","So, it grows a lot, it has that impact. And the second part of it is on infrastructure, our business in Wired, Industrial and Enterprise Storage. This year 17, business is just strong. The pipe just rose and I think that the other part that drove this double-digit growth. But you don\u2019t see that every year. And I think this is fairly unusually strong for infrastructure, but from wireless infrastructure -- so that combination is what created 18% growth. I would not for a second like you guys to cling believe that this is something we will sustain for the next five years. What we feel comfortable, we can sustain for the next five years is what we have said before, and we\u2019ll continue to deliver, hopefully over the next 5 to 10 years, which is mid-single-digit growth on average year-after-year.","Toshiya Hari","Okay. Got it. Thank you. And then my follow-up, I just want to ask some follow-up question on M&A. And I realize the topic can be a little bit sensitive here. But Hock, you\u2019ve told us to not believe anything we read in the papers. Is it okay for us to walk away thinking that you're not making the bids for that specific asset? Or and again I think ask the gentlemen. ","Hock Tan","Let me reiterate, please do not believe anything you read and we do not comment on any rumors and pure speculations in the headline, but we continue to focus on our franchise stable business model. We have a lot of free cash flow.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Your line is now open. ","Harlan Sur ","Congratulations on the solid results and outlook and just great execution by the team. On the topic of free cash flow, you guys generated 32% free cash flow margins. If I normalize to your target of 3% CapEx, you guys actually did 35% free cash flow margins which is your target model. But I'm wondering despite the great cash generation, do you guys still have some restructuring acquisition related cash charges which would imply that the normalized free cash flow even now is better than what you printed and maybe to see if that's to quantify some of those cash restructuring charges?","Tom Krause","No, you're right you're doing your math absolutely right. The Company take into account the elevated CapEx for mostly the campus investments we're making that you're aware of and some incremental restructuring charges and frankly some working capital headwinds as the business continues to grow. You're quickly get to 35% in which is where we want to be and obviously when we it continue to put up those numbers going forward, but based on where we see revenues and gross margins and operating expenses that we outlined for you, we think that's achievable.","Harlan Sur","Great. And then so my follow-up question within Enterprise Storage, you guys have got a leadership position and server rate and SaaS controller solutions, and typically these products tend to track server shipments. So given Intel's Skylake server CPU launch and you've got AMD\u2019s Apex server CPU launch, both I think which are ramping now. Is this contributing to the growth during the July quarter and maybe through the second half of this calendar year?","Hock Tan","Not in the quarter we just entered Q2, and no necessarily march in the July quarter Q3, but certainly we expect probably which is the generation and you're talking about for Intel launching Skylake. The early generation and storage will start to ramp up. You're right back half of this calendar year, really back half of this calendar year. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. ","John Pitzer","Hock, I want to talk a little bit about the Wired results just for the April quarter. There is a lot of different businesses inside of Wired, but the 3% year-over-year growth rate I think is kind of the slowest growth rate that we've seen since the financial crisis. And so, I'm just kind a curious if you could give us a little bit of color as to what actually happened to the April quarter where there were strength and where there might have been some relative weakness? And then as you think about sort of the reacceleration into July maybe some color around segments within wired would be helpful as well?","Hock Tan","Wow, that's interesting and very confusing question. But let me try somewhat, and for the rest, I have to take it offline another time because there are a lot of moving parts. And you're correct, in our Wired segments we represent 60% of revenue we throw in the kitchen sink, no really, all related to Wired. That is actually a couple of chunks on broadband, which is broadband access, carrier access, as well as CPE set-top box. And in Q2, totally not that strong obviously, it starts ramping up seasonally Q3, Q4. So, there is that effect there is not that strong and year-on-year a year ago, a year ago result that was a Summer Olympics, so we\u2019re comparing against the Summer Olympics, which will make is touch. And in Q3, Q4, that\u2019s all Summer Olympics of last year should begin to look very good, which is what accelerate this in the second half.","In switching and routing, no, we continue to feel very, very good whether it\u2019s in ASIC or merchant silicon, off-take delivery shipment continue to hit all-time high in those two segments. I hope that gives you enough -- and then third thing that messes with up is, we\u2019re building block products by fines, retirements, which are more unique to the designs that\u2019s been used as well as fiber optic which has gone through very interesting direction and cycles, that means mess of the number. But the two broadest area, broadband compared with a year ago is on compared, because the Summer Olympics. But switching and routing, the SMA continues to be a very, very strong franchise whether it\u2019s in form of an ASIC or in the form of merchant silicon. Even though there are both selling into very end market and users.","John Pitzer","That\u2019s helpful. And Hock, maybe from my follow-up on the ASIC side, I sort of a different question. You\u2019ve always had a strong switching routing into business. It\u2019s my understanding there are also be a basic of things my guess is the controllers and perhaps the things like in trends deep learning. Just kind of curious, how do you think about the ASIC IP, the Broadcom has? Would you consider that franchise and is it leverageable into areas beyond just switching and routing?","Hock Tan","Yes. You hit it right on. We do did launch ASICs that need to customize, deep learning chips for specific customers. We do that because we have all the IP in the hardware. I mean that\u2019s keep in mind, I believe deep learning is very much as much a software play such more than the hardware play, but we are happy to enable therefore specific large customers in ASICs with customize hardware, which we use even right now and be training or in terms but we do that. Then on SSD controllers, yes, we do a huge amount of SSD controller relatively speaking across our follow, basically for enterprises only, not really enterprises, but all part and enterprise storage business. They are not part in our wide basis. That difference is being very well as you probably can get it to date.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Your line is now open.","Stacy Rasgon","First, I wanted to ask about the cash flow. So again, we can see the margins are pumping up, if you normalize close for 35%. What about the payout ratio? So the payout ratio still running around 5%, we\u2019re not close to 50. What stopping you from bringing it closer to 50 earlier? What\u2019s your trajectory or which you\u2019ll be thinking about the payout ratio?","Tom Krause","Yes. Stacy, I think, we reiterated a couple of quarters that going put in place the financial policy that we're going to evaluate that once a year at the end of our fiscal year so that will be in October November timeframe. We're going to look back over our last fiscal year look at that cash flow generation, look at the sustainability of the businesses that we're focused on and then make an assessment obviously with the board's approval around a recommendation. But what I want to reiterate is you're right as we continue to perform if we maintain that we could plan to do our 50% payout then that's going to lead to obviously an increased potentially increase in the dividend in the end of the year. ","Stacy Rasgon","So my follow-up, I want to pick the dead horse but, refresh us on your definition of a franchise. What are the characteristics of a business that meets that definition? And frankly, would it possible for a NAND Flash business to qualify as a franchise under your definition?","Hock Tan","Good try, okay, let me give you our definition of franchise which is very open and try to ask, give me try to repeat the mantra. No, a franchise basically is a - we grew only components, semiconductor components. And it's just components broadly simply that it operates -- the product lines operate in the niche. Doesn't have to be mess market, most time it's a niche. And so niche where is the way that markets have been established and will likely continue to be established for the foreseeable future. So, we must have established end markets that are sustainable, one. And in that niche, in that market we are the market leader. And more than a market leader especially because we are -- the reason for us to be the market leader, we are the technology leader. We have to have the IT. We have to have the technology and the capability to continue to lead in that particular market. And the third, there is something financials about it. The financial is a fallout, a corollary fallout from those key criteria. And each of our 18 product lines meet those criteria, you made your own call whether NAND meets that criteria.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Shrivastava with BMO. Your line is now open.","Ambrish Shrivastava ","I wanted to go back to your Wired franchise, Hock. You have talked about and this is a follow-up to John Pitzer's question. With regard to newer areas and all within the umbrella of the 5% that you've articulated for the, quite well over the last couple of years. Is this something that this is a one off that you've done or do you see this as a broader volume with multiple customers as you go through the year and next year?","Hock Tan","Would you repeat that Pal. I might have missed some part of your question. Would you repeat that?","Ambrish Shrivastava ","Okay, the deep learning ASIC that you\u2019re rolling out. Is it a one-off for one customer or do you see this expanding to multiple customers?","Hock Tan","It\u2019s an -- that is learning product, we're doing for multiple customers today are all customized solutions, hardware solutions on outside. They\u2019re not software-based solutions. We are -- it falls into our ASIC category. And we have all-time intellectual property all luckily hardware-based like SerDes, much more than SerDes memories, you name it all kind of stuff that goes into training and inferences on a deep learning chip. We have all that IP, but only doing hardware. We make no pretensions we\u2019re trying to make it our full solution. So within ASIC solution and covers multiple customers and it probably covers multiple generations going forward. But it\u2019s really simply an ASIC solution.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri with Macquarie Securities. Your line is now open.","Srini Pajjuri ","Thank you. Hock, I just want to ask clarifying question to the previous answer. Some of your peers are putting this market opportunity and close to $30 billion. I just want to hear your thoughts of how big the ASIC opportunity for deep learning in European it is like to take maybe a three-year view on this?","Hock Tan","I have no clue to be honest. Seriously, no -- it is -- our franchise here is the intellectual property, capability, we have of implementing silicon solutions that does deep learning. We produce as well have the IP implemented to do high performance computing or as we do now a lot of switching and routing. This we do in deep learning. And for us, deep learning is not seen necessarily as a franchise. It\u2019s our ASIC capability that is a franchise.","Srini Pajjuri ","Got it. And then I know you said, you don\u2019t want to comment on your competitors trash talk, but if you could maybe comment on in terms of your BAW performance, I think historically the reason, you have just significant share was you had a significant performance advantage over your competitors. I\u2019m just trying to understand, if some of your peers are close in the gap or at least narrowing the gap and as we look out the next couple of years. Just want to understand, how much advantage you still have in BAW?","Hock Tan","Remember, my definition of a sustainable franchise. We don\u2019t talk investments, I mean contrary to myths out there. We are join every time, we quick public product line as our core product line as among the \u201918. We invest as much as we have to maintain, it\u2019s not lengthen our need. No different yet, we don\u2019t say put at the generation of last year, or two years ago, or three years ago, we continue invest the lead that we direct review never closes. And that\u2019s the key fund of our model. We will invest and given that your market leader in that niche, we can\u2019t afford to out invest anyone out there. We\u2019ve been in R&D for even better and as you know in totality, some of it packed up in cost of sales or product engineering as we bring it to production. The rest of it in R&D, we spend on product development in this company every year $3 billion and that something from CapEx, $3 billion. And we are very, very conscious of the fact that we have to maintain is not even increase that level of spending where we need to in specific areas to ensure that we are the leader both in technology which leads to market leader. So not that easy to narrow but leads is to in terms of coming to compete with us. ","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Steven Chen with UBS. Your line is now open.","Steven Chen","Hock, if I could I wanted to follow up your earlier comments on storage, your storage business and the guidance for stable demand again in this fiscal third quarter. I was wondering if you're looking back earlier this year when the storage business was seeing better than NAND because some of the storages in NAND Flash and [indiscernible]. I was wondering, if your customers are providing you a much commentary around whether the current hard drive demand, is in line with broader demand or for total come in that NAND as the shortages that are helping hard drive demand?","Hock Tan","It's a very hard market to predict at this point, because there are a lot of multiple dynamics going on in terms of it's not just about Flash demand being an outreaching very high levels, which is driving everything else probably is but into that was probably late '16 early '17. Today I guess all this big all this increased prices in memory whether its DRAM flash is not hard drives as part of the DRAM and flash is leading to careful spending by enterprises and operators and cloud guys and datacenter. They're all been very careful. So suddenly you have demand that is there, that is needed but people are not spending.","And you will have this stop and spot going on. So it's all very confusing it's all I'm trying to come to get on. And I'm not sure we have as much and embedded on we have any better visibility even our customers. Our customers have better visibility on their nerves for that manner. It's just very confusing and all we can see is that demand has strengthened out for our products be the SSDs or be the SSD flash control as I should clarify or be the components -- and -- for hard disk drive.","All we see is that a quarter ago we are seeing but we got to be careful about Q3. Well, Q2 is -- and gone Q2 was good, Q3 continues to look good, but then on doing -- say Q4 in many case we don't, with strong booking Q4 but it may not be a strong and a big part of their uncertainty and lies in fact that they're more than just simply a shortage of flash or DRAM that's creating this uncertainty. I think it's much more than that, it's also the change in spending pattern even in a short term of datacenter guys, cloud guys and enterprises because of higher memory prices. ","Steven Chen","Okay. I appreciate that consideration and I just had a quick follow up for your wireless connectivity business. And then much of Fab revenue is still driven by mobile type applications. So I was wondering how meaningful is your exposure to enterprise type at this point today and any exposure and like where the hot spots potentially going forward? Thanks.","Hock Tan","There are. There are as far as I can potentially describe is broadband carrier exchange are increasingly even set-top-box which includes set-top-box both CPE that is as well as central office are starting to spread Wi-Fi as another means. You have GPON, EPON, you have DSL, VDSL. Now, WiFi into the picture. So it\u2019s all good and we are very, very well position in all this and going to generation. So, it is giving us more content to be put it this way at every access point which may help the growth. But it\u2019s still not a big by the way as the phone by comparison the volume. But it\u2019s a decent amount of volume and gives us a very sustainable franchise in this area.","Tom Krause","Yes. And even this is just housekeeping but that business, while product line is in our Wireline segment, not in our wireless segment.","Hock Tan","Thank you for clarifying. Yes, it sits in Wired, not in Wireless.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes Broadcom\u2019s conference call for today.

Please go ahead, sir.","Ashish Saran","Thank you, Operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are Hock Tan, President and CEO; and Tom Krause, Chief Financial Officer of Broadcom Limited. After market close today, Broadcom distributed a press release and financial tables describing our financial performance for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. If you did not receive a cope, you may obtain the information from the Investor section of Broadcom\u2019s website at www.broadcom.com.","This conference call is being webcast live and a recording will be made available via telephone playback for one week. It will also be archived in the Investor section of our website at broadcom.com.","During the prepared comments section of this call, Hock and Tom will be providing details of our first quarter year 2017 results, background to our second quarter fiscal year 2017 outlook, and some commentary regarding the business environment. We will take questions after the end of our prepared comments.","In addition to U.S. GAAP reporting, Broadcom reports certain financial measures on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the tables attached to today\u2019s press release. Comments made during today\u2019s call will primarily refer to are non-GAAP financial results.","Please refer to our press release today and our recent filings with the SEC for information on the specific risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over the Hock Tan. Hock?","Hock Tan","Thank you, Ashish. Good afternoon everyone. Well, we delivered strong financial results for the first quarter with revenue of $41.5 billion and gross margin at 62.4%, both at a very top end of our guidance.","Earnings per share of $3.63 grew by 5% sequentially, while net revenue was essentially flat. Revenue was better than expected in all four segments. The benefits we achieved through business diversification clearly came through this quarter with growth in Wired, Enterprise Storage, and Industrial completely offsetting the typical negative seasonality from Wireless.","The integration of classic Broadcom has gone very well and is now mostly complete. We remain focused on driving financial performance towards our long-term operating margin and free cash flow targets.","Let me now turn to a discussion of our segment results, starting with Wired, our largest segment. In the first quarter, Wired revenue came in at $2.09 billion better than expected and represented 50% of our total revenue. Revenue for this segment was up slightly on a sequential basis, benefited from strong demand for Ethernet Switching and Routing products from cloud data center operators.","This growth was partially offset by the continuing seasonal decline in demand for our broadband carrier access and set-top box products, which we expect to bottom in this first quarter.","Turning to the second fiscal quarter, we forecast Wired revenue experience sequential growth a little bit stronger than what we saw in the prior quarter. We expect the momentum from cloud data center demand to sustain and expect a seasonal increase in demand for our broadband access and set-top box products.","Now moving on to Wireless. In the first quarter, Wireless revenue came in at about $1.18 billion, better than expect and Wireless segment represented 28% of our total revenues. Revenue for this core segment was down 13% sequentially, driven by the expected seasonal decline in demand from a major North American customer.","Turning now to our projection for the second quarter fiscal of 2017, we expect to hit the bottom of annual product cycle transition at a major North American customer. However, we expect to offset a significant portion of this decline in Wireless from a ramp of the next generation phone as our large Korean smartphone customer. This phone comes with an increase in Broadcom's RF and Wi-Fi connectivity content. As a result, we expect our Wireless revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 to be still sequentially down, but in the high single-digits better than the more typical double-digit declines we have experienced in prior years.","Let me now turn to Enterprise Storage, which continues to be strong. In the first quarter, Enterprise Storage revenue came in at $707 million and this segment represented 17% of our total revenue.","Segment revenue grew 26% sequentially, gaining better than expected driven by stronger shipments of SAS, RAID, and Fiber Channel products. As we foresaw, our hard disk drive and custom solid state drives controllers also had a very strong quarter.","And looking into the second quarter, however, we believe this resurgence of Enterprise Storage has to taper off and hence flatten out. Having said that, backlog for Enterprise Storage products continues up to today to be very strong.","But we foresaw what we foresee seasonality to start slowing demand in the third quarter if not in this -- late in the second quarter.","Finally, turning to our last segment, Industrial. In the first quarter, Industrial revenue grew -- came in at $180 million, up 11% sequentially better than expected as we rebuild depleted channel inventory consistent with stronger product resales.","The industrial segment represented 5% of our total revenue and as we look into the second quarter, we are anticipating industrial activity to continue to improve seasonally and accordingly, we are expecting industrial segment revenue to increase by high single-digits sequentially.","With all that to sump-up -- to simply sum-up, this second quarter was strong, revenue flat from the seasonally high fourth quarter of the preceding year. As we know look into the second quarter, we expect this demand environment for our products to continue to be very healthy and our outlook for this quarter's revenue to be virtually flat to that of the prior quarter.","It is becoming evident that our broader and more diversified product portfolio has largely mitigated seasonal impacts to consolidated revenue during the first half of the year. This is certainly an intrinsic goal of our business model just that we did not expect to achieve these so soon. The integration of classic Broadcom is clearly going well and we continue to invest across all our franchise products. We are sustaining our technology leadership and our products are very well received by our customers.","Our revenue trajectory from the first half of fiscal 2017 could possibly extend into the second half. Nonetheless, we do not expect that the approximate 15% level of year-on-year growth we are guiding for the second quarter to really be sustainable in the long-term. Our long-term operating model will continue to assume mid-single-digit annual revenue growth for the consolidated business.","With that let me now turn the call over to Tom for detailed review our first quarter fiscal 2017 financials.","Tom Krause","Thank you, Hock, good afternoon everyone. My comments today will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results from continuing operations unless otherwise specifically noted. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP data is included with the earnings release issued today that is available on our website at Broadcom.com.","Let me first start out by saying that we are very pleased with the execution this quarter and specifically the progress we've made towards our long-term target model, which remains an operating margin target of 45% of net revenue and a free cash flow margin above 35% of net revenue.","Further to what Hock was saying, we also believe that we can achieve these long-term operating targets based on a sustainable long-term revenue growth rate of mid-single-digits.","Now, let me review the Q1 results. Revenue for the quarter came in at $4.15 billion, approximately flat sequentially. Foxconn was greater than 10% direct customer in the first fiscal quarter.","Our first quarter gross margin from continuing operations was 62.4%, about 90 basis points above the midpoint of guidance, primarily due to revenue at the top end of guidance and a slightly better product mix.","This quarter's gross margin also benefitted from the impact of approximately $60 million of revenue related to the assignment of certain manufacturing rights to a customer in our Wired segment, which is included in our original guidance.","Turning to OpEx, R&D expenses were $664 million and SG&A expenses were $120 million. This resulted in total operating expenses for the first quarter of $784 million, or 18.9% of net revenue.","As Hock mentioned, we have not largely completed the integration of classic Broadcom and I would reiterate that we feel comfortable at this level of operating expenses relative net revenue.","Operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $1.8 billion and represented 43.5% of net revenue. Provision for taxes came in at $77 million, slightly above our guidance. This was primarily due to higher than expected net income.","First quarter interest expense of $110 million and other income net was $8 million. First quarter net income was $1.63 billion and earnings per diluted share were $3.63. Our share-based compensation expense in the first quarter was $201 million.","Moving on to the balance sheet, our days sales outstanding were 43 days, a decrease of five days from the prior quarter due to better linearity of revenue in the quarter. Our inventory ended at $1.34 billion, a decrease of $64 million from the beginning of the quarter.","We generated $1.35 billion in operational cash flow, which reflected the impact of approximately $313 million for annual employee bonus payments for fiscal year 2016 and approximately $80 million of cash expended on classic Broadcom restructuring integration activities including discontinued operations.","I'm very pleased that in the first quarter, the business already demonstrated the ability to generate free cash flow close to our long-term target model of 35%, while free cash flow in the first quarter was $1 billion approximately or only 25% of net revenue. This does include I want to highlight the impact from the annual employee cash bonus payment as well as cash restructuring expenses and capital expenditures that as we discussed before running higher than our long-term targets.","Looking forward, we expect classic Broadcom related restructuring expenses to continue to decrease as we finish this integration.","Capital expenditure in the first quarter was $325 million or 7.8% of net revenue. However, we expect long-term CapEx largely to fabless semiconductor company to run at about 3% of net revenue consistent with that fabless business model.","As a reminder for full fiscal year 2017, we expect CapEx to run at an elevated level of approximately $1.2 billion. This includes about $500 million towards campus construction, primarily at our Irvine and San Jose locations and about $200 million towards purchasing of test equipment to consignment at our CMs.","A total of $431 million in cash was spent on company dividend and partnership distribution payments in the first quarter. We ended the first quarter with a cash balance of approximately $3.5 billion.","Now let me turn to non-GAAP guidance for the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions and we do not intend to update this guidance. This guidance is for results from continuing operations only.","Net revenue is expected to be $4.1 billion plus or minus $75 million. Gross margin is expected to be 62%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. Operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $789 million. Tax provision is forecasted to be approximately $74 million. Net interest expense and other is expected to be approximately $106 million.","The diluted share count forecast is for 452 million shares. Share-based compensation expense will be approximately $223 million. CapEx will be approximately $290 million. And you have seen, our Board has declared a dividend of $1.02 per share to be paid later in the second fiscal quarter.","We're also looking forward to completing the acquisition of Brocade, which is proceeding as planned and we presently expect to close this transaction in our third quarter of fiscal 2017. I'm pleased that we're able to reach an agreement with ARRIS earlier this quarter for the sale of Brocade's network edge business for $800 million in cash plus the additional cost of unvested employee stock awards.","Following Brocade's recent results, we continue to feel very comfortable that Brocade's Fiber Channel San Switching business, the key business that we're focused on will generate approximately $900 million of EBITDA in fiscal 2018.","That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Your first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.","Ross Seymore","Hey guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I guess Hock the first question is on the Wireless side. It's good to see the content rising at other customers besides just your big North American customer; can you talk a little bit more detail about what's driving that content up? Is there anything unique or is it basically the same goodness that you've seen in the North America side? And any more color about that goodness continuing on the North America side into the second half of this year would also be helpful. Thanks.","Hock Tan","Yes, Ross thanks for the question. Yes, it's -- in fact it's a phenomenon we have been indicating to you guys for the last several years which is over the medium term -- long-term, I would say, our strength of franchise in cellular and our RF cellular analog, the front end cellular analog, which includes FBAR and power amplifiers and all the circuitry and component that goes in front of the transceiver in the handset for cellular. That's one area and the other area in Wi-Fi Bluetooth connectivity.","Those two functionality, those two features in phones continue to evolve and with each generation. And as each generation evolves, when it involves, in the case of RF cellular is two-fold. One is basically more band as we progress -- as more and more countries globally progress into 4G and eventually even further beyond that.","More and more bands -- spectral bandwidths get pulled into the fold and number of skills of phones get less and less for any major OEM manufacturer simply because of complexity of these phones. And so because of more bands, it requires more filters, more components like power amplifiers -- low noise amplifiers and because of that necessary content increases.","I should also add the difficulty of engineering those products increased fairly exponentially, which therefore drives towards better and better content for us into those very high-end flagship smartphones.","In the case of wireless connectivity, the same phenomenon is happening and it's particularly driven on bandwidth on the peer [ph] throughput as we move from -- what we gradually move from what used to be much lower bandwidth in Wi-Fi to today's AC.","As we move from to single users to multiple users and as we move next generation from AC into AX and further. Obviously, difficulty of doing those products in smartphones become correspondingly more difficult, content increases and we benefit from basically content increase. It's a normal phenomenon and we expect to see that continuing into the medium term.","Ross Seymore","Great, that's helpful. I guess for my one follow-up, both you and Tom, Hock, mentioned about the 15% growth not being your long-term assumption. Just wondering why you are bringing that up? Is there something you're seeing now that gives you pause that things are going to slow down or is this just a reminder that the level we are now is not the base assumption in your business model?","Hock Tan","I think the fairest way to answer that is we have articulated last fiscal year very clearly and even a year ago when we acquired Broadcom, as long as a year ago, that we were scaled and we were diversification of product portfolio.","Our long-term model, out five years, 10 years is a compounded annual growth of 5%. Not every year necessarily, but long-term 5%. And why we feel the need to mention it is obviously you saw the numbers we were guiding for Q2 on the topline and they're showing 15% year-on-year from a year ago. That's just one quarter and obviously just one fiscal year, one point in time.","So, we felt it necessary to just mention it that do not just take it and extrapolate it to say that we have move away from our broad model on guidance of 5% compounded annual growth in the long term to a 15%, far from it.","Tom Krause","And Ross, I mean just to add -- I also want to reiterate, we don't believe we need to have this accelerated revenue growth to hit our financial targets which we remain very focused on, specifically the free cash flow margins at 35%. We're very comfortable achieving those results based on a more normalized long-term CAGR of mid-single-digits.","Ross Seymore","Very well. Congrats on those results. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays.","Blayne Curtis","Hey guys thanks for taking my question and congrats on the great results. Just following-up on the Wireless guide, you've talked in the past sometimes it can be seasonal down 15%, 20% to the high single-digits. Just curious between contents and the units, what are you seeing with your two large customers in terms of the seasonality and the timing of the ramp magnitude versus the content gains you're seeing?","Hock Tan","To be -- I don't have specific data between to be able to speed out accurately between units and content, but off the cuff, my sense is it's largely content.","Blayne Curtis","Okay. And then you mentioned strength in switching, I was curious obviously you don't want to -- for a full year, I was just curious you talked about some businesses being soft in the second half. There's obviously a big upgrade cycle that's 2500G. Just curious your perspective as you look at the rest of the year the trajectory of the switch business?","Hock Tan","That's a very interesting question and on the switching side, which is a subset, obviously, of our Wired segment, which is our largest segment, but just if you look at our switching and routing sites, fair way to put it together, which is really data center networking business, we continue to see strength through the rest of the year.","We see -- a big part of that strength we see is simply because of a very strong data center demand -- data center buildup by the cloud operators. We're seeing that now and I suspect that phenomenon will still continue, particularly when we start to ramp-up newer generation with high-bandwidth of Tomahawks and Tridents and as we go later part in the year of our DMX router and aggregation switches.","So, we see that and this momentum to be fairly good based on demand -- intrinsic demand out there in data center expansion, especially into the cloud, but also from the fact that we're launching a few very key new products in this year.","Blayne Curtis","Thanks.","Hock Tan","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Harlan Sur with JP Morgan.","Harlan Sur","Good afternoon and thank you for taking my question and it's great to see the diversity in the business playing out here. On the strong growth in the storage business that I'm assuming some of this is your SSD product lines; I believe you guys are supplying Enterprise SSD controllers into the top two enterprising cloud SSD suppliers. And I think your top customer here just grew their Enterprise SSD business I think 20% sequentially and 20% year-over-year in the December quarter. Wondering if you guys are seeing similar growth trends? And do you expect double-digit growth in the SSD segment for the full year?","Hock Tan","I'll be [Indiscernible] our visibility in the SSDs are not as good as perhaps our customers are. A big part of it is there are three parts to our Enterprise Storage, three broad parts, one is very related to storage server connectivity, that's the rate part and the Fiber Channel whole part side of it rate. And then there is the components we ship into hard disk drives. And hard disk drive has experience as you well know a strong surge over the last several months probably because flash have been in short supply.","And the last and smallest part of our business in Enterprise Storage is really related to Enterprise flash controllers for SSD. And that's really a small part. So, we don't get that broad visibility into this SSD market as a lot of other people would. But you're, right now, it's very, very strong and especially in SAS.","Harlan Sur","Great. Thanks for the insights there. And then off of the success of Tomahawks and I also hear that your prior generation Trident is still very strong as well and the team is ramping into this upgrade cycle, but you started sampling Tomahawk II, I think it was second half of last year. Can you just give us an update on the qualification, customer feedback, and when should we see the adoption curve for T2 starting to ramp, is that going to be kind of 2018 timeframe?","Hock Tan","For very competitive reasons I really hate to give you specifics here. Suffice to say it's very well received. We have a lot of momentum on our entire switch portfolio. And by the way as Tomahawk doesn't fully replace Trident, Trident is using a different segment versus Tomahawk and both are going very well as are the Jericho products, which are more aggregation switching and routing.","So, broadly our portfolio of -- from high end down to even low range -- on the low-end range of switching -- campus switching pointers [ph], those are all going very well. And I suspect it's all largely due to the strength in data center spending that still receive continue, particularly more recently since we had very strong conversion of Enterprises into the cloud.","Harlan Sur","Thanks Hock.","Operator","Your next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust.","William Stein","Great. Thanks so much for taking my question and congrats on the very strong results and outlook. I wanted to address the free cash flow margin trajectory. Tom I think you referred to some of this in your prepared remarks, but I'd like you to maybe highlight what aside from the restructuring expenses that are still being paid and the temporarily higher CapEx that you are experiencing, what are the other drivers to get you to the 35% free cash flow margin? And what sort of timing should we think about for that?","Tom Krause","William good question and I think that's sort of the point of the prepared remarks. And if you look at where we are from an operating margin perspective, you look at the fact we restructured the balance sheet around now fixed rate debt. If you look at our sustainable tax rate of 4.5% and cash taxes of approximately $100 million a quarter and you take out the restructuring costs, which are bleeding off here pretty quickly, you take out the one-time campus initiative, the one-time tester initiative this year which will sort of play itself out over the next couple of quarters. Frankly, we're largely there. And that's probably the real takeaway and of course that doesn't take into account what we would expect to be the second half seasonally up trends from a revenue perspective.","William Stein","It's helpful. Appreciate it. Maybe one more. Something that came up last quarter was the change in capital allocation strategy. Maybe you can sort of highlight for us your plans on the M&A front from here despite the higher dividend -- the significantly higher free cash flow that you are going to be generating I guess after these temporary expenses falloff would seem to meet to continue to support a good M&A pipeline. Maybe you can characterize for us please?","Tom Krause","Yes, I mean there's no real uptick there other than we outlined very clearly that we're going to continue to drive given back 50% of free cash flows to investors in the form of dividends, which, of course, at these levels, would imply that we're going to have the ability to continue to increase the dividend pretty meaningfully here over the next couple of years certainly.","Beyond that we've used M&A to drive returns, obviously, over the last several years pretty effectively. We continue to see opportunities to do that. Brocade is the latest example of being able to put capital work and an interesting opportunity that drives better returns than our alternative. So, we're going to continue to do that, but given our scale, we have the opportunity to do that mostly off the balance sheet, particularly with smallest opportunities that arise.","William Stein","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.","Vinay Jaising","Hello, this is Vinay Jaising calling in for Craig. Thanks for giving the opportunity to ask the question. So, I wanted touch upon carrier aggregation, like this is one of the key growth drivers for RF business. Hock, can you provide us an update on the trends you're seeing by geography for that? And what that means for your portfolio?","Hock Tan","Okay. Carrier aggregation as you well know is the phenomenon of especially benefiting operators who have multiple spectral bandwidth, not necessarily one but multiple, and interest of reducing CapEx infrastructure is the phenomenon of enabling those bandwidths to max together into one, which creates much more capacity throughput and that's not only in infrastructure, it goes into the phone.","And we are probably one of the leading enablers in the phone of making that happen simply because not just of architectural design of the cellular RF analog, but also the fact that FBAR filters which are FBAR, are much better performing and more integral -- have been able to integrate it into a module to allow of that maxing and de-maxing separate spectral bands.","And that's happening. It started very aggressively obviously in China continuing to be very much so in China. It's also happening very aggressively in the U.S. Those are the two biggest geographies where a lot of that is happening, started with downlink last year, I think, and it's now moving on to up-linking, not just downlinking, which, of course, then part of reason why it's helping create -- not the only reason, but one of the reasons creating increased content in a cellular RF demand. So, it's great for us and we see that phenomenon continuing to grow and expand into other regions of the world.","Vinay Jaising","Got it, that's helpful. And for my follow-up, I want to touch upon gross margins. Pretty good performance in gross margin during the quarter and the guidance, but I was thinking about how should we think about gross margins for here? And if you can outline like what are the top two drivers of gross margin expansion as we look out towards rest of fiscal 2017?","Hock Tan","Okay. Well, it's a very interesting point and as we -- if you look back to a year ago when we just closed the Broadcom transaction every quarter since then, we have been able to expand our gross margin in the range of roughly 40, 50 basis points sequentially.","A big part of it is as we settle down the portfolio, as we start to get the benefit of larger scale in purchasing materials and as very specific actions like taking -- basically bringing testing very much in-house and consigning testers to contract manufacturers instead of leasing test time for our huge volume of semiconductor chips.","All those various actions -- a lot of a big part of this expansion of gross margin comes from a scale and ability to leverage on the scale in direct materials. It also helps that our product margin as we move from one generation to the other, keeps getting richer in terms of the mix. So, that's a combination of those two things.","And in terms of where will it go from here? Frankly, I don't know. Best indicator is probably to look at history.","Vinay Jaising","Got it, that's helpful, and congrats once again on a good quarter.","Hock Tan","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.","Stacy Rasgon","Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. For my first one you've talked a lot about free cash flow margins, but I wanted to dig a little bit into the payout ratio. You are paying out right now about a little over 30%, target is 50%. Should we think about that sort of level going up to 50% in line with the margins going up to 35% or more? Or like how should we think about the trajectory of reaching your target on the payout ratio that seems like something that's more in your control maybe even quicker than the margins themselves?","Tom Krause","Well, they kind of go hand-in-hand Stacy. I think what we're going to do and so articulate in the past is we're going to get to the end of the fiscal year, we're going to look back at the free cash flow trajectory on those margins over the course of that previous year. We're going to look at the business; obviously, we're very focused on sustainability. And then we're going to pay out 50%.","And so all you are seeing is the general trajectory improving from where we exited last year to where we are here exiting Q1 and guiding Q2. And you're right consistent with the policy as we get to the end of the year where we will achieve expectations that we're going to have -- obviously be in the position to raise that dividend consistent with getting back 50% on an LTM basis.","Stacy Rasgon","Got it. Thank you. That's helpful. For my follow-up I also wanted to dig into gross margins a little bit. You talked a little bit about the drivers, but I heard you say earlier that you're sort of comfortable with your level of OpEx spending as a percentage of revenue, which implies that the operating margin improvement toward the model from here comes from gross margins, but it's not that much, only about 150, maybe 200 basis points from where we are.","And this is even before you buy Brocade, which comes in at gross margins in the 70s. so, given all the levers that you just talk about and Brocade coming in, why should 64%, 65%, which is where that would take you -- why should that be the upper limit? Like how should we think about this if we're going farther, I don't see any reason why shouldn't expect gross margins to go even higher than that unless there something else -- mix or something else that ought to be taking it down. Can you talk about that a little bit?","Tom Krause","Well, Stacy, it's -- actually I think we're going to get into the gross margin where we think we can go and if I go all the way back to the original Avago first margins in the 30s, obviously we're always focused on continuing to improve on our gross margin.","I think the second part of the question is we are in our seasonally weak part of the year and so when you do look at the general seasonality of the business and where things are, I think you could take a whole fiscal year approach to looking at where operating margins will land and could land and apply that to how you're thinking about the model. That's the only guidance I'd give you.","Stacy Rasgon","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","Vivek Arya","Thank you for taking my question. Congratulations on the good results and the consistent execution. For my first one, Hock, your Wired business has essentially been in the $2 billion to $2.1 billion range for the past year on a quarterly basis. Can you give us some puts and takes on what's done well, what's been different than expectations? Because my rate is that the switching parts has probably done fairly well with all the cloud opportunities, but your broadband access and set-top boxes has perhaps not done so well.","But then on the prepared remarks you mentioned you are starting to see a little bit of a pick up on the broadband access side. So, just if you could give us a look back on what was different than expectations? And then as we look forward to this year, could we see contribution from both parts of Wired -- both the cable side as well as the switching side?","Hock Tan","That's a very interest -- good question actually, very insightful and let me try to explain it on our Wired business. You're right, it's our biggest segment and in simple terms broadly, there are two groups of products here and end markets. There's switching and routing, you correctly put out and that come from various fronts from standard switching and routing, as well ASICs, which is also part in there, as would be building block products as well as fiber optics components.","That business is very Enterprise driven directly and has actually done very well even on a year-on-year -- especially on a year-on-year basis because it's growing as we move from 10-gigabit few years ago -- couple of years ago, to increasingly 25 and 100 coming out very fast. As that transition happens very fast, obviously it's driving and you always hear products like Trident going to Tomahawk, especially in the very high end and at Jericho. All these are related to data center switching and that's very, very -- that's driving growth on all infrastructure on a very stable basis, but driving growth very nicely close to high single-digits, even double-digits.","Then the other part of the segment, which is pretty big too, is our broadband. And here the set-top box on the CP side and access gateways like DSL\/PON on the infrastructure side. And here the business is stable; it's very stable, has been stable for the last couple -- few years and continues to be very stable and it's also very seasonal.","And you will see that the later part of second half of the year is typically when it drives up and in the first half of the year is when it shows a seasonal decline. Hence in my opening remarks, I was mentioning that Q1 -- fiscal Q1 is probably a very seasonal low point and it gradually picks up seasonally later part of Q2, but certainly Q3, and then starts rolling over again, but if you look at it year-on-year, relatively very stable.","So, we have a confluence of two segments mixed together in our Wired business which is what you're seeing. It dilutes basically the strength, the growth of switching and routing, but nonetheless, both are very franchise product, very franchise business and drives stability in this company.","Vivek Arya","Thanks Hock. And as my follow-up question, it's a somewhat longer term question. You're obviously doing quite well in the Wireless business and that can continue for some time. The cloud business is also doing quite well. But when I talk with a lot of your peers and ask them about growth in semis over the next three to five years, they talk about connected cars or Internet of Things, or machine learning, or 5G.","Do you beer Broadcom is investing adequately to pursue those markets? Is there a part of the company that is looking at those longer term areas? Or do you think M&A is the better way to address some of those things as they become real over time? Thank you.","Hock Tan","Great question. Giving the opportunity to expand a little propaganda here, again, as we've already articulated. The franchise products we're in, the -- we are the technology; we are also the market leader in those areas. In those niches, some of them are very large niche, but we are the technology leader and we don't get there by not investing. We invested, as my remarks said and I said many times, very heavily in those areas we are in. We develop products that generally in those franchise areas before anybody else do it out there.","And that's why we can sustain it, that's why our margins are the way it is because we provide products that allow our customers to differentiate and innovate themselves. So, we invest very heavily and you look at our total R&D, we invest in total $2.7 billion a year as a company in R&D. We're the best engineers out there; we have the best products in this area.","So, that's really where we continue to sustain leadership in our existing franchise products. In some of those flights of fantasy somewhat that you covered earlier, we're not -- I'm not saying it won't happen. I will be direct, let somebody else take another hits and then we'll buy the company if it's successful. Thank you.","Vivek Arya","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from [Indiscernible] with Goldman Sachs.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the strong quarter. I had one short-term question and then another longer term question. On the short-term question, with regards to Wireless, you talked about trends at you're Korean customer offsetting the seasonal trends at you're North American customer and therefore you are guiding Q2 to be down only high single-digits relative to history being down about 15%, I recall.","Is the upside versus historical seasonality, is that all coming from dynamics at you're Korean customer or dynamics in terms of units or content at your North American customer trending better than history as well?","Hock Tan","You are really trying to pass the data, aren't you? It's all a combination really. It is -- and you obviously know out there it's also timing of some of the shipments and purchases by our two largest customers.","So, there's a bunch of -- a few factors involved in here. One of which was there's timing this quarter differences in timing. There's the fact that you're right, Korean customer is coming in with a vengeance to try to recover share. And broadly, we're also talking about content increases as each new generation comes in and it's not even the Korean customer it's also the major North American customer.","And it's a mix of all these factors. Have I sat down and broken it out in detail? No. We don't try to analyze it to that in degree, but those multiple factors mix pull together to basically indicate that the seasonality -- the downward seasonality that we saw a year ago is perhaps less pronounced this year.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. That's helpful. And then as my follow-up, another question on Wireless, specifically around China. Obviously, you're tied to the North American customer and the Korean customer in a big way today, but when you think about your Wireless business and your RF business specifically, on say a three-year view, how do you think about the opportunity in China today?","Hock Tan","Well, there are opportunities for us in China, and -- but the focus of our success and our product success in Wireless, especially content increases year-on-year is -- as you know, we push the cutting edge on technology. Be it wireless Wi-Fi connectivity or RF cellular, we push the envelope and that tends to go very much largely to the flagship class phones.","That top of the pyramid where a big part of it has been our major North American customer and Korean customer, plus a few other guys spread around. That's where our strength is, that's where the demand and value seen our products can have.","As China evolve over time, having said that, the opportunity exists, they will move from feature phones to low-end smartphones to now some premium phones. And we begin to get traction on even those premium phones to the extent that those brands in China use it, and that's why we need the technological engineering edge that we provide in the products.","Until then, they need less of it. Except -- with exceptions like carrier aggregation when we obviously are the leader in providing solutions for carrier aggregation on a discrete basis. But on an integrated basis into smartphones, it's really the flagship phones and now increasingly premium phones making its way into flagship phones that we see the demand. And that transition is happening in China, albeit, on a very gradual basis, but we're very patient people, we'll wait for it.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John Pitzer","Yes, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for sneaking me and congratulations. Hock, my first question is kind of a follow-up on the Enterprise Storage side. You rightfully pointed out that today, the SSD controller businesses is the smallest part of that business. I'm kind pf curious as you look out over time, do you see that market developing similar and potentially getting to be the size of the HDD controller market?","Or is there something inherent about the growing complexity of raw NAND itself, which means there will always be a large portion of that controller market which is insourced, the guys building demand actually building their own controller. Do you think eventually you will end up in situation where it's all outsourced?","Hock Tan","That's a very insightful question and we see the SSD controllers for Enterprise to be a lot of it will be outsourced. Why? Because there are certain IP inherent in those Enterprise flash controllers that are very tricky to do. Not dissimilar from the re-channel of hard disk drives, so that will happen.","[Indiscernible], because the nature of [Indiscernible], it's not so complex technology, IP required is not so extreme. We see that as probably less opportunistic for us, though one never knows. But certainly on Enterprise, which is where we are very focused on, we see a lot of need for intellectual property blocks features that few people can do. And we are one of those few people who can do it very well.","John Pitzer","That's helpful. And then, Hock, as my follow-up, I think a lot of us in the investment community understand the Wireless, both on the RF and on the connectivity side, the content ASP story. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about that same dynamic in your Wired business. And maybe differentiate between switching and routing versus set-top box and broadband access? How do we think about the ASP trends in those two segments over time? Or just your content going into the CapEx dollars being spent in the Wired market?","Hock Tan","Well, if you talk about switching and routing, it's really more than just chips -- building blocks of chips. It's really as much an architectural play, especially in the high end top of the rack, in the [Indiscernible] and the spine side of the data centers.","And here is where our model just goes beyond selling pieces of silicon; we sell a lot of firmware and software that goes hand in hand to enable those chips to work with multiple OEM customers at the end of the day.","So, that's a very interesting model for us and what is overriding all of this is obviously the need for more larger and larger more and more throughput, especially, in data centers, and especially in top of the rack and all the way to the spine.","So, we have big advantages in this area simply because of the strength of the intellectual property we have in making very complex engineering, very complex SoCs, but also interface very high-speed interfaces or [Indiscernible] as we call it. So, all that plays to our advantage of being able to do it.","And we continue to do that, and we continue to -- it goes from 10-gigabit to 25 to 50 to 100 and maybe -- and going on in the future to 200-gigabit to 400-gigabit. We believe we are investing heavily to ensure that we can develop those kind of products and develop it first and better than anybody else.","So, -- and with that expansion of features, we benefit from content increases, simply because you are providing a customer more throughput and it's not a one-on-one scaling, it's more and more -- it's a lot of value for our customers to be able to go from 25-gigabit -- or 10-gigabit to 100 in the next year or two and we provide a lot of value in that.","And by the way, in broadband, it's not dissimilar. Except that maybe it's not evolving as rapidly simply because it's a much more stable market, for instance, you hear about now 4K TVs video delivery to moving on to high definition, HD, and eventually moving even to 8K. That would be interesting to see how 8K is going to be accepted since the human eye may not even notice the difference, but people want it.","And they want that, we're able to provide that. But it might take a bit longer, that's why I said broadband to us is a much -- we look at it as a much more stable gradually evolving market, even as OTT, the hype behind OTT and all that comes play which we participate in.","But in data centers, it's serious stuff. More and more data are being basically pushed through pipes stored, processed as social media keeps expanding. And that's why we are seeing this past quarter and current quarter extraordinary strength in the demand for switching and routing.","John Pitzer","That's great. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.","Operator","That concludes Broadcom's conference call for today. You may now disconnect."],"4445":["Broadcom Inc.

Welcome to Broadcom Inc.'s First Quarter Fiscal Year 2019 Financial Results Conference Call.","At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Beatrice Russotto, Director of Investor Relations of Broadcom Inc. Please, go ahead ma'am.","Beatrice Russotto","Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are Hock Tan, President and CEO; and Tom Krause, Chief Financial Officer of Broadcom. After the market closed today, Broadcom distributed a press release and financial tables describing our financial performance for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.","If you did not receive a copy, you may obtain the information from the Investors section of Broadcom's website at Broadcom.com. This conference call is being broadcast live and a recording will be available via telephone playback for one week. It will also be archived in the Investors section of our website at Broadcom.com.","During the prepared comments section of this call, Hock and Tom will be providing details of our first quarter fiscal year 2019 results, guidance for fiscal year 2019 and commentary regarding the business environment. We will take questions after the end of our prepared comments.","Please refer to our press release today and our recent filings with the SEC for information on the specific risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call.","In addition to U.S. GAAP reporting, Broadcom reports certain financial measures on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the table attached to today's press release. Comments made during today's call will primarily refer to our non-GAAP financial results.","So with that, I'll turn the call over to Hock.","Hock Tan","Thank you, Bea, and thank you everyone for joining us today. So we had a good start to fiscal 2019, growing 9% in our first fiscal quarter compared to the same period a year ago. The strength of our business model delivered another quarter of sustained revenues, strong earnings and an extremely strong free cash flow.","Our semiconductor business helped us relatively well. Not surprisingly, our wireless business was down sharply and our storage business underperformed somewhat. However, these challenges were mitigated -- more than mitigated by our networking business, which grew double digits year-over-year.","In addition, we were very pleased to see that the broadband business has started to recover and stabilize in the quarter. In fact, putting it all together, the semiconductor segment was actually up year-over-year in the first quarter, if you exclude the expected sharp decline in wireless.","Turning to infrastructure. This business which includes SAN switching, mainframe and enterprise software delivered solid top line results, benefiting from a very robust enterprise spending environment.","The integration of CA onto the Broadcom platform is very well underway and we are confident that we can meet, if not, exceed in the long term -- exceed the long-term revenue and profitability target that we laid out for CA to you last year. In fact, renewals in our CA business have been strong this past quarter and we believe the dollar commitments from our core customers will continue to grow.","Many of our peers have commented that they are seeing a softening demand environment, especially out of China. While we are experiencing the same demand dynamics, we have factored in much of this macroeconomic backdrop when we provided fiscal 2019 guidance last quarter.","As a result, after a solid start to the year, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2019 revenue guidance of $24.5 billion. Having said that, we expect our semiconductor business to bottom in the second fiscal quarter, driven almost entirely by the seasonal drop in wireless.","But looking to the second half, we are confident that semiconductor business will resume very meaningful growth. This will be driven by strong product cycles in both wireless and networking, coupled with a recovery in broadband.","Infrastructure software, on the other hand, is expected to sustain throughout the year. So in summary, our diversification strategy is working and we are effectively managing the decline in wireless as well as in the broader semiconductor industry headwinds.","Now, let me turn over to Tom to provide you with more color in Q1.","Tom Krause","Thank you, Hock. Consolidated net revenue for the first quarter was $5.8 billion, a 9% increase from a year ago. And EPS came in at $5.55, an 8% increase from a year ago off of a $441 million weighted average fully diluted share count. In addition, free cash flow was $2.03 billion or 35% of revenue. I would highlight, free cash flow grew 39% year-over-year.","The Semiconductor Solutions segment revenue was $4.4 billion and represented 76% of our total revenue this quarter. This was down 12% year-on-year on a comparable basis. But as Hock explained, the semiconductor segment was actually up slightly year-over-year in the first quarter, excluding wireless.","Let me now turn to our Infrastructure Software segment. Revenue was $1.4 billion and represented 24% of revenue. SAN switching continues to perform extremely well. And as Hock mentioned mainframe enterprise software is off to a good start.","Let me now provide additional detail on our financial performance. Operating expenses were $1.08 billion. Operating income from continuing operations was $3.05 billion and represented 52.7% of net revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.24 billion and represented 55.9% of net revenue. This figure excludes $143 million of depreciation.","Inventory decreased $50 million from the prior quarter. Similarly, semiconductor receivables were actually down, which is typical for Q1, even though receivables increased $352 million overall due to the CA acquisition.","Total current liabilities excluding debt increased $2.5 billion, due to CA. However, excluding CA total current liabilities excluding debt decreased meaningfully more than receivables, primarily due to the payment of our annual performance bonus in Q1. In addition, we spent $99 million on capital expenditures. As a result, we had record Q1 free cash flow from operations at $2.03 billion, or 35% of revenue. This represents 39% growth in free cash flow from operations compared to Q1 of 2018.","I would note a couple things. One, fiscal Q1 is typically our seasonally weakest cash flow quarter, due to the annual performance bonus payment we make to our employees in the quarter that we accrue for throughout the prior fiscal year. In Q1, we paid approximately $530 million in APB cash bonuses to our employees. And second, I would also note that, we accrued $723 million of restructuring integration expenses of which that includes $363 million of cash payments in the quarter.","In Q1, we returned $4.6 billion to stockholders consisting of $1.1 billion in the form of cash dividends and $3.5 billion for the repurchase and elimination of $14.2 million AVGO shares. We ended the quarter with $5.1 billion of cash, $37.6 billion of total debt, 396 million outstanding shares, and 451 million fully diluted shares outstanding.","Turning to our fiscal year 2019 guidance, as Hock discussed we are reaffirming our full-year revenue guidance of approximately $24.5 billion including approximately $19.5 billion from semiconductor solutions and approximately $5 billion from infrastructure software. IP licensing is not expected to generate a material amount of revenue.","On a non-GAAP basis, operating margins are expected to be approximately 51%. Net interest expense and other is expected to be approximately $1.25 billion. We do not contemplate any debt pay down in fiscal year 2019. The tax rate is forecasted to be approximately 11%. Depreciation is expected to be approximately $600 million. CapEx is expected to be approximately $550 million. And as a result free cash flow from continuing operations is expected to be approximately $10 billion. And finally, stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $2 billion.","As we outlined last quarter, we granted approximately 31 million of restricted and performance stock units as part of the multi-year grant that will vest over the next seven years. As a result for modeling purposes, we would expect the fully diluted share count in the second quarter to be approximately 450 million. This excludes any stock repurchases. Similarly, for modeling purposes, we would expect stock-based compensation expense to be approximately $530 million in Q2.","Looking forward beyond Q2, we would expect the share count excluding any stock repurchases and eliminations to remain relatively unchanged and the quarterly stock-based compensation in the second half of 2019 to start to decrease slightly each quarter. We would expect stock-based compensation to level out at approximately $1.5 billion in 2021.","Now onto capital allocation. Our capital allocation strategy remains the same. We plan to maintain the current quarterly dividend payout of $2.65 per share throughout the year, subject to quarterly Board approval, which means we plan to pay out over $4 billion in cash dividends in fiscal 2019. In addition, we remain committed to buying back and eliminating a total of $8 billion of stock in fiscal 2019.","That concludes my prepared remarks. During the Q&A portion of today's call, please limit yourselves to one question each, so we can accommodate as many analysts as possible. Operator, please open-up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur","Good afternoon and congratulations on the solid quarterly execution. Hock on the strong double-digits year-over-year momentum in your data center network [came in] [ph] compute acceleration segment you've been shipping your new Tomahawk 3 switching platform now since the second half of last year. I think Google's using it for 200-gig. We hear Amazon is going to transition to 400. We're hearing good things from Baidu, Tencent and all of the cloud guys. Additionally, you're ramping compute acceleration ASIC into some of the big cloud guys as well. Question is, do you anticipate continued double-digits year-over-year of growth for the full year here for the networking business as the pipeline here appears fairly strong?","Hock Tan","Very good question, Harlan. And that listening to you, you really got me going. Yes, in networking and it's broader than just data centers. But let's talk data centers. Tomahawk 3 which is the 12.8 terabit top of the rack switch has just barely started production shipments. In fact we do expect -- we are fully expecting the ramp of Tomahawk 3 as part of the broader data center scale-out with 400 gig pipes in the connect so to speak to really start just about right now.","In fact, our Q2 -- fiscal Q2 and progressing up to the rest of the end of the year as more and more on the names you were mentioning type of cloud [jumps in] [ph] and expand -- and upgrade into data centers and simply because as you know expanding the capacity of data centers and pipes is the simplest way to decongest to minimize or mitigate congestion control in these huge data centers, in this large cloud tech. So there's a broad refreshing and upgrading of data centers among these cloud guys.","One area as mentioned Tomahawk 3 shipping, which is just starting this quarter in significant volumes. What's also not so perhaps obvious, but is very real for us, is the fact that in order to run 400 gigabit per second throughput pipes, you need interconnect, fiber optic interconnect that are built and dedicated in that area. That's very high-tech products which we are very deeply engaged in. And that brings the content by a multiple sector in this data center realm.","And then as you expand the top of the rack switch I can't resist saying you have to -- you need to connect data center to data center what is called DCI interconnectivity. And the approach that is being taken, which we are also very engaged in with multiple OEMs who are supporting the cloud guys is obviously coherent, coherent fiber optic connection at 400 gig. And we believe, we are very much in the lead on that area as well. So these are product lives of product cycles we are seeing that are continuing their impetus of double-digit growth in networking.","And it extends more than that. In routing, we are going to be launching and ramping our new generation router Jericho 2, probably in Q3 of our fiscal year. And that's going into Edge routing, call routing among the service providers especially the telecom guys. And we're starting to see the preparation in that happening. So yes, we feel very good about networking and the ability to sustain the level of growth we have been seeing.","Harlan Sur","Thank you, Hock.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.","Ross Seymore","Hi guys. Wanted to echo my congratulations. Sticking on the formally called wired category, Hock you mentioned that the -- I think you said the broadband space had stabilized and recovered. Can you talk a little bit about the product cycles that will be driving demand in that segment? And any geographic color, product cycle color would be helpful?","Hock Tan","Sure. Sure. Ross. Yes. In broadband happy to say finally, the thing recovered. And a big part of driving the recovery is cable modem video delivery, DOCSIS as they call it 3.1. We've seen implementations across multiple carriers, service providers of DOCSIS 3.1, so that's very good. What we're also seeing of course is in gateway access, which is a big part of broadband. Among many carriers too is the newer generation of DSL, digital subscriber line as they need to expand capacity and throughput and go through -- what they're calling the next-generation G.fast or 35b and we're seeing a lot of that in Europe, some in North American carriers.","But what's also equally interesting is as they go to the last mile into households, what we're also seeing is adoption of wireless connectivity or what we all call Wi-Fi. And what we're seeing now is as we see this wired gateways, whether it's cable modem DOCSIS 3.1 or digital subscriber line, we are seeing -- especially in the back half of the year enterprises and more and more service providers, telecoms, start to attach the next-generation Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi 6 on to those gateways. And in Wi-Fi 6 I'm very, very pleased to note that we are very much in the lead in having developed and productized a whole suite of products that perfectly address towards those enterprise and service providers.","And that -- but most of that will be only shipping we believe in the second half of the year, but fiscal and both calendar. And we're looking forward to seeing that happen, but it's a very nice product cycle that will basically push the recovery of our broadband business.","Ross Seymore","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS.","Timothy Arcuri","Thank you. Hock I'm wondering how you handicap Huawei. And I believe that they're kind of mid-single-digit customer right now. And we're hearing a lot of evidence that they may be double ordering impossible sanctions. So, I'm wondering how you think of that and how you handicap that for the full-year guidance. Thank you.","Hock Tan","I probably know as much as you do seriously in terms of what's available -- publicly available and what's -- and the concerns and the issues overhanging broadly Chinese sponsor, China and specific high-tech companies like Huawei from China.","They're a good customer and they buy products which obviously helps their products in a competitive in the global export market and I hope they continue to do so. But certainly, the overhand of that is something that we are closely monitoring and are very concerned about. But as far as specific things you're mentioning, I'm not able to basically comment on it simply because I don't know.","Timothy Arcuri","Okay Hock. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.","Vivek Arya","Thanks for taking my question. Actually a quick clarification on a question. I believe Hock you mentioned software could sustain throughout the year. That suggests annualized closer to $6 million rather than the $5 million I think you had before. And if that is the case, shouldn't profit margins than what you had?","And then the question -- there has been some more consolidation in semis NVIDIA acquiring Mellanox. We're just curious how you think, if at all, there is an impact on Broadcom. And even if there isn't, how you -- just think about the M&A environment in semis? Thank you.","Hock Tan","Okay. You got two questions here, very clever. Let me try to answer -- let me start with the second one. It's easier. I mean as I say we have done quite a bit of acquisitions in very strong assets in the semiconductor space. And it's obviously -- it's something we continue to look at because obviously semiconductor is tall area for us. And -- but you also know we're not necessarily limiting ourselves to that. We'll look towards broader area of technology, software, and appliances as Brocade would be considered.","And while we continue to be interested in the semiconductor space and that's still targets and we'll be continue to be very thoughtful and timely in terms of the time and in terms of how we approach those acquisitions. And we have observed our behavior over the last several years. We tend to do it in a very -- on a measured pace simply because it's important. In fact it's critical on any acquisition we make that we can integrate it very, very well.","And that's what we're doing with CA right now. And we're right in the thick of it as you notice in the numbers we are going through as we drive down to generate the kind of business model we expect to get out of CA.","Turning onto the next question you asked which leads to software. Yes, it's turning out to be a very, very nice deal for us. We actually are seeing for our core customers -- and as you recall, we have differentiated customers of CA between very tall large customers who considers both mainframes and enterprise distributed software as opposed to much smaller long tail of non-core customers.","And we'll get those core customers, they are focusing on -- after about at least one quarter now today more than one quarter of going through selling, renewals, and adoption of our software. We feel that the business model has been extremely -- our business model has been extremely successful.","I mean the growth as we see of dollars that we get through renewals and expansion of footprint in those core customers is pretty -- is surpassing our expectations. It's gone double-digits. But that's only three months. So, we're still early stage and we'll continue to push that. But as we have also made an announcement on at least one or maybe two deals we have done on our new PLA model above mainframe and enterprise-based software.","And these have been very well-received in the marketplace by our core customers. And we are hopeful it's something that makes so much sense that we'll expand. We expect to see more and more of these significant transactions occurring as we move forward toward the rest of the year, all right?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John Pitzer","Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. I'll echo my congratulations on the results. Hock, relative to the full-year guide, it does imply like many of your semi-peers, some pretty meaningfully above seasonal growth half on-half on the semi-solutions business. And I think you did a good job on some of the prior questions specific to data center and broadband access of some of the bottoms-up product cycles that are driving that.","I'd be curious or it'd be helpful if I could get your views on wireless and how that progresses throughout the year and how you're thinking or how we should be thinking about your content this year versus dependency on units this year within the wireless.","Hock Tan","Somehow I knew this was going to come up somehow someway someplace. I truly know if you did that. Yes, I know. It's actually not that because that product cycle in wireless is -- in all our views this is mine very predictable. And we will see that happen in our Q3 fiscal Q3-Q4 of this fiscal 2019. It will. We're already starting production in our wait of that, which has longer product cycle on FBAR and some of our products.","And we will see for one of better one because it's so seasonal, and it's very significant a shop bounce-back, which -- it's to mind our confidence that our full year guidance is something that's going to happen, very simple. And that in the second half we'll see that meaningful -- you correctly pointed out somewhat double-digit growth in the semiconductor segment of our business.","As I mentioned in answer to earlier questions, data center especially now networking, we have a whole slew of new product cycles will generate a big part of that double-digit growth. So will in our view wireless. I'd say that's happening fast. In this particular year perhaps the difference between this coming year 2019 versus 2018 is simply to do two things.","One, is we're probably going to get better share. I've mentioned that before. And secondly, content increase. It always happens year-after-year as I mention. Example in Wi-Fi, you'll see Wi-Fi 6. Wi-Fi 6 is not just in enterprise and access gateways in service providers. We are seeing Wi-Fi 6, the new generation, 802.11ax in handsets and that drives -- I call it strong content increase as the increase amount of bands in the ad bar that we constantly see as basically wireless continue to proliferate in various areas of the world continues to expand the amount of bands content in this next-generation phone.","So all that is going to drive a bounce back with perhaps increased content for our products. As far as volume is concerned, yes like you I will probably be as uncertain as you are, how much the volume would be? But regardless it's -- there's a lot of mitigating factors and the biggest part of it is pure content increase.","John Pitzer","That\u2019s helpful. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.","Stacy Rasgon","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So understanding the confidence on the semi ramp, your guidance also implies the infrastructure software business has to decelerate pretty materially as we go through the year. And I mean, it seems like right now in Q1, the CA business must have already been hitting pretty close to the $3.5 billion annualized run rate that you were talking about that was a few years out.","So I guess like what drove the strength of CA in Q1? And why does that business decelerate -- have to decelerate so markedly as we go through the rest of the year in order to fit into the guidance that you've provided?","Tom Krause","Stacy, it's Tom. I think one element is we don't want to get into the details between CA and SAN switching, but we're taking a conservative approach. It's just the first quarter out of the gate. We've got three quarters to go. As Hock mentioned we are actually pretty pleasantly surprised with the number of ELA and PLA opportunities that we see in the pipeline.","And a lot of our success in terms of growing the dollars of each of these accounts is going to be driven by our ability to convert those into wins. But so far so good. So I think we're going to take this one quarter at a time. But for now given that we're only one quarter into the year, we feel very comfortable reaffirming guidance on the top-line. And, of course, we feel comfortable with the operating profit as well as the cash flow expectations going forward.","Stacy Rasgon","But you said CA would sustain through the rest of the year. So does that mean that Brocade has to like come down a lot? Or is it just like overall conservatism that's in the number.","Tom Krause","No. Stacy, what we said is that the software, the infrastructure software segment would continue to sustain throughout the year. That's our expectation, but we are taking a conservative approach relative to the overall outlook for the business.","Q \u2013 Stacy Rasgon","But if it sustains wouldn't you be at 5.6 for the year instead of 5?","A \u2013 Tom Krause","I'll leave that to you Stacy to figure out.","Q \u2013 Stacy Rasgon","Okay. Thank you, guys.","A \u2013 Tom Krause","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.","Q \u2013 Toshiya Hari","Thank you for taking the question. Hock, I had a question on 5G as it relates to your wireless business. Based on preliminary discussions with your customers, what sort of content uplift are you expecting in your wireless business as 5G is inserted going forward? And from a timing perspective, do you think -- is it more of a 2020 dynamic when 5G starts to move the needle? Or is it 2020 and beyond? Thank you.","A \u2013 Hock Tan","It\u2019s a very good interesting question. You're asking areas of very vast uncertainty here. But my sense of it is you start to see a little bit of it in 2020. But it will be only a small part. I think if 5G actually impacts content, in components, in the handsets, high-end smartphones I might add will only really impact in a big way I think beyond 2020. 2020 will see some starts. But the tax rate for want of a better word to use is going to be not that high.","But you're right. Beyond 2020 as 5G comes in and you've probably heard and seen that, the amount of content especially for the way it affects us on RS analog FBAR. And here in this case as those FBAR content attaches itself more and more to antenna and various other parts of the phone will be quite significant, but not so in 2020.","Q \u2013 Toshiya Hari","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.","Q \u2013 Craig Hettenbach","Yes. Thank you. Just a question for Tom. On the back of the strong gross margin upside in the quarter, can you talk about just trends you're seeing in gross margin for the core semiconductor business and then software and just how we think about expectations through the year?","A \u2013 Tom Krause","Sure Craig. Well you can see that the gross margins are exceptional. They're all over 70% in the quarter. A lot of that is driven by including CA in the business. But you're right. The semiconductor business continues to increase from a gross margin perspective. Mix helps. As wireless comes down, we benefit as I think you know from the rest of the portfolio in semis being at or above the corporate average. But looking out longer-term, we've talked about this a lot. We continue to see the opportunity to improve gross margins and directly translate the course into our operating margins and our free cash flow conversion. So we see that continuing.","Q \u2013 Craig Hettenbach","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Harsh Kumar with Piper Jaffray.","Q \u2013 Harsh Kumar","Yeah. Hey guys. First of all congratulations, exceptional execution. I wanted to follow up on the gross margin question. Maybe for Tom. They stepped up quite dramatically. On one of the field trips I think you had mentioned that it really takes an acquisition about a year to hum and really produce results. So question is did you capture the vast majority of CA benefits very quickly in 1Q? Or is the best from CA reserved for the back half and later on?","A \u2013 Tom Krause","No. I think as you might be able to sort of look through the numbers, we're still not fully optimized around CA. We're only one quarter in. So you've seen some meaningful improvement in profitability for the company that includes CA. But when you look specifically at gross margins, it\u2019s a number of elements within the CA business tie to gross margins primarily services as well as support. So we've taken some actions to improve gross margins and improve the P&L in general. One in particular is we announced a deal with HCL and have outsourced a lot of our service activity to HCL going forward for the CA business.","But as we continue to work through our model which is really driving these PLAs as we talked about, we see the opportunity to continue to get better returns on our investment which includes improving our gross margins going forward. So we would expect them to continue to improve not just this year, but really over the long-term.","A \u2013 Hock Tan","If I could add to that on CA we continue to go through transitions. And you're right. It takes at least a year for us to so-call hum. In the case of software companies, I believe it will take longer because these are contractual commitments probably closer to two years. But it will get there. I think a big part other than fact that we're combining software and hardware now and CA in the software infrastructure, software-sized deal transitioning is improvement. And as Tom said just one quarter -- like to see more reductions. And these are not just cost of goods sold, but down below the line operating expenses as we go through it better.","For Q1, it's very critical to is the fact that its product mix. Wireless is down and the other products are humming along, our semiconductor products. And remember year by year nature of a product life cycles in those semiconductor products, we always have an opportunity to expand by delivering more value to our customers, expand our gross margin around 50 to 100 basis points on just its natural cadence. That and mix, I think, is adding a lot of tailwind to our improvement in gross margin.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research.","Edward Snyder","Thanks a lot. Hock, I'd like to if we could maybe touch back on wireless. This rebound you're going to see in the second half of the year, and I understand you've got a year-over-year issue here, because we were kind of weak last year. But this is flattening out units. This sounds like it's going to be a much stronger rebound than normal just on content alone. Correct me if I'm wrong, but you've got three big areas that you're playing with, just in handsets alone.","Of course, your standard ball business which covers I think above 2.4-gig. You're doing more products in the antenna congestion area now, because I know you're doing antenna flexors. And that problem's getting much more acute over the next year, especially as 5G comes on. But the Wi-Fi 802.11ax like you mentioned not only in enterprise, but we're seeing that in handsets and isn't it the cast that you've got a big lead over your closest competitor, maybe Qualcomm here.","So, should we expect one, to see a bigger rebound just on content; two, for maybe just to have more legs than we'd otherwise expected beginning next year? I know units are an issue, but given Wi-Fi itself is being deployed this -- and you play stronger to that, it should last longer, shouldn't it?","Hock Tan","Ed, we love all your comments, but I want to be played down very straight down the center simply. We'd see a rebound. My view is a normal rebound and it's a normal rebound. And while content increases, it's not really over the top that -- by that much either. But don't forget comparing it against last year, it's relatively an easier compare. ","So, we do see -- we definitely see a rebound and this will be a good rebound, but it's not -- and it will not be an extraordinary rebound. Just want to emphasize that. Just your normal rebound. It's not hard to compare year-on-year against last year versus second half fiscal 2019. The fact that, that will be a main improvement.","Edward Snyder","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.","Aaron Rakers","Yeah. Thanks for taking the question, and also congratulations on the quarter. A lot of questions on wired and wireless has been asked, but I wanted to ask about the storage business. The storage business, I think you mentioned, was up. I don't know if you've framed how much in this quarter. But I'm curious and kind of similar questions as prior, what kind of things are we to be focused on in that piece of the business over the next couple of quarters? And how do you assume that can go through the course of this year? Thank you.","Hock Tan","Okay. Well, very good interesting question. In storage, we have a mixed bag here. A bag -- a lot of it not all of it, but a lot of it relates to hard disk drive. And as you know hard disk drive is nothing to yell over these days and we see that no different from the others. Our mitigating factor here is that most of our hard disk drives, in fact all our hard disk drive component sales goes to near-line or basically in data centers. We don't do -- we do relatively less in PC desktops or mobile. So, we do see the impact of it being weak, but not as extreme as obviously the industry is saying. So, that helps mitigate it, but that's not a growth area.","Where we see a hopefully embedded new product cycle coming in is the fact that type two storage is -- especially on Flash SSDs is PCI Express. Second half of the year, we see pushing -- a strong push in the marketplace on PCI Express Gen 4. We're in the lead of it and we see a lot of interesting opportunities related to that, be it in storage or even be it in resulting the amounts are in offload computing, from viewpoint of machine learning, GPU-to-GPU connectivity. But it's also related to storage and that push something you said where is Gen 4 is what's quite interesting in storage over the next -- over the next -- well, actually over the rest of this year, especially the second half. All right?","Aaron Rakers","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust.","William Stein","Great. Thanks for taking my question. Hock, if you cut through the end markets and look instead at the business on a geographic basis, I'm well aware that when you shift to one region, there may not be consumption in that region that China's a big export in economy certainly. But can you talk to the pace of demand that you're seeing in China as best you can tell it, in particular relative to inventories there? Thank you.","Hock Tan","Good question. No surprise. Across the regions, as far as I can sense, China is the weakest. We all see that. We all know that. And I'm talking domestic demand products and view our product shipped to the -- ship to those regions used in that region indigenously. And it's the weakest region. It also had collateral impact we see to some extent on certain sectors in Japan and certain sectors in Europe, less so in the U.S.","But broadly -- so China has an impact beyond just the region in South China. It also impacts to a couple of other regions. But North America continues to be quite decent and that's what helps us mitigate this overall macroeconomic saturation.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's question-and-answer session, as well as today's call. This does conclude the program.

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Bin Jiang, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Bin Jiang","Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are Hock Tan, President and CEO; and Tony Maslowski, Chief Financial Officer of Avago Technologies.","After the market closed today, Avago distributed a press release and financial tables describing our financial performance for the first quarter fiscal year 2014. If you did not receive a copy, you can obtain the information from the Investors section of Avago's website at avagotech.com.","This conference call is being webcast live and a recording will be available via telephone playback for one week. It will also be archived in the Investors section of our website.","During the prepared comments section of this call, Hock and Tony will be providing details of our first fiscal quarter results, background to our Q2 2014 outlook and some commentary regarding the business environment. We will take questions after the end of our prepared comments.","In addition to U.S. GAAP reporting, Avago reports certain financial measures on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the tables attached to today's press release. Comments made during today's call will primarily refer to our non-GAAP financial results.","Please refer to our press release today and our recent filings with the SEC for information on the specific risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Hock Tan. Hock?","Hock E. Tan","Thank you, Bin. Good afternoon, everyone. We are going to start today by reviewing recent market business highlights in our end markets, then Tony will provide a summary of the first quarter fiscal 2014 financial results.","Revenue from our first quarter was $709 million and represented a decrease of 4% from last quarter and an increase of 23% from the same quarter a year ago. Now Q1 revenue came in slightly better than the midpoint of our initial guidance.","Sequentially, seasonal downtrends provided some headwind in our wired and industrial business even as strong demand from a major smartphone OEM sustained our record wireless revenue through this quarter, and bumped the historical norm of a revenue decline in wireless in Q1.","Having said all that, the key message I want to impart this quarter is simply that we have significant year-on-year revenue growth in wireless at 13% year-on-year and wired infrastructure at 59% year-on-year, and have seen a clear recovery in industrial and demand from a year ago.","Let me now provide more color on each of our end markets. Starting with wireless; revenue from wireless came in slightly above our expectation growing 1% sequentially and represented 49% of our total revenues. On a year-on-year basis, as I mentioned in revenue, wireless revenue grew 13%. And as mentioned earlier, normally our fiscal Q1 is a seasonally weak quarter for wireless; however, sustained demand from a large OEM customer during the quarter helped us achieve a second consecutive quarter of record wireless revenue.","At this period, I would also like to highlight an exciting development and it should come as no surprise that the push into LTE among carriers in China has enabled us to mount design in meaningful content in the mass market China smartphones for the first time. This trend was significant enough to substantially grow our mix of FBAR revenue and expand wireless gross margin during the quarter.","Looking towards Q2 of fiscal 2014, similar to last year, the annual product transaction at the same large OEM I referred to earlier will now be a significant headwind. However, we expect this maybe partially offset by initial product ramp and another large OEM customer where we have one significant RF content. Moreover, we've seen in this quarter the proliferation by multiple white-box OEMs of LTE-enable handsets in China which would accelerate demand for FBAR filters.","The expected search of FBAR sales will in addition to expanding our wireless gross margin by over 200 basis points further partially cushion our decline in Q2 revenue from wireless to no more than mid teens sequentially. Of course, year-on-year, we still project continued growth in our wireless business.","Moving on to wired infrastructure, wired revenue declined 7% sequentially and represented 32% of overall revenues. Year-on-year, this grew 59% but closer to 20% without adding in CyOptics. Data center-related demand continued to be strong particularly for our new generation for the gigabit per second fiber optics. However, due to sluggish enterprise demand and soft carrier routing, coupled with known inventory adjustment at our major networking OEM customer, both our ASIC and CyOptics business declined sequentially compared to the preceding quarter.","Now into this mix we have also aggressively transformed the CyOptics business model from low margin module revenue in China to high margin component sales. Despite this, strong demand by service providers particularly for optical 100G coherent transponder solution had enabled us to sustain the CyOptics revenue level. Looking forward to Q2, we believe strength in data spending will continue, in fact we expect to see the initial ramp of our proprietary bidirectional optical transceivers for simultaneous 10G and 40G transmission, which have been adopted by a major networking customer in the new generation data center platforms.","One network switching remains muted. We expect demand from EDGE routing as well as high performance computing would drive sequential revenue growth for ASIC and as a result, we anticipate wide infrastructure revenue to grow mid single digits on a percentage basis compared with Q1. Importantly, year-on-year, we expect to sustain our revenue growth trajectory in this end market.","Finally, moving on to industrial; industrial sales declined 11% sequentially, below our expectation at the beginning of the quarter but nonetheless showed a steady recovery of 6% from the relative bottom of a year ago. Industrial sales represented 19% of our overall revenues. This weaker than expected sales were caused largely by our ongoing actions to contract inventory in the channels, which exacerbated this single digit seasonal decline in distribution resales in this end market.","But not all regional geographies behaved the same way. As is normal this quarter, we experienced low single digit declines in North America and Europe. However, Japan continued its industrial recovery based on domestic demand and strong export performance, while Asia remained virtually stable supported largely by China's spending.","Looking to Q2 we expect industrial resales will rebound by a mid single digit on a percentage basis. We also plan to shift more into distribute channels in anticipation of this improvement in industrial demand. Accordingly, revenue for industrial end market is forecast to grow high single digits on a percentage basis compared to Q1. By the same token year-on-year we anticipate industrial sales will also expand high single digits.","To sum up, in second fiscal quarter, we expect product transition at a major OEM in wireless which will drive consolidated sales down, despite sequential growth in both wired infrastructure and industrial. Accordingly, we're getting overall revenue to decline between 3% to 6% from that of Q1. Notwithstanding, we expect that that favorable growth trend year-on-year experienced in our three end markets during Q1 will persist into Q2.","With that, let me now turn the call over to Tony for a more detailed review of our first quarter fiscal 2014 financials. Tony?","Anthony Maslowski","Thank you, Hock. Good afternoon, everyone. Before reviewing the first quarter fiscal 2014 financial results, I want to remind you that my comments today will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP data is included with the earnings release issued today and is also available at our website at www.avagotech.com.","Revenue of 709 million in Q1 represents a decrease of 4% from last quarter and an increase of 23% compared to the same quarter a year ago. The sequential decrease was in line with our guidance for the quarter. Revenue from our wireless target market came in slightly better than our expectation, though it was offset by weaker than expected revenue from our industrial target market. Revenue from our wired infrastructure target market was roughly in line with our expectation.","Foxconn continued to be a greater than 10% customer. Our Q1 gross margin was 52%, which was above our guidance for the quarter and also higher than the prior quarter. Gross margins improved in some of our product categories, offsetting unfavorable product mix.","I would like to highlight that during the quarter, we successfully improved the gross margin of the CyOptics business to our targeted level of approximately mid 40s on a percentage basis, three quarters ahead of our original plan. We believe CyOptics gross margin has reached the level to support our overall corporate target and therefore we will stop commenting on it separately from this point forward.","Turning to operating expenses, R&D expenses decreased by 2 million to 98 million and SG&A decreased by 1 million to 44 million, driving total operating expenses for Q1 to 142 million, 3 million below our guidance. The lower than expected operating expenses were primarily due to a curtailment and settlement gain from a change to our U.S. retiree medical plan benefit in the quarter. As a percentage of sales, R&D remained unchanged at 14% and SG&A remained unchanged at 6% of net revenue.","Income from operations for the quarter decreased by 5 million sequentially to 224 million and represented 32% of net revenue. Compared to the 152 million for Q1 of last year, income from operations increased by 52 million helped primarily by higher revenue. Taxes came in at 7 million for Q1, 3 million below our guidance. This was due to a change in the jurisdictional mix of income and expense.","Q1 net income of 217 million decreased by 10 million from the prior quarter and Q1 earnings per diluted share of $0.84 was $0.05 lower than Q4. Q4 '13 net income was higher primarily because of an $11 million increase in other income resulting from a gain on marketable securities. Compared to Q1 of last year, net income was 54 million higher and earnings per diluted share were $0.19 higher.","Our share-based compensation in Q1 was 24 million. The breakdown of this expense for Q1 includes 3 million in cost of goods sold, 8 million in R&D and 13 million in SG&A. In Q2 2014 we anticipate share-based compensation will be approximately 30 million. And just a reminder, the company's definition of non-GAAP net income excludes share-based compensation expense.","Moving on to the balance sheet, our days sales outstanding dropped to 42 days from 52 days in the prior quarter. The decrease was due primarily to the linearity of revenue throughout the quarter, timing of shipments around the holiday season and our collection efforts. Our inventory ended at 286 million, a slight increase of 1 million from last quarter. Our wireless inventory remained at an elevated level in anticipation of continued strong demand throughout the year, particularly of our FBAR filter products.","Days on hand were 76 days which increased five days from Q4 given the lower revenues during the quarter. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of 1.11 billion and we generated 229 million in operational cash flow. We spent 52 million on capital expenditures. This was below our guidance for the year, mainly because of the timing of equipment delivery.","For Q2 we expect CapEx to be approximately 70 million, primarily to support our continued build out of FBAR capacity. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 270,000 shares which consumed 12 million of cash. The buyback was lower than the prior quarter due to the timing of our negotiation to acquire LSI.","On December 31, 2013, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per ordinary share, which consumed 62 million of cash. This dividend was raised by $0.02 from the prior quarter. Since the inception of our dividend program in Q2 2011 to-date, we have continued to increase our dividend each quarter.","Now let me turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2014. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions and we do not intend to update this guidance. Total revenue is expected to be down in the range of 3% to 6% from Q1. Gross margin is expected to be 52.5% plus or minus 1 percentage point. Operating expenses are estimated to be approximately 147 million. Taxes are forecasted to be approximately 7 million and finally, the diluted share count forecast is for 261 million shares.","That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed, sir.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Yes. Thanks for taking my question. A very good performance on the gross margin side. You mentioned a couple of mix improvements within wireless and also within the wired business from CyOptics. Can you maybe talk a little bit about how much of the relative and improvement was from each of those two buckets and were kind of now at a level where that mix, at least in the wireless, is expected to kind of sustain itself in the current place?","Anthony Maslowski","Yes, so I think the mix \u2013 we see improvement in the wireless side is sustainable. It's definitely things that you can get that, it's the FBAR mix and so forth. And then obviously as Hock mentioned very directly at CyOptics, we've moved several steps away from the subassembly business into a more of a components business which is helpful for the bottom line as well.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Okay, thanks. And then as a follow-up, regarding your comments, Hock, around the inventory levels to distributors, it sounds like there was a little bit more of a bleed-off in inventories kind of across the board in the January quarter that you're expecting to refill that a little bit in April. Is that refill happening pretty much across the board geographically or there are things going on differently in the different regions?","Hock E. Tan","Jim, there are in different regions, absolutely. And if we talk industrial, as I assumed you're referring to in this question, we are seeing refill a lot in Japan where there's a fairly strong industrial recovery. We are also seeing that in Europe where after the seasonal or the holiday season last quarter, things are picking up and resale is showing those strong signs. Those are two specific areas we are talking about. Industrial, as I mentioned, in China continues to be stable, slightly up but nothing dramatic but very stable at a significant level. Having said that for channel inventory in general, we are seeing very strong resales and because of that refilling too in China, particularly with respect not so much industrial in China as much as wireless products for the white-box makers in China.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","That's helpful. Thank you very much.","Bin Jiang","Operator?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley","Yes. Thank you. You guys have seen some uplifts for FBAR in terms of margin mix and wireless. Outside of that, could you share any thoughts in terms of what we're seeing just yesterday in terms of industry consolidation and what that might mean for pricing and margins in the broader business within RF?","Hock E. Tan","Well, we have quite a few plays in our business as you well know and I assume you're referring to the announcement of RFMD and TriQuint and we know both rather well, good guys, good managers and \u2013 very strong managers. So I think the consolidation would be positive for the industry as a whole. It certainly puts more \u2013 possibly more stronger competition, but we always welcome competition as I said because we compete largely on a basis of technology more than anything else.","Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley","Got it. And then as a follow-up, any incremental thoughts you could share on LSI specifically just conference levels in terms of achieving the cost synergies you first laid out?","Hock E. Tan","Really it's too early at this point. I mean we're still awaiting all regulatory approvals and not to mention the shareholder approval of LSI which will happen sometime in April. So we really do not expect the deal to close before early May, probably maybe even later. And so at this stage, it would definitely be too early for us to understand and know where the assumptions in driving this deal still hold true at all.","Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please proceed.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you for taking my question. Hock, the question is on the wireless business. Obviously it has performed very well in the last two years but when I look at the guidance you're giving for the April quarter, it suggests sort of mid single digit or so year-on-year growth. Now I understand the transition at your largest customer, but how is it that if the need for FBAR is going up yet you are seeing this deceleration in sales? Is this just sort of temporary pause when the growth driver is really your largest customer and has a mix shift towards more to China and other customers or are you still comfortable with the long-term sort of double digit growth trajectory if possible in this business?","Hock E. Tan","To get right to the number of your question, yes, we're still very comfortable with double digit year-on-year growth, as I was very careful particularly in each case. Year-on-year, we still show which is on a quarter-on-quarter basis, year-on-year, we still show double digit growth. The interesting thing we are experiencing and I mentioned it a lot in the last earnings call is simply that as the OEM industry consolidates, revenues within each year as we go one quarter to the other within each year, goes through sharp movements because of product transitions of those larger OEMs now in smartphones in the marketplace. By the way our content keeps increasing in both OEMs which I said today even further. Now what we do see is fairly sharp changes in revenues quarter-on-quarter during a year. But if you trend it from one year to the other, you will see very clearly that we are able to sustain double digit year-on-year growth, which is really what matters because within any year you will see that a handset OEM launched a product at different times. And because of that we go to fairly sharp uptakes as well as fairly sharp declines as we move from one quarter as we did from Q1 to Q2 in this current year, and we will probably see another cycle of movement as we move to Q3 and Q4 this year when the large OEM launches its new generation of phones.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. That's really helpful, Hock. As a follow-up, I think you mentioned that you're starting to see the surge in your China FBAR adoption. Is there a way to quantify how much that is? So outside of your top or Tier 1 customers, is there a way to size how much that white-box China market is demanding FBAR or is it too early to provide that quantification?","Hock E. Tan","You've seen it (indiscernible) so to say, it's a search. And because it's not just one OEM in China that's launching LTE-enabled smartphones, it's multiple OEMs at the same time rushing into this market. And as you all know out there, China 4G or LTE is just a big thing this year \u2013 beginning of this year. And it's not just handsets that's happening, it's wireless infrastructure that's been build out, rolling out in China on phone time [ph], LTE and it shouldn't surprise us all that because of that, smartphones are coming out LTE enabled which are low costs even by China standards, but they're not LTE-enabled. And it really proves a point that we have been saying all the time in our FBAR thesis which is FBAR is used based on technology requirement not based on whether they are high end or low end. It's really based on technology requirements and some bands, particularly in China that do require very much so FBAR in order to achieve its performance. And because of that we are seeing those results. And quite a considerable amount of those designs which are driving quite a bit of our FBAR revenue from that angle. Having said that, a more traditional market of the large branded smartphone OEMs continue to adopt for the same reason the Chinese white-box OEM. They're adopting more and more these lines that uses FBAR, so a lot of them relate to frontend modules that encompasses both the FBAR filters as well as the associated power amplifiers for not just one band, for multiple bands within the phones.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Just one last one. High CapEx could be a good news or a bad news story. The question is it's with about 8% of sales for you in the last four quarters. Is it a point at which it starts to taper off or just that the demand for FBAR is there, so CapEx could stay at sort of these levels? Thank you.","Anthony Maslowski","Again, Vivek, we talked about CapEx being somewhat of a challenge this year but again we're only investing with line of sight capacity that we need for either \u2013 as Hock mentioned either large OEMs or some of this other surge we're having. So we're going to be in very selective. We get a great return on the CapEx in the FBAR fab and these surges in some ways you can have as an indication of our confidence in the future.","Hock E. Tan","In other words, we like our investment behind demand, and it's always a challenge therefore for us to meet that demand, to be honest, which also relates to why as Tony pointed out in his remarks on inventory with run-off that's very full [ph].","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. I appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please proceed.","Chris Hemmelgarn - Barclays Capital","Thanks very much for taking the question. This is Chris Hemmelgarn on for Blayne. Just a quick question first on your wireless expectations, just kind of what you're baking in \u2013 what your Q2 guidance bakes in there in terms of \u2013 how steep of a decline are you really seeing at the one wireless customer you highlighted? What are the puts and takes there versus what you wireless in for business?","Hock E. Tan","I'll tell you the right plans. We don't make any specific remarks on anything particular customer, Chris. I'm sorry about that, so I prefer not to answer that. We generally don't comment on any particular customer. We love them that much.","Chris Hemmelgarn - Barclays Capital","Not a problem, had to try. Moving on from that, there were a couple of announcements out of some BAW competitors out of Japan. I'm just kind of interested in whether you guys still really see that as predominately just you and TriQuint competing for the sockets or are you really seeing any progress from the rest of the competition that's largely trailed to you guys to this point?","Hock E. Tan","Well, I mean it's not new information as you know that there are SAW makers who put in temperature condensation to try to improve the performance and try to achieve closer to what BAW or FBAR performance achieves and we constantly see that and they constantly improve as we try to improve. So it's a typical technological race to improve, we try to improve more and we are already ahead of the game in making our improvement much better, but there is still a gap. And in terms of other players and just ourselves and TriQuint trying to get into the BAW business, yes that has happened. It's not the first time and that continues to happen, it's nothing new we have now seen for the last few years. But a big part of where we are today is not just the technology in terms of evolution of FBAR or BAW as we put it generically. We are, as I mentioned, on our current eighth generation moving to our ninth generation. Nobody stands even close at this point as long as we keep making the investments we are making, we not only are continuing to be ahead of game technologically on our FBAR but in terms of capacity to address a very fast expanding market where we are also I believe quite way ahead of anybody else.","Chris Hemmelgarn - Barclays Capital","Thank you very, very much.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura. Please proceed.","Sanjay Chaurasia - Nomura Securities","Hi, guys. This is Sanjay for Romit Shah. Hock, one question on TD-LTE ramp, I just wanted to get a sense of what the content is and what are the bands FBAR 15 use across the OEMs? Do you see this usage fairly similar across the OEMs or do you see there are differences in terms of band coverage and content?","Hock E. Tan","It depends on the country, but if you're referring to China, there are multiple and not the same OEMs will apply the same band. It depends on how they architect the phones, particularly, but it's the whole spectrum in a range of 2.3, 2.4 gigahertz all the way to 2.8, 2.7 gigahertz in that range. And within as you know, band 38, 40, 41, WiFi, WiMax and these are all in the combination of BAW totally.","Sanjay Chaurasia - Nomura Securities","Okay. And then to follow-up, you mentioned increasing competition from the merger of TriQuint and RF Micro. I'm just wondering \u2013 you mentioned that you're technologically much ahead moving from eight to nine generations. What are some of the dimensions you could see competition from these guys if not from a technology point of view?","Hock E. Tan","Let me rephrase what I said earlier and I apologize if I misinformed it. We already have growth from healthy competition from RF and TriQuint as we do from Skyworks and a few others, so it is still there. And if two of our competitors chose to merge to perhaps present a more united front, more power to them frankly and we will continue to see that competition and I don't think there will be any abatement of that competition with their merger. I think it will keep on going and as I said, what we do is \u2013 as I said, we compete on a kind of different dimension from many of our competitors. We compete purely on products that we believe we can do much, much better than they can and we do not compete on products that come on with us. And that strategy on our side still will not change.","Sanjay Chaurasia - Nomura Securities","Okay. Thanks so much.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of JoAnne Feeney with ABR Investment Strategy. Please proceed.","JoAnne Feeney - ABR Investment Strategy","Thanks. Congrats on the nice gross margins. A question for you on the competition and your response to your strategy, so TriQuint and RF Micro combined, Skyworks, Qualcomm have all now announced integrated end-to-end RF solutions. And so I guess I'm wondering what do you plan to release something along those lines or whether you feel like rather that strategy is not to go that route and to stick with products that are more FBAR focused and take advantage to having some discrete FBAR opportunities that the other competitors simply cannot satisfy?","Hock E. Tan","Well, our strategy is probably not that distinctly different. We, JoAnne, in the sense that yes, we always see FBAR as our real differentiator sustainably, we're not wrong there really and that's why we put in huge amounts of investment. We also put in investment in the power amplifier because that's what it takes to sell FBAR many times. And it changes depending on the generation, it changes depending on the architecture. So it's not one single particular architecture in RF that is pretty much acting concrete. It varies. So many times we sell discrete FBAR and we love to do that, but if we have to we sell those so-called end-to-end solutions that we pull, we call it frontend modules. We just don't the transceivers, I guess. But on a RF basis, we do cover the full (indiscernible) between the antenna to the base station [ph] transceiver. But if you're talking about things like SkyOne or RF360 by Qualcomm, we don't specifically go into that end. It doesn't mean we will never, we keep an open mind, as I said, and we are very opportunistic based on the fact that our simple strategy is we do products that can differentiate our sales and performance distinctly, and if we can't in any socket, we probably won't even participate in that socket.","JoAnne Feeney - ABR Investment Strategy","Okay, that's really helpful. Thanks. As a follow-up, you mentioned you're growing $0.06 with the mid range and low end smartphone makers, specifically in China. I'm wondering in that context, number one, you could describe for us where you think your second half growth is coming from in terms of say increase in dollar content, higher units in these mid range phones and perhaps if you have any sense of what percentage of your wireless revenue you think might shift towards these mid range phones and away from the high end where you've done so well?","Hock E. Tan","Thanks, JoAnne. You are really reading too much. Maybe it's my mistake. I will say we're doing a very unprofessional victory lap about the fact that finally we got into low end phones in China and that's because of FBAR, because as you know we have not participated much in those low end phones in China because of price and because of \u2013 and absolutely need to differentiate. Finally we say and it's because of FBAR which we've been talking about for years about the fact that its technology that drives its usage more than the price point of smartphones that is proven. That's all I'd say. And unfortunately things will be leading you to a fact that there's \u2013 now tell me how much is it going to drive your business? Well, a bit too early to tell, to be honest, JoAnne, because it depends on how successful those LTE-enabled white-box phones are going to be in China and I can't really tell (indiscernible) is just happening. It could be a one quarter wonder for all \u2013 I know I don't really know, I hope it isn't and if it can sustain it would be great for us. But what drives our business on a consistent basis I think also those large OEMs out there that we continue to be very, very well positioned and we see that continuing over the foreseeable future.","JoAnne Feeney - ABR Investment Strategy","Okay, fair enough. So that means that double digit growth you're anticipating, year-over-year double digit growth for wireless, the majority of that then is being driven by content gains as opposed to the yield curve?","Hock E. Tan","JoAnne, it's been content and year-on-year with the same large OEMs that we deal with, because of increasing band \u2013 number of bands and increasing complexity of architecture and bands like carrier aggregation coming in and as we mentioned a few other things before, content is still increasing and we are able to grow our content year-on-year in those generation phones.","JoAnne Feeney - ABR Investment Strategy","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets","Great. Thanks for taking my question, Hock, Tony and Bin. If you could focus a little bit on a segment you haven't talked much about and that would be the investor segment. I'm a little surprised to hear about your bullishness given \u2013 we keep hearing that the China end market seems soften and PMI results to get, I believe you're still fairly exposed to the China market on the industrial side. Can you talk to us a little bit about why you're feeling as confident about that market coming back?","Hock E. Tan","Okay. Well, I guess it's not just open night [ph]. As I mentioned, if you look at our Q1 last quarter that is and you look over the trend over the last several quarters, we have seen \u2013 having said that I am qualified, it's a gradual but very uptrend of demand resale in industrial in China but also even places like Europe where after the meltdown in the Europe over a year ago, people had given up as a lost cause. It has recovered. And in Japan, it is the other data point that gives me a lot of encouragement especially with a fairly low ended base, finally we are starting to see that the Japanese industrial OEMs, the big powerhouses that we sell many of our products too are also picking up steam. And the reason it began to steam over the last six months or nine months, six months in particular is not just strong domestic demand but they are able to export in China and emerging countries, of course, China helped by their currency. And even the Europeans are able to hold their own. So what that tells us is that there is an improvement in industrial demand. It may not be as strong or as clear as the way it was most, but it is more steady and it's definitely a trend. And that's part of the reason why I'm feeling more bullish about everybody than it is. Having said that, from a year ago we have grown 6% industrial; it's no great shape, but mid single digit for industrial year-on-year isn't too bad, at least it's not going down of late.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, great. If you could also talk a little bit maybe about the (indiscernible) business, some book to bill trends, maybe what you've seen recently in the market and what are customers are willing to lay in a little bit more backlog, how would you describe your visibility overall?","Hock E. Tan","Well, you are right in asking that question. Book to bill unfortunately for us it's not a very clear indicator because many of our larger OEMs and they comprise a big part of my revenues, we are on VMI, as I call it which are vendor managed inventories. Basically they fully direct from half, so there's almost no book to bill ratio as it applies to a big chunk of our revenues. The ballot [ph] applies at a smaller chunk and the small chunk and I hate to tell you even as you do data might not reflect what the total business sales is. So January bookings and February bookings so far has been pretty okay.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets","Great, thanks so much and congrats on the strong results.","Hock E. Tan","Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Sterne Agee. Please proceed.","Vijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee","Thanks. Nice job on the quarter and guide. Just a housekeeping question on the FBAR [ph] side. I know here you had dragged from one customer, but as the timing of all the transitions, as you look at the second half, do you feel comfortable with how the wireless side is working and especially I would think in China with the very high frequencies, 2.3, 2.6, you continue to drive FBAR versus (indiscernible) options out there?","Hock E. Tan","I understand your question and yes, we \u2013 it's pretty hard to provide any real forecast if that's what you mean but the way it happens \u2013 the way we are seeing things happening now, it's not different from what we've seen in the previous year or two except hopefully we now have larger content in those large OEM phones which we are feeling very good about. So, I think things are as we kind of expect them to be for this year.","Vijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee","All right, you answered my question. As a follow-up, when you look at the LSI side, I probably missed this, can you update us on the progress on the approval side and what \u2013 can you frame us \u2013 as you look at the markets there, what are the ASIC markets that you'll be focusing on as you go through that business?","Hock E. Tan","I'll try to answer the second question first. As far as we're concerned, as I mentioned earlier, we have not really taken over this company yet. I mean we have announced that in this country, but we can see but we don't touch. So at this point we're not touching and I'll be direct and say no position to know enough yet to be able to clearly articulate to you what our strategy on our ASIC business is at this point. All we will say is that whatever they have been doing we like and we like them to keep going on and doing what they've been doing. But as far as any specific strategy that we might have formulated, it's too early to tell seriously, Vijay. And on the second part, we're still going through regulatory approvals and the various worldwide approval of a regulatory body that need their approvals on and we haven't gotten all of them yet, and we're still working on ways to assist them. We also need shareholder approval from LSI which I believe will happen sometime in April. So we are hoping or we are planning, as you say rather than hoping, to see closing of this deal sometime in May. But again, it's an estimate at this point nothing guaranteed.","Vijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee","Got it, thanks a lot.","Bin Jiang","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","The final question comes from the line of Steve Smigie from Raymond James. Please proceed.","Steven Smigie - Raymond James","Great. Thanks a lot. I was hoping you guys could talk a little bit about the optical transceiver business maybe in terms of what you see as potential growth opportunity for the market this year? And then how you think you might perform relative to that market?","Hock E. Tan","Okay, that's a very good question and that's a very interesting question for me and I'll try to put in some comments. I'll tell you what we're seeing right now. I don't know what is going to happen the rest of the year, to be honest. It's hard to figure it out but in enterprise, the transceiver business overall is kind of \u2013 the optical transceiver business is being flattish. And no surprise, some of the OEMs out there has been saying that there may be winners or losers among the lot, but broadly I think the market is flattish. And the way we try to play in this market now is what we've always been trying to do which is pick up opportunities that we can produce fairly proprietary products and right on the core sales of those customers who adopt our proprietary design and use that to push their overall systems. And as I pointed out earlier, we started last year with 40G and that's more of a standard product but we were about the guy to do it at that time and do it for (indiscernible) with longer instances to be applied in data centers and we have been selling it very well and we continue to sell it very well. That's one of our drivers. The other thing that is also happening now is we just launched and are ramping another proprietary fiber optic that is bidirectional. What that really does is applicable particularly for data centers where we can reap [ph] our transceivers, our customers or their customers who are OEM can run using the same infrastructure or fiber OM3 fiber optic cable that have already been laid out in an existing legacy data center, just change the transceiver and suddenly transform the transceiver from running 10 gigabit to 40 gigabit by just putting new transceivers and boxes. That's one of the new product we launched and that's one I mentioned earlier in my remarks about transceivers that can simultaneously do 10 gigabit as well as 40 gigabit. That's the bidirectional product we have launched. We're depending on those kind of proprietary systems to give us an edge and gain us share to grow. But as far as the broader market is concerned what we're seeing now is fairly flat and sluggish, be it switching or routing market.","Steven Smigie - Raymond James","Okay, great. And then sort of on the (indiscernible) side then can you talk about the growth opportunity you're seeing for the year at this point? And in terms of what you're \u2013 when you're going for your design competitions, what innovations are you bringing that are allowing you to win this? Thanks.","Hock E. Tan","Well, our big thing in ASIC is our service. We have definitely very, very good ASIC, very proven ASIC and there are not too many people out there who can do those kind of ASIC and run it all the way through 28 gigabit per second which is what we are now covering generation of products out there and designs are doing now. And that's really our edge, our differentiation in a lot of opportunities we go against. Of course the other side to it is we are very tested and we have very good skills in integrating not just the service but the IP calls into one complex digital chip that we do for ASIC for our customers and we're very good at doing that. So we've continued to drive in that and frankly on our ASIC business, we're very linked to the customers we deal with and we deal with only a handful of large OEM customers. And as they succeed, so do we. If they don't grow as much, we don't grow as much either. But that's pretty much where we stand right now. And so in terms of \u2013 and we're very much focused on the enterprise networking business though we do some of it in high-performance computing. And what we're seeing now is high-performance computing is doing very good currently. So that's providing the engine of growth for us. As far as ASIC as an enterprise networking largely in the switches and all that, growth here is okay. Over the last few years we've been growing at 20% a year. We expect close to that this year as well. But it's not something that ramps up fairly rapidly.","Steven Smigie - Raymond James","Okay, great. If I could take one last one here on FBAR. Obviously as the bands proliferate up because of LTE, a number of them are in certain higher frequency ranges. What I'm trying to understand is how many of them might be sort of on the border there between SAW and TC-SAW can do or low end ballplayers [ph]? So how many of the bands that are going up there are really sort of right along the border where it might be more competitive versus high end where you guys with your eighth to ninth generation can really differentiate and be sure to capture share?","Hock E. Tan","It's a hard question to answer because yes, I'm sure there are bands that are on the edge that's put in, but some of these bands are on the edge because of how they are architected in any phone system. For instance, they are stuck next to certain other bands and certain other functions that may interfere with their performance. Certainly the band that is on the margin may become not on the margin any longer. Equally the other direction even if you put a band that is not so on the margin but in a very clean environment and that doesn't happen too often, you might get away with temperature (indiscernible). It doesn't happen too often though. But it's hard. If it's \u2013 this return is not \u2013 is very undetermined depending on the system and the architecture of each of the handsets. The broader picture is it is evolving. As you put in all bands and this holds carrier (indiscernible) bands and some of these bands are harder and harder and even if all bands are on the margin and you put a bunch of them together, they all become non-marginal, they become (indiscernible). And as more of that happens, the trend toward (indiscernible) will continue to move up.","Bin Jiang","Thank you, operator.

Joining me today are Hock Tan, President and CEO; and Tom Krause, Chief Financial Officer of Broadcom Limited. After market close today, Broadcom distributed a press release and financial tables describing our financial performance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017. If you did not receive a copy, you may obtain the information from the Investor section of Broadcom's website at www.broadcom.com.","This conference call is being webcast live and a recording will be available via telephone playback for one-week. It will also be archived in the Investor section of our website at broadcom.com.","During the prepared comments section of this call, Hock and Tom will be providing details of our third quarter and fiscal year 2017 results, guidance for our first fiscal quarter of 2018, and some commentary regarding the business environment. We will take questions after the end of our prepared comments.","In addition to U.S. GAAP reporting, Broadcom reports certain financial measures on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the tables attached to today\u2019s press release. Comments made during today\u2019s call will primarily refer to our non-GAAP financial results.","Please refer to our press release today and our recent filings with the SEC for information on the specific risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Hock Tan. Hock?","Hock Tan","Thank you, Ashish. Good afternoon, everyone.","Well, we closed our fiscal 2017 on a very strong note with solid financial results for the fourth fiscal quarter. Fourth quarter revenue of $4.85 billion grew 17% year-on-year and 9% sequentially. On the earnings front, earnings per share were $4.59 growing by 32% year-on-year and 12% sequentially.","Our business continue to become more profitable through fiscal 2017. We achieved operating margins of 47% in our most recent quarter comfortably ahead of our long-term operating margin target of 45% which we had announced at the end of fiscal 2016 and EBITDA rose to 50%. This led to substantially improved free cash flow generation in 2017 which drove the 72% increase in our dividends we announced today.","As you may recall, these latest dividend increase comes on top of the doubling in dividends we had announced at the end of fiscal year 2016. We remain very focus on increasing capital return to our shareholders.","We also continue to successfully execute our M&A strategy having completed acquisition of Brocade early in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 this current quarter adding one more business to our broad portfolio of networking and storage franchises. Against this backdrop, clearly our business continues to be strong. All our 20 product franchises continue to perform extremely well.","Before I turn to a discussion of segment results, please note that commentary today for the fourth quarter does not include any contribution from Brocade. As I look forward within each of this segment commentary, I will also touch on specific trends and growth drivers for our business in fiscal 2018.","Guidance however for fiscal quarter does include a partial quarter of expected contribution from the Brocade Fiber Channels SAN business. Please also note that this first quarter 2018 is a 14-week quarter for us.","Starting on Wired our largest segment, in the fourth quarter Wired revenue was $2.15 billion growing 4% year-on-year, declining 3% sequentially. The Wired segment represented 45% of our total revenue. As expected Wired segment revenue declined sequentially as the result of the typical seasonal decline in demand for our broadband access and set-top box products.","Similar to a number of our peers, we also experienced a slowdown in demand for our optical products from access and metro networks. In contrast however demand from data centers continue to hold up quite well into the fourth quarter.","Turning to the first quarter of 2018, we expect to see the bottom of the seasonal decline in demand for set-top box and broadband access. And if we look further into the rest of '18, we are rather excited about the ramp that we are enabling for our key cloud customers and couple of OEMs in artificial intelligence.","In broadband we're also seeing increasing traction on 10G technology to support broadband video delivery. Beyond even that point, we see that 10G cable technology going full duplex.","Moving on to wireless, in the fourth quarter wireless revenue was $1.8 billion growing 33% year-on-year and 40% sequentially. This wireless segment represented 37% of our total revenue. Fourth quarter wireless revenue was driven by the ramp in shipments of next-generation platform from our large North American smartphone customer. The growth was partially offset by a decline in shipments to other customers and the substantial year-on-year growth in revenue was driven by the large increase as we had indicated in Broadcom's total dollar content in this new platform.","As we look into first quarter 2018, unlike the last two years we expect wireless revenue to continue to grow sequentially as the ramming demand from our North American customer this year was pushed out compared to prior years.","Going beyond that into '18 - into the rest of 2018, we see significant increase in FBAR content driven by the need for additional filtering at the antenna. We are also very excited by the launch - the second half of '18 of the next generation WiFi products, the 802.11ax which we expect to see happen at retail and progressing to handsets.","Let me now turn to our enterprise storage segment. In the fourth quarter 2017, enterprise storage revenue was $645 million growing 15% year-on-year and declining 12% sequentially. The storage segment represented 13% of October revenue. Sequential decline in storage revenue was driven by an anticipated correction in demand for hard disk drive products.","In contrast, our servers and storage connectivity business, the [immigrate] business experienced an increase in demand driven by the Purley server launch cycle. Looking into the first quarter 2018, we're seeing this Purley launch continue to gain traction and drive very strong growth in demand for our several storage connectivity products. We also expect HDD described demand to have bottomed in the first quarter and start to recover.","Starting with the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the enterprise storage segment - this enterprise storage segment will include Brocade Fiber Channel SAN business which is expected to generate a partial quarter revenue contribution of $250 million in Q1 fiscal '18. Beyond this as we look into 2018 we see the storage landscape in being driven fairly well by our products supporting the adoption of All-Flash arrays in storage appliances infrastructure with our PCI Express and NVMe technology.","Finally our last segment industrial, fourth quarter industrial segment revenue was $257 million representing 5% of total revenue. Revenue for this segment grew 59% year-on-year, 8% sequentially and this strong year-over-year growth however included a impact from a large increase in our IP licensing revenue which as you know tends to be quite lumpy in nature.","What is significant is that sustainable industrial resale continue to grow double digits year-on-year and looking into the first quarter. While we expect IP licensing revenue to decline sequentially, industrial shipments and resale are likely to continue to trend as they did in the preceding quarter. And in fact for the rest of 2018, we see the strong adoption and ramp of our optical isolation products to continue to drive growth coming from electric vehicles.","So in summary, for the fourth quarter fiscal quarter we delivered very strong financial results. Our first quarter fiscal 2018 revenue continues to be good as we see an outlook of $5.3 billion which includes the partial quarter contribution from Brocade. This will position us we believe for very strong start to the new fiscal year. We have made great progress I believe in executing to all key parts of our strategy through fiscal 2017.","Solid revenue growth and improved profitability which ended up exceeding our current financial targets led to a significant increase in capital return to our shareholders. These achievements coupled with the expected rapid integration of Brocade and a background of continued strength in our various businesses will allow us to now improve on our long-term target operating model particularly as it applies to 2018.","While we will continue having said all that to target long-term sustainable revenue growth of just 5% even as in the first quarter fiscal '18 we're seeing double digit growth, we are increasing the gross margin target to 65%. We expect to sustain R&D expenses at about 15% of net revenue and drive SG&A expenses below 3% of net revenue. These positions us to increase the target for operating profit margin to be 47.5% and sustain a 50% EBITDA margin for this company.","With that, let me turn the call over to Tom for more detailed review of our fourth quarter financials and first quarter outlook. Tom?","Thomas Krause","Thank you, Hock and good afternoon everyone. My comments today will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results from continuing operations unless otherwise specially noted. A reconciliation of our GAAP and our non-GAAP data is included with the earnings release issued today and is also available on our website at broacom.com.","Let me start first and comment on the progress we have made toward our long-term target operating model. As Hock outlined and I'm pleased to report for fiscal '17 we did exceed our long-term target of greater than 60% gross margins and 45% operating margins. We delivered fourth quarter 2017 gross margins of 63.3%, a 250 basis point increase from the same quarter last year and operating margin of 47.3% which was a 580 basis point increase from the same quarter of last year.","On capital returns as you recall, starting last year we did increase the target for aggregate dividends to 50% of free cash flow on a trailing 12 month basis and a result of that financial policy did double our dividend at the end of fiscal 2016.","Leveraging the significant improvement in profitability and operating cash flow generation in fiscal 2017, we announced today a 72% increase in dividends. This increase takes our interim dividend to $2.75 per share or $7 per share on a full-year basis and represents an approximate return of $3 billion annually to shareholders.","We closed the acquisition of Brocade three weeks into the fiscal quarter of 2018. We completed the divesture of Brocade's campus WiFi and switch business to [Arras] for 800 million in cash in the first fiscal quarter of '18 and we also sold Brocade's headquarter building in Santa Clara for approximately 225 million in cash also in the first quarter.","These transactions along with the completion of other some of other smaller deals marks the completion of portfolio rationalization activities for the Brocade acquisition and resulted in lowering the total consideration for Brocade with approximately $5 billion. We look forward to fully integrating Brocade over the next few quarters and expect our total operating expenses in fiscal '18 including Brocade to remain within our target of 17.5% of net revenue.","Let me take a moment to reiterate our financial policies which remain committed to going forward. We expect to continue to target long-term component gross leverage of approximately two times EBITDA as long as the cost of that debt remains attractive. We also plan to continue to target aggregate dividends of approximately 50% of free cash flow on a trailing 12 month basis.","Given our free cash flow generation, we believe that this will also allow us sufficient balance sheet flexibility to pursue acquisitions that are consistent with our proven business model. As we look forward, the credit quality of the business continues to strengthen and remain focused on maintaining and improving our investment grade rating including in our current debt.","As Hock mentioned we're also updating our long-term target operating model. Sustainable long-term revenue growth remains at 5% on an annual basis. Gross margin target increases to 65% and operating margin targets increased to 47.5%. Target free cash flow as a percent of revenue increases from 35% to 40% and I would note that includes a long-term CapEx target remaining at 3% of net revenue.","With that let me quickly summarize the results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 focusing primarily on balance sheet and cash flow items. We delivered strong financial results for the fourth quarter starting with revenue at $4.85 billion which grew by 8.5% sequentially and 16.9% year-on-year. Our days sales outstanding were 46 days, a decrease of three days from the prior quarter. Our inventory at the end of the fourth quarter was $1.447 billion flattish from the prior quarter.","We generated $1.959 billion in operational cash flow which includes the impact of $345 million payment to fund our legacy pension plan in the U.S. Free cash flow in the fourth quarter was $1.726 billion or 35.6% of net revenue. I am pleased that even with the impacts from the pension payment which is approximately 7% net revenue, we were able to drive free cash flow conversion above the 35% target we had set last year.","Capital expenditure in the fourth quarter was $233 million or 4.8% of net revenue. As we've indicated on prior calls, we expect overall CapEx to decline meaningfully starting in 2018. We expect CapEx to approach our long-term target of 3% of net revenue in the second half of fiscal '18.","Moving on to additional items and the cash flow statement, a total of $439 million in cash was spent on the company's dividend and partnership distribution payments in the fourth quarter. We received approximately $4 billion from the issuance of long-term debt to finance the Brocade acquisition and we also received approximately $440 million from the sale and leaseback of the Irvine campus.","We entered the fourth quarter of the cash balance of $11.2 billion but I\u2019ll note the cash balance was an elevated level through the fourth quarter in anticipation of closing the acquisition of Brocade.","Now let me turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 which includes expected contributions from Brocade's Fiber Channel SAN business for a portion of the quarter. Also to note, this is a 14-week fiscal quarter. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions and we do not intend to update this guidance. This guidance is for results from continuing operations only.","Net revenue is expected to be $5.3 billion plus or minus $75 million, gross margin is expected to be 64% plus or minus one percentage point, operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $900 million, tax provision is forecasted to be approximately $106 million, net interest expense and other is expected to be approximately $126 million.","The diluted share account forecast is 458 million shares. Share-based compensation expense will be approximately $300 million. CapEx will be approximately $210 million. And as a reminder, our first quarter is generally a weaker quarter for operating cash flow due to the payment of our annual employee bonuses relating to the prior fiscal year. In addition we do expect to start incurring cash restructuring expenses related to integrating Brocade.","Okay, finally before we open up the call for questions, I do want to briefly address where we stand on redomiciliation and Qualcomm. First on redomiciliation, on November 2, I think as everybody knows we announced our intent to initiate a redomiciliation process to change the parent company of the Broadcom Corporate Group from a Singapore company to a U.S. Corporation. The redomiciliation will occur whether or not there is corporate tax reform in the United States.","The redomiciliation is subject to a shareholder vote and is expected to be affected in a manner intended to be tax-free to shareholders. We are confident that our shareholders will support this move. The final form and timing of the redomiciliation and a shareholder vote will depend in part on tax reform efforts in the United States.","On the Qualcomm front, on November 6 we made a proposal to acquire Qualcomm for a per share consideration of $70 in cash and stock. Our proposal represents the 28% premium over the closing price of Qualcomm common stock on November 2, 2017 the last unaffected trading day and a premium of 33% to Qualcomm's unaffected 30 day volume weighted average price. We expected the proposed transaction would be completed within approximately 12 months following the signing of a definitive agreement.","Earlier this week on December 4 we notified Qualcomm of our intention to nominate a slate of 11 independent highly qualified individuals for election to the Qualcomm Board at the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders which Qualcomm has announced will be held on March 6, 2018. The highly qualified slate brings significant technology sector financial and operational experience. While we have taken this step, it remains our strong preference to engage in a constructive dialogue with Qualcomm.","We firmly believe that this complementary transaction will position the combined company as a global communications leader enabling us to deliver more advanced integrated solutions for our global customers and drive enhance shareholder value. We continue to receive positive feedback from stockholders and customers.","In addition, after having had initial meetings with certain relevant antitrust authorities, we remain confident that any regulatory requirements necessary to complete a combination will be met in a timely manner. Given our common strengthen and shared focus on technology innovation, we're confident we can quickly realize the benefits for all stakeholders.","As a reminder, the purpose of today's call is to discuss our quarterly earnings. Please keep your questions focused on today's financial results. We will not be commenting in the Q&A on Qualcomm or the redomiciliation activities.","With that, let me turn it back to the operator. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Your line is now open.","Stacy Rasgon","First I guess a tactical one. Given where it's falling in Q1 how much revenue in OpEx is actually really coming in, in that extra weeks. Should we think of both of those as a full week or is the revenue may be less than a full week and the OpEx is a full week? What's the best way for us to think about the different puts and takes in your guidance impacted by that extra week.","Thomas Krause","I think is as you look at the seasonality in our business and you look at where we are in Q1 relative to where seasonally typically going in Q2 you can you can argue I think we believe it's less than an additional week of contribution. And OpEx what I would suggest to you is flat because we're basically just taking an extra week from a payroll and other [front] perspectives on the OpEx side.","Stacy Rasgon","For my follow-up I wanted to ask a little bit about the guidance and particular the segments. So you said wireless was up, I wasn't sure if that was because of the extra week or if that was normalized for the extra week and I guess given the metrics wireless seems like it is strong storage looks like it's bottomed and other pieces are growing. It seems to me the wired infrastructure may still be down sequentially, I guess if I normalize for the extra week given the drivers that Hock talked about.","I guess could you give us a little more color on, I guess how much of the strength in wireless is extra week versus normalized and I guess what are those drivers for the rest of the guidance imply for wireless as we go to January quarter.","Hock Tan","The best way to describe is to expand a bit on what Tom was saying is, you know 80% of our revenues is direct OEM revenues and so the extra week had very little impact for Q1 in terms of topline revenue. The industry revenue does have an impact obviously on a bases that is resale is very time base and so you might say on overall revenue basis from if I were to have an estimate that additional week provides probably an additional one foot addition of a week's revenue you are going to look at it.","But as Tom indicated expenses we will be showing a full week of expenses which are largely for a company of our nature obviously salaries, people costs. So full week of expense is probably one third of a week of topline is the best estimate to put on a consolidated basis.","And based on that to answer your question on wireless, it really doesn\u2019t make much difference. Our wireless business is all direct largely. It makes very little different that there is an additional one week, but it is strong. As I indicated in my remarks, it is strong because of the fact that unlike the year before and the year before that as well, the rollover of the product life cycle of a North American, lot of American smartphone manufacture has been sort of push-out, push-out by over one month.","Stacy Rasgon","So, I guess the wired outlook then is just the set-top box I guess bottoming in Q1 which is driving that or there other numbers.","Hock Tan","Set-top box and broadband access, carrier access is bottomed out in Q1. Against that datacenters continue to be okay, good and a big part of it driven by the ramp of our opportunity in AI in cloud and a couple of OEMs.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Ross Seymore","Hock I want to follow-up on the wired side of things. The last couple of quarters on average you've been kind of the low to slightly below mid-single-digit growth in that business. You talked a little bit about what the broadband access and set-top boxes has done, you talked about optical and AI side. If we think about those three buckets as we look into fiscal 2018, can you just talk about the direction that they should go, is there going to be the optical side snapping back or this year it seemed like you had a number of headwind that might not persist into next year. So any color you could give on an annual basis would be helpful.","Hock Tan","Sure, and you did touch on that in your saying that is true. In 2017 especially second half of 2017 in our wired business which we run into lot of puts and takes but quite a bit of headwinds in that whole regard simply because especially in the second half you start to see decline, seasonal decline in broadband, very much broadband than in the later - and especially in optical, we all have seen the slowdown in demand from metro and access network particularly out of China but against that we see datacenters continue to perform very well.","And the net result of it was, has been relatively slow to flattish, if you look at the whole year, flattish slow single-digit growth in wired in 2017 with those headwinds. 2018 the sense we have is we've seen a lot of those headwinds and the worst of those headwind seems to be over, datacenters continue to be very well - presenting itself very well not just from switching routing which have always been very good for all this period but also the additional push from deep learning chips that we are providing for a few large customers.","And against that, given that we have seen the worst on broadband I think wired business in 2018 will probably grow over 5%.","Ross Seymore","Tom switching gears over to your side for a moment, the free cash flow target increasing from 35% to 40%, the dividend increase was a bit more than I expected at 72% it seems like you guys actually were closer to 60% of free cash flow. So I guess as we go forward one is the policy change at all, are you giving back more and then two what's the biggest driver of that free cash flow margin increasing, is it one-time charges going away, profitability increasing any color on those will be helpful.","Thomas Krause","So Ross obviously you can do the calculation on the free cash flow just based on the cash flow statements but there were a couple of things that we took into consideration. One, as I think you know we had a big campus initiative both in Southern California around the Irvine Campus and then up here and in San Jose and a lot of that is tail off and then we went off and actually monetized the Irvine Campus which we just reported.","So we thought we should give back that portion as well to shareholders in form of dividend. So that's the biggest driver, the CapEx initiatives beyond that will really around the test program the confinement work we did which I think is largely done.","And then of course we delevered, we delevered around the pensions. So we had the [gear] pension which is the LSI pension that we inherited when we bought LSI several years ago. We took steps toward derisking that pension by fully funding it in affects and turning it more into a fixed income based portfolios. So we think that was the right thing to do but it was also a onetime event that hit free cash flow and so we backed it out.","Going forward really it's all about the business model and the financial model that gets put out of that business model that Hock articulated earlier. CapEx is coming down to 3% as a percentage of revenue which is consistent with the fabless or largely fabless business model and given the operating margins of the business a balance sheet that's got 2x gross leverage you know less than 4% sort of average cost of debt capital we think 40% is a very achievable target.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Craig Hettenbach","Hock now that you've closed Brocade can you talk about just the synergies from a technology and product perspective and the implications to your enterprise storage business?","Hock Tan","Well, the main reason we acquired Brocade very simply put it that we believe that product line is a very sustainable product franchise. It fall and also certain customers with mission critical data center storage requirements. They need to use Fiber Channel SAN storage area network.","The more conventional so to speak basis of iSCSI, IP networking stuff not of a performance level, quality level that will address those mission-critical requirements that financial institutions as an example agencies, governments need to make work in those storage systems.","So it's fairly unique in some regards but it's a nice addition to our store enterprise storage portfolio where we tend to address more conventional storage requirements and we see this business as a business that will continue into the foreseeable future and not just in America worldwide simply because this storage - this kind of storage system and network fiber channel is literally bulletproof, mission-critical systems and practically not hackable.","Craig Hettenbach","If I could just follow-up and look to expand on your comments about AI and you know the type of visibility you have in some of those product ramps, as well as just the role you expect ASICS to play from your side?","Hock Tan","Well we believe a lot of these emerging requirements that we're seeing in very specific application-specific end market specific requirements fall deep learning as we call it artificial intelligence other people call it when you need training and you need inference on large databases that continually upgrade. We tend to see that's been very customized. A lot of software that needs to be written on a hardware silicon platform that because of the particular nature of the application will tend to be very customized and we are making, we're producing cut in a nutshell ASIC of custom silicon solutions that addresses those market niches and it's pretty substantial. And our visibility today is extremely good in terms of the demand for this product.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","John Pitzer","Hock in your prepared comments you talked about excitement around continued FBAR content increases in fiscal year 2018. I am kind of curious to what extent is that just new flagship phones growing as a percent of the overall mix where content growth has already been very strong. To what extent is an expectation that maybe flagship phones that get introduced in calendar year 2018 will continue to have content growth and to the extent that it's the latter - this year you gave us pretty explicit guidance as to how much you thought your content was going up, I'd be curious as we look out to calendar year 2018 how we should think about that FBAR content story.","Hock Tan","Well, it's an interesting story and by the way to answer your question it is on the same old story again of our more FBAR and more [band] this is not - this is actually thing of filtering as being stage. This is literally - most of the front end modules we talked about in the past where we have power amplifiers, and FBAR filters we tend to put it close to the transceivers where you filter signal that our channel by the antenna.","What we're seeing here is going in and filtering the signals close to the antenna and before a channel is down to the front-end module. That's the thing that have changed. Some of the craving additional level of filter level of states of filtering which in effect increase -- and that increases the amount of filters unique and this advance are the only thing that can do very effectively those filtering that we call it extraction of signals at the antenna. And the benefit of all that it allows antenna to be shared as opposed to multiple antenna.","John Pitzer","Any sense on what this new application can do to your dollar content in the phone?","Hock Tan","Probably should tell you as we progress through the year. Now might be a bit to mature, but eventually it's going to increase it.","John Pitzer","And then as my follow-on Hock, I just wanted to get back to your AI comments in the prior question, it just seems like over the last couple of quarters, I wouldn't say you were being dismissive of the market opportunity, but you clearly weren\u2019t sort of highlighting it as one of the key drivers. It sounds like you're being a little bit more front foot on the AI opportunity.","Did something change and can you help us understand how you're thinking about your TAM in this market over time?","Hock Tan","Well, the dollars as they affect us have certainly grown a lot. So I guess I better had make a few comments on it as dollars drive it.","John Pitzer","Any sense on how we should think about the total addressable market over a three-year horizon Hock?","Hock Tan","We see driving our dollars to a level not dissimilar, but significant levels not that far off from even now switching revenue.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Vivek Arya","Just first as a near-term question on wireless. Hock on the last call, I think you said and you expected Q1 to hold, which at that time sounded flattish. Now you're saying Q1 could be better.","My question is that something changed, was it just perhaps conservatism before, but more importantly, how do you track the sell through of the different flavors of products that your customer is setting to make sure that you're shipping in line with sell through?","Hock Tan","Well, as I mentioned on your latter question, 80% of our revenues, over 80% goes direct to customers and we get very good visibility in orders backlog with our customers. So that just I believe that in fact is pretty clear, over 80% goes directly to our various customers itself.","And that enables us to track very well, that also enables to attract that over shipment in terms of in a sense that a customer has taken more products than they truly need because it adjusts itself very, very quickly. So it's just doing it directly as opposed to going through any distributor or middlemen.","And as far as the question on wireless, yeah I can answer, it's not nothing we consolidate them. Since we last talked a quarter ago, visibility has obviously become full -- crystal clear and we're just in interest of being transparent, we're just passing on what we see today.","Vivek Arya","And then for my follow-up Tom, you raised your long-term targets on margins. When I look at gross margins versus what you reported in Q4, there seems to be another I think 170 basis points of upside to the 65% target. But on operating margin, you're already above the target. So I'm just curious what's driving that Delta.","Thomas Krause","Well, I'm not sure if I totally understand your question, but, yes, basically as you look at it with Brocade, you're right, we're running 64-ish guide. I think what you're seeing consistently, and probably the key driver of the overall financial model of the new targets is our ability to continue to drive gross margin expansion.","But I think a lot of that ties back to the business model and continue to introduce more and more content rich products that carry higher values. And I think that's what's driving and it's consistent for a very long period of time.","And obviously given the scale of the company, we'll continue to reinvest in R&D at a very healthy clip 15% of expanded revenue. But we're growing mid-single digits, obviously we did better last year. We're keeping SG&A lean and simple which is consistent with our model, and that gives us leverage.","So you're right, I think we'll continue to monitor the long term model. We've obviously updated it a number of times over the past several years, but right now we're very comfortable with a target of 65%, 47.5% operating margins.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Shrivastava with BMO. Your line is now open.","Ambrish Shrivastava","Hock, I just wanted to visit the longer term driver for wireless specifically in '18.","Besides the N10, you also talked about WiFi in the back half of the year. And I think correct me if I'm wrong, you said first retail and then it starts to show up in handsets? So can you give us some idea on what that would do to content within the handset space, and then I had a quick follow-up as well.","Hock Tan","Well, it does, but when you're trying to run it over time it becomes very hard and I'm very [low] to give you misleading answers. But all it does is definitely directionally pushing in the right direction.","And I've always indicated to you guys, on a long term basis is what you're asking year-on-year, we are seeing dollar content increase which I'll say a large part of this content increase driving topline revenues in wireless closer to the range north of 10%, 10% to 15% annually on an annual growth rate basis.","And that's all content increase in our view where there is an improvement of WiFi connectivity through 802.11ax and\/or more FBAR as we enhance the RF experience on smartphones, it all comes back to the same thing.","We seem to see based on history empirically that last five years CAGR, Compounded Annual Growth Rate, CAGR is around the mid-teens. And using that - and using the trends in architecture and designs and [indiscernible] or phones that the next five years will see that same CAGR of mid-teens.","Ambrish Shrivastava","And then on the non-wireless side, Marvell and Cavium are proposed to be combining. Just from your vantage point, does it or does it not change the competitive landscape the way you see it? Thank you.","Hock Tan","We don't really see any material change at all as far as our business is concerned. As far as their business is concerned, of course, there could be major impact, and I'm not dismissing that at all. But as far as we are concerned and our various franchise businesses are concerned, we do not see any impact.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Harlan Sur","On the OpEx guide, if I assume the OpEx run rate similar to Q4 for core Broadcom, and then normalize to the 14-week quarter and then try to back out the implied Brocade OpEx, I'm actually coming out with Brocade OpEx contribution on an annualized basis around $280 million which is right where you want your Brocade OpEx to be post integration back when you first announced this acquisition.","So am I doing the math correctly? And I guess the question is how much more cost synergies will be coming out on the integration plans over the next few quarters?","Thomas Krause","I think the benefit of being able to spend a little extra time between sign to close, and of course, the benefit of being able to announce number of the sale processes which were in effect with structuring activities in time has helped us get to our target model with brocade factor.","Now, that doesn't mean there isn't more to do. I would suggest we probably got about 20 million a quarter in operating expenses in the business right now on a run rate basis that still need to come out of the model.","But we are ahead of schedule relative to where we normally would be when we close the deal. And I would expect over the next six months or so, we'll be trending towards sort of getting that 20 million out of the business on a quarterly basis.","Harlan Sur","And Hock question for you. As we speak with many of your datacenter customers, they're all anxiously awaiting Tomahawk 3, 12.8 terabytes of total switching throughput. I think the bigger opportunity here is that you're moving the market to 50 gigabits per switch port using this new PAM-4 technology which means that you not only change to switch silicon but you have to change the [indiscernible] products and after components as well. So you've got a lot of potential for content enhancement here for you and the team.","So I guess the question is, are you still on track to get Tomahawk 3 to customers end of this year, beginning of the next year? And do you have a view as to how big this opportunity could be for the datacenter business probably starting in 2019?","Hock Tan","Answering your first question, yes, we are very much on track to get samples out to our customers by the end of this year, calendar year. Very much on track. And as far as how big the impact will be, well to be fair, and that's not - I hope that may not get carried away.","Tomahawk 3 which goes to 12.8 terabyte throughput, will just replace to a large extent, the existing versions of Tomahawk 2, we just thought that to be fair, and Tomahawk 1 which is 3.2. Now, of course, it replaces 8 by 4x and gives us therefore room opportunity for delivering more value to our customers. But at the end of the day, the number of sockets - there's a total level of replacement of existing sockets.","With higher throughput equivalent, silicon, no doubt, which gives us some enhanced the dollar value, but it's not a total add-on in the overall scheme of things.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Chris Caso with Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Chris Caso","Your first question is regarding seasonality and how we should be thinking about the April quarter. Of course, I know you don't want to provide guidance for that now. But as we build our models, I assume we would be taking out the extra half week of revenue as we model out April. How should we also be thinking about wireless therapies? I guess there was some extra wireless revenue in the January quarter during the push-out. How should we think of that as we build out our April expectations?","Thomas Krause","Chris, obviously we're not going to give guidance on the April quarter. What I tell you is, yes, there is a little bit of the extra week. That's right. But I think more importantly, we've talked about the long-term model here is mid-single digits. And I think that's where we plan to be a going forward.","Chris Caso","And just as a follow-up on Brocade. You guys had set out some targets. I think it was 850 million EBITDA. My assumption, what you're talking about will take any additional 20 million out that basically gets you to that target. Are you still - stand behind that target the potential if you do a little better than that?","Thomas Krause","No, I'm sure Hock believes we can do a little better than that, but we certainly are in and around that target today in the business. Actually, I think what we are happy about is the business is performing very well. It's performing on plan and we think it's a great addition to the other 19 franchises we have in the portfolio.","Hock Tan","Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes Broadcom's conference call for today. You may now disconnect.

Please go ahead, sir.","Ashish Saran","Thank you, operator and good afternoon everyone. Joining me today are Hock Tan, President and CEO and Tony Maslowski, Chief Financial Officer of Avago Technologies.","After the market closed today, Avago distributed a press release and financial tables describing our financial performance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2015. If you did not receive a copy, you may obtain the information from the Investors section of Avago\u2019s website at www.avagotech.com. This conference call is being webcast live and a recording will be available via telephone playback for 1 week. It will also be archived in the Investors section of our website at avagotech.com.","During the prepared comments section of this call, Hock and Tony will be providing details of our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2015 results, background to our first quarter fiscal year 2016 outlook and some commentary regarding the business environment. We will take questions after the end of our prepared comments.","In addition to U.S. GAAP reporting, Avago reports certain financial measures on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the tables attached to today\u2019s press release. Comments made during today\u2019s call will primarily refer to our non-GAAP financial results. Please refer to our press release today and our recent filings with the SEC for information on the specific risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Hock Tan. Hock?","Hock Tan","Thank you, Ashish. Good afternoon, everyone. I will start with a short summary of fourth quarter and fiscal year 2015 business highlights and Tony will continue with more details on our financial results.","So, fiscal 2015 was an important year for Avago where we saw the significant increase in our top line from a full year of LSI contribution augmented by strong growth in wireless revenue. On this expanded base, we drove higher levels of profitability through leveraging our largest scale, continual richer product mix and the full achievement of LSI acquisition cost synergies to deliver operating margins over 40%. In other words, mission accomplished.","Our fourth quarter results exemplified this, loud and clear. Revenue came in at $1.85 billion, a 6% sequential increase and continuing to be very pleased with our execution which drove the fourth quarter margins above the high end of our range and earnings per share to $2.51. We ended our fiscal year on a very strong note delivering record levels of revenue and profitability.","Let us now turn to a discussion of our segments starting with wireless. In the fourth quarter, wireless segment represented 37% of our total revenue from continuing operations in this very difficult strong seasonal fourth quarter. As we expected during this seasonal upturn, revenue from our wireless segment grew by 10% sequentially, with the customary product ramp at our North American customer partially offset by the product cycle rollover at one of our large Asian customers. While there was an increase in overall RF content in the new phone model, our, Avago\u2019s RF content on a dollar basis in the new phone model remained largely flat, the same as it was in the prior generation. We had to walk away from supplying additional RF content in the new phone model because of a constrained filter manufacturing capacity. This will not happen again.","Our long-term expectation for our wireless business remains very strong and we expect our RF content per smartphone to increase at over 20% every year. We have concrete plans in place to address this. We may remain on track with our plan to increase FBAR filter capacity in fiscal 2016 by 50% as we convert our fab from 6-inch to 8-inch wafer manufacturing. We also expect our portfolio in fab to remain at near full capacity as we start to pre-build inventory to support anticipated new phone launches later in fiscal 2016.","Now, looking more short-term at the first fiscal quarter 2016, unlike last year, we do see a seasonal decline in demand and expect our wireless revenue to sequentially decline in the low-teens on a percentage basis. Last year, first quarter demand had held up offsetting normal seasonality, but we don\u2019t see the same phenomenon this year. And therefore, on a year-over-year basis, we expect our wireless segment revenue to also decline similar to the sequential drop.","While that is just one part of our portfolio, let me now turn to another segment of portfolio, which has been performing rather amazing, and that\u2019s our enterprise storage segment. In the fourth quarter, enterprise storage revenue grew by 9% sequentially and enterprise storage represented 35% of our total revenue from continuing operations. In the fourth quarter, we also saw strong growth from our RAID and SAS products. We also benefited from increasing shipments into enterprise and datacenter hard disk drives. Despite macro worries, enterprise storage markup held up quite well in fiscal 2015 and in fact, our core enterprise storage revenues in the fourth quarter grew close to 20% on a year-on-year basis. Looking towards first quarter 2016, we expect this segment to maintain its momentum from the strong fourth quarter and we expect revenue to be up slightly on a sequential basis. We also believe we may be gaining share in this segment.","On to wired infrastructure, in the fourth quarter, wired revenue grew by 2% sequentially and our wired segment represented approximately 20% of our total revenue from continuing operations. The ASIC business was up slightly in the fourth quarter driven primarily by an increase in shipments into routing, especially edge routing. Our fiber optics business after a strong third quarter maintained much of its momentum into the fourth quarter delivering a small sequential increase. We saw increase in fiber-to-the-home shipments and stable deliveries into the enterprise OEM market. The addition of wafer fab capacity at our Breinigsville, Pennsylvania at a meeting laser facility help us better meet the increase in demand for fiber-to-the-home market. In the next quarter, first quarter, we expect sustained performance from this segment and project our revenue to also be up slightly here.","Moving on to industrial, in the fourth quarter, industrial and other miscellaneous products represented 8% of our total revenues from continuing operations. Focusing on industrial, resales held up reasonably well during the quarter and were in fact up slightly. By region, Asia-Pacific was quite strong with e-resales growing close to double-digits. Europe also grew by nearly mid-digits sequentially, but Americas and Japan were both weak and resales declined in the mid single-digits sequentially in those regions. However, similar to a number of peers, we saw \u2013 we took a cautionary tone from customers during the quarter and consequently reduced shipments into our distributors, which drove channel inventory down. As a result, our industrial segment revenue declined by 10% sequentially in the fourth quarter. And please keep in mind we recognized revenue here on a sell-in basis.","As we look at first quarter, anticipating the normal seasonal declines as well as of course lingering macro uncertainty, we plan to continue to reduce inventory in distribution. And accordingly, we expect revenue for industrial segment to decline in the low single-digit sequentially.","In summary therefore, after the strong close for fiscal 2015, we expect an approximate 4% sequential decline in consolidated first quarter 2016 revenue, driven primarily by seasonality in our Wireless and Industrial segments, offsetting projected sustained performance from our Wired and Enterprise Storage segments. With the LSI integration completed in fiscal 2015, we have created a very powerful business model that leverage our largest scale and increase diversity to deliver strong growth in earnings for the year. As Tony will provide more color on his \u2013 in his summary, we expect our earnings strength to carry over into the first fiscal quarter regardless of revenue seasonality. And as we go into the rest of fiscal 2016, we expect this earnings machine to further strengthen with the pending Broadcom acquisition.","With this in mind, I would like to mention that the Broadcom acquisition process continue to progress very smoothly and day one integration planning continue \u2013 planning, including identification of all key, business leaders and supporting teams have \u2013 has been completed. We have made very good progress, in fact on the regulatory approval front and expect to be in a position to close the transaction early in the first calendar quarter of 2016. In fact, we believe that we could present an integrated set of financial results starting with our second quarter of fiscal 2016.","With that, let me now turn the call over to Tony for a more detailed review of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2015 financials. Tony?","Tony Maslowski","Thank you, Hock and good afternoon everyone. Before reviewing fourth quarter and fiscal year 2015 financial results, I want to remind you that my comments today will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results from continuing operations unless otherwise specifically noted. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP data is included with the earnings release issued today and is also available on our website at www.avagotech.com. Revenue of $1.85 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter represents an increase of 6% from the prior quarter. Foxconn was a greater than 20% customer in the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter gross margin from continuing operations was 62%, which was above the high end of our guidance range, primarily due to better revenue mix and continued high fab utilization.","Turning to operating expenses, R&D expenses were $257 million and SG&A expenses were $81 million. This resulted in total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of $338 million, $2 million above guidance, primarily due to higher bonus accruals, driven by higher profitability. On a percentage basis, total operating expenses were 18% of revenues, a reduction from 19% in the prior quarter. As a percentage of sales, R&D was 14% and SG&A was 4% of net revenue. Operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $811 million and represented 44% of net revenue. Taxes came in at $43 million for the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter net income was $737 million and earnings per diluted share were $2.51. Fourth quarter interest expense was $41 million. Other income net was $10 million, resulting from a number of items, including cash from a legal settlement, interest income and gains from foreign exchange hedging.","Our share-based compensation in the fourth quarter was $63 million. The breakdown of the expense for the fourth quarter include $7 million in cost of goods sold, $30 million in R&D and $26 million in SG&A. In the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we anticipate share-based compensation will be approximately $65 million. Just as a reminder, our definition of non-GAAP net income excludes share-based compensation expense. The non-GAAP guidance from first quarter fiscal 2016 also excludes estimated ticking fees of approximately $47 million related to debt commitments for the pending Broadcom acquisition.","Moving on to the balance sheet, our days sales outstanding were 50 days, an increase of eight days from the prior quarter caused by linearity of our revenue across the quarter. Our inventory ended at $524 million, a $17 million increase from the third quarter. Days on hand were 68 days. We generated $582 million in operational cash flow and ended the quarter with the cash balance of $1.8 billion, which increased by approximately $400 million from the prior quarter. Our fourth \u2013 in our fourth quarter, we spent $106 million on capital expenditures.","On September 30, 2015, we paid a cash dividend of $0.42 per ordinary share, which consumed $116 million of cash. This dividend was raised by $0.02 from the prior quarter. Since the inception of our dividend program in the second quarter of 2011 to-date, our financial performance has allowed us to increase our dividend each quarter. As a reminder, our Board reviews and determines our dividend policy on a quarterly basis. Based on our financial performance and condition, the contractual provisions related to our outstanding indebtedness and other factors deemed relevant by our Board.","Now let me briefly recap our fiscal year 2015 full year results. Net revenues increased by 60% year-over-year to $6.9 billion, benefiting primarily from a full year of contributions from continuing operations of the LSI businesses as well as strength in our wireless business. Gross margin increased 5% year-over-year to 61%, driven by an improvement in product mix, with higher contributions from our FBAR related wireless products as well as comparatively higher gross margins from the Enterprise Storage segment. Net income for fiscal 2015 increased to $2.6 billion or $8.98 per diluted share as compared to $1.3 billion or $4.90 per diluted share in fiscal 2014.","Now let me turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the first quarter of fiscal year 2016. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions and we do not intend to update this guidance. This guidance is for results from continuing operations only. Net revenue is expected to be $1.78 billion plus or minus $25 million. Gross margin is expected to be 61% plus or minus one percentage point. Operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $314 million. Taxes are forecasted to be approximately $40 million. Net interest expense and other is expected to be approximately $37 million. And finally, the diluted share account forecast is for 295 million shares.","That concludes my prepared remarks. However, I would like to make one final comment. Earlier this week, Avago became 10-years-old as an independent company. Just as a contrast to today\u2019s results, our first year in operations, we had $1.51 billion in revenue and a non-GAAP net loss of $108 million. I would like to personally thank all employees for their hard work and contributions in this first decade. Operator, please open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Vivek Arya of Bank of America. Your line is open.","Vivek Arya","Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on the consistently strong execution. Hock, you mentioned on the wireless business that on the next year\u2019s flagship model, you expect at least 20% higher content, can you give us some context what is driving that higher content and what is your differentiation and competitive advantage versus another competitor who also has FBAR filters and is also adding capacity, what can you do consistently that they cannot, so what\u2019s really driving up content and what\u2019s your competitive advantage?","Hock Tan","Well, let\u2019s start with content. Content keeps increasing in smartphones, especially the high-end smartphones because of as I say increasing number of bands, spectral bandwidths that come into play worldwide as carriers expand the bandwidth by which they connect phones, connect us to each other. A number of especially LTE bands are increasing even in places like Japan, where you have new introduction on new bands, the band 21, which had not existed before. And of course the same applies in China where you have both TDD and FDD as well. So, it\u2019s really the proliferation of LTE bands. And for high-end smartphones, the need for the creation especially towards the high end for phones that can roam. But adding on to this mix is the fact that two other things are happening that drives, not just RF content, but our particular kind of RF content, which is the form of FBAR filters, which allows signals to be received or transmitted in extremely discreet very narrow base \u2013 on a very accurate, call it, narrow basis, which is the problem of with that number of bands in one little device, you start to create the phenomenon of coexistence. And coexistence, which exists and exists not across several bands alone, but across WiFi, Bluetooth as well crossing cellular bands too. That coexisting issue creates a specific need for filters that can attract signals from a very collective air space from ether.","Then of course you hear now about downlink carrier aggregation. And next year on, you start to see some of \u2013 certain phone models with uplink carrier aggregation. What carrier aggregation meant and I may have discussed it in previous calls is simply the ability to max or de-max multiple bands, signals from multiple bands into one single channel in the phone or out externally. And in order to do that, you need components. You need filters that are able to do the maxing and de-maxing in the RF space. And that\u2019s where FBAR filters come in to the own. So, because of all that, we have been consistently seeing over the last several years and we see that trend continue over the next three years, because it\u2019s as far as we can probably look within a degree of certainty, the increase in content, in RF content and in particular in the need for filters, which are not able to be integrated into one single chip. Each filter is a very discrete element. So, that\u2019s pretty much what\u2019s driving what I postulate as perhaps a trend of 20% a year increase in dollar content of RF over the next several years for high-end smartphones. Okay?","Vivek Arya","And as my follow-up, Hock, you also mentioned good growth in your enterprise storage business. That\u2019s very different from some other more sluggish, weak enterprise spending environment trends that we have heard from others. So, I am wondering what is helping you outgrow the broader spending environment in enterprise? Thank you.","Hock Tan","That\u2019s a very good question and sometimes we sit there and wonder ourselves by the way. All we do know is it is. And I suspect in specific areas, there is market share gains on our site simply because we do a better product, simply because we are able to execute on better products, but also we have been perhaps fortunate in being focused on certain customers, certain OEM customers, in particular that have done better than others and that allows us through their process by itself to gain share. And we will display that because yes, we are fully aware of what\u2019s out there, what we hear out there on a macro side. But we are seeing strength particularly on the enterprise front, less so the cloud datacenter side. So maybe that\u2019s something to do with that as well.","Vivek Arya","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Craig Hettenbach of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Craig Hettenbach","Yes, thank you. I had a question on the FBAR capacity expansion, in particular, move from 6-inch to 8-inch, I know it\u2019s early on, but that is an important factor for wireless growth in the back half of fiscal 2016. So, can you just give us some early insight in terms of how that\u2019s progressing in the confidence of bringing that online?","Hock Tan","Yes, that\u2019s been progressing very much, very well. To be direct about it, we are almost ready now give it a few more months for the back half. And \u2013 but that will not be a full completion for back half. We will anticipate continuing the migration from 6-inch to 8-inch of existing lines through even the first half of 2017 in anticipation of the generation of phones in 2017, not late 2017, not just 2016, but we are pretty prepared right now.","Craig Hettenbach","Got it. Thanks. And as my follow-up, good to hear that the integration of Broadcom is going smoothly and day 1, you can hit the ground running. So, as to get your thoughts more on the product side as you had more time to look at the portfolio, anything standout to you positively, particularly with their networking business and the prospects there?","Hock Tan","Oh, we love their products, we love their engineering. It validates entirely our premise, our investment thesis in making this acquisition as far as we found so far. So, we liked a lot of what they are doing. To be more specific, it might be a bit premature, sorry about that, but I am not in a position to really disclose it. Frankly, I want to do it, not because I don\u2019t want to, but I think I am not totally in the picture 100% until we really do have the operations under our control after day 1.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Romit Shah of Nomura. Your line is open.","Romit Shah","Yes, thank you. Couple of questions. First, Tony, I noticed that operating expenses are declining, I think about 7% in the January period, which really stood out to me. Can you talk a little bit about that?","Tony Maslowski","Sure. It\u2019s mostly due to two factors. We completely completed the Emulex transition. So, there is some OpEx drop off from that. But more significantly, it\u2019s the reset on the bonus accrual. So, on the bonus side, we are significantly above 100% attainment and that gets reset into Q1 at 100%. So, you get some benefit from that as well. Now, just to give you some perspective in 10 years of working here with the bonus is that it\u2019s not reset to last year\u2019s numbers. We have new numbers that are a little bit stretch targets for next year. So, every year that we accomplish over 100%, it\u2019s a pretty Herculean feat. So, it\u2019s not that we go into it saying we are going to earn 150% in the next year and you have kind of expense catch up at the second half of the year. So, it\u2019s a true reset and those are the two reasons for the expense drop off.","Romit Shah","Okay, helpful. Thanks. And Hock, can you give us a couple of data points on wireless? You said that RF content in high-end phones would increase at 20% or so. And then you also told us that you are planning to increase the capacity by about 50%. So putting those two data points together, how do we think about expectations for the wireless business, how fast it grows in fiscal \u201816?","Hock Tan","Well, I don\u2019t know. I cannot really answer for fiscal \u201816 because we don\u2019t give guidance, Romit on an annual basis, but I tell you the trajectory we have been seeing and continues I believe to be on. And I have taken things in my opening remarks to clarify why this year, this as end of \u201815, early \u201816, as we sit here, why it\u2019s more of an exception, a hiatus I call it than the rule. But content as we are bundling all this additional spectral bandwidth into a single device has increased content wise, physical content, might what we have seen is anywhere from 30% to almost 50% every year compounded every year. But then there is always a value to some level of integration in terms of dollar translation, which is why in dollar terms, that content increase of 30% to 50% typically translates to, I think 20% to 30% on an annual basis. That\u2019s really what it comes out to.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho. Your line is open.","Vijay Rakesh","Hi, guys. Good quarter and guide on a given all the wordings. I have a question on the RF side and as you look at China where probably just don\u2019t have much of carrier aggregation today, where do you see carrier aggregation penetration in China by the end of next year?","Hock Tan","Last \u2013 probably some, but there is some carrier aggregation, a high level of carrier aggregation going on in China right now. Not as much perhaps as out here in the U.S., but there is. And there is a need to do that because that\u2019s where the operators in China are where and want to go. And so we are seeing that now and we are selling some products, some are more discrete module products that addresses downlink carrier aggregation. Uplink, that\u2019s a different method, probably out for a couple of years at least if not longer for China. Uplink will happen here and some parts of the world fast, but downlink carrier aggregation is already happening in China.","Vijay Rakesh","Got it. And on the first side, as you talk about 8-inch capacity, is it \u2013 do you already have output 8-inches bus? Thanks.","Hock Tan","We have, at this point what I would call pilot lines. We have been doing the conversion over the past 12 months, which is more investment and developing the process. We are at a point that we are starting to go into production fairly soon.","Vijay Rakesh","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Ross Seymore","Hi guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Hock, back on the wireless side of things, you mentioned that the capacity constraint was never going to happen again and then you are kind enough to give us that 20% increased number, is part of that 20% increase just simply your ability to address the sockets that you are limited on today or is that above and beyond the content increase that you are going to get on average with RF into phones?","Hock Tan","No, I am basically \u2013 it\u2019s almost one and the same. We have all a sense of trying to be too arrogant or buoyant please, but it is one and the same, because in order to integrate their turn of increase of content into a tiny little device and do it very well, not many people can do it is our view. And so as I say, it becomes almost one in the same, which is our perception of the trend last 3 years and forward 3 years, is that content keeps growing up. It keeps growing in that range, at least in dollar terms. And we are always able to capture that. But it\u2019s a broad trend, we believe in month-to-month and we do not see that changing over the next 3 years as it has been happening the last 3 years.","Ross Seymore","And I guess as my follow-up, another one for you Hock. And I know you are not going to give full year guidance and maybe it doesn\u2019t even matter once Broadcom comes into the mix, but as you look at your four segments, can you just walk us through some of the areas that you are most excited about going up in fiscal \u201916 and then areas where you think there might be some headwinds as you look at your current portfolio of businesses?","Hock Tan","I am most excited about networking, wired infrastructure, so to speak and very excited about \u2013 continue to be excited about wireless. And enterprise storage has been, as I have mentioned performing very well. And I will be very pleased, but totally not disappointed if it doesn\u2019t hit the level it did in 2015 in enterprise storage. But definitely in wired and wireless, I believe, those two areas will continue to grow and grow very well.","Ross Seymore","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ambrish Srivastava of BMO. Your line is open.","Ambrish Srivastava","Hi. Thank you, Hock. Clearly, there is a tailwind on the wireless side and you have executed very well within that. I was just having a tough time understanding and trying to reconcile what you said at the top of the call regarding the capacity, so you were constrained by capacity and so you said that you walked away from certain business. And I am assuming that it can\u2019t be at the high end because you have a very differentiated product at the high end, so what gives you the confidence then that the competition or the customer will come back to you for that content that you could not provide? And then I had a quick follow-up.","Hock Tan","Because we are very good at what we do and we are just about only of the very few people can do to what we say we do here. Any really, my purpose in explaining that at the beginning was that because this quarter and last we saw as you saw a sort of a pause in that 20% growth rate year-on-year. And I took the pain to explain that as basically as not about people catching up as much as it\u2019s our inability capacity wide to meet all of their needs for this particular short window of time. But otherwise if, in fact the content the demand will still keep going at that rough 20% a year rate.","Ambrish Srivastava","Okay. My follow-up then on the tax side Tony, should we, I just want to make sure I get it right, so we should use the baseline from the guide for the Q1 because...?","Tony Maslowski","Yes. So everything we have right now and again this is assuming model that no Broadcom. So I mean in a full year, if you do just us, it\u2019s this new run rate. We will have our new mid-year merit increases, which is a couple of percent. And then if we outperform our businesses, you will see some bonus catch up in the second half. So yes, this is the \u2013 I would consider stable run rate. Again, we throw that out of window when we do Q2 and we start integrating Broadcom, so.","Ambrish Srivastava","Okay, got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Freedman of Sterne Agee. Your line is open.","Doug Freedman","Hi guys. Let me echo the congratulations on excellent execution. I guess Hock, sorry to beat a dead horse here a little bit, but I am getting a sense that your approach to the FBAR business may have changed here at your commentary about not wanting to supply constrain the market going forward. I did notice intra-quarter in the news, you guys procured a large factory up in Oregon. I believe it was cited as being for wireless, can you give us sort of maybe the timing of getting Oregon up and running and whether you have in fact changed your strategy to not supply constrain the FBAR market and if so, how quickly do you think you will remove that constraint?","Hock Tan","Well, I guess our strategy was never to want to constrain the market to first of all to make that clear. What probably I am implying the color to what you just said and is true on what I just said is we are seeing the market grow even faster than we had originally thought. And again, consistent we have got one thing to constrain the market we want to address, those specific high end smartphone markets, we are taking steps to make sure we will never constrain it again.","Doug Freedman","Okay. Moving on...","Hock Tan","And that includes that potential fab up in Oregon to just complete that thought and tying with what you said. Yes, that include \u2013 that plan of our to address that longer term includes that facility. And that\u2019s a long-term plan because we don\u2019t expect that to \u2013 once we get that going, if we get that going, that won\u2019t come into play \u2013 come into line until more towards 2018. 2016 and \u201817, what we have in [indiscernible] 8-inch conversion is pretty cool, \u201818 uncertainty we better get this additional Oregon fab.","Doug Freedman","I guess as my follow-up, what capacity addition does that Oregon fab enable if you could on a percentage is that going to double your FBAR capacity going forward?","Hock Tan","We generally don\u2019t want to disclose that Doug. Sorry.","Doug Freedman","Okay. Thank you. I tried.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Srini Pajjuri of CLSA Securities. Your line is open.","Srini Pajjuri","Thank you, Hock. Again on the wireless, I know you said you have visibility into the next 2 years to 3 years on that design wins and also on the architectures. I am just curious as to how much of visibility you have on the pricing front because obviously to say that your content is increasing 20%, you got it seemed pricing curve. And the reason I am asking is given that your competitors are also adding capacity, what\u2019s the risk that your pricing assumptions could go wrong here?","Hock Tan","Oh, you are right. It\u2019s, again, I am approaching it from a very macro point of view and a very trend basis. And if you look at my trend in macro over the last four years, that 20% is what I have been achieving and have been able to achieve and achieving. And there is nothing reeling that we see out there though I should never take it for granted, because each one is an interesting challenge by itself. I will be honest the products we do in FBAR, in front-end module, PATS as I call them, very, very difficult things to do. I mean, I am not saying they are moon shots, but they are not that far from that. And we spend an enormous amount of money, talent doing it. So, the best way to describe it is we don\u2019t see anything that dramatically change though each one is a tough one by itself. So, if I have seen it the last four years, I am basically commenting that it sure looks that for the next two, three years, we will see a continuation of this trend and we see that as I answer an earlier question through more bands to the increasing issue of coexistence across bands in handsets plus just as much the phenomenon of downlink and uplink carrier aggregation as operators need to run their network and base station much more efficiently and all that is happening. It\u2019s not pie in the sky.","Srini Pajjuri","Great. Thank you. And then Tony, on the balance sheet side, I guess once you closed the Broadcom deal, I think you told us you are going to have the leverage ratio around 2.5 times or so. My question is if an opportunity comes along to do additional M&A next year or some other time, first, what\u2019s your strategy in terms of additional M&A here and then how much debt capacity you think you have? Thank you.","Tony Maslowski","Yes. So, taken in reverse order, we definitely have the debt capacity go probably back to three years slightly above it. So, you can think about it at any given time we could be another turn here right out of the gate. However, the Broadcom acquisition, there will be a digestion phase for Broadcom. And as we have said, we don\u2019t wake up every morning looking for the next acquisition. We are very opportunistic on the acquisition front and we will look at it as we go. But again, I think we have flexibility with a starting point at 2.5 to do what we need to do. And if something opportunistic comes along, we will take advantage of that.","Srini Pajjuri","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Amit Daryanani of RBC. Your line is open.","Amit Daryanani","Yes, thanks a lot and congrats on the good quarter guys. A question for me, I guess if I go back to the wireless segment, Hock, to the extent you can talk about when you add capacity in the near-term over the next 12 months, call it are you doing it basically the design wins you have or do you have much more firm purchase commitments from your larger OEMs and hence you are adding capacity?","Hock Tan","It\u2019s a judgmental process. That judgment tends to be very tight to start by conservatively, but you are right, it\u2019s tied to sockets. I believe in sockets that we will win over the next 12, 18 months. And you are right sometimes we have to scramble to put capacity in place because of that kind of approach, but we believe that we prefer to be conservative than the other way around, but it is \u2013 but at the end of it all, it\u2019s all based in judgment and we tend to be rather conservative in lagging capacity build out behind what we see as demand. We might have based on an earlier statement started to behave a little differently, but basically, we are very conservative creatures is what we know we are, but it\u2019s all based on judgment. And obviously, our judgment is that we will use that capacity that we are putting in place for the next two, three years.","Amit Daryanani","Got it. And then on the enterprise side, you talked about share gains and business doing better. Is that more on your HDD side or is it more the fiber channel adapters from Emulex, where you think you might be thinking of more share?","Hock Tan","I think it\u2019s more on the connectivity side than the HDD side. HDD market doesn\u2019t change very much.","Amit Daryanani","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Harlan Sur","Hi, good afternoon and congratulations on the solid quarterly execution. On the wireless business, typically calendar Q1 is when your large Asian smartphone customers ramps production of its flagship platform. So, the question is are you seeing some of this ramp in your fiscal Q1 or is that typically seen in fiscal Q2? And then Hock, in line with your commentary, are you anticipating 20% plus content gains on their new flagship smartphones?","Hock Tan","I am saying yes to all three. Yes, there is an uptick there late Q1, probably Q2 on fiscal, not calendar, fiscal Q2, more like fiscal Q2. And yes, we do see improvement in content.","Harlan Sur","That\u2019s great. And then industrial you had anticipated revenues to be down kind of low single-digits in Q4, it came down 10% sequentially, but I think it\u2019s obviously a good decision to be prudent and take down inventories in the fourth quarter. As you think about Q1 and another quarter of inventory reduction, can you just help us understand your expectations for sell-through and also any commentary on demand by geography that you would expect in Q1?","Hock Tan","Yes, good points. Keep in mind maybe the first \u2013 simplest way to answer is our Q1 is November, December and January. So, as you know \u2013 as you probably know, industrial seasonality is down late end of the year and up again beginning of the year. So for Q1, we only have one month, no much. So, that\u2019s why we continue to be \u2013 to forecast and be conservative in our guidance of industrial revenue whether they be resale or shipping. On the resale front, yes, we kind of see \u2013 industrial \u2013 it\u2019s hard to breakout between seasonality versus secular in this case. All we see is that industrial is kind of struggling even to stay flat at this point. We saw our Q4, as just to emphasize, was actually August, September October. So, we only saw part of the downturn of the back end of the year. And so that \u2013 so even though our shipping was down, our resale, as I indicated, wasn\u2019t that bad. So, I would expect our resale Q1 to be not so good and that\u2019s why I use the word struggle to even say flat, which is why we believe we better guide our shipping, which is our revenue at down single-digits and we could have \u2013 and not more or less, that\u2019s what they are in, because if the resale maybe down a bit more, but our shipping is best, because we already pulled under it last quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is from Edward Snyder of Charter Equity Research. Your line is open.","Edward Snyder","Thank you very much. Hock, you said 8-inch probably take you through the transition in about 2017, Hynix fab in Portland probably wouldn\u2019t get turn on and I think you indicated till what 2018. It seems kind to be a flat spot between the two. I was just curious the silicon soft stuff that you have been working on is that there to take up the slot to take some of the pressure off the FBAR fab by moving some of the lower end stuff into that or is that more of a push by Avago to expand your filter offering beyond just traditional bond something maybe that will be more competitive in the soft run? And I have a follow-up please.","Hock Tan","Well, I think we think we have planned it pretty well, because you are right, 8-inch will take us all the way through product generation of \u201817, which will just be in time for the fab up in Oregon to come in for \u201818. So, it\u2019s straight on and it\u2019s all largely focused on filters.","Edward Snyder","Okay. And then the 20% increase I know it\u2019s more of a general number for the TAM growth overall, but it sounds like you are pretty enthusiastic about that for the next year. In 2015, as it specifically applies to Avago, will more of that come from say the max filters and is that really a content gain like you are getting more parts or is it more of an ASP boost given how tough these are to do maybe not more dye size itself, but you are just getting paid better for it?","Hock Tan","No, we are very nice people to our customers. We basically be more content and we actually give a discount as on a filter basis. It\u2019s a lot more content, a lot more filter.","Edward Snyder","Great, thank you.","Hock Tan","Thank you.","Tony Maslowski","Thank you, operator. Thank you for participating in today\u2019s earnings call. We look forward to talking with you again when we report our first quarter fiscal year 2016 financial results.","Operator","That concludes Avago\u2019s conference call for today.

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Ashish Saran, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Ashish Saran","Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are Hock Tan, President and CEO; and Tom Krause, Chief Financial Officer of Broadcom. After market closed today, Broadcom distributed a press release and financial tables describing our financial performance for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018. If you did not receive a copy, you may obtain the information from the Investors section of Broadcom\u2019s website at www.broadcom.com.","This conference call is being webcast live and a recording will be available via telephone playback for one week. It will also be archived in the Investors section of our website at broadcom.com.","During the prepared comments section of this call, Hock and Tom will be providing details of our second quarter fiscal year 2018 results, guidance for our third quarter of fiscal year 2018, and some commentary regarding the business environment. We will take questions after the end of our prepared comments.","In addition to U.S. GAAP reporting, Broadcom reports certain financial measures on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the tables attached to today\u2019s press release. Comments made during today\u2019s call will primarily refer to our non-GAAP financial results. Please refer to our press release today and our recent filings with the SEC for information on the specific risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Hock Tan. Hock?","Hock Tan","Thank you, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone.","I am very pleased with our execution in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. We drove gross margin to 66.6%, EBITDA to 52.3% and free cash flow to 42.3% of revenue. All record achievements for us and a continued demonstration of our robust business model. We were also quite active in executing on our recently announced stock repurchase program. Since announcement over a six-week period through June 1, 2018, we have returned approximately $1.5 billion to stockholders by repurchasing more than 6.4 million shares. And we do intend to continue to be active.","Consolidated net revenue for the second quarter was $5.02 billion, just above the midpoint of guidance with strong wired and enterprise storage results offsetting weaker wireless revenue. As a reminder, before I go and give you more color into this quarter, the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was a 13-week quarter, while the prior quarter, Q1 was a 14-week quarter. Segment revenue comparisons reflect this as I discuss performance by segment.","Starting with wired. In the second quarter, wired revenue was $2.3 billion, growing 9% year-on-year, 22% sequentially. The wired segment represented 46% of our total revenue. Second quarter wired results reflected strong sequential increase in demand from cloud data centers and a seasonal recovery in broadband access. Solid year-on-year growth was driven by robust increase in networking and compute offloading in cloud data centers and strong growth spending by enterprise IT. We also benefited from an increase in spending on broadband capacity expansion by service providers. In contrast, however, spending on video access and in the China optical markets remained sluggish.","Turning to the third quarter fiscal \u201818, we expect growth in wired revenue side to continue, notwithstanding the ban on shipments to ZTE. We expect demand to remain healthy from cloud data centers and enterprise IT, while broadband access remains robust.","Moving on to wireless. In the second quarter, wireless revenue was 1.29 billion, growing 13% year-on-year but declining 41% sequentially. The wireless segment represented 26% of our total revenue. Second quarter sequential decline wireless revenue was deeper than usual as shipments to our North American smartphone customers reduced sharply from typically exaggerated first quarter. We did partially offset this decline from increase in our product shipments to a large Korean smartphone customer as they supported their new product launch.","Looking ahead to third quarter, we expect to see the beginning of seasonal second half ramp in demand from our large North American smartphone customer as they start to transition to their next generation platform. However, we expect this strength recovery -- I mean to say, this recovery to be offset by a decline in shipments to a large Korean customer. As a result, we are expecting our overall wireless revenue to be flat, maybe even slightly declining on a sequential basis for the third quarter.","Let me now turn to enterprise storage. Second quarter 2018 enterprise storage revenue was $1.16 billion and represented 23% of our total revenue. This of course included a full quarter of contributions of over $400 million from the recently acquired Brocade Fiber Channel switch business. As you may recall, we have completed acquisition of this business early in our first quarter of fiscal 2018.","And as reported, enterprise storage segment revenue grew 63% year-on-year and 17% sequentially. But if we exclude Brocade contribution, second quarter enterprise storage revenue would have shown stable year-on-year performance with strong growth from enterprise server and storage markets, partially offset by softer demand from the hard disk drive market. For the second quarter, the overall sequential revenue growth was driven by broad strength from the enterprise IT sector.","Looking ahead to third quarter fiscal 2018, we expect continued spend in enterprise IT to drive sequential growth in enterprise storage, and growth in cloud storage capacity will lead to a recovery in hard disk drive demand.","Finally, our last segment, industrial. In the second quarter, industrial segment revenue was $263 million, growing 17% year-on-year, 5% sequentially. The industrial segment represented 5% of our total revenue. Resales continued to remain very strong with 20% year-on-year growth. And we expect this momentum to continue into the third quarter. Notwithstanding the strength today, we expect annual industrial revenue growth however to be in the mid single digit range on a long-term basis.","So, in summary, our overall business remains robust and stable. Our third quarter fiscal 2018 outlook reflects this with the consolidated revenue focus of $5.05 billion at the midpoint, as we experience continued strength in wired and enterprise storage, benefitting from a very robust cloud data center and enterprise IT spending environment.","Year-on-year, our revenue growth has remained very sustainable. Even without contributions from Brocade, organic revenue growth for the second quarter would have been in the high single digits. And for the third quarter, we foresee this year-on-year organic revenue growth to modulate towards our long-term target of mid single digits.","We will continue to keep a consistent focus on improving margins and increasing free cash flow from our business. Our balance sheet continues be strong with over $8 billion in cash at the end of the second quarter. We also have $10.5 billion remaining on our stock repurchase authorization as of June 1st. And reflecting the very strong free cash flow generation, we expect during the balance of fiscal 2018, we plan to continue to aggressively repurchase our shares as long as we believe that we can generate superior returns in doing so.","With that, let me turn the call over to Tom for a more detailed review of our second quarter financials and third quarter outlook.","Tom Krause","Thank you, Hock, and good afternoon, everyone.","My comments today will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results from continuing operations, unless otherwise specifically noted. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP data is included in the earnings release issued today and is also available on our website at broadcom.com.","Let me quickly summarize our results for the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Second quarter net revenue was $5.02 billion, in line with guidance. Our second quarter gross margin from continuing operations was 66.6%, 60 basis points above the midpoint of guidance. We did benefit from a more favorable product mix in the quarter, driven by higher than expected revenue from our wired segment and lower than expected revenue from our wireless segment.","Operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $2.46 billion and represented 48.9% of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $2.63 billion and represented 52.3% of revenue.","Our days sales outstanding were 50 days, a 5-day increase from the prior quarter as we saw reduction in linearity of revenue across the quarter. Our inventory at the end of the second quarter was $1.26 billion, a decrease of $56 million from the prior quarter. Days on hand remained flat from the prior quarter at 67 days. We generated $2.31 billion in operational cash flow, which reflected the impact of $117 million of cash expanded on acquisition and restructuring related activities including Qualcomm and Brocade. Please also note that we did not make any interest payments in the second quarter as these are made on a biannual basis in the first and third quarters of our fiscal year.","Capital expenditure in the second quarter was $189 million or 3.8% of net revenue. As a housekeeping matter, I would also note that CapEx was $61 million higher than depreciation. Free cash flow, which define as operating cash flow less CapEx, in the second quarter, was $2.12 billion or 42.3% of net revenue and reflects the impact of acquisition and restructuring expenses.","On the buyback, just to give you some more clarity. In the second quarter, we spent $347 million on repurchasing 1.5 million shares. These repurchases took place over the last two weeks of the quarter. Over the first four weeks of the third quarter, we have spent an additional $1.16 billion, repurchasing 4.9 million shares. In addition, we returned $766 million in the form of dividends and distributions in the second quarter.","Turning to our balance sheet. We increased our cash balance by $1.1 billion through the second quarter and ended the period with $8.2 billion in cash and $17.6 billion in total debt.","Now, let me turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions and we do not intend to update this guidance. This guidance is for results from continuing operations only.","Net revenue is expected to be $5.05 billion, plus or minus $75 million. Gross margin is expected to be 66.5%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. Operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $882 million. The tax provision is forecasted to be approximately 7%. Net interest expense and other is expected to be approximately $115 million. The diluted share count forecast is for 457 million shares and it does not include the impact from any share repurchases done after June 1, 2018. Stock-based compensation expense will be approximately $320 million. CapEx will be approximately $125 million.","As you may recall, in connection with the redomiciling the United States and as a result of the effects of U.S. corporate tax reform, we had initially expected our effective cash tax rate on a steady state basis to be in the range of 9% to 11% per year. Following the redomiciliation, we currently expect our cash tax rate for the balance of fiscal year \u201818 to be approximately 7% and our long-term cash tax rate to remain in a 9% to 11% range.","That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Ross Seymore","Hi, guys. Thanks a lot, and I have few questions. I want to start off on the wired side, last quarter there was a lot of debate about why the year-over-year growth slowed so much and you guided for confident sequential growth that you just delivered. Talk a little bit about the visibility going forward. What\u2019s driving the slight growth that you\u2019re guiding to in the fiscal third quarter? And can you still hit the mid single digit growth for the fiscal year in that wired segment?","Hock Tan","The wired segment for us, especially the networking part of it that we have very good visibility right now and it\u2019s largely driven, as I indicated in my prepared remarks, from the cloud data center guys, the big cloud data center guys. What we also see, and that\u2019s probably less visible, is very strong spending patterns at enterprise. I call that enterprise IT environment, the more traditional enterprise. That\u2019s -- those guys have also been spending. So, when you combine the two together, that portion of our wired infrastructure because as it relates to networking broadly as we describe it, is very strong. And of course, as an aside, a separate segment, we call it enterprise storage, benefits get dropped along with that. So that\u2019s why we see very strong business in what storage, I call near line or what I call data center storage business, very, very strong, both of them. And that\u2019s very visible in many, many -- in many of the situations because the cloud data center guys tend to spend in fairly lumpy manner -- in a lumpy manner. And so, you get that visibility as opposed to a more secular or trended manner as the enterprise IT guys are doing. So, to answer your question, bottom-line, that will drive our wired business to hit to our goal of mid single digit year-on-year for this year.","Ross Seymore","Perfect. Then, I guess, as my follow-up, switching gears on to the wireless side of things. It\u2019s good to see that your big North American business is starting to turn up and that the business as a whole has stabilized. Can you just talk about whether via content or the unit side, how you think about seasonality in the back half of the year, given that there are so many different moving parts of content per SKU and what different customers are doing?","Hock Tan","There are a lot of moving parts. It\u2019s easier to look at it on whole -- on a total basis and whole [ph] basis and also there\u2019s unusual factors which we all thought would happen in that. As we move from iPhone 8 to iPhone 9 generation coming out that there is some caution in the level of builds, and there is, we believe there is. But having said that, we are also seeing orders coming in what I call in a normal seasonal pattern of strength. And we do see that very clearly now, and we do see bookings that extend all the way to close to the end of this calendar year from these North American customers. So, we see that -- what you said exactly, back to -- trend of the normal patterns. The difference is, what\u2019s the mix of the new generation phones versus legacy phones. And that\u2019s what -- might lead to some uncertainty of how much content changes or increases that might be. And very frankly, visibility is not as clear. Because it\u2019s hard to predict what level -- what will the mix of new generation phones versus legacy generation phones would be.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Craig Hettenbach","Yes. Thank you. Hock, just more of a strategic question of how you view the business. So, some of the pushback on the company is that you\u2019ve been so acquisitive that feeling that there is a need to do more M&A. So, just few things on that. Number one, with the current make up of the business, can you talk about the long-term growth profile as you see it? And then the second part would be, now that you\u2019re buying back stock, your view of the opportunities to do M&A versus return cash through buybacks?","Hock Tan","Very interesting question. In terms of long-term growth of this Company and the various franchise businesses that comprise our entire business and Company, we have always said and there are no reasons to change that at all to say that long-term -- that we will achieve on a long-term basis, as you look over a period of -- extended period of time an average compounded growth rate, average compounded growth rate of mid-single digits. No reason for us to change. The business model continues to be to demonstrate it. And we do not see anything that makes us think otherwise.","Year-to-year, as we\u2019re seeing, you may see variations from that mid-single digit. We saw that 2017 as it compared to 2016. We saw strong organic growth taking -- stripping out the acquisition, there are contributions from acquisitions. We saw close to mid double digit mid-teens year-on-year growth in \u201817. We\u2019re in \u201818 and I don\u2019t expect that mid-teen rate of growth to continue. Because as I said, it\u2019s one year, but it\u2019s still above in \u201818 mid single digits, definitely. We expect it to be moderate, down to perhaps high single digit conservatively. And expect that, but that\u2019s to be expected. You cannot expect the kind of breadth of our business in connectivity solutions largely and our major positions -- market position within connectivity solutions, especially in those markets where franchise products prevail. To keep growing higher than the rate of growth of the entire semiconductor industry, not counting memories. There is always, it has to modulate down, as I said before to a level, which is closer to the growth of the industry. We have to follow that. And the only variation to that whole thing as we think through this is simply that like all technology business, every new generation -- every time a new generation pops up and it varies in product life cycle from handsets, which is 18 months to storage, which may be 5, 6 years,. to industrial which maybe even longer that each new generation brings an increased contest. So, we have a pica above GDP growth rate, I want [ph] to say that. Hence, we end up with mid single digits on a worldwide -- on a global basis. And we will see that long-term. Even as in the short-term, we see variations and we saw in it in \u201817, we\u2019re seeing in the \u201818. But it will inevitably -- we measure it over long enough period, get down to that mid single digit. ","Craig Hettenbach","And then, just as a second part of that question around how you\u2019re evaluating kind of M&A opportunities versus the aggressive steps you\u2019re taking on the buyback?","Hock Tan","We could do both, as we do basically based on return on investment as we generate cash. One of the things we are seeing is our cash flow generation, as Tom indicated in his remarks and especially last quarter -- and this last quarter is not an unusual quarter. As we focus going forward, our cash flow generation is very, very strong. Our free cash flow was north of $2 billion last quarter. And a big part of it relates to the fact that CapEx, which has been a big consumption of our cash flow over the last two years, at least, between building up capacity and building up campuses in couple of allocations worldwide, which involves big amount of money, for cost reduction -- cost reduction, operating cost reduction purposes, but nonetheless [indiscernible] CapEx dramatically dropped as we finished those programs. And as Tom said, we are looking towards CapEx level much lower than we are seeing in prior years, in prior quarters. So, that\u2019s enabling our cash generation to be fairly substantial on a quarterly basis, probably north of $2 billion free cash flow. So that\u2019s allowing us a lot more flexibility, which allows us to still look at M&A, as we do, and still be able to invest that very strong stream of cash generation in a very good return generating asset, our own shares, which is fairly -- think about shares producing -- generating over $8 billion in a company, our market talking about 8% cash on cash return, strong balance and its own shares. So of course, we will keep doing that especially with the flexibility of generating a lot of cash. But that doesn\u2019t mean we stop doing M&A. We are continuing to look and we go by the criteria we have on cash and cash return. And as we see opportunities as we still do, we will act on those M&A opportunities.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ambrish Shrivastava from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Gabriel Ho","This is Gabriel Ho calling in for Ambrish. Thanks for taking my question. I think, this question is for Hock. On the wireless, the guidance seems to be implying a flattish on a year-over-year basis in terms of growth for the fiscal third quarter. So, my understanding is, last year, the phone -- at your large smartphone OEM customer was later than normal. So, why is wireless revenue not growing and is it due to the content or more of the units?","Hock Tan","It\u2019s hard to measure it quarter-on-quarter for various reasons. In my remarks, I was very clear. At this time last year third quarter, we had both the North American smartphone maker and the Korean high-end phone maker going in the same direction. We\u2019re not -- while we are still very positive on the North American phone maker, we are not seeing strength in the Korean phone maker. That\u2019s -- as I said in my prepared remarks, that\u2019s the reason we are seeing that difference, the major reason we\u2019re seeing that difference.","Gabriel Ho","Thanks. As a follow-up. On the revenue side, you talk about operating leverage, talk about revenue growth moderating towards mid single digit, and how should we think about OpEx front as well as your gross margin, longer term?","Tom Krause","So, if I understood your question correctly, you\u2019re talking operating leverage and the model going forward. I think, if you look at the operating expenses, they\u2019ve effectively flattened out here at these levels. We might see them come down a bit, especially as we look into \u201819, but to fair level, we don\u2019t see -- expect this increasing from here much. We obviously think we still have a lot of leverage from a gross margin standpoint. We continue to see gross margins expand; that\u2019s the trend you\u2019ve seen over the last several years. We don\u2019t see that stopping any time soon. So, when you put that together, we believe that we\u2019ve got a lot of capacity to continue to improve our operating margins. And as Hock talked about, CapEx is coming down. I mean, this is largely a fabulous company, a CapEx-light company when you look at the fundamentals. And so, we\u2019re driving CapEx spend to more like $100 million a quarter, which suggests you are going to be running much closer to 2% as a percentage of revenue. And so, free cash flow margins, which we have a target of 40%, we think that can continue to improve and likely improve obviously north of 40% if you do that math.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Blayne Curtis","I just want to ask on the guidance. I wanted to make sure -- it sounded like all the segments would be up but then you said not to mention ZTE. So, I was just curious how much of an impact that would be. And then secondly on just wireless, I just wanted to understand, obviously it\u2019s harder to triangulate content, average content; legacy is one portion but there\u2019s also the share portion. I just wondered if you can comment on your visibility of your share at that customer, the North American customer? Thanks.","Hock Tan","We don\u2019t want to -- like to talk about share on that because in the overall scheme of things, Blayne, it makes no difference to us. It might make a big difference to somebody else, which I won\u2019t mention, but in overall scheme of things, we look our business as 20 product divisions, four different segments, some segments are up, some segments are down quarter-to-quarter but overall, very, very stable and sustainable, I mean broadly answer. So, I really don\u2019t have that much to comment on in terms of share, and we really don\u2019t want to -- don\u2019t like to comment on share. But, in regard to your first part about ZTE, again, this is -- we\u2019re trying to be looking at it from a very high level. And until we have the ability to ship out, clearly ship out to ZTE, we really prefer that -- again as we said, not to comment on it. Where we stand now is products are not shipping. And that\u2019s our opposition at this point.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Amit Daryanani","Yes. Thanks for taking my questions. I just have two as well. First, just on capital allocation. Now, that buybacks are part of your broader capital allocation, does the bar for M&A for deals essentially become higher because plan B would be assuming to buy your own stock, buy something at a 8% a cash yield with no integration issues. So, I\u2019m curious does the bar for deals become higher, or how do you look at the cash on cash targets today now that you have option to do buybacks?","Tom Krause","I think Hock said it well, I\u2019ll just reiterate it, maybe a little bit more color. But basically, it\u2019s a returns driven phenomenon. You can see our views on the returns of buying back our own stock based on our execution to buy back over the last month plus. So, I think that\u2019s self evident. Going forward, as Hock said, we always look to drive double-digit returns from an M&A standpoint. Obviously, we think we know how to do integration. And so, we\u2019ll take a risk-adjusted view of it. But as long as we think we can find opportunities that are well in excess that we can buy our own stock at, we\u2019ll obviously take a very close look at that. But, without that in mind, obviously the stock over the last month plus is what we try to do based on the stock that we brought back and we continue to do so, as Hock said given the returns.","Amit Daryanani","Got it. And then, if I could just follow up on the wireless segment, and I understand some of the near-term discussions you\u2019ve been having on this. But, as you think about the next couple of quarters in fiscal \u201819 on a broader level, do you think you\u2019re positioned to grow your wireless revenues in aggregate in fiscal \u201819 at this point or are the compares going to be such that it\u2019s going to be hard to show growth next year in that business, if you are assuming flat with your two largest customers there? ","Hock Tan","We don\u2019t give outlook even beyond one quarter, much less the year. And frankly, we\u2019re not about to really change that practice or policy. Because then we\u2019ll be doing nothing but a lot of this in every earnings call. We\u2019ll give you a strategic view of the whole thing and that hasn\u2019t changed. Again, we\u2019ve got franchises in those -- in every segment including especially wireless. And largely for one year look, we don\u2019t comment on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","John Pitzer","Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Tom, congratulations on the strong quarter. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Hock, just maybe I\u2019ll ask the wireless question a little bit different. I understand the impact that mix might have as far as your revenue growth in the back half of the year. But as you think sort of flagship to flagship at your North American customer, how should we think about content growth this time around? And perhaps differentiate between RF and other applications. And I guess, with the RF stack, we\u2019ll start to see some initial 5G modems coming out at the end of this year, just wondering what kind of visibility you have for continued growth of FR [ph] as the world transitions from 4G to 5G?","Hock Tan","I mean, strategically, if you go to add 5G and you go deeper and deeper in the 5G, which runs what I call the ultra high band frequency or maybe, it\u2019s not so, ultra high. But nonetheless, well, you talk about anything, 3 gigahertz and beyond. You tend to push towards more and more advance [ph] that\u2019s given, that\u2019s very well proven, that\u2019s very well known. Now, when would 5G really come in and what fashion they will come in, because the initial phones will likely be claimed to be 5G, but not truly 5G. So, the specifications don\u2019t have to be as rigorous for performance. People will try to -- phone makers may use, especially on the lower end, not higher end, use softer alternatives, and soft filters and get away with EBITDA performance doesn\u2019t matter, just soft. [Ph] But when you really get deeper and deeper into 5G, you need advance filters to make it work, given. So, think of it, long-term content will step up, no question, not only more frequencies but frequencies that demand the need for above. Beyond that, who knows. Go ahead.","John Pitzer","And then, specifically as we think flagship to flagship this year from your North American customer, how do we think about your RF content growth and\/or potential growth elsewhere, things like connectivity or touch?","Hock Tan","Well, if things are -- as we are seeing moving a lot, we all like to think about is how soon will normalcy in flagship phones recover, comeback to what you call normalcy. We don\u2019t know. And how do you know what is content versus unit volume, especially when normalcy -- I\u2019m not trying to doubt your question. I\u2019m saying is, you can\u2019t tell, because right now, shipments are not really normal even as we see bookings coming and strongly and hopefully we like to see normal. But then we don\u2019t see the North Korean customer be not strong as it should be.","Operator","And our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Your line is now open.","Stacy Rasgon","Let me ask that question in a different way. So I know, last year around this time, you gave us a number of content, you said at your North American customer was up 40%. Obviously that may have changed a bit, given the mix and it sounds like you\u2019re suggesting mix going forward of new phones versus legacy is an unknown. But if the mix, I guess in the 2019 was the same as what we saw this year, what do you think your content at your North American customer would be? That should be a math problem you ought to be able to do.","Hock Tan","Yes. But even I tell you, how we\u2019re going to check it against revenues, which is most important. Because our legacy phone will vary. The mix of legacy phones customers increasing dramatically, you will reflect on the different set of content. What you are asking is, what the content -- it\u2019s not really what\u2019s the content. What\u2019s the revenue over the next few quarters? What it\u2019s going to look like. And based on -- trying to do simple math on content, I\u2019d say you have an unknown equation which says the legacy phones may increase in percentage, which then dilutes any increase in content. And then the revenue won\u2019t reflect what you are looking for. I am basically trying to answer your question for you by saying that if you are looking for what else -- simple correlation between content increase and revenue change, I am saying that other factors that are coming in that might dilute that whole equation. And so, answering that question that you asked in simple terms, doesn\u2019t answer the underlying interest that you have. I would say in broad scope, content direction and trend hasn\u2019t changed at all. But the mix of legacy, the mix of phone SKUs, and in some situations if you look beyond North American OEM and look at other high-end smartphone makers which we sell to and their varying performance, all are superior numbers.","Stacy Rasgon","Let me ask you a question\u2026","Hock Tan","I mean your math request is easy, and I am telling the math request is that the trend in content increase has not changed. [Multiple Speakers]","Stacy Rasgon","Okay. But, I mean your old -- kind of long term kind of normalized outlook was for kind of end market units to be relatively flat, given call it premium phones aren\u2019t growing very much. But, you have mid double digit - kind of over the long-term mid double digit content increase. You are not changing that long-term point of view. And that was -- by the way, that had nothing to do mix, that was a portfolio point of view as I understand. Are you still holding that long-term portfolio due for content increase?","Hock Tan","Yes. That would be long-term content increase still and will still be long-term content increase. I am interested to know that there\u2019s a mix change and there\u2019s a unit change, now that we\u2019ve all seen.","Stacy Rasgon","Let me ask about storage really quickly. So, obviously that\u2019s growing well right now. And I think in conjunction with the networking portion of enterprise, you got similar of the drivers. I think storage historically has tended to be quite a bit more lumpier than the wired business and it just rose 17% sequentially and it looks on a mostly organic kind of quarter. I guess, how should we think about the drivers of that and I guess the lumpiness that may continue with that going forward? I think historically you\u2019ve given -- again, a longer term kind of view of that business overall was roughly flattish, plus or minus, like how should we be thinking about the near-term drivers of that and how those may play out over the rest of the year?","Hock Tan","Let me correct some misperceptions and maybe I did not articulate it clearly enough. If you strip out Brocade, I was trying to say - if you do a year-on-year comparison you have to strip out from current year fiscal \u201818 results. Our revenue in enterprise storage year-on-year is single digits growth as you expect enterprise storage to typically happen. And this is stable kind of business. It doesn\u2019t do cut wheels [ph] and stuff like that, but it\u2019s very stable and extremely sticky and profitable. That\u2019s storage. And even in fiscal \u201818, we\u2019ve seen super strength especially with near line data -- data center buying more high capacity drives -- hard drives. We will still grow maybe closer to high single digits year-on-year which is unusual for enterprise storage. What has perhaps confused mix is we now at year-on-year comparison Brocade. And that leads to that 17%. Otherwise year-on-year, please don\u2019t expect double digit growth on storage, at best flattish to single digits.","Stacy Rasgon","So, wasn\u2019t the 17% a sequential number or am I remembering that wrong?","Hock Tan","It\u2019s probably some level of sequential. Now, you\u2019re right. That sequential -- I\u2019m trying discourage if I\u2019m looking at it sequentially. Look at it, year-over-year. Sorry.","Stacy Rasgon","Okay. So, you think roughly flattish year-over-year excluding Brocade. Okay. Thank you. ","Hock Tan","Yes. Roughly flattish year-on-year, excluding Brocade.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Vivek Arya","Thanks for taking my question. I also had two. So, question on -- I understand, we don\u2019t want to talk about specific content. There does appear to be some more competition in high mid-band bands. Do you think that is just the desire for large customers to just be -- just have supply diversity or do you think competition is catching up in technology? And if it\u2019s the latter, what are you doing to make sure that you\u2019re sort of maintaining your competitive edge in based technologies?","Hock Tan","Okay. Good question. In every franchise, product line franchises we have, and we have plenty of them, we are in the lead. That\u2019s the definition of why we call it franchise and that\u2019s our business model that we are the lead. Whether we grow it organically ourselves or acquire and strengthen and sustain those, we\u2019re the number one in each of those segment, no different in wireless. Within wireless, we sell most notably RF frontend as well, in words building to it or WiFi Bluetooth combo chip, as we call it wireless connectivity. Very much we\u2019re the number one ending the lead.","And we always having said that, have competition. Word is such you always have competitors. But, we are always in the lead and we always, as our key business model, continue to invest as we need to continue if not extend our lead. And to answer your question, in our RF frontend, which I assume that\u2019s what you\u2019re addressing rather than wireless connectivity on WiFi, Bluetooth whether nobody even within range. In RF frontend, we are very much in the lead. And we have that lead now for many years. And we continue to invest to keep that lead. And it has not changed. Believe me, it has not changed. The lead that we have and been able to understand and design those RF frontend components, which includes -- a lot of it FBAR filters, a key element of strength. And power amplifiers, and the normal switches, and little component that add up to an RF frontend. But especially, when it relate to FBAR, we are in architecture where the benefit -- creating those RF frontend that enable high end phones to deliver the kind of performance and bandwidth that they generate that you see around you. And we continue to make sure we are very much in the lead. So, as far as we\u2019re concerned, that hasn\u2019t changed. The business hasn\u2019t changed. The franchise, to answer your question directly, is not at all in jeopardy. Maybe the clear answer to all you guys out there is we do not see -- and this is not trying to be cavalier or complacent, well far from complacent in any one of our franchise business. We continue to remain the lead -- we ensure we continue to be in the leads as we look forward, one generation, two generations. That hasn\u2019t changed, the franchise is not in jeopardy.","Vivek Arya","And as my follow-up. Very strong performance on the gross margin side. I think Tom, you were mentioning that you expect perhaps more upside. What\u2019s driving this upside? Is it just mix, is it something else? And is their way to quantify what longer term opportunity is to take gross margins through? Thank you.","Tom Krause","Yes. Good question. I mean, obviously, it is mix as well. I mean, if you look at the growth Hock\u2019s been articulating around, cloud and enterprise IT, we\u2019ve added Brocade.","These are all very margin accretive activities. As revenue grows as well, we\u2019re seeing our businesses that were lower performing carried with it lower gross margins ones that we acquired from Broadcom in particular continue to improve. As you know, it takes several years to go from actually designing in the product to shipping new products in volume, some of the businesses we've owned for less than a couple of years. And so, all those things as well as the day-to-day normal operating improvement is driving gross margins up. Clearly, we\u2019re focusing on value accretive R&D. So, we\u2019re spending nearly $3 billion in R&D, all of that is focused on delivering greater and greater value of the customer, that\u2019s also very gross margin accretive. So that gives us confidence, so we can continue to improve it from these levels.","Hock Tan","And now that we have also -- let me expand a bit on what Tom is saying also. Here is the thing, if you look at the strategy of this company and the product and the market characteristics and how we address the market. We pick those franchise products and those products are strategic components typically of the customers in each of the sites, in each of the end markets we address. And as I say, one of the things that\u2019s great about technology business is it constantly evolves. I\u2019m not using the word disrupt, I\u2019m using what evolution, it evolves. It grows on switches, increases in bandwidth. Top-of-rack switch we\u2019re launching now is 12.8 terabits. Features a lot, but this is capacity. The routers, we have same situation. The SerDes we have out there to support our building block products and a few -- a bunch of other products we have has now reached a level of 102 gigabit per second.","As we go up high and high, the bar in challenging our products goes up correspondingly. I almost want to say, use the word in many cases, exponentially. You have to spend the money to deliver those kind of very high technology products. And it gets harder and harder as generation progresses in every one of the product. Even a simple thing as PCI Express generation 3, going to generation 4. It\u2019s a huge challenge for most silicon guys out there. We can do it. SerDes is going from 25 gigabit to 56 gigabit to 112 gigabit, as I said earlier. We are finding less and less people out there able to come even close to what we do. And because of that, we\u2019re delivering high content and increased bandwidth which is big part of what we do. Higher bandwidth allows more data transfers, allows us to get better value for those products, and that\u2019s what drives the gross margin. All this is -- spending, it\u2019s mostly in R&D. The spending is not in making the product more -- it\u2019s not in cost of manufacturing going up, it\u2019s more in the R&D spending to design and enable the product to come out.","So, it\u2019s normal that the gross margin goes up. It\u2019s also normal that the cost of doing R&D is stepping up. And as Tom said, we are very disciplined on how we make sure we get a good return. But really the cost of manufacturing more and more sophisticated, higher performance product doesn\u2019t change -- doesn\u2019t increase as fast as the value we add to our customers. And that\u2019s why you translate it to high and high gross margin. The same applies in wireless to RF frontend, guys, I\u2019d like to say that. It\u2019s harder and harder, the value goes up, but the cost of manufacturing goes up less. And it\u2019s the explanation for why our gross margin has been trending or creeping up generation-after-generation year-after-year.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Your line is now open.","Harlan Sur","Good afternoon, guys, and great job on the quarterly execution. Your data center ASIC pipeline is very strong and I assume contributing to the strong year-over-year growth in wired. And our sense is that the pipeline is getting stronger and more diversified in terms of customers and product types, switching, routing, AI, deep learning, Smart NICs and so on. And it does seem like more and more the cloud titans are trying to do their own silicon. So, do you guys think that this is just a transitory phase and merchant silicon will eventually fill this void, or do you get a sense that better silicon optimization via ASICs will be a sustainable trend? And I think, this question also applies to your analog ASIC business as well?","Hock Tan","Very interesting question. I\u2019d be direct with you. I don\u2019t know the final outcome and answer either. But we see strength today, and looking forward to the next generation in both merchant silicon and ASIC implementations of the kind of products we do, they are both. And in many situations on large cloud guys who have the scale to ask for unique ASICs, some of those unique ASICs get their platform from our merchant silicon. And so, in many cases it\u2019s almost an equal system play. It\u2019s a whole fabric on network play. It\u2019s not one component by itself. And we\u2019ve seen that. And I would say both, merchant silicon is moving along very strongly as is ASIC or semi ASIC, semi custom development. And this is -- when you say that the cloud guys want to do their own silicon, I will phrase it to say they can only do so much of the silicon.","As you know, there is a whole spectrum when you do a silicon from right at the frontend definition, architecture definition, chip definition to RF and design RTL all the way to the backend. And no cloud guy can cut across the entire spectrum, they\u2019ll do only parts of it. There is always room for a silicon supplier like us who are able to do across the entire spectrum and with $20 billion of revenues. Our scale enables us to not only do things better than most other suppliers out there in silicon, but it also gets us to the scale of cost that is hard to match and across a wide diversity of products. In other words, our cost of developing 7-nanometer spread across such a wide spectrum of products is very, very cost effective as the IP, intellectual property we develop to support many of our unique products very low. And you see that in the kind of financial performance Tom articulated.","Harlan Sur","Thanks for the insight there, Hock. And then question for Tom. You guys have a full quarter of Brocade under your wings. You were targeting $900 million in annualized EBITDA, post synergies, 60% EBITDA margins. Just given the Company\u2019s total margin profile that you\u2019re driving right now, seems like you guys are kind of already there, but wanted to get your view. Can you just help us level set where you are relative to your target and how much more you think you can drive versus prior expectations?","Tom Krause","Sure. Good question. I think at this point we feel really good about Brocade. Obviously, revenues are -- as a public company and everyone knows where the top-line on the sand was. So, revenues are strong and a lot of that\u2019s reflected in the storage business and the results there. In terms of margins, obviously, it\u2019s a margin accretive deal. A lot of the costs on the OpEx side have come out; there is a little bit left to go. But, it\u2019s largely done. So, if you do that math, obviously this is a business that\u2019s meeting if not exceeding our expectations. And I don\u2019t want to get any more detailed than that.","Operator","Thank you.

Please go ahead, sir.","Tom Krause","Thank you, operator, and good afternoon everyone. Joining me today are Hock Tan, President and CEO, and Doug Bettinger, Chief Financial Officer of Avago Technologies.","After the market closed today, Avago distributed a press release and financial tables describing our financial performance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2012. If you did not receive a copy, you may obtain the information from the Investor section of Avago's website at avagotech.com. This conference call is being webcast live and a recording will be available via telephone playback for one week. It will also be archived in the Investor section of our website.","During the prepared comments section of this call, Hock and Doug will be providing details of our Q4 and fiscal year 2012 results, background to our Q1 2013 outlook, and some commentary regarding the business environment. We will take questions after the end of our prepared comments.","In addition to U.S. GAAP reporting, Avago reports certain financial measures on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation between the GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the tables attached to today's press release. Comments made during today's call will primarily refer to our non-GAAP financial results.","Please refer to our press release today and our recent filings with the SEC for information on the specific risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Hock Tan. Hock?","Hock Tan","Thank you, Tom. Good afternoon, everyone. We are going to start today by reviewing recent end market business highlights, and then Doug will provide summary of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2012 financial results.","Revenue for Q4 fiscal year was $618 million, which was slightly above the midpoint of our guidance. This represented an increase of 2% from last quarter, but a decrease of 1% from the same quarter a year ago.","However, if we just look at our three primary target markets, revenue from those markets grew 8%, sequentially, on an apple-to-apple comparison basis. For the full fiscal year 2012, revenue was $2.4 billion, which represented an increase of 1% from fiscal 2011. Essentially here, a 20% in our Wireless business was offset largely by 23% decline in industrial revenues. Wired Infrastructure, remain relatively flat.","Back to Q4 results, Wireless was very strong, driven by simultaneous product ramps at two of our large smartphone OEM customers. While there were certain bright spots in Wired Infrastructure, Wired revenue was down due to largely weak core routing spending with service providers. Industrial was also down below our estimate at the beginning of the quarter, here though is because, our distribution partners reduced inventory levels.","Looking forward to Q1 Wireless demand continues to be strong. However, we expect that continued supply chain contraction in industrial and the continued hiatus in core routing spending will result in a sequential decline in revenues overall.","Let me now provide more color on each of our end markets. Starting with Wireless, revenue from Wireless came in at the upper end of our expectations, growing 30%, sequentially. This sequential strength was driven primarily by product ramps at two large OEM customers. I guess I will let you figure out who those are.","We also benefitted from seasonal demand from selective smartphone makers in China and Japan, and this particular strength resulted in shift I should say, a mix shift in our revenue mix with Wireless increasing to 51% of total revenue for Q4.","Looking at Q1 fiscal 2013, follow-on demand from our two major smartphone OEM ramps remained strong. In addition, we're continuing to see demand from certain other smartphone OEM, as is pretty normal at this time of the year as a launch multiple high end smartphone programs to compete against each other, the upping in demand has also helped a lot by proliferation of LTE capability in these platforms and the strength of our products offering, which now supports 15 LTE frequency bands is supporting this very well. We therefore expect overall Wireless revenue to be virtually flat in Q1, despite one would normally be a seasonally weaker quarter.","Stepping back here for a second, I'd like to add; we have as a company cumulatively invested or are currently investing approximately $300 million into putting in place an additional FBAR capacity. We in fact, from 2011 through the end of fiscal 2013, we expect to quadruple our FBAR capacity, driven pretty much by our expectation of strong customer demand. The growth in FBAR as a key point here will improve our Wireless gross margin going forward.","Moving onto Wired Infrastructure, revenues here came in slightly better than we expected at the beginning of the quarter. Notwithstanding, revenue sequentially declined 8%. We did benefit from double-digit growth of our ASIC business, shipping into data center switching. However, the pullback in our core routing business at one of the large communications OEM customers particularly more than offset the strength in the ASIC business.","Looking forward into Q1, we expect Wired revenue to continue to decline around high-single digits, low-double digits on a percentage basis, caused pretty much by the continued hiatus in demand in core routing from service providers.","Turning to industrial and automotive, net sales here declined 11%, sequentially, due to inventory correction in the supply chain during Q4 fiscal '12. On the other hand, we believe industrial demand has bottomed and demand continues in fact to be largely flat and lightly gradually improving going forward.","Looking at Q1, OEM demand for industrial fiber and LED products in particular has been picking up and continues to do so. We expect global resales in industrial to continue to be flat during this holiday season. However, we do expect to see contraction in distribution supply chain worldwide, therefore driving industrial revenue to decline low to mid single digits on a percentage basis compared to Q4.","With this as background and in summary, I would just add, we grew to 2% sequentially in the fourth quarter, driven primarily by strength in Wireless. Q1 wireless demand remains steady. However supply chain contraction in industrial and weak core routing spending would drive our overall revenue to decline between 5% to 9% as compared to Q4.","With that, let me now turn the call over to Doug, for more detailed review of our fourth quarter financials.","Doug Bettinger","Okay. Thanks, Hock. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining the call. Before reviewing the fourth quarter and fiscal 2012 financial results, I want to remind you that my comments today as always will focus primarily on our non-GAAP numbers. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP data is included with the earnings release that we issued today and it's also available on our website at avagotech.com.","Revenue of $618 million in Q4 represents an increase of 2% from last quarter and a decrease of 1% versus the same quarter a year ago. The sequential increase was essentially in line with our guidance for the quarter.","Revenue from our wireless target market came in at the upper end of our expectations. Revenue from our wired target market came in approximately as we expected, maybe a little bit better. And then finally as Hock took you through revenue from our industrial target market was a little weaker than what we saw a quarter ago and that was driven by contraction in our supply chain.","For the last two quarter, we've disclosed that Foxconn was a greater than 10% customer, and when we file the K, you will see that they continue to be one again this quarter. We saw the third consecutive quarter of growth in distribution resales in our three primary target markets. However, at the same time which our reslaes improved, we also saw distribution inventory fall. This dynamic is the main reason we saw our industrial market revenues declined.","Our Q4 gross margin was 51.1%, which was slightly below the midpoint of the of the guidance that we provided. This result was driven primarily by a stronger finish in our lower margin wireless target market and a weaker finish in our higher margin industrial market.","So, now let me turn to operating expenses. R&D in Q4 came in, or I should say decreased by $8 million to $75 million, while SG&A increased by $1 million to $43 million which drove operating expenses in total to $117 million, which was $7 million below last quarter's $124 million.","OpEx also came in $7 million lower than our guidance and this was due primarily to lower variable compensation accruals as a result of lower attainment of our business in financial metrics. As a percentage of sales, R&D dropped to 12%, and SG&A remained flat at 7% of net revenue. Given swing in OpEx in Q4, I wanted to pause just for a minute and give you some color on how variable compensation at Avago works.","The annual target for variable comp is in a range of $45 million to $50 million per year. This payout is based on attainment of overall corporate financial targets as well as organizational performance metrics, some of which are financial. It's typical at the beginning of our fiscal year, we provide on a pro rata basis for a 100% payout. We then true these estimates up each quarter. Some of the quarterly variation in spending is driven by our changing view of how attainment versus these goals will come out. We saw this specifically during Q4, when we took our accrual down.","As you will see in a minute, the growth in spending for Q1 is based on our estimate of 100% payout of variable compensation for fiscal 2013. Our philosophy here is simple. It is that when the company is doing well, our employees should get paid well. And when we are missing our goals, we should all get paid less. It aligns incentives pretty well here.","Now, let me go back to Q4. Income from operations for the quarter increased by $13 million sequentially to $199 million and represented 32% of net revenue, compared to the $191 million of Q4 in last year income from operations increased by $8 million. We recorded a net gain of $1 million in interest and other.","Taxes in Q4 came in at $6 million. Net income of $194 million increased 7% from the prior quarter, and Q4 earnings per diluted share of $0.77 was $0.05 higher than Q3. Compared to Q4 of last year, net income was $8 million higher. And for earnings per diluted share was $0.04 higher. Earnings are higher versus the prior year primarily due to the lower spending that I described above. The sequential increase in Q4 earnings was primarily attributed to higher revenue as well as the lower OpEx. I'd like to point out that both, operating as well as net income in Q4 were record highs for Avago.","Our share based compensation in Q4 was $14 million. The breakdown of the expense for Q4 includes $2 million in cost of goods sold, $5 million in R&D and $7 million in SG&A.","In Q1, I anticipate share based comp will be approximately $17 million, and just to remind you, the company's definition of non-GAAP net income excludes share based compensation.","If I go to balance sheet now, our DSO came in at 51 days. This was up one day from the prior quarter. The increase was due to the linearity of revenue within the quarter, which was driven primarily by the timing of product ramps in our wireless target market. Our inventory ended at $194 million, which was a decrease of $22 million from last quarter.","Days on hand came in at 58 days, which decreased eight days from Q3. Q4 inventory declined from Q3 primarily because we accumulated inventory in Q3 in anticipation of the Q4 wireless revenue growth. And in Q4, we shipped that inventory. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.84 billion and we generated $215 million in operational cash flow.","And just to foreshadow of Q1 a bit for you, Q1 is generally a little bit weaker quarter for cash generation due to the payment of our annual variable compensation relating to prior fiscal year. We spent $73 million on new CapEx. This was at the lower end of our guidance for the quarter and it was mainly due to the timing of equipment delivery.","In Q1, we expect CapEx to be in the range of $75 million to $85 million. The increase is primarily due to the ongoing build out of incremental FBAR filter capacity to support growing customer demand.","For fiscal 2013, I now expect CapEx will be roughly flat to maybe slightly up from fiscal year 2012. The continued investment will be primarily in FBAR as Hock described in a little bit in the Wired Infrastructure area.","During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 294,000 shares which consumed $10 million of cash. On October 1st, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.16 per ordinary share and that consumed $39 million of cash. This dividend was raised by $0.01 from the prior quarter. And, I'd just point out since the inception of our dividend program in Q1 of 2011, we have continued to increase our dividend each quarter. We also have continued to evaluate potential strategic investments and acquisitions as another way deploying cash to enhance shareholder returns.","Let me now briefly recap our fiscal 2012 full year results. Revenue increased by 1% to approximately $2.4 billion driven by the strength in our wireless business. Gross margin declined by 70 basis points to 51%, also driven by the decline also due to the strength of our Wireless business.","Net income for 2012 increased to $700 million, or $2.77 per diluted share and that compares with $692 million or $2.70 per diluted share in fiscal 2011.","Let me now turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2013. I'd just let you know Q1 will be a 14-week long quarter which happens every five or six years here for us. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions and we don't intend to update this guidance.","As Hock told you, revenue is expected to be down at a range 5% to 9% over Q4, caused by the weakness in core routing as well as the continued contraction in the industrial supply chain. I expect gross margin to be approximately 50.5% plus or minus one percentage point. The slight sequential decline is primarily a result of the end market revenue mix.","Operating expenses are estimated to be $130 million. And as I explained earlier, this was driven by an increase in our variable compensation accruals. Interest and other is projected be a gain of approximately $1 million. Taxes are forecasted to be approximately $7 million. And finally, the diluted share count forecast is for 253 million shares.","Let me just remind you. This quarter will be the last time that we report consumer and computing as a standalone target market. Starting with Q1 of next year, we'll group the remaining revenues from this business with industrial given the insignificant size of the remaining consumer revenue. And I just mentioned, revenue from consumer was down sharply in Q4 due to the last time bias in Q3, and we expect, what remains as consumer revenue, will be down again in Q1.","We'll provide you with the recast of historical information in the earnings tables next quarter, so this change is clear.","That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please go ahead and open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Okay. (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Terence Whalen with Citi. Please proceed.","Terence Whalen - Citi","Thank you. Good afternoon. I guess, the first question will be on the comments that Hock made regarding quadrupling and FBAR capacity. That seems like it's an incremental update from what you had last shared with us. Specifically, what I wanted to understand is what the gross margin effect on Wireless will be if you can help us understand the magnitude of that? Thanks.","Doug Bettinger","Yes, Terence. I'm not going to quantify it for you, except I think you know that the margin on FBAR, when we sell FBAR is better than some of the other products we sell in wireless, and so Hock's comment is telling you that we expect wireless gross margin ended up itself to get better as we ramp FBAR.","Terence Whalen - Citi","Okay. Terrific. Then perhaps the follow-up question that I have is around the core routing. It's a little bit of a surprise to see the magnitude of weakness two quarters in a row when some of the other competitors and peers in that space have actually seen some improvement. Can you help us understand what's driving that for Avago specifically, and do you have line of sight into that business improving in April? Thank you.","Hock Tan","Yes. Very interesting question, Terence, is on core routing. The products we supply, these are fiber products. We supply proprietary fiber products I should add we supply into core routing is fairly unique, is proprietary by that definition. In a sense, that there are not too many OEMs who make those core routers. They need it for very high volume, high bandwidth flow of data and usually invest that in the backhaul side of any infrastructure development as opposed to the front side, which is more the base station discrete.","This is really more related to backhaul as connect interface to transport, and those investments do tend to be rather lumpy, we do have some line of sight but it does get lumpy and it's fairly substantial each time a program comes in.","I guess, what I should have added is, sitting here looking ahead as I used the word hiatus and it's true. There's a hiatus in investment in core routing at this point by some service providers. But eventually, such investments need to be made in order to create the bandwidth needed as there are more and more smartphones and especially LTE running.","We do see a line of sight that, while this quarter Q1 might continue weakness in core routing investment and therefore demand for proprietary fiber products, we do see coming fall fairly shortly a large program in China, and probably another one in China latter part in the year.","We see one being recently awarded in Japan though it takes a while for it to translate into demand for our product, not very long and we definitely do see with an expansion of LTE networks in North America for investments by carriers in North America to be made in core routing for the rest of this year. So, we are pretty positive. So, we are kind of, as I say, in the midst of a hiatus right now.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank","Hi, guys. Just a question on the guidance, on the per segment comment. It seems like if wireless is flat, the math barely gets you to the low end of your guidance range, the down 5 versus the down 9 end? Is there something I am missing in the guidance range that, Hock, you gave to explain how you would get to the mid or the lower end of our guidance range?","Doug Bettinger","Well, you should understand that what is left of consumer of, Ross, is, going to decline also. So, you got about $10 million drop-off if we were giving you that next quarter. That might be why your numbers are netting up?","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank","Okay. That's helpful to know. And then, I guess, as a more forward-looking question here, the extra week that you guys have in the January quarter, how should we think about that impacting both, the revenue and OpEx side of the equation not only in the January quarter but also in the April quarter?","Hock Tan","I guess, it's a simple thing. It's more likely to impact expenses than revenue. We'll have one more week of expenses. That's for sure, as given where, how it runs. But, for the November to January quarter, when you pretty much have Christmas and New Year's break in between, I think from a revenue point of view, historically, we've not seen much change in terms of how it runs compared to other quarters in the fiscal year but expenses with 14 weeks would definitely add an extra week of spending.","Doug Bettinger","And, Ross, our guidance comprehends the extra week in both items revenue and expenses.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank","So, that 130 was not just the variable pop back to a 100% payout, but also the inclusion of the extra week?","Doug Bettinger","The biggest thing is the variable comp, but there is other stuff in there as well. I don't always give you every single detail, but variable comp is the biggest but certainly the extra week is part also.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please proceed.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays","Good afternoon, guys. Hock, I was wondering if you could talk about, you talked about sell-through industrial or sell-out being flat by reducing inventory. Can you compare this to the levels you saw last January when the business did bottom out and how close are we to those levels?","Hock Tan","We are pretty close to that level right now. First quarter fiscal '12 is when there was Thai floods, those big floods in Thailand and that's when it hit in our industrial business as many others industrial and automotive business all over the world and that ruled down a lot in inventory at distributors worldwide simply because they couldn't ship much to distributors and end customers were pulling it out of these three channels. By the time we end this quarter Q1, we will be pretty close to that level.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays","Thanks. And then on the Wireless, I guess, flattish with the extra week is a little bit down. You talked about the strength of your top two, so does that just mean the non-top two are seeing weakness. And then, can you talk about your outlook for the rest of the year and whether you see yourself as a share gainer as you go through the year?","Hock Tan","Well, I guess, trying and looking ahead on Wireless. By the way I have to qualify that to say we seem to be in a room here wireless, where things change all the time. The fact you're experiencing one year doesn't mean it's the same the next year. As I indicated to you guys, I think, a few months ago, we expected this quarter Q1 Wireless to be relatively flat from the preceding quarter, which is typically our strongest quarter in a 12-month period. And as we see it here now, we have Q1 running at the same rate as Q4.","It depends on how fast the product transitions occur at those two major OEMs. I think, that's what more than anything else drives the characteristic that drives what one would call the ups and downs of the wireless business for us. And in other words, if the launch of new ramps on one of those two OEMs or both those two OEMs occur earlier and as you saw in this year '12 it launched around September-October, timeframe, kind of later.","But, if that thing were to be pulled forward, then probably product transition quarter would occur probably earlier than this year. This year it occurred in our fiscal Q3. If these things will pull forward, which possibly could, though we don't know, it's too early to know, then it could move forward one quarter or it could push back one quarter and could still remain at Q3 as we did in calendar '12.","So, given the information I have right now, I would probably say, most likely we would have the same situation as we had this year, product transition in wireless which means the lowest quarter of the year would occur in our fiscal Q3, but I could be wrong by one quarter.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura. Please proceed.","Romit Shah - Nomura ","Yes. Thanks a lot, guys. Hock, I was somewhat encouraged just by your comments on industrial. I know it was down in January. You mentioned that industrial demand or resales is flat to improving. Is that a trend that you guys have observed more recently?","Hock Tan","No. We are seeing that now for three quarters in a row. Okay? As, you know, most of our industrial business goes through distributors, not all but I would say 85% to 90% of it goes through distributors. And based on resale, our industrial business has in fact been virtually flat the last three quarters. And, so, I would say we are definitely in the trough and we are probably looking at it probably slowly gradually creeping from the trough, especially when it comes to China.","Romit Shah - Nomura ","Then my follow-up would be, what normalized revenues are for the segment. Because, on your January guidance, it looks like industrial will be around $130 million to $135 million. That's up from where it was a year ago, but it's still well below the 180-plus you guys were doing in the back half of 2011?","Hock Tan","Right. Well, as I said, because it goes through distribution and we recognized revenue and you correctly pointed out ship into our channels. You will see in periods of volatility, like on periods of uncertainty I should say, this sort of thing happening and part of it relates to the fact that tracing back to the beginning of fiscal '12. Another way of putting it in, beginning of calendar '12 when we were experiencing like many other industrial component manufacturers, the Thai flood, at that time, we obviously had to draw down substantially our end customers that have drawn substantially on channel inventory to meet their needs and we weren't able to replenish those channel inventory in the obviously timely manner and that was beginning of '12.","And, we obviously started to replenish it in our fiscal Q2 and fiscal Q3. And since then, we have been drawing back, the distribution channels has been bringing down their inventory levels quite significantly and that's pretty much what we are seeing over the course of fiscal '12. An answer to an earlier question from the audience was that by the end of this fiscal quarter, our inventory level in the channel would be as low as it was as it was in January calendar '12 when we had the Thai floods and when inventory was really been drawn down, but through all this my point is as it generates our revenue shipping that is resale has been pretty flat.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed","Vivek Arya - Merrill Lynch","Thanks for taking my question. Hock, first one on Wireless. I am curious how your visibility is into design wins in the flagship smartphone products for 2013. Do you think you will be able to maintain your content in terms of absolute dollars for phone, because as you also acknowledge your top customers have a habit of changing suppliers with every generation of phone?","Hock Tan","You said it, exactly. These guys have a habit of going for the things they need, be it, the best performance or the best price and it depends on the program they are engaged in and depends on the OEM themselves. Usually, we have visibility out six months, good visibility out about six months, so it's limited but out six months and sometimes nine months and that's the extend of it.","Doug Bettinger","But, Vivek, we wouldn't be investing CapEx if we weren't feeling pretty good about the broad market need for FBAR, so we're talking to people. We don't know the exact design wins, but we kind of know to know what they are going to need and we kind of know where they are going to need to come to get the performance that FBAR provides.","Hock Tan","The trend is very clear, especially when we went from CDMA to 3G and now particularly from 3G to 4G or LTE and the proliferation of smartphones that are LTE-enabled, which doesn't mean they are just LTE (Inaudible). They go back what's into better comparable to 3G and 2G and CDMA, which basically puts a lot of bands and requirements on any particular piece of a device, which basically creates a lot of what we have said before coexistence problems. All that rose into a situation where as I've mentioned in my opening remarks, a situation where when five years ago maybe one or two bands in the spectrum uses FBAR. Today, we have 15 bands that uses FBAR. Of course, the number of bands have proliferated since then.","I mean five, six years ago may be there was less than 10 bands. Today, there are 40 bands, but having said that, out of 40 bands 15 uses FBAR, so those kind of trends and demand and the proliferation of smartphones and content in basically in those smartphones is what's driving the need for us to expand our capacity in a fairly, fairly radical manner.","Vivek Arya - Merrill Lynch","Got it. And then follow-up, Hock, is if you look at your top customer they have already made the move to LTE. The last time they made the move to 3G, the next generation of phone RF content probably came down, because they were able to integrate different components.","So, now that they have already made the move to 4G LTE, do you think it's possible that their next one or two products RF content perhaps on a like-to-like basis comes down, because they are able to take advantage of integration and just a competition in the RF frontend market?","Hock Tan","It is possible. We are talking a bit conceptual here, so please take that in mind and audience when I say it. It's possible because, you are right. They will try to integrate. I mean, the number of bands hasn't changed. In fact, the number of bands will increase as we go into more and more LTE in various parts of the world.","Offsetting that number of bands means more content in theory linearly. But in practice, your point is taken. The integration or so to say the consolidation of RF components will reduce the content the other direction. Having said that, I do want to remind you from our very self-interest bias point of view, you can see that in power amplifiers. You don't see that in filters or duplexers. You cannot integrate duplexers or filters. Every band needs a separate filter.","You don't integrate them together, but power amplifiers has been as we have seen in a recent 8960 Qualcomm chipset have supported or supports power amplifiers, 2G and some of the 3G bands integrated as one single chip solution in power amplifiers. But for duplexers and filters, which is the main thrust of interest for this company, it never gets integrated.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin with UBS. Please proceed.","Stephen Chin - UBS","Hi, Hock. Hi, Doug. Thanks for taking my question. Wanted to ask a couple of more follow-up questions on industrial just to better calibrate my understanding there, but in the past I know that emerging markets such as china was a big part of the growth in your industrial story. Is that still the case now or is North American group, a big component of what's driving the trends there?","And, secondly, in the terms of product areas, are alternative energy power electronics, that's still something that's maybe on the rise or playing some factor in variability in your industrial demand?","Hock Tan","I apologize. I didn't quite catch the first question you asked. I know the second one is about alternative energy. You got it? Doug go ahead.","Doug Bettinger","Stephen, you're asking if China still drives our industrial business as much as it used to, right?","Stephen Chin - UBS","Correct.","Hock Tan","Okay. Good question, and it's a question I don't really know 100%. It's not as obvious it is driving and so the best answer is not as much as it used to in the heydays of 2010, and definitely part of 2011, much less now but it still does have an impact and quite a big impact. Because, the industrial multinationals resell into Central Europe and into Japan and even part of North America, export a fair amount of their products into China for China programs. So, it does have that. It still drives part of it, but much less than it used to.","You asked me to quantify how much, I'm not sure. I could quantify that. By drives, it has much less impact which is probably the reason why we are seeing industrial resale among Tier 2, Tier 3, which tend to go through distribution a lot. To be very flat in countries like North America and in countries like and more than flat declining in countries like Europe and Japan offset by gradual increase in industrial resale in places like China and in emerging countries. It balances out globally industrial resale what we've seen over the last nine months has been virtually flat.","On the second question on renewable energy, there are two parts to it. One of the major part, you're talking about is remaining to solar, wind those kind of renewable energy things. Yeah, there was strength few years ago in the period of 2009, 2010, it's pretty strong. From 2011 onwards, things have come down quite dramatically. It's now, I think, shrunk to a relatively smaller percentage of our total industrial business probably maybe down to about 5%, 10%.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Danely from JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Doug Bettinger","Chris are you there?","Chris Danely - JPMorgan","Can you hear me okay?","Doug Bettinger","We can't hear you. Try again. We can't hear you, Chris.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. Please proceed.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Can you hear me?","Doug Bettinger","Yes. We can hear you, Mark.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies","Great. Two easy questions first on FBAR. What's your market share now? What do you think it will do over the next year or two? And, second on the FBAR business. Can you help us understand to what extent you get attach, where you sell the FBAR par which you guys have a great position and you get attach rates of other silicon in the handset. Thank you.","Hock Tan","Okay. Great. To answer the first part of question, I'll now rephrase your question. I apologize for doing it, but I'll rephrase your question. It's not really sharing the FBAR as much as the filter business. What penetration is FBAR, and as I mentioned before in simple terms, there are 40 bands right now roughly operating in the world 40 cellular bands and 15 of that do use FBAR.","It doesn't mean every one of them use it, so if I were to guess market penetration by handsets, I would probably say 20% only if at all, 15%, 20% is FBAR. Maybe even less, which it's interesting thought gives us lot of room to grow, but only 15%, 20% uses FBAR at this points and that includes all the LTE bands.","And the way FBAR pulls other components. That's very interesting good question and I'd like to highlight that and it refers back to an earlier question about, A, if FBAR has sold discretely that means staying standalone duplexer filter. FBAR creates a lot of gross margin, generates a very high gross margin for us but they do not sell on its own most of the time.","You pair an FBAR or it pulls with it power amplifiers usually. Among other small other components, largely power amplifiers. And, so that kind of dilute our mix, but it is a necessary think. That it gives us content and a lot of times those two pull together as package in the frontend module as we call it, or as some people call it paired or frontend modules which basically gives a higher prices, higher dollar content but relatively lower margin.","But as more of this frontend modules requires FBAR, obviously, it's also good for us in improving not only our dollars, but our margin. It's not typically, but I would say 75% at least of our volume of FBAR, are sold paired with power amplifiers.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Joanne Feeney with Longbow Research. Please proceed.","Joanne Feeney - Longbow Research","Thank you. Can you guys hear me?","Doug Bettinger","We can hear you, Joanne.","Joanne Feeney - Longbow Research","Perfect. Okay. Question on the FBAR capacity expansion. So in the past, you talked about doubling capacity by the middle of 2013. Today you said quadruple. I'm wondering if that's just a change in your starting point of comparison or if you've actually doubled your intentions. And if so, can you tie that to CapEx for the year? And then, I have follow-on.","Doug Bettinger","Yes. We have doubled our intension, Joanne, and it's because we are going a little further out in time and so that's why I told you next year CapEx will be at least as high as it was in 2012 and maybe slightly higher. And, Hock mentioned the fact that, cumulatively between what we've already invested and what we will invest in 2013, it will be $300 million on FBAR alone.","Hock Tan","And, I would add a little bit more. It's not that we improve or increase our intension. We're so pull forward a part of that, so from 2011 to today to early next year we would have doubled the capacity. And about another year's time, we would double it again.","Joanne Feeney - Longbow Research","Okay. Perfect. And then could you give us a sense of how that might affect gross margin. What I'm wondering in particular is the timing of when this new capacity comes online and how that matches up to the programs you see demanding your FBAR products?","Doug Bettinger","Joanne, it kind of comes in the way we do this. As it comes in tool-by-tool and we try to do it such that we bring the constrained tools in and it gradually increases capacity. And, if we're going to do in this we'll match it with demand. You don't always get that exactly right.","Hock Tan","We expect to trend gross margin up, but it's a trend not a spike and it's hard to predict it accurately at this point other than to be able to tell you it will continue to trend out this capacity. It basically depends on whether we sell it individually discretely as FBAR duplexer or we sell it in a frontend module which obviously affects the revenue, but brings down gross margin somewhat and it's a mix of the two and it's pretty hard to predict the mix going out that far. All we do know is the trend.","Operator","And your next question comes from Ian Ing with Lazard Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Ian Ing - Lazard Capital Markets","Yes. Thank you. So, given the fall off in core routing is, what's the mix between proprietary and standards optics? Is it still 50-50. And for standard optics, what's the pricing environment right now given the current demand?","Doug Bettinger","So, it's a little more standard than it used to be given the fall off in parallel. Ian. I don't know. Hock, you want to take the pricing question?","Hock Tan","The pricing question, optics always has this price, a downward price trend line in semiconductor products which is considered as though. I don't think it really is a semiconductor product. It's a normal pricing environment we see today, which is roughly, frankly depending on which particular generation of product it is somewhere in the range of anywhere from 5% to 10% annually is what we tend to see in our mix of fiber optics products.","Obviously, the newer product tends to ramp down faster and stabilizes, the older product pretty much stays firm. Older products, I mean the 1G tends to be more firm, 10\/100, if you imagine that's still exists, still it's more firm and the newer 8-gigabit per second storage product or 10-gigabit per second would tend to start off at a higher price and move down much faster. So, the mix of that, I would say on the most steady state basis, will range from 5% to 10% a year, sometimes into the low double-digits.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Aalok Shah with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed.","Aalok Shah - D.A. Davidson","Hi, Doug. Just a real quick clarification. Can you go over the consumer business again? So, does that business go down about another $10 million going into the January quarter and then you are going to include it into the industrial business?","Doug Bettinger","Yeah. Exactly right, Aalok.","Aalok Shah - D.A. Davidson","Okay. And then, if we look at kind of how you are thinking about the FBAR business it does sound like that the seasonality is changing again next year. How do you guys view, I mean I know you don't want give me full guidance, but are you guys seeing a change in how handsets are being delivered or designed for next year?","Hock Tan","No. I think it's the same way. It's just that. the dynamic, it is still very much there for most part. I guess, you probably see two big guys and also other significant OEM guys out there and there's still seasonality for the most part, which comes at this time of the year and everybody tries to get their products launched before fall towards this seasonality but the difference also is there are one or two of those big OEMs who go through more than one product launches, significant product launches a year and the other big one, do it once a year. And, so you still see that, but it tweaks one as a component supply to everyone, we see each year somewhat.","In the old days, when the OEM makers were all not that far apart in size more or less about the same size, we do see the seasonality of year end, Christmas year-end becomes very pronounced. Today, the seasonality is pronounced for the significant OEM. But, because of also the way share is shifted, that seasonality gets to a large extent muted by the size of the two big guys continuing their strong ramps.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed.","Matt Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity","Good afternoon, gentlemen. This is Matt Ramsay on for Mike. Thanks for taking our questions. The first question is, Hock, it's fairly well understood which two of the unnamed dominant smartphone OEMs are driving your wireless business. A quick question there, were each of those two, both 10% customers in the quarter or only your leading one?","Doug Bettinger","Matt, we don't disclose unless it is a 10% customer. In my scripted remarks purposely gave you Foxconn as a 10% customer and that's all I have to tell you.","Matt Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity","Fair enough. And, as a follow-up, now that your leading customer has included LTE in all their global SKUs, we're seeing in our checks other high tier OEMs may be forced to follow suite and Qualcomm's LTE based band solutions are definitely well positioned in that market.","Hock, maybe you could talk a little about your FBAR alignment with Qualcomm's LTE roadmap and reference designs, relative to your competitors and maybe your attach rate with Qualcomm's LTE wins to this point? Thanks.","Hock Tan","Well, the best way for me to describe is, we're obviously very, very closely engaged in enabling Qualcomm on our RF side with both, our FBAR duplexers as well as our PA designs as well as frontend design and a combination of anything else in the RF they need and we are obviously very, very well engaged with them on that. It definitely benefits us a lot to do that and we continue to do that.","But, in terms of specifics pretty hard. That's a lot of designs. There are many, many designs that keep pouring out and I can't even begin to tell you how many we have engaged versus how many there are out there. Just sufficient that we do have, we have very close engagement, not only just with Qualcomm, but with the OEMs who takes those reference design and do not necessarily follow those reference designs either.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Danely with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Sameer Kalucha - JPMorgan","Hi. This is Sameer Kalucha calling in for Chris Danely. Can you hear me now?","Doug Bettinger","Yes. We can.","Sameer Kalucha - JPMorgan","Okay. Great. Sorry about earlier. I think, we need FBAR filters here in the phone here to.","Doug Bettinger","Clearly.","Sameer Kalucha - JPMorgan","Of course. The question I have is around taxes. The taxes have been in the $15 million to $20 million range as you pointed out during the IPO. But at that time, you also said you have visibility into the next three, four years going forward. I wonder how the visibility into tax holidays is at this point. Do you expect it to continue for another, I would say, two, three, four, five years or is it subject to change?","Doug Bettinger","Sameer, the visibility is much longer than that. For the indefinite future, our effective tax rate will be 4% to 5%. It's not going away. Our tax holidays are double-digit number of years.","Sameer Kalucha - JPMorgan","Got it. Thank you.","Doug Bettinger","And we work to extend them all the time.","Sameer Kalucha - JPMorgan","Great, and then a lot of people and some of your peers have also expressed some possibility of a snapback in macro demand going past once the uncertainties on fiscal cliffs and those sorts have cleared. I wonder does that change your outlook in, say, April timeframe if that uncertainty is clear from the flattish resales you are seeing right now?","Hock Tan","It is hard for us to sitting here right now to know for sure with any degree of certainty that that would happen. And as I said, we only focus all the way out with any degree of guidance levels that we have here through the end of this quarter. Beyond that? Who knows? I'll be honest. With no clue.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brendan Furlong with Miller Tabak. Please proceed.","Brendan Furlong - Miller Tabak","Yes. Good afternoon, everybody. Thank you. Two quick questions both, on gross margins. I don't know if my first question has been addressed, but how much of the downtick in gross margin in the fiscal Q1 is mix related versus utilization, be it, backend or frontend and what the implication for that would be in the April quarter?","Doug Bettinger","It's primarily mix, Brendan.","Brendan Furlong - Miller Tabak","Okay. Then the second question, following-up on Joanne questions, you were expecting to double your capacity in the middle of next year and then your comment on gross margins for FBAR after that. So, should we assume that the see through on the gross margin side happens in the second half of your fiscal year? We don't see it for the first half in others words.","Doug Bettinger","It should in the second half, and as FBAR gets to be bigger and bigger percentage of the mix which we see that happening as we go through back part of 2013, you should begin to see it trick its way through.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call over to Tom Krause for closing remarks.","Tom Krause","Thank you, operator.

At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Ashish Saran, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Ashish Saran","Thank you, operator and good afternoon everyone. Joining me today are Hock Tan, President and CEO; and Tom Krause, acting Chief Financial Officer of Broadcom Limited.","After the market closed today, Broadcom distributed a press release and financial tables describing our financial performance for the third quarter of fiscal year 2016. If you did not receive a copy, you may obtain the information from the Investors section of Broadcom\u2019s website at www.broadcom.com. This conference call is being webcast live, and a recording will be available via telephone playback for 1 week. It will also be archived in the Investors section of our website at broadcom.com.","During the prepared comments section of this call, Hock and Tom will be providing details of our third quarter fiscal year 2016 results, background to our fourth quarter fiscal year 2016 outlook and some commentary regarding the business environment. We will take questions after the end of our prepared comments. In addition to U.S. GAAP reporting, Broadcom reports certain financial measures on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the tables attached to today\u2019s press release. Comments made during today\u2019s call will primarily refer to our non-GAAP financial results. Please refer to our press release today and our recent filings with the SEC for information on the specific risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Hock Tan. Hock?","Hock Tan","Thank you, Ashish. Good afternoon, everyone. Well, we did deliver very strong results for our third fiscal quarter 2016, with revenue at $3.8 billion, up 7% sequentially and above the midpoint of guidance. Earnings per share of $2.89 grew by more impressive 14% sequentially as we benefited from the leverage inherent in our business model. I am rather pleased with our execution on integrating classic Broadcom businesses and divesting several of its non-core businesses we had identified as assets held for sale. We have also made rapid progress in driving towards our target business model within the first two quarters after closing the acquisition, but we are not yet done with the full realization of expected acquisition-related cost synergies.","Let me now turn to a discussion of our third quarter segment results starting with wired. In the third quarter, wired revenue came in at $2.07 billion and the wired segment represented 54% of total revenues. Revenue for this segment was flat sequentially as the strong demand we had seen for wired products in the prior quarter continued to sustain into the third quarter. This was slightly weaker than we have expected due to lower than expected set-top box product shipments because of supply constraints. However, the reduction in set-top box revenue was offset by growth in our ASICs, particularly in Ethernet switching and fiber optic shipments into the fiber-to-the-home applications.","We also benefited from strong demand for fiber-to-the-home products in our broadband access business, switching and routing ASSPs sustained as datacenter operators continue to upgrade their infrastructure. Our Jericho routing product family, which is enabling a whole new set of switching and routing platforms for our core customers had a strong ramp in this quarter. As we look into the fourth quarter for our wired segment, similar to the prior quarter, we expect wired to sustain and continue to come in flat sequentially. We continue to resolve supply constraints in this segment as we progress through the fourth quarter.","Moving on to wireless, in the third quarter, wireless revenue came in at about $1 billion, and this segment represented 27% of total revenues. Revenue for this segment was up 27% sequentially somewhat stronger than expectations. Growth was primarily driven by the expected start of a ramp from a large North American smartphone customer as they transition to their next generation platform further enhanced by a substantial increase in Broadcom\u2019s content in the new handset. We also benefited from continued demand increases from our large Asian handset customer.","Looking towards the fourth quarter fiscal 2016, we expect strong growth to continue in our wireless segment and we are projecting revenue growth over 30% sequentially here. We expect this growth to result from the full ramp of the new phone model and our North American smartphone customer partially offset by the annual product cycle rollover in our large Asian customer.","Let me now turn to enterprise storage. In the third quarter, enterprise storage revenue came in at $527 million, and this segment represented 14% of total revenue. Segment revenue came in flat sequentially compared to the large seasonal decline in the prior quarter. We had expected revenue in this segment to decline sequentially, but instead we delivered better results as some stability returned to both the hard disk drive and server storage SaaS connectivity businesses in the third quarter. Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect positive end market seasonality to drive enterprise storage revenue growth in the low single-digits sequentially.","Finally, to our last segment, industrial, as I mentioned previously, this segment also includes our IP, intellectual property licensing business. In the third quarter, industrial segment revenue came in at $202 million, up 11% sequentially much better than expectations. Industrial segment represented 5% of our total revenue. In IP licensing, as expected, after a strong and lumpy second quarter, revenue dropped in the third quarter in IP licensing. In contrast, industrial product resales, there is our distributors selling to our end customers grew by a healthy 15% sequentially, with strong demand from all geographies. As a result, industrial product revenue also increased sequentially and significantly as we replenish depleted channel inventory during the third quarter. And accordingly, as we look into the fourth quarter and take into account the strong inventory replenishment in the third quarter, we plan on reducing shipments into the channel as we head towards the seasonally weaker end of the calendar year. Therefore, even as we focus resales to continue to be firm and trend up mid single-digits, we expect an approximate 20% sequential decline in fourth quarter industrial revenue.","In summary, therefore, I would like to say it\u2019s visibility to near-term projected demand remains very solid and we anticipate continued momentum into the fourth quarter. We expect the ramp in our wireless segment to drive consolidated revenue growth of 8% sequentially. We expect our operating leverage to drive earnings per share growth of 16% sequentially twice our projected revenue growth.","With that, let me now turn the call over to Tom for a more detailed review of our third quarter financials.","Tom Krause","Thank you, Hock and good afternoon everyone. My comments today will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results from continuing operations unless otherwise specifically noted. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP data is included with the earnings release issued today and is also available on our website at broadcom.com.","We continue to focus on our core businesses or franchises as we call them, to drive a financial model that delivers sustainable mid single-digit annual revenue growth at greater than 60% gross margin and greater than 40% operating margin. To that end, in the third quarter, we took another very positive step towards our target model. We achieved healthy top line growth with gross margin over 60% and operating margin at just over 39%. As our integration plans progress, we see a very clear line of sight to achieving our target model in fiscal year 2017.","We were also able to improve our capital structure in the quarter. We completed both previously announced divestitures collecting over $600 million in cash and paid down $1.3 billion of our long-term debt. Finally, just after the quarter close, we took advantage of favorable credit markets to refinance our outstanding term loans at substantially lower rates. I will touch on the details of the refinancing later in my prepared remarks.","Now let me turn to a summary of our results for the third quarter. Revenue for the third quarter came in at $3.8 billion, growing 6.7% sequentially. Foxconn was greater than 10% direct customer in the third fiscal quarter. Our third quarter gross margin from continuing operations was 60.4%, about 40 basis points above the midpoint of guidance, primarily due to better than expected operational efficiency.","Turning to operating expenses, R&D expenses were $667 million and SG&A expenses were $141 million. This resulted in total operating expenses for the third quarter of $808 million, in line with guidance. Operating expenses were flat sequentially as the benefits from the ongoing realization of acquisition related cost synergies were offset by higher bonus accruals due to higher profitability. Our fourth quarter guidance for operating expenses anticipates a similar outcome. We expect our IT platform integration, which is scheduled to be completed in early fiscal year 2017, to continue to drive operating expense reductions next year as we work towards the full realization of projected acquisition related cost synergies. On a percentage basis for the third quarter, total operating expenses were 21.3% of revenue. As a percentage of sales, R&D was 17.6%, and SG&A was 3.7%. Operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $1.5 billion approximately and represented 39.2% of net revenue.","Taxes came in at $61 million, slightly above our guidance. This was primarily due to higher than expected net income. Third quarter net income was $1.3 billion approximately and earnings per diluted share was $2.89. Third quarter interest expense was $139 million and other income net was $4 million. As I mentioned in the opening remarks on August 2 right after the quarter closed the second day of the fourth fiscal quarter, in fact we completed the refinancing of outstanding term loans by upsizing our term loan A and reducing our term loan B by an equivalent amount and simultaneously re-pricing the remainder of the term loan B at a lower interest rate. The net effect is a reduction of our blended cost of debt based on current LIBOR from 3.5% to 2.9%. This refinancing significantly lowers our projected ongoing interest expenses starting with the fourth fiscal quarter of 2016. Keep in mind our indebtedness is 100% floating rate and is therefore subject to movement in short-term interest rates.","Our share based compensation expense in the third quarter was $213 million, which included the full impact from new grants issued to classic Broadcom employees after the close of the acquisition in the second quarter. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we anticipate share based compensation expense will also be approximately $213 million. Just as a reminder, our definition of GAAP net income excludes share based compensation expense.","Moving on to the balance sheet, our days sales outstanding were 52 days, an increase of 4 days from the prior quarter due to the timing of the seasonal ramp in our wireless revenues. Our inventory ended at $1.3 billion, down from $1.47 billion in the prior quarter. This was primarily due to the completion of wireless filter inventory we have built up in prior quarters to support the strong second half production ramp, which started as expected in the third quarter. We generated $963 million in operational cash flow, which reflected the impact of approximately $96 million of cash expended on restructuring activities. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of approximately $2 billion. In the third quarter, we spent $232 million on capital expenditures.","For the fourth quarter, we expect CapEx to be approximately $325 million. As I had mentioned previously, we expect CapEx to run at an elevated level over the next several quarters, driven by campus construction, primarily at our Irvine and San Jose locations, integration related operations and IT investments and the ongoing RF filter fab capacity expansion we discussed in the past. A total of $211 million in cash was spent on company dividend partnership distribution payments in the third quarter. And as I think you have seen already, our Board just recently declared a dividend of $0.51 per share to be paid later in this fourth fiscal quarter.","Now let me turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions and we do not intend to update this guidance. This guidance is for results from continuing operations only. Net revenue is expected to be $4.1 billion, plus or minus $75 million. Gross margin is expected to be 60.5% plus or minus one percentage points. Operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $108 million. Taxes are forecasted to be approximately $71 million. Net interest expense and other is expected to be approximately $104 million, and the diluted share count forecast is for 448 million shares.","Now that concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, if you could please open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","John Pitzer","Yes. Hock and Tom, thanks for letting me ask the question. Hock my first question is just on the wired business, you talked about supply constraints in the set-top box area, was that all the miss in the July quarter. And then when you look at the non-set-top box portion of wired through both July and October, I am just kind of curious you could qualify how that business is trending, especially because some companies have been talking about de-acceleration in data center spending in the back half of the year, I would think that you guys would probably be an early leading indicator for that because you really don\u2019t want to buy CPUs if you don\u2019t have kind of your [indiscernible] so any kind of color on that would be helpful?","Hock Tan","Okay. Well, with regard to data center spending, yes we do see strength. And in fact, we saw the strength as early as Q2, our fiscal Q2, not calendar but our fiscal Q2. And that strength has continued into this current \u2013 into Q3 and even as we sit here right now.","John Pitzer","And then Hock, as my follow-up on the wireless business, you are guiding sequential growth higher in the October quarter than July quarter, which is consistent with what you said on the last conference call, I am just kind of curious if you can help us understand what\u2019s unit driven versus content driven and now that we are sort of a quarter into some new builds of new cell phones, can you talk a little bit about your content growth expectation on both the FBAR and the connectivity side for some of those new phones?","Hock Tan","Well, one thing I have to press is, this is a \u2013 what we are seeing in this quarter Q3 fiscal quarter and Q4, most of Q4 fiscal quarter is all over that ends in October. That represents a period when it\u2019s still a ramp, okay. So its how one constructs the ramp and orders required of our key customers and not necessarily representatives of volumes that would eventually be sold through the various channels into end customers. So with that preface, what we are always saying is with the build year-on-year be compared back to a year ago, the build in unit terms has not significantly changed. It\u2019s largely all about content change \u2013 changes.","John Pitzer","Perfect. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.","Hock Tan","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Blayne Curtis","Hey, guys. Nice results. Just two questions on wireless, if you could just talk about, obviously, you have one customer doing the big ramp you mentioned one baseline now, can you talk about the China market and what you are seeing there and then on the connectivity side, could you just talk about the roadmap there for Thompson increase, I know you are getting little GPS this go around, but just for WiFi combo chip, what\u2019s the roadmap and what\u2019s the opportunity to gain more content over the next couple of generations?","Hock Tan","Okay. Well, let\u2019s touch about WiFi, which is wireless connectivity with Bluetooth combo included in it. It\u2019s \u2013 what we are seeing now today is by the way, we are largely in the high-end phones, where we have \u2013 where we are driving 802.11ac generation. And in that regard, we are not seeing that much content increase say from a year ago. We expect to see that content increase as we move into next year as more functionality, higher performance, multi-bands start to come into play, which includes not just 2.5 gigahertz, but 5 gigahertz. We also expect to see beyond that 802.11ac moving into AX, which would be a big step up for the \u2013 in content gain. And in many ways, this is all about increasing capacity throughput of bandwidth of data transfers through these WiFi connections. Apparel situation to our LTE wireless situation was increasing bands. First, LTE and then they are increasing the number of bands in LTE interconnectivity leading to increasing content. Very, very similar, may not match it to other as we move one generation to the other, but their overall trend upward is extremely light.","Blayne Curtis","Thanks. Can you just talk about on the cellular side, what you are seeing in China? Thanks.","Hock Tan","Well, our visibility in China is not that good in the sense that we sell to OEMs and they sell to all over the world and our focus largely on very high-end premium phones be they premium phones from Chinese makers or U.S. makers or Korean makers. So, it\u2019s not really a good representation of true end demand as others may see it in China.","Blayne Curtis","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Vivek Arya","Thanks for letting me ask a question. For my first one, Hock, you mentioned supply constraints in your set-top box business, which I believe is around $500 million, $550 million a quarter or so. Can you quantify how much sales you are missing? Is it a 5% impact? Is it a 10% impact? And is there going to be a quarter in the future when you catch up with all these sales that you are missing right now?","Hock Tan","Well, first of all, it\u2019s very hard for us to quantify, because customer comes in and place their request and we obviously modulated with what we can shift and so there will be push and pull. And by the time it\u2019s all done, I will be honest I don\u2019t have a good idea what it is. And even I do, I probably wouldn\u2019t disclose it in this public forum, but that aside, we are very aware that we could ship more not for our supply constraints and we have been improving them over the course of the last several months actually and we expect to be largely out of this by the end of this fiscal quarter Q4.","Vivek Arya","Got it. And then as a follow-up, I wanted to ask about the leverage in the model, you mentioned you will already be at your target operating margins by Q4 and I am curious how much more room is there on the gross margin side. Is it possible to get to, say, 61 or 62? And then on the OpEx side, I believe, Tom, you said that you will have the full realization of synergies in OpEx next year. And since you are sort of around $808 million, what does full realization of synergies mean in terms of either an absolute number or as a percentage of sales by next year? Thank you.","Hock Tan","Well, let me try to answer the question on both sides very simply. We have said announced publicly, disclosed early on when we closed the deal in early February, February 1 that we target to exit fiscal \u201816 which is this current quarter Q4 at 40% operating margin. As guidance is showing, we are going to achieve that goal. Now, is that our targeted and state operating margin? Obviously, you hit it right. No, that\u2019s not our targeted operating margin necessary at all, because we do see that all operating spending and the current level is about 800 plus, 808, to take a step down especially, particularly after we integrate our two ERP systems. As you know, classic Avago runs Oracle, classic Broadcom runs SAP after the end of November, which is our day 2, what we call day 2 where we integrate two systems into one, one database, one ERP system. We expect to run only one system that will be a step down in terms of our headcount requirements, in terms of our support costs and obviously, an improvement in our operating cost structure significantly. And that will come through obviously in fiscal \u201817 and which will then gives our operating margin a further lift up. Without your consideration to further expansion of our gross margin which as you have seen over the last two or three quarters is likely to continue.","Vivek Arya","Yes, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Danely with Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Chris Danely","Hey, thanks guys. Hock, just a quick clarification on the previous question, so you said that the GMs, there should be a little bit of lift, they should be able to keep going up, was that kind of what you were saying to the last question and then I will get started?","Hock Tan","Yes.","Chris Danely","Okay, great. The first one is can you just touch on the connectivity business? Was that up sequentially and maybe talk about the margins there and the progression and how you feel about how the business is progressing what the margin goals are?","Hock Tan","In terms of wireless connectivity you are talking about the WiFi Combo Chip and all that?","Chris Danely","Yes, the classic Broadcom connectivity?","Hock Tan","Broadcom connectivity, that\u2019s progressing very, very well. It addresses the same end markets as our FBAR business has the same characteristics, has the same stickiness and driving towards the same margin goals.","Chris Danely","Was that revenue up sequentially as well?","Hock Tan","Yes, it was.","Chris Danely","Great. And then for my follow-up, I guess, just to take a step back, Hock, how do you feel about the overall semiconductor environment today versus a quarter or two quarters ago, better, the same, maybe talk about where you feel better, where you are more nervous if any?","Hock Tan","It\u2019s not much. Well, that\u2019s broadly, it\u2019s growing macroscopically. It\u2019s sustaining. It\u2019s holding up. That\u2019s why it is holding up sustaining? Is it booming? Not really, but just sustaining. Now, obviously you see seasonal effects versus secular effects, which I assume your question is addressed. Secular is holding up. Seasonally, you have seen the RAM on the smartphone business. And as we always do end of the year and we are experiencing that RAM, but there is a seasonal effect as opposed to the secular and secular, which is as I say just holding up.","Chris Danely","Great. Thanks, guys.","Hock Tan","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Amit Daryanani","Thanks. Good afternoon guys. I guess two questions for me as well Hock, when you look at your operating model today and I guess I am looking at October \u201815 quarter, pre the Broadcom deal, you did 62% gross, 43.8 op margins, structurally do you think there is anything different in Avago plus Broadcom that prevents you from getting there over the next several quarters?","Hock Tan","No, nothing prevents us from getting there nor exceeding it.","Amit Daryanani","Perfect. And I guess any update on Tony and the CFO position as you go forward from here, I think the expectation was four months after you guys announced that there will be some updates?","Hock Tan","No. We don\u2019t have any particular updates at this point, but we will be sure to let you guys know as soon as we have it.","Amit Daryanani","Perfect. Thanks and congrats on the quarter guys.","Hock Tan","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Craig Hettenbach","Yes. Thank you. I had a question on the RF dollar content story Hock, can you just give an update in terms of particularly what you are seeing from carrier aggregation and then locations there for growth as you move forward?","Hock Tan","Continuous \u2013 and when you say that, I assume you would \u2013 wireless RF content, you are referring particularly to cellular RF content, which is largely our FBAR and the front end modules associated with that FBAR. And that story has not changed. The continued increase in the number of bands continue \u2013 continue to grow and carrier aggregation is another phenomenon in parallel that increases FBAR content in those handsets, in those high end handsets, be they in China or in the U.S. So you are right and that content increase continues to steadily progress generation after generation. And we have seen that last 3 years and I see that in the next 2 years.","Craig Hettenbach","Got it, great. And then if I follow-up on the supply constraints just to clarify, you mentioned set-top boxes but on the Tomahawk or switching side, have those constraints eased at this point?","Hock Tan","Those constraints, after much vigorous supply chain action, have eased quite and have eased quite significantly. And by the end of this quarter, we would certainly be out of the woods there.","Craig Hettenbach","Got it. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Ross Seymore","Hi Hock, just a question on your wireless business in the past, your seasonality has changed substantially in the January quarter, I realize you are only guiding to the October quarter, but could you just walk us through the puts and takes of what normal seasonality is from what you see now that you include classic Broadcom with classic Avago?","Hock Tan","You are right. Our seasonal \u2013 the sharper seasonality of the past when it was just classic Avago would probably have reduced, simply [indiscernible] because wireless used to be north of 40% of classic Avago\u2019s revenues. Today, wireless which is highly seasonal part of our business even as it\u2019s grown bigger in absolute dollars represents closer to 30% of our total revenues and it is the bigger portion of it, the 70% representing networking, enterprise storage and industrial as you well know of extremely stable, almost like to say predictable businesses. So it\u2019s certainly a modulated down very well volatility of our revenue seasonally. And so Q1, we don\u2019t give forecast, but we fully expect it to be not as volatile as perhaps it might have been 2 years ago.","Ross Seymore","Great. Thanks. A follow-up one for Tom, on the OpEx side of things, I believe that in addition to the margin guidance that you had given exiting this year 40%, etcetera, you also said exiting this year, you would have about half of the OpEx dollar savings that you expected to achieve, is that still on target. And I guess, if we just made the word simple and said you had the other half left remaining from the 8.08 that you are guiding to, where we are getting that other half bring OpEx down to on a dollar basis? Thanks.","Hock Tan","You are really pushing it.","Tom Krause","You want to answer that?","Hock Tan","Yes. I will answer that. You would probably get it down like some $30 million.","Tom Krause","A quarter.","Hock Tan","A quarter. Sorry.","Tom Krause","And to answer the question Ross, yes we are just about half way there.","Ross Seymore","Great. So 70, 80 is kind of the base you are talking about?","Hock Tan","That\u2019s first part of the year. Second half of \u201817, we will remain to tell it.","Ross Seymore","Perfect. Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Harlan Sur","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Looking at data center switching and routing ASSP product families that would be Jericho, Qumran, Tomahawk [indiscernible] demand continues to be pretty solid as mentioned cloud data center spending in the second half looks to be strong, Hock I am just wondering how far are you into the Tomahawk and Jericho 25 gig adoption, are we 15% of the way through 30% of the way through, just wanted to get a sense on how much growth potential lies ahead of the company?","Hock Tan","Well, the Jericho ramp, as I indicated in some of our remarks, while maybe not that clear is just started. And by the Qumran and Jericho similar in some ways, different specific applications, but the Jericho ramp is just \u2013 has just started. Tomahawk was about six months earlier, three months to six months earlier. But again, many of these products have fairly been wire could have more expanded life cycles. So I will say definitely, even Tomahawk is less than 40% of the way, maybe no more than one-third of the way. And Jericho, which is the aggregation switch or I will call it a router too if you want to, it\u2019s probably maybe 20% even there at all the way.","Harlan Sur","Great. Thanks for the answer. And then there is a portion of the wireless business that gets sort of less visibility, these are the analog ASIC 2, some of your large smartphone customers, we have heard that the design pipeline there is quite good, how do you see this sub-segment adding to the content growth story in wireless this year and over the next 2 years?","Hock Tan","That one, I am not at liberty to disclose to you. Sorry, simply because of the nature of what you characterize as an ASIC.","Harlan Sur","Got it, okay. And maybe just a follow-up question then, on the supply constraint in the set-top box business Q3, Q4, where was the mismatch in terms of supply and demand, is there just more demand for some of the high end set-top boxes, like some of these new 4K UHD speed boxes or was the mismatch more around some of the low end boxes, any color would be helpful?","Hock Tan","Well, our sense \u2013 our I guess, perception is the mismatch between demand \u2013 the mismatch between demand and supply is because of very strong demand much more than normal and it\u2019s probably driven, we guess by two factors. One, you hit it right on is perhaps the RAM, the rollout of those 4K systems, the Ultra HD as you call it. And that coupled with the late summer Olympics where there were some operators like Comcast, which had a very strong promotion on cable for the Olympics. So that drove I suspect, a one-time pushup \u2013 one-time upside and couple that with the rollout of 4K systems.","Harlan Sur","Thanks, Hock.","Operator","Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Toshiya Hari","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one is on CapEx, you are guiding for another step-up in CapEx in your fiscal fourth quarter, can you maybe remind us how much capacity you are adding in that business this year and what your preliminary plans are going into 2017?","Tom Krause","Yes. You are right, we will continue to make conversions from 6 inch to 8 inch and that\u2019s ongoing. And it depends on what frame of reference we are using in terms of how much we are adding, but it\u2019s approximately 50% at this point. I will keep in mind though as we have talked about CapEx more broadly, the main reason at this point for the uptick is in a campus expansion strategy. We are moving from leasing buildings to buying and owning buildings, which drops our overall cost of inhabiting those campuses. So, that\u2019s a key driver. The second key driver is we are also moving to consign testers. We are no longer leasing testers. We are actually spending money to own our testers and consigning to our CMs. So, those are the two big drivers of the uptick in CapEx.","Toshiya Hari","Great, thank you. And as my follow-up, I had one on gross margins. Hock, you talked about your comfort level, when you think about gross margins going forward, but when we kind of zoom into the fiscal fourth quarter, you are guiding gross margins pretty much flat sequentially despite any percent increase in revenue. Can you discuss what the puts and takes are here?","Hock Tan","Well, if you look \u2013 maybe I should take you to looking back over the last three quarters where we have been stepping up gross margin on a fairly steady and hopefully more predictable basis. And each time we guide from what we have actually seen. We try not to guide from what we have not seen simply because gross margin as you put it a lot of puts and takes. But as some touch on earlier highlighted in respect of CapEx, we are actually \u2013 we have initiatives on hand to actually improve our gross margin, not just because of product mix, but also the sheer fact that, for instance, in wireless moving to 6 to 8-inch increasing CapEx, reduces our cost of sales quite dramatically in our wireless business. Going from leasing testers and we use a whole lot of them for our semiconductor ICs to owning the testers on a fairly substantial basis is also driving our cost of material \u2013 cost of purchase material significantly down. And all these actions are ongoing and all these actions are continuing to proactively reduce our cost of sales and expand our gross margin. And you will see that. And rather than forecasting what it will be, we are basically using the current reference point and telling you when it\u2019s likely to move to the next quarter.","Toshiya Hari","Very helpful. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Your line is now open.","Ambrish Srivastava","Hi, thank you. I had a couple of longer term questions. The first one, Tom, just following up on the capacity expansion, you have given us the 50% expansion for fiscal \u201816, but what is the thinking beyond that? And what I am trying to get to is that with the content gain that you have laid out longer term, would you have capacity and the ability to supply other than the two big customers that you are supplying? And then I had a follow-up after that.","Tom Krause","Yes. We don\u2019t have any specific update on that other than to say any capacity expansion we have talked about will be based on line-of-sight demand. We have always built to capacity levels where we know we have demand in hand and we will continue to do that.","Ambrish Srivastava","Okay, makes sense. And then Hock, on the question longer term ASICs, you guys have built a great business there and to us it seems competition has been weakening, but then couple of weeks ago, at the Intel Developer Forum, Intel was very vocal about their aim and the goal to go after the communications infrastructure and we all know what happened last time, you went after it, but what is the right way? Help us \u2013 just provide us your perspective on how easy or how hard it is to go after that business. And we all know that not just having SerDes is not the only answer. So, please help us understand that little bit better? Thanks.","Hock Tan","You mean \u2013 could you repeat that \u2013 I didn\u2019t quite catch it. What was Intel indicating in IDF about going after the communication chip business you mean?","Ambrish Srivastava","No, in the foundry business, the other area besides the client handset business where they announced partnership at ARM, the other area that they were talking about is the infrastructure networking and there were other customers that were also there at the forum that we are talking to Intel\u2019s foray into the business, essentially going after Cisco\u2019s business?","Hock Tan","Well, to be honest, we don\u2019t know much about that \u2013 didn\u2019t hear much about that. But as you probably may know, the ASIC business, especially the high-end ASIC business where your customer is requiring technology \u2013 is pushing the limits of technology be they SerDes bandwidth, be they IP and embedded processing that has very low power, very high performance and features, IP features like that. It\u2019s not a business one gets into on an overnight basis. And your question is correct it\u2019s a long-term basis, simply because, first, you have to have the strength of the IP portfolio capabilities, which we have in plentiful supply, if you don\u2019t mind by saying that. Number one, that\u2019s only a necessary condition. It\u2019s not even sufficient. The sufficient one is that you are able to execute on silicon implementation and you are talking about leading edge not related to foundries that have proven ability to deliver on those leading edge nodes and been able to execute your design well. And that comes \u2013 the proof comes with the Ethernet, which means you got to have the confidence of your customers that you are able to do what they want you to do, because if you don\u2019t, they are screwed literally simply because their roadmap depends on it. So, they are not about to rush into any new opportunity even on a price even on whatever nice stuff it is just because on say so that might happen. It takes a long time. It\u2019s almost a Catch 22. You want to get into this business, be it leading edge not as a foundry or leading edge SerDes, our intellectual property in silicon, you have to convince your customer you can deliver and your customer is putting their future at least in [indiscernible] in your hands. Which customer in their right mind would easily do that? They won\u2019t\u201d. They want you to prove it, but you can\u2019t prove it unless they try it. So, it\u2019s a Catch 22. So, it\u2019s hard. All I am trying to say it\u2019s very hard. It\u2019s a long process. We have fortunately \u2013 we are fortunate to be in a position that we have proven ourselves and so competition will come. It always does and we will deal with it as we always have.","Ambrish Srivastava","Clear. Thanks, Hock.","Hock Tan","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Your line is now open.","Vijay Rakesh","Good quarter and guide year. Just on the wireless side when you look at your 810s FBAR, it looks like on the wireless side you seem to be gaining share, but with this 810s, are you able to get your costs down and compete more effectively with FBAR up and down that chain?","Hock Tan","We continue to do that. You noted every new generation, which is almost every year, we change our process. We just not only change our design. And I said that before too in several meetings, several calls of this nature ago. Our advanced process technology grows or evolves on two fronts, on process as well as on the designs. So, that a band 2 FBAR 3 years ago doesn\u2019t look like the band 2 FBAR today. And that band 2 FBAR 3 years from now will be also very different from what it is today and it improves on power, it improves on insertion loss, it improves on performance. And so we continue to invest in that and it\u2019s part of the reason why we go from 6-inch to 8-inch not only to gain more capacity, but to be able to improve the process we put into it. And yes, BAW technology or even SAW technology temperature compensated continues to try to improve. We are very well aware of the development that continues in some of our competitors. And all I have to say is that we continue to maintain at least maintain if not better our technology lead over those guys.","Vijay Rakesh","Got it. And I agree on that. But actually looking at 8 inch, as you ramp that, what\u2019s your mix, what do you expect your mix of 8 inch FBAR to be exiting let\u2019s say calendar \u201816 and calendar \u201817? Thanks.","Hock Tan","Calendar \u201916 is very, very low. As Tom said, we continue to spend money, CapEx. We are barely at the 50% milestone. Our concept at the end of the day is to convert 100% of our 6 inch into 8 inch. That will not happen until 2018. So we are barely 50% and we continue to methodically steadily convert 6 inch to 8 inch, so exiting this fiscal \u201816, very low, \u201817 significantly higher, \u201818 maybe get done.","Vijay Rakesh","Alright. Thanks.","Operator","And our last question comes from Stephen Chin with UBS. Your line is now open.","Stephen Chin","Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. Hock if I could, I wanted to get a little more color on some of the demand trends within your switching ASSP business, if I recall correctly, classic Broadcom, the switching demand was roughly one-third driven by cloud data center, enterprise and service providers, I was wondering if you could talk a little more about how enterprise and the service provider verticals are performing in terms of demand in the recent quarter and your visibility into the current quarter?","Hock Tan","First and foremost, while we like to say it split up nicely as you put it to be that way, that tends to be very conceptual and a bit theoretical and at any point in time, sometimes we have a tough time knowing where the particular chip we ship ends up in. I mean we ship a lot to OEMs. And as you know many of the OEMs would ship to service providers or enterprise or even to the cloud guys. And that\u2019s a part of it where we are not 100% sure. But to try to answer your question in substance, we think a lot of strength, a lot of demand driven from service providers today as well as from the cloud guys. Enterprise tends to be more stable as opposed to strongly trending now.","Stephen Chin","Okay. I appreciate the color. And as my follow-up, just within enterprise storage, I appreciate that in the current quarter you guys are seeing some good seasonality there, but I was wondering from a technology upgrade or roadmap perspective, can you talk about any other upcoming technologies that can continue to drive growth in the enterprise storage in terms of the server storage products?","Hock Tan","Server storage connectivity products, yes there is, I know some of the trends are very interesting, but I can tell you all of this, but enterprise storage is slow to change, for good reason. People are very, very conservative, very careful in that area. And one of the biggest \u2013 I mean there is a cadence they go by and the cadence go by in the CPU cadence. We are now shipping [indiscernible] as you know and next year, we will start shipping against [indiscernible] some of the interconnects expanding capacity though is for enterprise a lot of it is SaaS. And slowly, very slowly perhaps considering a move into PCI Express or NVMe potentially as Flash arrays start coming into the picture, but to answer your question directly, it moves very slowly. Most enterprise today are still driven on SaaS.","Stephen Chin","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Hock Tan","Sure.","Operator","That concludes Broadcom\u2019s conference call for today.

At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Ashish Saran, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Ashish Saran","Thank you, Operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are Hock Tan, President and CEO; and Tom Krause, Chief Financial Officer of Broadcom Limited. After market close today, Broadcom distributed a press release describing our financial performance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016.","Global Newswire inadvertently published our earnings release today without the financial tables that typically accompany the release. Global Newswire is in the process of re-publishing the complete document. However, these tables are available for you to review in the copy of the earnings release we furnished to the SEC earlier today. Once updated by Global Newswire, you will also be able to obtain this information from the Investor section of Broadcom\u2019s website at www.broadcom.com.","This conference call is being webcast live and a recording will be available via telephone playback for one week. It will also be archived in the Investor section of our website at broadcom.com.","During the prepared comments section of this call, Hock and Tom will be providing details of our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016 results, background to our first quarter fiscal year 2017 outlook and some commentary regarding the business environment. We will take questions after the end of our prepared comments.","In addition to U.S. GAAP reporting, Broadcom reports certain financial measures on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the tables attached to today\u2019s press release. Comments made during today\u2019s call that primarily referred to are non-GAAP financial results. Please refer to our press release today and our recent filings with the SEC for information on the specific risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over the Hock Tan. Hock?","Hock Tan","Thank you, Ashish. Good afternoon, everyone. Fiscal 2016 was a very transformational year for our company as we complete the acquisition of Broadcom Corporation. This acquisition and integration significantly increased our scale, added seven businesses to Avago\u2019s existing portfolio of 12 businesses and roughly double revenue. Since closing the acquisition at the start of our second fiscal quarter, we have made great strides in integrating classic Broadcom.","As you may recall, going into the Broadcom acquisition, we had introduced an operating model targeting 60% gross margin and 40% operating margin that we had expected \u2013 planned, I should say, to progress over the long-term. I\u2019m very pleased that we were able to make good progress towards this target in fiscal 2016, and in fact, since closing the acquisition February 1, 2016, we have driven significant improvement in product margin and spending and exited \u2013 and in fact, exited the fiscal year exceeding this long-term target. More recently also, on November 28th, we have also made good progress on another major milestone with the integration of the Avago\u2019s and Broadcom\u2019s Financial Reporting Systems.","Looking at 2017 and beyond, we expect our business to be continuing to be sustainable and in fact becoming much more profitable. We are raising our long-term operating margin target to 45%, a significant increase from our prior model. We expect to drive to this long-term target through a combination of the full realization of material cost synergies and operating leverage on a larger scale.","Reflecting expected improvement in profitability, we announced earlier today a doubling of our dividends. We are comfortable that our projected free cash flow generation will support this significantly higher return to shareholders, while still preserving flexibility on our balance sheet for future M&A opportunities. If and when these new M&A opportunities materialize, they will enable us to further increase capital returns to shareholders.","Let me now turn to a discussion of what happened in the fourth quarter. We delivered strong results for our fourth fiscal quarter of 2016 with revenue of \u2013 with revenue at $4.15 billion, up 9% sequentially. This result was at the top-end of our guidance primarily due to better seasonality from our Wireless and Enterprise Storage segments. Earnings per share of $3.47 grew by 20% sequentially.","Talking about Wired, our largest segment, in the fourth quarter, revenue came in at $2.08 billion, meeting expectations totally and the Wired segment represented 50% of our total revenue. Revenue for this segment during the quarter was up slightly on a sequential basis. We benefited from increased demand for networking ASICs into data centers as well as strong fiber-optic shipments into access and metro networks.","Our recently launched Jericho standard product line that targets aggregation and edge routing applications continue its reign during this quarter. We were also able to address the supply chain constraints we experienced in a prior quarter, allowing us to catch up to customer demand in our set-top box business.","As we look to the first quarter for our Wired segment, despite expected declines, seasonal declines I should add, in broadband carrier access and set-top box businesses, we anticipate continuing growth in fiber optics and strong increased demand from several cloud data center operators, which will keep our Wired revenue in total at least flat sequentially.","Moving on to Wireless, in the fourth quarter, Wireless revenue came in at about $1.35 billion and the Wireless segment represented 32% of total revenue. Revenue for this segment was up 34% sequentially, a bit stronger than expectations. Growth was primarily driven by the full ramp of the new phone generation at our North American smartphone customer, further enhanced by an increase in Broadcom\u2019s cellular RF content and Wireless connectivity content in this new generation of phones.","We\u2019ve made great progress in relieving FBAR filter capacity constraints we experienced in late 2015. Over the course of 2016 fiscal year, we were able to increase FBAR filter capacity in our Fort Collins plant by approximately 50%. This increase was enabled by our new 8-inch wafer manufacturing process that came online with very good yields.","As we look forward, we intend to add more capacity by continuing to convert existing switch 6-inch line to 8-inch line. This very capital efficient conversion approach will allow us to theoretically add another 70% of capacity over our existing 6-inch footprint within Fort Collins fab over the next few years. Because of this, we no longer need to keep the idle facility we had purchased in 2005 in Eugene, Oregon as a backstop pending the outcome of this 6 to 8-inch capacity expansion.","Turning now to our projection for first quarter fiscal 2017, similar to last year, we expect a seasonal decline in demand and expect our Wireless revenue to sequentially decline in the mid-teens on a percentage basis at least.","Turning to Enterprise Storage, which is going through something of a resurgence that we expect will continue into the first quarter fiscal 2017. In the fourth quarter, Enterprise Storage revenue came in at $561 million and this segment represented 14% of our total revenue.","Segment revenue grew 6% sequentially and came in better than expectation. We benefited from the strengthening demand both for our HDD, hard disk drive and RAIDCore\u2019s box adaptive products.","Looking into the first quarter, we expect the strength in the storage end market to continue to show momentum and drive Enterprise Storage revenue growth to 20% on a sequential basis. We are expecting growth from all our Enterprise Storage products. In particular, we\u2019re expecting a strong ramp in shipments of our custom flash controllers for the SAS, enterprise, Solid State Drives that are increasingly being used in place of high performance hard disk drives and data centers.","Finally, let\u2019s move on to our last segment, Industrial. In the fourth quarter, Industrial segment revenue came in at $162 million, down 20% sequentially. This segment represented 4% of our total revenue as expected, with reduced shipments sharply into our channel as we headed towards this seasonally weaker end of the calendar year. Industrial product resales did decline, but only in the mid-single digits, sequentially, resulting in the sharp reduction in our channel inventory.","Accordingly, as we look in the first quarter, we plan on rebuilding depleted channel inventory and anticipate increasing shipments to our distributors. As a result, we expect revenue in the first quarter from our Industrial statement to increase sequentially in the mid-single digits.","In summary, after a strong close to our fiscal year 2016, we expect a solid start to fiscal 2017 as the demand environment for our entire portfolio of products continues to be very firm. In fact, we expect in the first quarter to largely offset the seasonal decline in Wireless revenue through sustained strength from Wired products benefiting from growth in Cloud, broad strength in Enterprise Storage and a recovery in industrial.","With that, let me now turn the call over to Tom for a more detailed review of fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 financials.","Tom Krause","Thank you, Hock, and good afternoon, everyone. My comments today will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results from continuing operations unless otherwise specifically noted. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP data is included with the earnings release issued today and is also available on our website at broadcom.com.","Let me start by providing some comments on our long-term operating model and update on our capital allocation return strategy. As Hock highlighted, the integration of classic Broadcom with Avago is going very well and we have made rapid progress towards achieving our original target operating margin objectives.","Looking forward to a fully-integrated Broadcom, we recently announced an increase in our long-term target operating margin from 40% to 45%. We expect to make progress towards the new operating margin target through a combination of operating leverage driven by long-term revenue growth, which we continue to target at approximately 5% per year and the full realization of acquisition-related cost synergies from the Broadcom acquisition, all while maintaining a significant investment in research and development.","In addition, we recently announced the acquisition of Brocade, which we expect to complete in the second half of fiscal 2017. We expect the Brocade\u2019s Fibre Channel SAN Switching business will generate approximately $900 million in EBITDA by fiscal 2018.","Turning to our balance sheet, we currently intend to maintain liquidity from cash on hand of approximately $3 billion to cover expected working capital needs and projected annualized dividends.","As we have discussed in the past, we expect to continue to target gross leverage of approximately two times EBITDA as long as the cost of that leverage remains attractive. Given our current EBITDA run rate, we don\u2019t intend to pay down additional debt going forward beyond the amortization obligations in our loan agreements.","Finally, long-term, we expect CapEx to run at about 3% of net revenue consistent with our largely fabless business model. However, you\u2019ll see for fiscal 2017, we expect CapEx to run at an elevated level of approximately $1.2 billion. This includes about $500 million towards campus construction, primarily at our Irvine and San Jose locations, and about $200 million towards purchasing test equipment to consign the contract manufacturers to support classic Broadcom businesses. In summary, as we reflect on all this, we\u2019re comfortable that we can generate long-term free cash flow margins of better than 35%.","Turning to M&A and as Hock highlighted in his opening remarks, as we look at the landscape versus the scale of our projected free cash flow generation, we feel that we have reached the point where it makes the most sense to return a more meaningful portion of our cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends.","The substantial increase in our dividend announced today is the first step. Long-term, we plan to target aggregate dividends of approximately 50% of free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis. Given our free cash flow generation, we believe that this will also allow us sufficient balance sheet flexibility to pursue opportunistic acquisitions that are consistent with our proven business model.","One note on the dividend, our board has decided to set dividend policy and the projected quarterly dividend amount for the full fiscal year rather than on a quarter-by-quarter basis as it did previously. However, the declaration and the payment of any particular quarterly dividend if any is subject to the approval of the board at the time of distribution.","Now looking below the operating line, I want to pause for a minute to provide you a quick update and some color on our tax situation. As you are aware, we are a Singapore company and our IP is predominantly located in Singapore pursuant to our agreement with the Singapore government.","When we acquired classic Broadcom, we intend to align the acquired operations with classic AVGO\u2019s existing processes and structure as that structure has demonstrated long-term sustainability and relatively higher flexibility to deploy clash globally. This integration of IP occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.","As a result of acquisition accounting at the time we closed the Broadcom acquisition we established a deferred tax liability on our balance sheet associated with the potential tax liability from our planned IP integration. This tax liability will only become payable upon the actual distribution of any earnings resulting from integrating the IP and maybe partially offset by any qualifying tax credits and deductions available to us at the time of distribution. We expect to distribute these earnings over several years.","The payment of these cash taxes will be in addition to the cash taxes that we pay on our regular operations and will over time reduce the deferred tax liability that you see on our balance sheet today. As a result, in fiscal 2017, we expect to pay approximately $400 million in cash taxes, which will include the impact of cash taxes if any associated with the IP integration.","With that, let me quickly summarize our results for the fourth quarter. Revenue for the fourth quarter came in at $4.15 billion, growing 9% sequentially. Foxconn was greater than 10% direct customer in the fourth fiscal quarter. Our fourth quarter gross margin from continuing operations was 60.8%, about 30 basis points above the midpoint of guidance, primarily due to better than expected operational efficiency.","Turning to OpEx, R&D expenses were $666 million and SG&A expenses were $137 million. This resulted in total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of $803 million, slightly below guidance reflecting the benefits from the ongoing realization of acquisition-related cost synergies, offset by higher bonus accruals due to higher profitability.","Operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $1.72 billion and represented 41.5% of net revenue. Provision for taxes came in at $73 million, slightly above our guidance. This was primarily due to higher than expected net income.","Fourth quarter interest expense was $106 million and other income net was $9 million. Fourth quarter net income was $1.55 billion and earnings per diluted share were $3.47. Our share-based compensation expense in the fourth quarter was $208 million.","Moving on to the balance sheet, our days sales outstanding were 48 days, a decrease of four days from the prior quarter due to better linearity of revenue in the quarter. Our inventory ended at $1.4 billion, an increase of $92 million from the beginning of the quarter. I would note that the starting inventory for the quarter included the impact of $86 million of step-up charges to reflect the impact of purchase accounting. However, our non-GAAP results exclude the impact of these step-up charges. Therefore, non-GAAP inventory days on hand reflected an aggregate change in inventory of $178 million in the quarter, an increase from 74 days to 78 days.","We increased inventory for some of our classic Broadcom products to improve operational flexibility to better meet customer demand. We generated $1.35 billion in operational cash flow, which reflected the impact of approximately $124 million in cash expended primarily on classic Broadcom restructuring and integration activities including discontinued operations.","We ended the quarter with a cash balance of approximately $3.1 billion. In the fourth quarter, we spent $193 million on capital expenditures. A total of $213 million in cash was spent on company dividend and partnership distribution payments in the fourth quarter.","Now let me turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions and we do not intend to update this guidance. This guidance is for results from continuing operations only.","Net revenue is expected to be $4,075 million plus or minus $75 million. Gross margin is expected to be 61.5%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. Operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $785 million. Tax provision is forecasted to be approximately $73 million. Net interest expense and other is expected to be approximately $101 million.","The diluted share count forecast is for 446 million shares. Share-based compensation expense will be approximately $210 million. CapEx will be approximately $330 million. And as a reminder, our first quarter is generally a weaker quarter for operating cash flow due to the payment of our annual employee bonuses relating to the prior fiscal year.","That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Craig Hettenbach","Yes. Thank you. Hock question on networking and you mentioned some strength in ASICs. I know over a number of years you guys have done well in terms of taking share. Can you talk about where you are in that and just kind of maybe the legs of that share gain story on the ASIC side?","Hock Tan","Well, over the years, you\u2019re correct, we have been gaining share and as we talk generally about those shares, generally these ASIC have a long product life cycle and gaining share tends to take a while, a few years before you show up -- it shows up in revenues. And I guess, what we\u2019re seeing now is the outcome -- the revenue outcome of share we had gained in previous years and we continue to gain share, especially we\u2019ve -- on very, very high-speed, high-performance networking switches, routers, even vector processing machines.","Craig Hettenbach","Got it. And then as a follow up on the Wireless front, you mentioned kind of getting caught up on capacity and the 8-inch transition is going well. Up until this point, you\u2019ve been mostly servicing at the two high-end smartphone OEMs. Any thoughts in terms of the approach going forward on the China smartphone OEM market in terms of is it sizable enough for you guys to engage more on that front?","Hock Tan","It is sizable. It\u2019s just that, see, our strength, our basic strategy in Wireless, be it RF cellular, analog or Wireless connectivity, WiFi that is Bluetooth combo is about the features, the engineering advances that innovation we provide with those solutions and those were -- and we continue to do that generation after generation. However, this tends to be very expensive, relatively speaking product, but they offer very, very unique differentiated features to our customers.","So that\u2019s -- it\u2019s usually only a very high-end segment of the market that takes this on, and you\u2019re right, it would include the Chinese that to the extent that the very high-end flagship status bring in status phones. But it\u2019s a much smaller percentage than our core business, which is largely the flagship phones from our North American customer and our big Korean customer.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Your line is open.","Blayne Curtis","Hey, guys. Great results. Maybe just following up on the last question, on the Wireless segment, you\u2019re guiding basically what you did last year [inaudible]. I\u2019m just curious if the moving pieces within that are about the same, if you can just give any comments on what you\u2019re seeing in the January versus last year.","Hock Tan","Pretty much the same, Blayne. You hit it right on. Our Wireless business is very, very -- more predictable, there\u2019s a product roadmap, every generation we come up with -- every generation of phone, which is every year virtually. We come up with a new set of new product, a new set of features, capabilities that our solution provides for our flagship customer -- phone customers and with it typically more content as we call it, because there are more bands or there are more features or there are more channels that Wireless connectivity needs in delivering the high-performance data signals that phones are rapidly becoming. So, like, it is, other than that, the fact that it keeps innovating, it keeps becoming a much more, more and more an engineered product, but it\u2019s very much the same kind of business we had.","Blayne Curtis","Great. Then on just the guidance for storage is up quite strongly. You mentioned the ASICs presence. Just wondering with that -- within that guidance how much of that was contributing, just broad strokes and what else if you had to rank the drivers getting that 20% growth?","Hock Tan","No. It\u2019s no surprise to you guys, right? Right now, I suspect the -- not suspect, their strong seasonality in consumer PCs and hard disk drives are running very strong. It\u2019s also partly because enterprises, Cloud are buying a lot of hard disk drives because of enterprise great name shortages too and we -- so we benefit a lot on the storage side. But also we\u2019re seeing a lot of Cloud spending on the storage side of the business, which is where our MegaRAID, our SAS storage connectivity or our server storage connectivity side of the business is also showing renewed strengths, even at this late stage of the Grantley generation, temporarily it\u2019s coming next when we expect a big lift, but it\u2019s interesting to see this lift also happening at this time. So we\u2019re seeing across as I mentioned pretty much all sectors in our Enterprise Storage portfolio.","Blayne Curtis","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Ross Seymore","Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I guess the first one on the cash return policy. Congrats on doubling the dividend. I\u2019m just wondering if you could give a little color on how the 50% of free cash flow target was given. And, Hock, does that have any implications about your view on the appetite and\/or availability of good M&A targets in that you\u2019re getting more equally balanced return of cash to shareholders and M&A?","Tom Krause","Ross, let me hit that first and then if Hock wants to add something more he should. At the end of the day it\u2019s a balance, right, we looked at the scale of the free cash flow. We looked at the M&A landscape relative to that scale and we wanted to maintain flexibility on the balance sheet and remain in and around our target of two times EBITDA in terms of leverage. And so when we put that together and in light of the fact that we\u2019re very focused on the dividend relative to any buybacks, 50% made sense.","Hock Tan","Yeah. What is implied here, Ross, the other side to it is, our appetite and acquisition hasn\u2019t changed at all. Interesting businesses out there that are actionable, we will consider and we will act prudently and appropriately. What is about, one, I\u2019ll just say in terms of our new cash allocate -- capital allocation policy is we\u2019re basically taking the view that we are taking on a significant amount of our debt as effectively like long -- on a long-term capital, as part of our long-term capital. And we feel comfortable in continuing to support that, which then basically opens ourselves for the opportunity to really create a lot of flexibility on our balance sheet and our ability to translate a lot of our operating cash flow into cash return for our shareholders, while not at all diminishing our ability to act on transactions, that make plenty of sense.","Ross Seymore","Great. I guess and my one follow-up, it\u2019s very helpful to have the updated target of 45% on the operating margin. I pulled that together with the last couple of quarters where you have nicely beaten the gross margin side of the equation. Gross margin wasn\u2019t mentioned in the levers you\u2019re going to use to get to that 45% operating margin, so I just wanted what your thoughts are in the at least the direction of gross margin going forward? Thanks.","Hock Tan","No, no. I didn\u2019t mention it. I didn\u2019t mention it. And what -- a key part of our realization of a benefit to all this and particular in gross margin is, our gross margin continues to expand. You have seen that since February 1st this year, quarter-after-quarter and we continue to expand, even as we guide Q1 fiscal 2017, Q4 fiscal 2016 was 60.8% gross margin. We\u2019re guiding it up to 61.5% and if you look at it closely by stepping up, we are not trying to tell you that\u2019s a long-term trend. We have been stepping it up about 50 basis points every quarter sequentially and the benefit and the reason why that\u2019s coming from is simply because very simple.","We are getting synergies from material costs, some talk about investing CapEx into tests, a lot of tests of our silicon based products. These are very expensive tests. They\u2019re talking investing $200 million on a lot of tests because we believe we have a more efficient way of doing it, we do our testing through consignment of test equipment, which we are adopting. It\u2019s a good idea and the whole thing through all of that is, we are getting a lot of synergies on material costs, not just on our SG&A line.","Ross Seymore","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Vivek Arya","Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the consistently good execution and for doubling the dividend. I have one question on Wired and one on Wireless. So how come the Wired one, just on an apples-to-apples basis how do you think your Wired business has done relative to what you thought when you acquired classic Broadcom? I know there is a perception that you have stood firm on pricing. Do you think this has distracted from growth in any way, just how do you think your networking and the cable sides have done in your Wired business over the past year?","Hock Tan","Okay. Our Wired business has done very, very well. In fact, to be direct about it, just before we closed the transaction, that means in the final due diligence stage and all that, looking from that point, starting point over the last nine months, it\u2019s done much better than we had expected it to have done. We had seen this product has been very, very sustainable with our customers, been very, very strategic to a lot of our OEM customers and continuing to be that way.","We continue to invest a lot in those areas that we particularly find them to be very, very core and sustainable, and we haven\u2019t spend on that investment there and we are seeing it pay back a lot and by the way, when I say investment, it\u2019s not just hardware, we\u2019re investing a lot in firmware, software and support. So that business has done much better than we had originally thought we could get out of it.","Vivek Arya","Okay. And my follow up, looking forward, on your Wireless business, usually April is the seasonally tough quarter for your largest customer, but there is often some positive offset from your Korean customer. Can you give us some color on how you\u2019re thinking about how April might shape up this time around? Thank you.","Hock Tan","To be honest, we have no clue. For this one -- part of it is how resale is doing, especially through this holiday season. That\u2019s when we start to know about it in the January timeframe. December is a bit too early to figure it out, but you\u2019re right, typically at that -- in spring, we have the other large customer, OEM customer in Korea has a nice counterbalance and that helps. But, overall, for Wireless we expect Q2 as always to be bottom -- to be almost I call it the bottom of the seasonality.","What\u2019s very nice for us right now is the strength that I purposely indicated to you guys in my remarks, opening remarks, in our Wired and a strong recovery now as on early recovery in bookings on our broadband set-top box and carrier access in bookings recovery would actually then \u2013 would actually help cushion that seasonality we expect in that March, April, timeframe, which is our Q2. But that\u2019s looking very far ahead, of course, which we as always never try to venture much of an opinion on.","Vivek Arya","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","John Pitzer","Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Congratulations on the strong results. I guess guys, my first question just around CapEx. Tom, you gave a lot of detail for the fiscal year coming up, but it looks like you guys under spent in the calendar fourth quarter by quite a bit relative to guidance. What drove that and as you answer that question, I\u2019m just curious, Hock, I want to make sure I completely understand your commentary around the Oregon fab. Is it that the 6-inch to 8 inch transition for wafer has gone so well that you don\u2019t need to build out capacity in Oregon to the extent you thought, if you can just help me understand that, that would be helpful.","Tom Krause","Okay. Let me hit the first one quickly, John, then I\u2019ll pass it to Hock. The answer is timing of payments. We had a lot of obligations that we had placed orders and ended up making the payments rolling in the Q1 as opposed banking payments in Q4","Hock Tan","Yeah.","Tom Krause","So pretty straightforward, Q1 will be your high watermark for CapEx likely in this fiscal year.","Hock Tan","Okay. It\u2019s just timing slippages or payments from Q4 to Q1 basically. But back to Oregon fab, yeah, I know that a lot of concern, comments or chatter out there, at least I hear it from Ashish, about where we selling of these in idle potential facility in Eugene, Oregon. As I said my remarks, and you hit it right on, John is, and I say that right at the get-go when we bought this fab. It\u2019s an insurance policy. That\u2019s the way to describe it.","It\u2019s an insurance policy, because we were in the midst of increasing our capacity in Fort Collins by taking all our 6-inch lines, which is entire line a year plus a go, two years ago, and bringing, converting them into 8-inch in phases, but we\u2019re converting to 8-inch. And by the time we converted all 6-inche, we\u2019ll get a 72% increase in capacity without any further expansions of the footprint, which is pretty cool, which will be pretty much what we need over the next two years, 72% increase.","And our initial couple of phases of conversion, which has happened over the last year or two, year and a half, has gone very, very well. Yields are up to normal. Everything is running very well. So we feel very comfortable and in my usual way of making sure we don\u2019t overspend money, we don\u2019t want to hold onto an idle facilitate that we paid some operating expenses on an ongoing basis. In other words, I don\u2019t need insurance policy anymore.","John Pitzer","That\u2019s help. And as my follow up, just to follow on to Blayne\u2019s question earlier. I\u2019m just kind of curious within Enterprise Storage, how large is the SSD business now and can you help us kind of understand how big that business should get, is this going to be a similar size market to HDD controllers overtime, are the dynamics of the market the same, or how are you thinking about this over a longer period of time?","Hock Tan","Well, I -- to be honest with you, first and foremost, I don\u2019t have the data in front of me. And if I do as a policy, we generally don\u2019t try to break it down, because then you would be torturing me every of this earnings call about what is number gone down now. But broadly it\u2019s not the size of HDD re-channel at this point.","And do we hope to cushion some the long-term gradual decline in HDD associate? Yes, we do. That\u2019s why we go into this, because that has similar capabilities and designs that we transfer engineers from our \u2013 of our \u2013 transfer engineers from our SoC to this area, very nicely. And so we are seeing two strings of revenue in our, so to speak, our storage drive business right now.","And it\u2019s just that in this season where flash seems to be \u2013 Enterprise Flash seems to be in short supply. We are seeing enormous demand from couple of OEM customers for flash controllers. We do customize flash controller, I should say, we do for these OEMs that are used for SAS-based Enterprise Drive, which are the high-performance enterprise drives. So it\u2019s very interesting and it is significant enough to be rather meaningful in overall mix.","John Pitzer","Perfect. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Harlan Sur","Good afternoon. Solid results and great to see the strong dividend rates here. On the data center routing side, strong results, we\u2019re still early in the ramp with Jericho and Cameron here. Port deployments, I think, by your Cloud customers are still trending about less than 10%, from a silicon port shipment perspective though I think that the penetration numbers are obviously higher. So I guess the question is where do you think we are in terms of silicon port shipment penetration for Jericho and Cameron? And then on the routing side just sticking with that, is the team also benefiting from the data center routing port build out via some of your ASIC engagements as well?","Hock Tan","Interesting \u2013 yeah, but one thing you did say is very correct. The two are running almost in \u2013 well, not run -- the two will be running in parallel down the road. You\u2019re right. Most of this routing program \u2013 routing call or edge routing and aggregation to some -- to larger extent data centers now are using, are used to be using a lot of ASICs, which is great for my ASIC business.","What we are also seeing is some of this cloud guys they\u2019re moving to merchant silicon, which is Jericho, Cameron as you put it. And that\u2019s early stage compared to the ASIC side. So we are very well positioned on the ASIC side and we are well-positioned now as we ramp up Jericho in edge and certain parts of [inaudible] aggregation especially.","And is -- to answer your question it\u2019s very early. That Cameron, Jericho side is barely -- you say 10%, I\u2019m surprised. I think it\u2019s a bit more than that at this point. But then it could be data we may be looking at different parts of different sets of data. But it\u2019s definitely not one-third yet. It\u2019s in the range of I would call it 20% to 35% of those parts available, because there\u2019s still a lot of the ASIC being used.","But that push, that trend over the long term we are seeing is towards standard open merchant silicon, you\u2019re right. And we are seeing that, especially not just only in the cloud \u2013 hyper cloud Tier 1 guys, we\u2019re seeing that among the operators, who are pushing for standard silicon, standard SAS for their networks and data centers.","And that\u2019s also putting a lot of pressure in push \u2013 in driving up use of Jericho especially, but it\u2019s also interesting in the sense that many OEMs are now coming -- working with us on both sets in parallel, which is why I say there will be coexistence of the two approaches, and ASIC, silicon for routing and together with merchant silicon.","Harlan Sur","Okay. Thanks for the insights there. And then on the broadband connected home, it seems like the pay-TV service providers in developed countries are getting ready to make a more aggressive push out of 4K UHD services, which I think should result in a set-top box upgrade cycle. So given your leadership in satellite, cable, IP set-tops, is this going to be start to be a growth tailwind for the team in 2017?","Hock Tan","Unlike to believe that, one replaces the other, though, but you\u2019re right. And for once they can\u2019t just use software to upgrade it. They actually need a relatively new chip, which is good for us. But we are seeing it, but it\u2019s a gradual trend. It\u2019s not a one -- it\u2019s not an avalanche. It will be a gradual trend and we are in the midst of it or the beginning, the early part of the uptrend on 4K.","Harlan Sur","Thanks, Hock.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of William Stein from SunTrust. Your line is open.","William Stein","Great. Thanks. Let me add my congratulations on the excellent results. My question relates to carrier aggregation. You\u2019ve sighted this in the past as one of the future drivers of your RF content and I\u2019m wondering if you can update us to better understand where we are in the growth in that -- of that phenomenon driving that part of your business?","Hock Tan","We\u2019re in the midst of carrier aggregation as you know now. It\u2019s happening a lot in the U.S., it\u2019s happening in China, in spades, so which is by the way a good way for us to sell our chips even to the low cost sensitive Chinese phone makers. Base station carrier aggregation in China and those are very difficult chips to do and we have the best performing chips, so we got a very good share in that even in China but even cost sensitive. In other words, they have chip stop everywhere except the carrier aggregation chip, which is interesting.","But in terms of the big flagship phone makers that I mentioned earlier they have it all in spades. This is usually downlink carrier aggregation. In another year or two, we will see uplink carrier aggregation in additional, all towards saving infrastructure costs, base station costs and that will be another lift.","That\u2019s why I say year-by-year as I look over the next several years, that RF cellular permits that we develop and sell to those flagship phone makers continues to get more and more complex, more and more context.","William Stein","Great. Thanks. If I can follow up with one more on the pending Brocade acquisition, any update on the anticipated timing or in the process to sell the piece of that business that you\u2019re planning to divest.","Hock Tan","Tom, go ahead.","Tom Krause","No, no. It\u2019s a -- just as we discussed when we announced the deal. We\u2019re targeting the second half of our fiscal year and all the regulatory filing processes that have to take place are on track. As to the divestiture, we don\u2019t have any specifics to report at this point but we remain pretty confident that we\u2019re going to be able to have a successful outcome there, and that\u2019s off to a very good start and progressing well and hope to report on that relatively soon.","William Stein","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your line is open.","Stacy Rasgon","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I had a question on your margin target. You obviously got to the 40% operating margin target pretty quickly, raised it to 45%. Do you need the Brocade deal and the benefits in that in order to reach that 45% or do you think you can get there even without Brocade?","Hock Tan","The Brocade deal may have accelerated somewhat, but not really make a difference. We are trending towards it. It may take us a bit longer, without Brocade, may or may not, but we will get there. We\u2019re very confident. This model now is a long-term model, obviously, it\u2019s not a model just for 2017 -- fiscal 2017. I would say it\u2019s a model over the next three years that we would meet or exceed that 45% operating margin with or without Brocade.","Stacy Rasgon","Got it. Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. So my follow-up, just a quick on your debt balance. Obviously, you\u2019re going to be holding on the debt for now, but as far as I understand, it\u2019s mostly or even all are floating rate. How do you think about that situation and what may potentially be a deflationary environment that we\u2019re heading into?","Tom Krause","It\u2019s a good question, it\u2019s something we monitor and focus on, as you might expect. I think the key take away is that our credit quality continues to improve and I think that\u2019s going to drive a lot of our decision-making around how we think about floating versus fixed in our long-term capital structure. But I\u2019ve got to leave it there in terms of talking about specifics on how we might think about solving the floating rate risk going forward.","Stacy Rasgon","Yeah. Okay.","Hock Tan","But we do recognize it.","Stacy Rasgon","Sorry. Go ahead?","Hock Tan","But we do recognize it.","Stacy Rasgon","Got it. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ian Ing from MKM Partners. Your line is open.","Ian Ing","Yes. Thank you for taking my question. You\u2019ve done a great job of targeting big OEMs of the world. What are your thoughts on automotive OEMs, I mean, is this something potentially to go after one day, it seems every semiconductor company, large ones like Intel and Qualcomm and Samsung are talking about it? Thanks.","Hock Tan","Oh! What -- I assume you don\u2019t mean targeting OEMs as customers, right?","Ian Ing","You talked about it\u2026","Hock Tan","With the OEMs as customers, right.","Ian Ing","Right.","Hock Tan","Yeah. Well, yeah, see our business model is very financially driven. We sell components. We sell very engineering based components where each of -- in each of our product lines, business units, we are the -- not just the market leader, we are the technology leader, very, very clearly. This can be the niche market that some of them have become and our big end markets, regardless that\u2019s our business model. And our acquisitions as you put it, as we put it, is not about targeting any specific area, it\u2019s more about targeting businesses out there that become available that have a very strong potential to be, to meet those criteria.","I mentioned about established markets, technology leader and very successful in areas they are -- in the market they are in, be the niche or main. And automotive is one, yes, we might in on automotive if there potential opportunities there, but we don\u2019t stretch and go out of our way to look at specific end markets where we want to play.","Ian Ing","Thanks. And for my follow up, perhaps, more of an update on the IT back end consolidation and update on the synergies there. You talked about financial systems in the prepared comments and does that go into Q2 and Q3 of this year?","Hock Tan","Yeah. We\u2019re not done with our synergies yet, especially on the operating synergies, OpEx synergies in below the line SG&A and we will start having -- we are now running on one ERP system, which is great, which would be -- which would help us a lot in terms of headcounts and expenses to be able to run it much more efficiently. And we will also see other synergies in other areas that in IT, workplace services that really play in a few other areas, and they all will come in over the course of at least the next six months, if not nine months.","Ian Ing","Thank you, Hock.","Operator","Thank you. In the interest of time, we will take our last question from the line of Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jeriel Ong","Hi. This is Jeriel Ong on behalf of Amit. Just two quick questions and thanks for squeezing us in. I think first off, it looks like just based on modeling to the midpoint of guidance that operating margins could be about slightly north of 42%. I know you guys just talked about 45% the long-term target. Going forward, is the -- getting to that 45% number, is it going to be more gross margin or operating or OpEx in terms of synergies?","Hock Tan","Both, we expect our long-term -- to answer your question where 45% comes from, it comes from both places. As you see us keep expanding our gross margin and we see that continuing for some period of time. We will start to approach particularly product makes as well together with cost synergies and scale on manufacturing overheads as we cover -- as we broaden our product lines, scale our product lines over the same set of manufacturing support teams to come closer and closer to 65%.","Our OpEx, R&D and SG&A will run closer and closer to 20%, if it\u2019s not already there. R&D will continue to be at 16%, 17%. I think it\u2019s a basic thing. And our SG&A is ahead also, less than 4% now closer and closer to 3%. So you can see where our 45% is. Now that\u2019s not going to happen in 2017, guys, but it\u2019s where over time we will be able to drive this OpEx.","Tom Krause","Yeah. And let me add also the revenue trajectory and how the revenue bumps around, especially related to the 5% targets we have also will help drive that number.","Hock Tan","Yeah.","Jeriel Ong","Yeah. Thanks for that clarity. I think that helps quite a bit. Next question, just congrats on the dividend increase. And it\u2019s -- while I\u2019m not trying to push my luck here, but I would say the two other factors that investors struggle with is the lack of buybacks and not including option expenses in the model. Can you just talk to your process around those two dynamics?","Tom Krause","Sure. I\u2019ll take it. On the latter question around SBC, we certainly break it out very explicitly in our comments and our results. So we think we\u2019re addressing that pretty much head on. In terms of \u2013 in terms of the buybacks, I mean, we\u2019ve addressed this number of times. We look at dividends as a more permanent return to capital, a better indication of how we feel about our business, obviously, we talk a lot about the sustainability of the franchises that we own, and I think, that\u2019s consistent with our model.","Jeriel Ong","Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Ashish Saran, Director of Investor Relations, for closing comments.","Ashish Saran","Thanks, Operator. I\u2019d like to confirm that Global Newswire has now released the corrected earnings press release which includes financial tables.

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Tom Krause, Chief Financial Officer of Broadcom Inc. Please go ahead, sir.","Tom Krause","Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone.","Joining me today is Hock Tan, President and CEO of Broadcom. Today, Hock is going to give you a detailed review on our core business and spend some time outlining the industrial logic behind our recently acquisition of CA. I will then spend time reviewing our Q3 results and Q4 outlook, and most importantly our financial model and capital allocation policy.","Quickly on the formality. Today\u2019s call, will primarily refer to non-GAAP financial results. A reconciliation to U.S. GAAP measures is included in today\u2019s press release, which is available in the Investors section of our website at broadcom.com. Information on risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call is also available in today\u2019s press release and in our recent SEC filings. This conference call is being webcast live. A recording will be available via telephone playback for one week and archived in the Investors section of our website at broadcom.com.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Hock. Hock?","Hock Tan","Thank you, Tom.","The strength of our business model delivered another quarter of very sustained revenues, strong earnings and free cash flows. Consolidated net revenue for the third quarter was $5.07 billion, 13% increase from a year ago and EPS came in at $4.98, a 21% increase from a year ago, while free cash flow at $2.13 billion is 42% of revenues.","We have a lot to cover today. So, let\u2019s dive right into the segments. Starting with wired. In the third quarter, wired revenue was $2.3 billion, growing 4% year-on-year. And this segment represented 45% of our total revenues. Third quarter wired results reflect strong year-on-year growth for both our networking and compute offload businesses, driven by robust demand from the cloud data center markets, as well as traditional enterprises. Networking and compute offload represented approximately 60% of our total wired segment in the quarter and grew over 10% year-on-year in the quarter. This is off the back of growing over 15% annually in the second quarter.","So, this part of the wired segment is doing really well. However, cyclical headwind in certain parts of our broadband businesses has impacted year-on-year growth for the wired segment. While digital subscriber line or DSL demand remained stable, demand for PON, fiber-to-the-home in China, as well as video access, particularly North America, has been soft, compared to a very strong 2017. As a result, broadband was down year-over-year in the third quarter after being down in Q2 as well.","Turning to the fourth quarter fiscal 2018. We expect networking and compute offload to continue to grow double digits year-on-year as strong demand from both the cloud and traditional enterprise sustain. However, cyclical headwinds we have seen in video access including cable and satellite are persisting into the fourth quarter. And as a result, in the fourth quarter, we expect wired to grow only mid single digits year-on-year.","But, on the other hand, we\u2019re very encouraged by the prospects for fiscal 2019. We expect strong growth in our networking business to continue, driven by new product ramps of our Tomahawk 3 switch and our Jericho2 router platforms. We also continue to see strength from our deep learning ASICs with our cloud customers. And we forecast broadband video will bottom this third quarter, as we start to enter an upcycle in 2019. On enterprise wireless access too, we expect to be the first to enable the integrated 802.11ax chipsets during this coming year, among service providers, enterprises and homes.","Let me now turn to enterprise storage. For the third quarter 2018, enterprise storage revenue was $1.25 billion, representing 25% of revenue. As we have experienced and mentioned in our wired networking business, robust enterprise IT spending drove over a 70% year-on-year revenue increase. This of course includes contribution from Brocade. But even without Brocade, storage was robust year-on-year in the third quarter.","Looking in the fourth quarter, strong demand from enterprise continues to be good, and we expect year-on-year storage revenue growth to accelerate.","Moving on now to wireless. In the third quarter, wireless revenue was $1.3 billion, which was flat year-over-year. The wireless segment represented about 25% of our total revenue. In aggregate, wireless revenues were in line with our expectations for the third quarter. We benefited from the initial seasonal ramp at our North American OEM customer, which was partially offset by anticipated decline at our other large wireless customer. We expect this ramp at our North American OEM customer to drive wireless revenue to be over 25% sequentially, given as it may be down single digit year-on-year. Let me take some time to put this in perspective.","Like all our franchises, our RF frontend business which makes up roughly half of our wireless segment, competes and competes very well, based on its technology leadership and its ability to deliver differentiated, high-performance products, generation after every generation. To generate the high returns, we expect on our substantial R&D and manufacturing investments, we focus on delivering the best FBAR technology in every new generation of smartphones. Nonetheless, from time-to-time, not that often, but time-to-time, the same technology platform used by our customer, may expand beyond one generation. And when this happens, it does create an opportunity for a customer to temporarily use lower performance alternatives in selected skews. With the benefit of hindsight, these maybe precisely what happen with this 2018 generation. But, every indication we have is that the cadence of annual platform upgrades will resume in the upcoming 2019 smartphone generation. And we believe we\u2019re very well-positioned to win back the platform. And with 5G on the horizon, we expect this cadence of annual upgrades to sustain.","As a result, we are maintaining our high level of investment as the market transitions to 5G. Meanwhile, in WiFi, Bluetooth to transition to 802.11ax continues to keep us in the lead. We believe, we are very well-positioned to sustain this particular franchise over the next several years. And accordingly, we expect to see our wireless revenue returning to double-digit growth in fiscal 2020, following a temporary dip in fiscal 2019.","Finally, our last segment, industrial. In the third quarter, the industrial segment represented 5% of total revenues. Excluding IP licensing, the industrial business was up over 10% year-on-year. Distribution resales continued to be strong with double-digit Q3 year-on-year growth. We expect demand environment for industrial to remain strong and industrial resale to maintain double-digit year-on-year growth during the fourth quarter.","So, in summary, we continue to execute well on our business model. More than half our consolidated revenue you may note is benefiting from strong cloud and enterprise data center spending. This, coupled with a seasonal uptick in wireless will drive our forecast revenue in the fourth quarter to be $5.4 billion, an increase 11% from a year ago. In the meantime, our margins continue to expand due to our focus on technology leadership and high-performance products.","This is all driving exceptional cash flows, which provides us great flexibility in our capital allocation model of returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share purchases, while enabling us to pursue strategic acquisitions to expand our earnings capacity going forward.","Speaking of acquisitions, before I turn this call back to Tom to talk about the financials in greater detail, let me perhaps take a few more minutes and talk about CA Technologies. The number one question we get from when we get with CA is, why did we choose to buy? Cut to the chase. We\u2019re buying CA because of the customers and their importance to these customers. CA sales mission critical software to virtually all of the world\u2019s largest enterprises. These are global leaders in key verticals including financial services, telecoms, insurance, healthcare and retail. And CA does it a scale fairly unique to the infrastructure software space. This can only come from longstanding relationships with these customers that spend several decades. In other words, these guys are deeply embedded.","Now, Broadcom does a lot of business with the cloud companies, building the digital economy, the leaders. Google, Amazon, Microsoft are all large customers for us. They\u2019re growing rapidly and we are, as you notice, growing event. They use our leading edge silicon solutions to develop their next generation data centers to enable many businesses worldwide.","On the other hand, when you look at the largest enterprises, which comprise CAT customers, these guys really have limited direct access to a mission critical technology. In that lies what we think is a new and huge opportunity. Just as we have done with hyper cloud players, we believe we can bring our compute offload solutions, our Tomahawk switches, Jericho routers, fiber optics and our server storage connectivity portfolio directly to these same large enterprises that are buying CA software. These large end users invest tens of billions dollars on IT infrastructure every year. Through CA, we believe we have a big doorway to engage strategically with these customers and provide them direct access at very compelling economics to the same leading edge -- and make through the same leading edge networking storage and compute technologies that are used to enable the cloud service providers today.","Beyond this industrial logic, I might note, CA by itself is a great franchise. Mainframes remain the backbone of the enterprise computing environment and are relied on to run mission-critical applications. Mainframes process approximately 30 billion transactions per day and $7 trillion of credit card payments annually. Contrary to popular belief, over the last 10 years, mainframe models have actually increased 3.5 times, driven largely by increasing amounts of data generated with every single transaction. Given mainframes are the most important parts of large enterprises, we believe this will remain a strong and stable market opportunity for us for long term. CA is a leader in delivering a suite of mainframe solutions across application development and ITOM tools. So, bottom line, we actually see this opportunity, a great opportunity, I may say, to double down for future growth.","With that, let me turn the call over to Tom at this time.","Tom Krause","Thank you, Hock, and good afternoon, everyone. My comments today will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results from continuing operations, unless otherwise specifically noted. Let me walk through our results for the third quarter of fiscal 2018.","Third quarter net revenue was $5.07 billion, just ahead of the midpoint of our guidance. Our gross margin from continuing operations was at the high-end of our guidance, the 67.3%, as we benefited from the more favorable product mix in the quarter. Operating expenses were slightly lower than we expected at $874 million, driven by lower SG&A. As a result, operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $2.54 billion and represented 50.1% of net revenue. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $2.71 billion and represented 53.4% of net revenue. For housekeeping purposes, Q3 depreciation was $129 million in the quarter.","Below the line, net interest expense was slightly better than guidance due to high interest income from our cash deposits. The tax provision was in line at 7% of operating income from continuing operations or $170 million. The diluted share count was 453 million shares and includes the weighted average impact of the stock repurchases completed in the quarter. As a result, the Company delivered $4.98 of EPS in the quarter. This represents 21% year-on-year growth, including the impact of share repurchases.","Working capital, excluding cash and cash equivalents, increased approximately $209 million, compared to the prior quarter, due primarily to an increase in receivables. This increase was driven by seasonally higher shipments in the last month of the quarter, as well as the effect of a distributor consolidation program for the Brocade business where we are providing a temporary extension to payment terms to facilitate the consolidation.","In addition, cash restructuring expenses were $18 million, as we are now at the tail end of the Brocade integration. Finally, we spent $120 million on capital expenditures, which was slightly below expectations. As a result, free cash flow from operations was $2.13 billion, or 42% of revenue. This represents 52% year-over-year growth in free cash flow from operations. In the quarter, we returned $754 million in the form of cash dividends and spent $5.38 billion repurchasing 24 million AVGO shares. We did not pay down any debt in the quarter. We ended the quarter with $4.14 billion of cash, $17.6 billion of total debt and 438 million fully diluted shares outstanding.","New, let me turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions and we do not intend to update this guidance. The guidance is for results from continuing operations only. Net revenue is expected to be $5.4 billion, plus or minus $75 million. Gross margin is expected to be 67%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. Operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $394 million. Tax provision is forecasted to be approximately 7%. Net interest expense and others expected to be approximately $125 million. The diluted share count forecast is for 436 million shares. CapEx will be approximately $110 million.","Before we open the call for questions, I want to update you on our financial model and capital allocation policy. On the financial model, there have been a lot of questions regarding our long-term growth and concerns about the growth rate of our core semiconductor business.","The intention with the CA announcement has not been to signal a change in the growth rate of our core business. On the contrary, we believe our long-term growth rate for the semiconductor segment will remain mid single digits, driven by end-market growth and content increases from new product introductions. As we acquire businesses outside of semiconductors including Brocade and more recently CA, we are taking a conservative approach relative to our internal expectations on revenue growth. The returns we model, do not require growth to hit our targets, but make no mistake, we do expect to grow these businesses. So, the important message is that we do not see any fundamental changes in our long-term growth rate.","Now, on the capital allocation. Here at Broadcom, we have a set of complementary, highly-profitable technology franchises that require limited capital expenditures, and it sits on top of an efficient corporate platform. This in turn sits at a substantial and sustainable base of cash flows that we expect will grow over time. This expected cash flow generation provides us with a lot of flexibility on how we allocate capital to create value for you, the shareholders. We are committed to our policy of distributing 50% of our prior fiscal year free cash flow to shareholders in the form of cash dividends. Given our fourth quarter outlook and expected full fiscal year \u201818 results, we anticipate another substantial increase in the quarterly dividend for calendar 2019.","Now, with the remaining free cash flow, we see the opportunity to do a couple of things. One, we plan to continue to buy back shares. We currently have $6.3 billion left in our $12 billion stock repurchase authorization that extends through the end of FY19. And two, with the focus on maintaining our investment grade credit rating, we believe we also have the cash flow and the borrowing capacity to continue to expand our earnings base through strategic and accretive acquisitions.","Finally, as previously announced, we have cleared HSR with respect to the CA transaction in July. The transaction is still subject to CA shareholder approval and antitrust approvals in EU and Japan. We expect to close in the fourth calendar quarter of 2018.","That concludes my prepared remarks. During the Q&A portion of today\u2019s call, we request you to limit yourselves to one question each. So, with that, operator, could you please open up the call for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Tim Arcuri with UBS. Your line is open. ","UnidentifiedAnalyst","Hi. This is Pradeep [ph] on behalf of Timothy Arcuri. I had a question more on the longer term view of CA and the wireless solutions group. And how you view the wireless solutions group from a strategic standpoint, given that the CA acquisition is kind of focusing you guys towards more of an infrastructure company? ","Hock Tan","That\u2019s a very interesting question and it offers me the opportunity to clarifying how we look at our composite set of businesses. Our business model is very much focused on putting together a portfolio -- on portfolio of what we consider product technology, product franchises. And that\u2019s not necessarily limited to IT infrastructure or networking or data centers in any particular specifics. As you notice, we have a range of products that sells into multiple end markets which ranges from wired and even in wired, we have made a distinction, as I said, of networking, data centers, as well as more service provider spending as it relates to carrier access, and PON and video delivery, and the two sets of end markets by itself. Then, we have enterprise storage, which is very data center centric, I mean. But then, you\u2019re right, we have wireless, which is, as we define it, is very focused on mobilities and smartphones where we put up the best latest technology. And finally, we have industrial where we have a set of products that goes to various industrial product, necessary to make that the data centers.","So, they are very disparate, they are very diverse. And there in our view lies our strength. It\u2019s very set of diverse products, franchises and that\u2019s the key to operating, franchises. But each of them is very -- a set of common characteristics. One is, they operate in niche markets typically, those are the niche markets that become mass markets, because mass markets have moved over to these niche markets. And for two is, we have the technology, more technology, we are the leader in technology in each of this niche markets. And we tend to have the highest market share too in each of these end markets. And the common thing we do is, they all sit on our platform, but each of those features keep investing and you\u2019ve seen the level of dollars we invest. We\u2019re investing over $3 billion, $3.2 billion a year just on R&D and product development as we move through each generation and evolve the technology for use of end customers. And we make sure, we lead in each of those.","And so, we believe, to answer your question specifically on wireless, we believe our position in wireless, in those wireless products and markets that we are very much in the lead technology, we are lead in market share in the niches we are in. So, it\u2019s satisfying, those considerations of us, of franchises in those specific markets as you would apply to switching and routing in data centers where we\u2019re very well represented too. And the benefit of all this particular franchises is they all are enormously profitable and they all continue to grow. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Pierre Ferragu with New Street Research. Your line is open. ","Pierre Ferragu","Hey, Hock, and thanks a lot for taking my question. So, I\u2019ll ask you about Computer Associates as well. So, you have demonstrated in the past a rather unmatched ability to create value from your acquisitions. And this is something you\u2019ve mostly done in the semiconductor industry and that\u2019s what you got, a lot of investors are used to. So, today, it\u2019s really clear that we need to better understand the Broadcom model, how Broadcom can create so much value from acquisition and how it can apply to CA? So, in that spirit, my question to the two of you, Hock and Tom, would be, can you tell us what you guys do like nobody else? What makes you unique at integrating the business? You acquire and create value from these businesses like nobody else and in particular like private equity firms for instances would not be able to do. And then, of course, put that in the context of Computer Associate. How are you going to apply these unique capabilities to Computer Associate?","Hock Tan","Thank you, interesting question. Let me try to address that, if I could, one of which, to start with, we don\u2019t own private equity, by no means. Why? We know -- we understand the businesses that operates in the Broadcom very well, and we operate those businesses. We are not financial investors. The financial performance, the capital allocation that comes out, the exceptional cash flow we generate of those making those businesses very successful happens to be just the end product. We run those businesses and we run them as a group. That\u2019s the biggest difference between us and private equity, very, very much. So, the way we see some differentiating tricks in now we identify and acquire those businesses and then integrate them into a whole, as part of Broadcom, is simply this. I think we\u2019re very, very aware of our ecosystem, what product lines, what markets are very sustainable, very good as potential profit and growth opportunities. And we\u2019re very focused. And that\u2019s a key thing.","We are very focused in determining what businesses make sense to invest in and what businesses we do not or should not invest in because it won\u2019t generate the return, which is why, as I explained on my reply to the earlier question, today, Broadcom comprises 19 separate product divisions. Each of them leader in their own right in each of those niche markets they are in. And by being extremely focused on continuing to be the technology and market leader, which basically means delivering generation after generation. Because one advantage in technology is you keep, having to evolve with better and better products that your customers can use and\/or ask for.","As you do that you actually create more and more value to your customers. And the extension of that is shown by the fact that, if you look at our financials over the last several years, we expect our product margin, gross margin to say as a collective whole 100 basis points approximately every year. This is the same product. This is not about adding new acquisitions, which accrete the gross margin. We're talking about if you look organically at the same products that we have 3, 4, 5 years ago, you will see that margins expand as a whole. And the reason it can expand is because you're delivering more value to your customers.","And so the real basic thing is be very focused. Stick to what you do very well and focus on where you are very successful and keep doing the same thing. And what we do when we look at acquisitions very simply is we look at companies where the opposite is actually sometimes happening, where the core business of the Company -- of some of these business companies are not so focused on or neglected in many ways, and instead the bright, shiny objects get focused on where the strength of that particular company may not be so good. And we basically pull them back to their roots and put them into as part of the overall Broadcom portfolio. That's really what we are.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line and William Stein with SunTrust. Your line is open.","William Stein","Hock, one of the biggest questions that we've gotten especially more recently is on the semi-cycle. Now I understand you have 19 or so franchises that you can argue are more specialized, but I think you're certainly exposed to the broader trends in the industry. And there's an expectation that we're seeing a slowdown, in particular, in China, especially potentially related to tariffs. And I'm wondering if you can offer a comment as to where you think we are in that cycle, what you see going on in that regard.","Hock Tan","That's a very, very good question and a very timely question. And what we -- I can -- I'm not trying to look out far nor trying to basically postulate a vision here, but short -- but what we're seeing now and what we've seen recently and looking what we're seeing now is that the dynamics of the semiconductor space is constantly changing. I know that's an obvious answer. But what I mean is by different end markets. And we, in some ways, are fortunate in selling to 4, 5 end markets, very, very different end markets. And I can tell you, over the last 2 years, the behavior of all those 5 end markets are very -- had been very different.","So it's hard for me to say how's the whole semiconductor industry because it does cover into a lot of spaces. And 2 -- like 1 or 2 years ago, I did say that in 2016, 2017 -- even 2017 and '16, broadband was very strong. What part of the, I guess, of service provider spending -- level of service provider spending worldwide and -- but also -- and leading to business that's kind of cyclical. It's a business I might add that's relatively flat but sustainable and cyclical. So today, as I say, broadband, as I mentioned, is not so strong anymore.","Now last year -- 2 years ago, data center spending was okay. This year, 2018, it's extremely strong and continues to look good. So we see different parts of the cycle. Just like even wireless. I mean, wireless, 2 years ago, 3 years ago was great. Content was growing. Then what we've seen over the past year is smartphones literally, not just handset worldwide but smartphones, just kind of flattened out, totally flattened out and where cost becomes a concern more than that demand or innovation becomes limited, and people are now waiting for perhaps a 5G cycle before we see another uptick.","And industrial -- oh, yes, automotive was moving away for a few years, drives industrial, continues to do so as we see, though we start to see definitely some slowdown from where we are, both in automotive and industrial. So you're seeing ups and downs across different segment, different end markets that's an -- which uses semiconductors. And I guess, our best saving grace here is, because we are fairly diversified, we cannot keep ourselves stable and secure on a total basis as opposed to riding any particular end market upwards are downwards.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Your line is open.","John Pitzer","Hock, maybe the short way to ask my question is does this operating margin expansion story have a ceiling at some point? But I guess, the longer term or longer way to ask the question is I wonder if you can just talk a little bit about how you think about R&D. I think, oftentimes, investors get fixated on R&D as a percent of revenue and forget that at your scale, your absolute dollar spend is just enormous. But help me understand, is there something about your IP portfolio that gives it more leverage than a typical digital or SoC company? Or why are you able to drive so much more leverage out of your R&D line than many of your large peers? And again, as you answer that question, maybe you can talk about is there a ceiling to this op margin.","Hock Tan","That's a great question, John, and I'll try to address that. And you're right. It starts with IP. We sell intellectual property except with productizing. With -- in many -- a lot of our business are semiconductors, and we sell IP embedded in silicon, is perhaps the simple best way to describe. That's what we do. We don't try to license this out. We make it into products that addresses what our end users, end customers need to make, to use or make into -- for the -- make into part of a systems. And it's that intellectual property that drives the technology evolution because we keep feeding that machine. We keep enhancing, innovating on those technologies in any particular markets we're in. And as I mentioned, we have 19 of those markets. In each of them, one -- it's -- we behave very commonly.","We have a team of people, and in many cases, we -- or in most cases, I would add, we have the best engineers in the world, architects and engineers in the world in each area -- in the space they are in. We are among the best. And many of these -- and these guys, the other side to IP, they have IP they have developed over the years and innovate to the next better thing. And we keep doing that. And the customers love to have this product because it makes them successful. It makes them more productive. It makes them do things that otherwise they can't do. And when you do that with each evolving technology, each evolving generation of technology, you basically get a higher value added to your product. Always do because you give your customer more value. You get something more for it.","I'll give you an example, right? The well-known Tomahawk 3 switch is 12.8 terabit per second throughput switch. The previous generation, Tomahawk 2, was only 6.4, half that throughput. So you are able to put into a data center and on top of a direct of servers twice the throughput, twice the capacity, twice the bandwidth. Do you -- do I -- am I able to charge 2x the price? Of course not. That's not the way technology works. But we are able to obviously improve against our value simply by the fact that even as dollars, our price per terabit drops, on the total 2x terabit, the value of the product goes up for us, for the customers.","And if the demand, the usage consumption increases to use up all 12.8 terabit and basically, the data center scale gets to scale out tremendously at a very cost-effective set of economics. And that's an example that applies across all 19 product lines and to bottom -- at the bottom -- at the end of it all, so because of that, our ability to do that, to offer better products are more value to our customers. Our product margin goes up. And it goes up faster than the amount of R&D we pour in, and we pour in quite a bit to sustain that level of improvement. And that leads to an improved operating -- and expanding operating margin. That's what we've seen. That's what has happened.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Ross Seymore","Hock, I wanted to focus on your wired business, both in the near term and the long term. In the near term, you did a great job of explaining some of the puts and takes between that 60-40 split of the fast-growing and slower-growing businesses. But to the extent it's 45% of your business today, and we look forward longer-term, how should we think about the growth rates of that 60-40, and what does it mean to the profitability of the Company, either on the gross or operating margin line as the growth rates seem to be so different between those 2 sub-segments?","Hock Tan","Well, Ross, thanks for asking that too. But what you say is true right now. In 2016, I loved broadband. It was an on up-cycle. If you recall, there was the Summer Olympics floating around. Everybody was signing up for cable, cable access. So we were booming. That time paid. That thing outperformed data centers, networking, that is. Today, the cycle turned around. We look at broadband and say, \"Man, this thing is dragging me.\" It's not. When the up-cycle happens as we fully expect within the next 12 months also, you'll be great again. So that's one of the interesting things about it, is looking at, say, even wired or even wireless. Every one of this -- a lot of these markets' growth has their ups and downs, and especially if you look at a quarter and much less annually.","Quarterly, even worse. What we have to keep realizing is these are all technology-driven applications and market-driven as better and better, more innovative technology comes in. It keeps expanding, some at a slower pace than others, but what it does is it adopts new technology, and which allows us to keep adding more value as we progress through it, even though it goes through its ups and downs. And the key thing to all this is sustainability. These are all very sustainable end markets. The product we see today may be much better than the product in this end market we saw 5 years ago, and the product 5 years from now will be much better than the product we see today. But believe me, the end use continues.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Craig Hettenbach","I have a question for wireless RF. I mean, you play mostly at the high end of the market. Interesting developments in China, when I think of some of the local brands there, some impressive specs coming out and as they start to ramp the volumes. So I just wanted to know if that potentially could change your opportunity set in RF in the China market over time.","Hock Tan","A very interesting question, and it is, again, part of the whole franchise model. And then, yes, because again, in the case of wireless, we have very unique technology. We have very, very differentiated technology that allows us to produce very high-performance products in those smartphones. And so far, it's been the super high-end smartphones that tends to use our products. And I could see a situation where, especially with 5G coming into the mix, with all these difficult bands showing up, where 5G, you start running higher than 3 gigahertz spectrum bandwidth.","You start to meet better and better RF components, especially in filtering, very much so in filtering, and we could see that being required across the board in many next-phase or next-generation 5G phones. And we can see that happening, in which case then, it starts to expand beyond just high-end phones, and you're exactly right in that regard. It has happened before, a few years ago, when there were certain bands that were so critical, it can only be done using FBAR. Very difficult FBAR technology, and for a while, that was pretty cool.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Your line is open.","Blayne Curtis","I just want to follow up on that wireless. You were talking about cycles and some years better than others. When you look at wireless, cellular and then WiFi is 2 components. Just kind of curious, as you look out, you mentioned 5G. Maybe kind of what's the content story between now and a couple of years from now, when 5G will be a majority? And then on the WiFi side, can you just talk about timing of that?","Hock Tan","Okay. You -- and so actually, 2 questions you're asking here, so let me try to address them separately. WiFi, in many ways, is a more stable, predictable evolution of the technology trends. And today, very much so, everybody uses the standard, WiFi standard called 802.11ac, C as in China, and that's great. It's definitely an improvement from what it used to be 5 years or 10 years ago. But we have a new technology, a new protocol coming in called 802.11ax, which I may have commented on a couple of times in my prepared remarks.","What ax does is, in a nutshell, it increases, in layman's language, the bandwidth. Huge. You can imagine easily running data stream wirelessly from your handsets. Upwards and uplink and downlink weigh over 1 gigabit per second, even 2 gigabits per second. You get carried away. But what's even more interesting is it allows for multiple users simultaneously, which is something that's always been tricky. And it requires a lot of technology, hardware and software. And we are in the lead in doing it, as I indicated. We are the first out with our product, they're working, we're designing, and we started launching it with multiple partners starting October next month. By the way, this year, starting with the retail routers and going on to the enterprise access points and then operators by early next year.","So it's a big thing, 802.11ax, and I bet you in the spring, you will find at least one big handset maker coming out big-time to push 802.11ax. And our chips will be right in those flagship phones. But -- so it's more predictable, and our technology is so strong. I have to say that we see ourselves in the road map of our key customers over the next 2, 3 years. More predictable as 802.11ax, that should go to a second wave and upgrade and all that. On RF, it's truly not that much different, except that what's happening here more than anything else is over every several years, we go from, as you know, 2G, GSM, we go out to 3G, and now -- and then we have 4G that's been going on now for 6 years.","And now there's actually demand, or kind of a demand, I might add, for even higher speeds, higher throughputs, lower latencies, more connections, that's what 5G is all about, which leads to IoT applications and all those applications we had dreamed about previously. That -- those are great. It's just that those are very, very difficult to implement. And in order to make it happen, one, in a nutshell, it will happen as it has happened in the past on 4G, it's your phone already runs 3G, 4G. You now have to put in additional components, additional capability to run an additional set of spectrum that runs, that is operating in 5G.","And once you start doing that, you really will have issues of coexistence. You also have to reach out in 5G to frequencies that are much higher, much more difficult to produce, to put in a phone for communications, data communications. And I'm referring to frequencies that go way above 3 gigahertz now as a first step. And as you go into more and more of these 5G phones, you have more frequencies, more requirements of components in the same limited space of a phone.","So you start to have to innovate on your components to be able to put them in a phone, unlimited space, lower power, working very well together. And that's where our capabilities, our technology in RF, especially FBAR, comes into its own. And that's why we see this is as a sustainable franchise, especially for someone who is able to design, have the IP to design capabilities, components, that few people are able to replicate.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Caso with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Chris Caso","Just a follow-up question with regard to the wireless and some of the prepared comments that you made. You talked about expectations will return to double-digit wireless growth next year. You also talked about being in a position to win back some of the FBAR business. Can you reconcile those 2 comments? And is one dependent on the other? For the double-digit growth you're expecting next year, what are the assumptions behind that?","Tom Krause","Chris, it's Tom. Let me just clarify the prepared remarks. What we were referring to is double-digit growth in 2020 off the back of a dip in 2019. And just also to clarify, we do feel really good about the prospects of winning back the business that we discussed, that we had lost in the current generation phone, which would impact the very back half of '19, but really would have an influence on the 2020 growth rate we discussed.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Harsh Kumar with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Harsh Kumar","The big question we're getting is what is Broadcom's expectation running a software company? This is the first one for you guys in this area. Could you maybe talk about some of the strengths and challenges you see and maybe some of the plan around running this business? And then also, for the non-mainframe business, what kind of margin opportunity do you expect to see from, for example, enterprise solutions?","Hock Tan","Well, I love this question. I'm almost tempted to tell you, hello, the same reason we've put together a bunch of businesses in semiconductor, what we call semiconductor solutions. On one extreme semiconductor solution, I am pulling simple hardware semiconductors, pure hardware analog components. To the extreme, it's not even silicon, in some cases, it's nanotechnology, it's indium phosphide, gallium arsenide, as in lasers, to the more well-known, well-recognized silicon SoCs, silicon on a chip there we built our routers and switches, and deep-learning chips on, with a lot of software, by the way on this thing, lots of software. I have -- in our networking team I have as many software engineers as I have hardware engineers, silicon solution engineers.","In our video delivery business, video, which is basically a set-top box with cable modem, I have more software engineers because there are tons of different kinds of software that goes into a set-top box chip thus compared to hardware engineers. We understand software. CA, you're right, is all software. But a set-top box is, to put a number, over 60% software. And if I have to look at the switch, I can make the switch as simple, programmable and install software-defined networks and write a lot of software specs to program this, and that's 70% software, 30% hardware. Or I could hard-code chips as I do in certain other versions of my networking business, which are typically lower-end switches.","And I would say I have 80% hardware and 20%, 30% software. So I go -- it varies across a lot of spectrum. One thing that's common is technology. It's technology solutions you provide to your customers, who cannot operate very productively, very efficiently, they don't sometimes operate at all without that, and it's technology solutions that evolve over time and your ability to keep up with customer needs over time. We're very good at managing that. We are very good at understanding how to monetize intellectual property in technology. I think that's a common thing we have.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Your line is open.","Matt Ramsay","I think it would be helpful for either one of you guys to talk a little bit about the M&A philosophy going forward. I think, Tom, you did an excellent job in sort of reiterating the capital return policy. It sort of struck me on a lot of the questions that we got from investors were it was sort of a surprise at the size of the CA deal, given some of the prior commentary around maybe focusing on smaller M&A deals. So I just kind of open it up and I'd love to hear some philosophy, conversation about how you're thinking about maybe verticals or size or any of those things, if there's anything that's off limits going forward, or we should just think about the capital return policy only and nothing's really off the table in terms of M&A. And I'll just open it up at that.","Tom Krause","Good question, Matt. I think that the important message is not much has changed. The business model and what we think drives the returns of the acquisitions that we do is very consistent. And we understand and appreciate that CA was a bit of a surprise and certainly larger than maybe what many people expected, but the reality is it was the right deal for us at the right time as we think about how to grow the earnings base of the Company and how to drive value for shareholders over time. And if you think back, and this follows up on Harsh's question a minute ago, when we bought LSI, we were getting into what you could argue as a very different business.","We had a largely mobile business at Avago, RF business that's sustained today has grown organically very rapidly, but we're getting into businesses that included rechannel SoCs, preamps for hard disk drives. We were getting into enterprise storage and SaaS connectivity, serving -- delivering to the server market. And these were all businesses that we frankly didn't know very well, but it was the characteristics of those businesses, just to follow in on what Hock discussed in terms of the intellectual property, the barriers to entry, the sustainability of the businesses, and by focusing on those businesses, that's what allowed us to drive the returns we've seen. And we have obviously expanded from there. We've done smaller transactions, but we've also more recently done Brocade.","Clue, that's a systems business. It's largely software. It has an end-user sales force. It's opened our eyes to end customers and what we can do with those end customers. But more importantly, it's proven to us that we can manage these businesses. The performance of Brocade over the last year, and we've obviously been quite familiar with the business for more than that time period, has been quite exceptional. And so CA is really an extension of a strategy that we've been pursuing for a number of years and has driven a tremendous amount of value for shareholders. So we look to continue to do that as a way to drive value. Obviously, we're going to deliver on the dividend, which is really important to us. But we have a lot of financial flexibility off the back of significant and substantial operating cash flows to continue to do buybacks and to do accretive M&A, and we see opportunities going forward to do that.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research. Your line is open.","Edward Snyder","One of the things that struck me though in your initial comments, when you were talking about your new customer base with see CA because they do open up a lot of clients that you don't have with the semiconductor business. You were talking about porting in some of your networking and compute solutions, storage solutions to them. But right now, you're selling semiconductors, and a number of your big customers, you mentioned them, Google, Facebook or Google, Amazon, Microsoft, build their own boxes using your silicon. I would imagine, most of the CA's customers do not do this. So how are you going to port your -- how do you think you could port your semiconductor products to these new customers without getting into boxes? Or are you thinking about that? Or do you think they will start up such endeavors to start porting through? So I guess I don't understand how your existing products are going to be ported to these new clients without some sort of intermediary or white box guy or something. Maybe I'm a little bit confused there, but if you could explain that, I would appreciate it.","Hock Tan","Sure. I think that's a very, very insightful question you came out with, and you're right 100%. One, we're not interested in going to the boxes, you got that right, or systems. We don't need to do that. But we have the key ingredients. We have the chips, the engine. So you take a box, be it in the industry that you're out to, any of those things. Where -- and we have the software. Or if you want to sum up all of these end users now, and you're probably aware of that and to some extent, some of the big operators now are starting to want to build their own data centers and they have come to us and asked us to enable them to build their own data centers. And what -- that's very similar. And these guys are very, very aware of how the cloud guy is doing.","The cloud guys use our own silicon engine -- our own merchant silicon. In many cases, some of our initial -- our software, SDK, by -- in many cases, they even write their own software and they then go to ODMs, the ODMs in Taiwan, in China, anywhere else, to put a box to build a system, a box. We have to enable that. Obviously, we have to. And the cloud guys do it.","There's no reason why an operator like AT&T with Domain 2.0 cannot and is, in fact, executing on that basis or any other large enterprise users who build -- who had to build out on their own scale fairly substantial data centers, why they can't even do that on their own because as Tom had said, the core IP, the core technology, which is the engine, the software. Everything else ties together, and there are lots of ODMs out there. You call that white boxes, I believe, and they have a choice of doing that or continuing to buy from their traditional sources.","What we are able to do now with our direct access to CA customers is establish strategic and strong engagements with those end users, and substantial end-user enterprises or end users, who would want to start doing it themselves in order to not just do it at low economics, but in order to access directly the latest, call it, leading-edge silicon software products, technology, which will enable them to build data centers just as leading-edge as what's available in the cloud. But we have seen that requirement, that request coming in, and we are basically responding to it. This is not a pipe dream.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question will come from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura Instinet. Your line is open.","Romit Shah","I definitely appreciate that you guys think very strategically about the deals you do, but if I just go back and think about your M&A track record over the last several years, it just struck me as being financial deals, first and foremost. And Hock, the playbook has been, at least my impression has been, you'd slash SG&A by a significant amount, you'd cut R&D while basically raising prices at the same time. And CA, given the kind of legacy nature of their technology, has a lot of people believing that this business may turn out to not be as sticky if you take the same approach. So could you just comment on that, please?","Hock Tan","Absolutely. That's a question that's wrong on so many fronts, I don't know where to begin. Let me start, let me try. Number one, we acquire -- we have a history of acquisitions and integrating very, very well. Those are not financial deals. They end up, as I say, as great financial returns. They're not -- we operate them under a single umbrella. We operate them, I hate to say, very, very well, but we also operate them very, very focused. And when you're focused, as I said before, you don't overinvest in R&D. When you're focused, you don't overinvest in even selling. When you run your company in a business model that is simple, you don't need a huge amount of SG&A.","As already mentioned, it's not about cutting SG&A, it's about simplifying a business process with very strong -- a portfolio of very strong businesses, where you focus your spending on R&D to enable you to keep being ahead of the pack. And that's really our business -- our model, it's a business model and that we have executed over the last 6 years through multiple acquisitions. And it's also, as I mentioned in an earlier response, how well we integrate into the model, which ties to being very focused on what you pick as core businesses you want to keep investing in and divesting. You can't cut a business that you don't have. Businesses that you do not see as being sustainable, part of it being sustainable is really a chance of them in franchise.","When we buy companies over the last 5, 6 years, just as many companies and businesses we are in. If you look at the finer print and we have that data, we divest as many businesses out there. We just let it go because those are businesses that we believe are not sustainable, are not strong, are commoditized and where you don't have an advantage for whatever reasons that comes into play. So in that sense, you might call that financial. I don't. I call it a very strategic focus on businesses you can win.","And that's how we look at even looking towards CA, which is an interesting part of what you say because, Romit, the mainframe business is very alive and well. Investments are still continuing in the mainframe business. And to put it in simple terms, transactions, online transactions, a lot of them in the largest enterprises in the world cannot run without mainframe, with hardware or the software tools that drive it. So that's basically all I say to that. But obviously, ours is an operating model and a business model, and the financials is what comes out of a very strong, sustainable and secure business model.","Tom Krause","Okay.

At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Beatrice Russotto, Director of Investor Relations of Broadcom, Inc. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.","Beatrice Russotto","Thank you, operator and good afternoon everyone. Joining me today are Hock Tan, President and CEO and Tom Krause, Chief Financial Officer of Broadcom. After the market closed today, Broadcom distributed a press release and financial payables describing our financial performance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2018. If you did not receive a copy, you may obtain the information from the Investors section of Broadcom\u2019s website at broadcom.com. This conference call is being webcast live and a recording will be available via telephone playback for 1 week. It will also be archived in the Investors section of our website at broadcom.com.","During the prepared comments section of this call, Hock and Tom will be providing details of fiscal year 2018 results, guidance for fiscal year 2019 and some commentary regarding the business environment. We will take questions after the end of the prepared comments. Please refer to our press release today and our recent filings with the SEC for information on the specific risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call. In addition to U.S. GAAP reporting, Broadcom reports certain financial measures on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the tables attached to today\u2019s press release. Comments made during today\u2019s call will primarily refer to our non-GAAP financial results.","So with that, I will turn the call over to Hock.","Hock Tan","Well, thank you, Bea and thank you all for joining us today. Well, as you saw, we closed the fiscal year on a very high note. Consolidated net revenue for the fourth quarter fiscal \u201818 was $5.45 billion, a 12% increase from a year ago and EPS came in at $5.85, a 27% increase from a year ago. Importantly, free cash flow was $2.53 billion or 46% of our net revenue. I would like to provide you more color on the top line today and I have a lot to cover today actually. Please note fourth quarter results do not include any contributions from CA.","Starting with wired, on the quarter results, starting with wired, revenue was $2.2 billion, growing 3% year-on-year and wired segment represented 41% of our total revenues for this quarter. Looking deeper though fourth quarter wired results reflect very strong year-on-year growth for our networking and computing offload businesses driven by robust demand from the cloud data center markets, as well as traditional enterprises. Networking and computing offload represented over two-thirds of our wired segment in the quarter and grew 22% year-on-year in the quarter. This is on the back of growing 10% year-on-year in the third quarter. So, this part of the wired segment continues to be very robust. On the other side as anticipated, cyclical headwinds in certain parts of our broadband business reflecting weak carrier spending in those areas continued to impact this part of our wired business in the fourth quarter. As a result, broadband was down year-over-year again in the fourth quarter and offset partially the strong growth from data center spending.","Turning to enterprise storage, revenue was $1.3 billion, representing 23% of revenue. And consistent with what we experienced in wired networking businesses, robust enterprise IT spending drove over 96% year-on-year revenue increase. Now, of course, this includes contributions from Brocade, which we acquired about a year ago. But even if we strip out Brocade, enterprise storage grew double-digits year-on-year in the quarter.","Moving on to wireless, revenue was $1.7 billion, which was down 5% year-on-year. The wireless segment represented 31% of our total revenue. And wireless revenue however was somewhat better than our expectations for the fourth quarter as we benefited from upside volumes of legacy phone generations and our North American OEM customer. And finally, our last segment, industrial. In the fourth quarter, the industrial segment represented 5% of our total revenues. Distribution re-sales which is how industrial outsold for us continued to be strong contributing to high single-digit year-on-year growth in the industrial business.","With that now, let\u2019s talk about the segment performance for the full fiscal year 2018, which interestingly enough could be in stark contrast to the Q4 results I just articulated. Wired for us in fiscal 2018 was up 1% as networking expanded while broadband was down. Meanwhile, enterprise storage was significantly supported by Brocade as well as strong organic growth in our server storage connectivity business and industrial performed extremely well, up 12% helped by healthy macro backdrop. Finally, despite all the quarterly fluctuations, wireless was actually up 20%.","So, what\u2019s interesting and what I want to highlight when you step back from quarterly results and look at the annual performance, we had a great year. Our revenues hit a new record high growing 18% year-on-year to nearly $21 billion for fiscal \u201818. This clearly demonstrates how our diverse set of businesses drives stability and sustainability in our consolidated revenue despite quarterly and even biannual volatility in specific segments. With this in mind, we plan to move away from quarterly guidance to annual guidance going forward. Annual goals and guidance reflect we believe more accurately how we manage our business and also aligns very well with how management and employees in this company are measured.","In addition, viewing our business broadly, you can see we have created over the years, organically and through acquisitions, a substantial core revenue stream in semiconductors based on technology enabling connectivity solutions across a broad set of end-markets. We continue to remain focused on the sustainability and growth of this core business. But in addition, with our acquisition of Brocade, we created a complementary revenue stream to our semiconductors solutions that we are now calling infrastructure software. With the acquisition of CA now, we will grow this revenue stream and build upon it through acquisitions consistent with our business model. As a result going forward, our two primary segments will be semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software. And so for fiscal 2019, this coming year, the outlook for business is as follows. In the semiconductor solutions segment, we expect continued robust demand from cloud customers with the RAM of next generation Tomahawk 3 stretchers and from the launch of our next generation routers, Jericho 2. We also expect to see recovery of spending by carriers, operators in cable as well as in communications as we expect the broadband market recovery to start to progress through the year. We have already seen that happen this quarter. Storage, we believe will be stable relative to fiscal 2018. And as we previewed last quarter, we believe the reset in our wireless business in the first half of 2019 from share loss in the current phone generation will be followed by a substantial recovery in the second half as we take share back for the next generation. So while there will be lots of puts and take here, our outlook for the semiconductor business is for modest revenue growth in 2019. This maybe somewhat dampened relative to our long-term mid single-digit growth expectation by wireless.","Now, turning to infrastructure software segment, before providing our outlook, I should take a few minutes to outline the substantial changes we are making to the CA business model. We expect these changes to result in a dramatically more profitable revenue base which is more aligned to the rest of Broadcom and that we expect will grow. First and foremost, gone are the days of trying to land new products with new customers and I am referring to software, enterprise software. We are focusing all our attention on renewing existing products with existing mainframe-centric customers, customers that represent virtually all of the world\u2019s largest enterprises and largest spenders on IT. We are also targeting expansion opportunities within this core mainframe customer base. The cost of running this renewed and expanded model will be substantially less than the legacy land-at-all-cost model and importantly renewing and expanding plays to CA\u2019s strengths.","Let me explain. Today, over 70% of CA\u2019s revenues are derived from its top 500 accounts. In almost all cases, these top customers have been licensing CA mainframe products for more than a decade and oftentimes several decades. CA contracts with its customers are primarily broad-based, multiyear license agreements and include a term license with maintenance for mainframes. At this same customer, enterprise products are sold, but sold as perpetual licenses with maintenance and data in the license agreements. At each of our top customers we have two primary objectives: 1) we want to expand our efforts on mainframe and make sure that we are realizing the full value that our mainframe tools are delivering to our customers. And as we discussed on the prior call, usage as defined by MITS has been growing at double-digit rates at all these top accounts. Logically, we are now more focused, because of that on pricing mainframe based on consumption. We also feel there is a huge opportunity for customers to save money by leveraging our broad mainframe portfolio to drive more conversions to CA tools.","Going on to the second objective, we really want to expand our enterprise software products within the same top accounts. Now, it is true that lower costs and lighter weight SaaS alternatives have been creating challenges for CA for sometime in the enterprise software market. What\u2019s interesting is that CA actually has very highly rated, in fact Gartner upper right hand Magic Quadrant categories for enterprise software on the end for enterprises. While we are very well suited to the private cloud IT environment of the largest enterprises, these enterprise software are just too expensive relative to SaaS. So, moving forward, we are growing away to move away from the inflexible, perpetual license model for enterprise software to an enterprise-wide all-you-can-eat license for all of our core accounts. By doing this, we expect to remove the friction caused by selling expensive upfront perpetual licenses so that the incremental costs for our customers to expand the use of enterprise products will be highly competitive relative to SaaS-based alternatives. Bottom line, we are adopting a fully ratable subscription model for the Broadcom software business.","This new business model we believe plays to our strengths, focusing on the largest 500 customers tied to mainframes with the ability to up-sell enterprise software competitively using an all-you-can-eat subscription based model. We expect this transition though to take a couple of years given the timing of contract renewals. But once completed, we expect revenues to stabilize at over $3.5 billion annually and grow from there. And to support that revenue base, we do not expect to spend more than $900 million per year. And as a result, we expect to achieve more than $2.5 billion per year in operating profitability from the CA business once we go through this transition. We are well underway today with the CA restructuring and the integration process, including announcement of the Veracode divestiture to Thoma Bravo and the outsourcing of the CA services business to HCL. So, with that as background, let me talk about our outlook for the infrastructure software segment in 2019.","Now, SAN switching, private channel SAN switching here performed beyond our expectations in 2018 on the back of very strong enterprise demand as well as meaningful share gains. While we expect to continue to see healthy demand, we do not expect in this forecast to have this sustained through 2019. Furthermore since we are moving mainframe and enterprise software products to a fully ratable revenue recognition model and just focusing on the top 500 accounts, we expect a reset in the CA revenue starting Q1 2019. As a result, our revenue outlook for the infrastructure software segment for 2019 will be approximately $5 billion. Combining with semiconductor solutions, in summary, we are forecasting consolidated revenue to be approximately $24.5 billion fiscal 2019. This will be to some to repeat driven by very stable semiconductor business that will be complemented by an infrastructure software business that we are rapidly building up. Thank you. Tom?","Tom Krause","Thanks, Hock and good afternoon everyone. My comments today will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results from continuing operations, unless otherwise specifically noted.","Let me walk through our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. Fourth quarter net revenue was $5.45 billion ahead of the midpoint of guidance. Our gross margin from continuing operations was above the high-end of our guidance at 68.4% as we benefited from a more favorable product mix in the quarter. Operating expenses were slightly lower than expected at $863 million. As a result, we achieved record profitability in the quarter. Operating income from continuing operations was $2.86 billion and represented 52.5% of net revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.02 billion and represented 55.4% of net revenue. This figure excludes $132 million of depreciation and the company delivered $5.85 of EPS in the quarter off of a $435 million weighted average fully diluted share count. This represents 27% EPS growth compared to the same quarter last year.","Working capital, excluding cash and cash equivalents, increased approximately $105 million compared to the prior quarter due primarily to an increase in receivables. This increase was driven by seasonally higher shipments in the last month of the quarter. In addition, we spent $106 million on capital expenditures. As a result, we had record free cash flow from operations at $2.53 billion or 46% of revenue. This represents 47% growth in free cash flow from Q4 of 2017. In the quarter, we returned $2.26 billion to stockholders, including $723 million in the form of cash dividends and $1.53 billion for the repurchase of 6.4 million AVGO shares. We ended the quarter with $4.3 billion of cash, $17.5 billion of total debt, $408 million of outstanding shares and $432 million of fully diluted shares outstanding.","New, let me turn to our fiscal year 2019 non-GAAP guidance. We do intend to update our annual guidance on our quarterly earnings calls throughout the year. And as normal, this guidance is for results from continuing operations only. As Hock discussed, net revenue for fiscal 2019 is expected to be approximately $24.5 billion, including approximately $19.5 billion from semiconductor solutions and approximately $5 billion from infrastructure software. IP licensing is not expected to generate a material amount of revenue. Operating margins are expected to be approximately 51%. I would like to note post-CA integration restructuring we do expect to move closer to 55% operating margins in 2020.","Net interest expense and others expect to be approximately $1.25 billion and reflects maintaining a target cash balance of approximately $4 billion and servicing total debt outstanding of approximately $37 billion following the close of the CA deal. This forecast does not contemplate any debt pay-down in fiscal year 2019. The tax rate is forecasted to be approximately 11% and includes a slight negative impact from the CA acquisition. Depreciation is expected to be approximately $600 million. CapEx is expected to be approximately $550 million. As a result, free cash flow from continuing operations is expected to be approximately $10 billion. And finally, stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $2.1 billion. Now, this is a substantial increase in our stock-based compensation expense and let me take a moment to explain.","We are implementing a special broad-based multiyear equity award program for our employees, including our new CA employees. Each multiyear equity award will vest on the same basis as four annual equity grants made on March 15 of each year beginning in 2019. And it is expected that a maximum of approximately 31 million shares of common stock in aggregate will be issued in vest over the next 7 years. This is the same number of shares in aggregate as we would have expected to grant over the next 4 years annually. The spike in the 2019 stock-based comp will start to come down in 2020 and declined from there back to our normal level by 2022.","So in summary, really this is an accounting dynamic that impacts the stock-based comp in 2019. We do believe providing 4 years of equity grants upfront provides clarity regarding future compensation that creates a powerful retention incentive in an otherwise tight labor market and a sharpened focus on long-term stockholder value creation. In addition, it allows us to maximize the use of the remaining authorized share reserves under our 2019 Avago equity award plan, which unfortunately is expiring in 2019. As broad-based employee stock ownership is a fundamental tenant of our company, it is important that we continue this legacy while our current equity plans enable us to do so. I would note couple of things: one, Hock is not participating in this program and as previously disclosed, will not receive another equity grant until at least 2021. In addition, for executives 50% of the awards are PSUs, the vesting of which is tied to total shareholder return similar to our prior annual awards to executives. Finally, no further annual grants are planned for employees, who receive this award until at least 2022.","Now, let me turn to capital allocation plans before we open the call for questions. Consistent with our capital allocation strategy, we are focused on returning approximately 50% of our prior year free cash flow to stockholders in the form of cash dividends, with the balance being allocated to a combination of stock buybacks and acquisitions. In addition, we plan to also continue to use our balance sheet to fund acquisitions while focusing on maintaining our investment-grade credit rating.","With that, on the dividend based on approximately $8.2 billion of free cash flow that we generated in fiscal 2018, we are increasing our target quarterly cash dividends starting this quarter to $2.65. This constitutes an increase of 51%. We plan to maintain this dividend payout throughout the year subject to quarterly board approval, which means we plan to pay out over $4 billion in cash dividends in fiscal 2019.","Consistent with our capital allocation policy, we will reassess the dividend at this time next year based on our fiscal 2019 free cash flow from operations. Now, given the dilution stockholders are bearing from the multi-year grant and given the free cash flow yield that Broadcom is currently generating, we are also budgeting to return an additional $8 billion to stockholders through stock buybacks in fiscal 2019. Coupled with the dividend, this means we are planning to return approximately $12 billion to stockholders in fiscal 2019, which constitutes all of our projected free cash flow, plus the excess cash that we have on our balance sheet today.","That concludes my prepared remarks. During the Q&A portion of today\u2019s call, please limit yourselves to one question each so that we can accommodate as many analysts as possible. Operator, if you could please open up the call for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya","Thanks for taking my question, and congratulations on the good execution. Hock, I understand and appreciate keeping the focus on longer-term trends, but just because removing the guidance on a quarterly basis is a big change. Just for this quarter, could you give us some color on how Q1 trends are shaping up especially, given all the concerns around trade and tariff and your largest customers. So, even if you can\u2019t quantify everything, if you could just give us some color commentary on what\u2019s going on in different segments in Q1, that would be very helpful?","Hock Tan","I\u2019ll give you the answer, it\u2019s okay. Remember, we have backlog out 18 weeks for most of our products, that\u2019s longer than a quarter, which runs 13 weeks. And based on what we have in place, it\u2019s running pretty \u2013 trending pretty well compared to Q4, okay. And keep in mind, it\u2019s \u2013 there are puts and takes even in all of this. Broadband starts to recover, as I mentioned before, finally, long last, and networking, offload computing is still nicely holding up, but handset, wireless, you\u2019ve seen it out there, we expect to see a seasonal down-take. So, storage flattish back to moderation. So, all combined together, things are kind of what it is, okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.","Aaron Rakers","Yes, thanks for taking the question. I want to understand maybe the puts and takes a little bit better in the software \u2013 infrastructure software guide. If we look at CA\u2019s results on a standalone basis, it looks like they\u2019re about 3. \u2013 call it $5 billion. You\u2019re stripping out the services business. You\u2019ve sold Veracode. So, can you help us bridge a little bit more the uplift you\u2019re seeing from that level of revenue to that $5 billion guide for the full-year? Thank you.","Tom Krause","Hey, Aaron, it\u2019s Tom. I think, keep in mind there are now two substantial businesses, I should really say three in that number. As you properly pointed out, there\u2019s the CA business for a couple of data points. Veracode run rate business is about $150 million a year and it was growing, and we\u2019ve outsourced the services business, so that business will start to tail off through the course of 2019 and largely be gone in 2020. But then keep in mind also, there\u2019s Brocade, the SAN fiber channel switching business, which is performing very well for us. We\u2019re not breaking out the specific revenues for that particular business, but it\u2019s also providing a substantial portion of the overall $5 billion. So, in total we see a reset in the CA business starting in Q1. We do expect based on the renewal expectations around our core 500 customer base to grow throughout the year with CA, and we also expect to continue to maintain reasonably high levels of revenue with the Brocade fiber channel business.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.","Amit Daryanani","Thanks for taking my question, guys. When I think about that $2.5 billion operating profit target from CA, can you just talk about that timeline to achieve that? And when I look at the accretion or the incremental contribution you get from post CA, the accretion I guess, how much of that is going to come in cost versus OpEx for you guys?","Hock Tan","Well, very interesting question. Let me outline again what I went through in my remarks fairly quickly. And as Tom actually articulated earlier in answer to a question, we start 2019 partly because of a resetting from recognizing perpetual licenses on a salaried manner to ratable subscription-based revenue recognition. \u201819 will take a step down from what you typically expect the rate to be and it will rapidly build up over the next 2, 3 years to the level as we spoke about closer to over $3.5 billion. On the spending side, if you recall, before we acquired CA the last quarter, stripping out services, taking out services which was a wash, spending \u2013 total spending was about 2. \u2013 about $2.4 billion, $2.5 billion per year. We\u2019re bringing it down to $900 million. And we are able to bring it down to $900 million is for one, I purposely articulated in my opening remarks, okay. A large part of that $2.4 billion of spending was attributed to the various sales motion, development motion, I should say, of trying to land new customers, as well as land existing customers with new products, but basically landing new customers. And a lot of these customers are, I would consider, the long tail of a long list of customers. The largest 500 customers in the world are already our customers through mainframes. But a big amount of that spent, I would guess what we\u2019re saying is to the tune of more than $1.5 billion at least, sorry, above \u2013 of spending $2.4 billion, sorry, $900 million is the end part [ph], so, $1.5 billion is used to try to develop new products and land our new customers. By moving away from that, focusing on the largest 500 customers, we\u2019ve renewed most with mainframes, but up-selling on enterprise software. We basically get to the same revenue number with much less spending substantially. And that $3.5 billion, say as conservatively we get to in year 2 or year 3 from today and less the $900 million state is \u2013 end-state spending is where we believe we get to around the $2.5 billion operating profit target.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.","Toshiya Hari","Great. Thank you so much for taking the question. Hock, you talked about your intention to regain share in the RF business next year, I think that\u2019s consistent with what you had said three months ago, I appreciate the time you spend with your customers in designing these products and you probably have some visibility, but I was under the impression that the SKUs for next year hadn\u2019t been set, so I guess the question is what gives you the confidence that you can indeed regain share in that business? Thank you.","Hock Tan","We are just confident. And obviously we have not been idle, we have been working. And because these are very difficult products, very complex, technologically proving, advanced products to do and we have been working on it for over 1 year with customers.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Hock, you talked about continued strong trends fiscal \u201819 in networking demand, cloud and enterprise, I was hoping you could quantify a bit more, next year it\u2019s still looking like the cloud guys are growing their spending again albeit at a lower rate versus this year, but then you were there on the 200 gig, 400 gig upgrade cycle with Tomahawk 3 and then you have got the ramp of some of your AI and deep learning and SmartNIC ASIC programs, given all of this, I kind of wanted to know if the team still feels like they can sustain double digits year-over-year growth rates for this segment fiscal \u201819?","Hock Tan","Very good question. Thank you. Yes, cloud \u2013 public cloud I call it, has been part of our networking, compute offload business, so to speak. The public cloud side, which is about half or at least half of our revenues right now in that sector that does networking and of compute offload continues to be extremely strong. And it\u2019s strong not because of anything else, in 2018 we didn\u2019t launch any major new milestone products and we still grew. As we indicated, we grew double digits. 2019 we have in addition to that natural momentum, the addition of the fact that we are launching both two significant products. The top of the rack switch, the Tomahawk 3, 12.8 terabyte \u2013 terabit per second, three throughput switches which are very welcome, very \u2013 basically will be very much in use by the hyper cloud guys. That will be a big driver of growth. In addition, but perhaps in use in some of the spine architecture of those hyper cloud data centers, but more on adjusted more so at operators for their routing applications. We are launching middle of the year Jericho2. So we have two product drivers on top of the natural momentum of increasing content that we are seeing, that you articulated in those data centers at the cloud, from \u2013 especially from compute offload, where we are talking about more than controllers. We are talking about deep learning content. We are talking about compression encryption. And we are just talking broadly about anything to do with offloading CPU cycles from server. And that\u2019s a very long-term tailwind that we have basically been able to take advantage of and continue to benefit through probably more than 1 year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura Instinet.","Romit Shah","Yes. Thank you. Tom, I just wanted to make sure I had my facts correct on the option grant, so $2.1 billion for fiscal \u201819 and you have that coming down over \u2013 is it over a 4-year period and does it go back to the fiscal \u201818 levels or some level above that? Thank you.","Tom Krause","No, I think that\u2019s the right way to think about it Romit. It\u2019s a 4-year grant accelerated and done in one shot this year as opposed to doing it over 4 years. So in aggregate you wouldn\u2019t have any difference, but from an accounting perspective you will have to take all the step up this quarter. It will start to bleed off next year and decelerate back to where we were over a 4-year period. So I look at the 2018, $300 million a quarter type stock based comp run rate as the run rate roughly for the company on a steady state basis.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust.","William Stein","Great. Thanks. Congratulations on the quarter. Thanks for taking my question. I am particularly focused on the dividend, there was a significant increase this quarter and when we contemplate the company\u2019s ability to grow the top line long-term, expand margins and your capital allocation plans save any further M&A, what does management expect the sort of long-term growth rate of that dividend to be?","Tom Krause","Sure Will. So I think we have spelled it out fairly clearly both on the policy in terms of returning the 50% of free cash flow from the prior fiscal year. And we have spelled out now what we think we can do from a free cash flow from operations perspective in 2019, which is the $10 billion. So when you take into account the buyback expectation that we have also articulated of approximately $8 billion, the outstanding shares should come down, as well as the free cash flow is going to go up. So when you do that math, you are going to come up with a number that\u2019s north of 20% in terms of potential for dividend growth. Now, going forward we will have a couple of other tailwinds that we have benefited from in the past, which is frankly M&A and the accretion that we drive once we are fully integrated and restructured. And so as Hock has been articulating, when we get to the $2.5 billion plus of operating profit, that\u2019s going to start to be realized in 2020, into 2021. Absent additional M&A, we would continue to focus not just on the dividend but also the buyback, which would allow us to reduce the share count as well. So I think we have a good setup to continue to be able to drive the dividend well into the double digits over the next several years.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.","Stacy Rasgon","Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you can elaborate a little bit on the all you can eat model that you are developing now for the enterprise software business, does that basically works one license that a customer takes for anything that you buy going forward and put into that segment and if that\u2019s true, how do you grow the business without taking those rates up over time if you are still selling to the same customers, what does that model actually look like over time?","Hock Tan","Yes. That\u2019s a very good point. And you are right. We provide that enterprise wide license to those core customers only, by the way product by product. Obviously, it\u2019s not across all our enterprise products at the same time, but it\u2019s only when the customer is adopting it. And so that part of it becomes very important, you are right. If a customer is one of those big core customers, adopts say agile operations, one of our agile operations, software or agile what we call rally which is for projects. And they want more seats, they want more capacity, what we will provide is for a license contract of a \u2013 on a multi-year basis, we expect to get a certain amount of dollars, as you say and we will give them under that enterprise wide unlimited license. And you are right, so for that particular product limited ability to increase, except on the fact that after say, the contract is 3 years, end of 3 years inflationary improvement and improvement in our product, innovative improvement in not putting more features in the product. But we would better be selling them another product on the same basis and that\u2019s how we expect to be able to grow. And so from two fronts improving the product we have on an ongoing basis, but also selling the customer another product from a very broad suite of enterprise software products.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Ellis with B. Riley FBR.","Craig Ellis","Thanks for taking the question. I will echo the congratulations on the good execution. Tom, I think it was in your comments where you mentioned the aspiration for 55% operating margins in fiscal \u201820, but since that would represent a 400 basis point increase from what you are targeting in fiscal \u201819, can you just walk us through some of the assumptions that could lift the operating margin level of that magnitude? Thank you.","Tom Krause","Yes, good question. So there is a number of things with that. I think first and foremost, we do continue to see the ability to grow the business. In the core semiconductor business, we do expect especially as wireless recovers in the back half to see a return to more standard mid single-digit growth rates in 2020. On the software side, as we continue to grow into the ratable model, we also expect to continue to see growth there in 2020 and into 2021. And then as is consistent with what you have seen over the last many years, our model is very focused on gross margin expansion. We will continue to drive incremental expansion in gross margins, especially on the semiconductor side. And then finally we have talked about it a lot on this call, but we are going to be reducing expenses dramatically with CA and we are doing that because of a change in the business model and the focus on the top 500 accounts, the focus on leveraging mainframe with these great enterprise products and moving to a fully ratable model. This is a much lower cost, much more profitable way to run the business. And so you are going to see the benefits of that in 2020, which will actually continue to show progress even into 2021, I think. So, 55% operating margins we think is very achievable as a result of all those factors as we look out beyond \u201819.","Hock Tan","And to be specific, Craig, this fiscal \u201819 when we buy a company, especially as complex and large as CA, it takes us a year or two to transition through the end state. Fiscal \u201819, I would estimate we are carrying something like $1 billion of transition expenses in fiscal \u201819 alone. Now, it won\u2019t all evaporate by fiscal \u201820 but a big part of it will evaporate by fiscal \u201820 and that with the revenue increase Tom was talking about gets us to that 55% operating margin.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.","Craig Hettenbach","Yes, thanks. Hock, just a question, any particular feedback from large customers now that you have Brocade and CA together, anything you would like to discuss in terms of some of the synergies and overlap of customer base and things you can do?","Hock Tan","Great question. Yes, I have met with quite a few CIOs, Chief Operating Officers and CIOs of fairly some of the largest customers of CA who happens to be coincidental or otherwise the largest end use customers of Brocade as well, which is SAN switching. And you may know, we have mentioned in prior quarters, SAN switching, which is attaching to storage arrays is very, very connected to mainframes as well in hardware and software the way storage is done. And basically, all this custom CIOs, a lot of them are as you well know thinking through the high levels of IT spending each of them has to go through. Each of them are trying to figure out what\u2019s the best structure, architecture for their data centers. And many of them are regulated, which means they can\u2019t go completely to the cloud. So, a lot of them are going \u2013 are talking about as we all hear hybrid cloud a lot more of them are thinking of building their own private cloud. We have all the technologies, hardware and software to enable them to build those private clouds. And each of those CIOs in these larger companies who are spending several billion dollars at least a year in IT are quite able and have the scale to do that. So, there is potentially a lot of synergies and it\u2019s not just in the technologies we have and collaborate as one. It\u2019s also the go-to-market model that will be very much simplified as we now reach out to those end user customers who are in CA, who are in Brocade and who indirectly develop building or buying big data centers, compute, storage, networking indirectly from us. So, there is a lot of synergies and we have begun the process of engaging in a dialog.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho.","Vijay Rakesh","Yes, hi guys. Hock, you mentioned all-you-can-eat model for software. I was wondering if you continue to do more M&A on the software side that you can stack on that same model? Thanks.","Hock Tan","That\u2019s a great idea and we definitely want to do that, because we developed with CA the platform, that platform for support, ensuring customer success and a platform for directly touching, engaging \u2013 in fact, heavy touching I call it on those largest 500 customers. And as we add on more products, software products, be they particularly on enterprise software, we believe this is an opportunity for us as we say to build on that second revenue \u2013 complementary revenue stream in infrastructure software.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.","Ross Seymore","Hi, guys. Congrats especially on the cash return side. Hock, I wanted to ask a bigger question, with all the uncertainty in China trade and macro, etcetera, you mentioned you have the 18-week backlog and that the first quarter I think is doing fine to paraphrase what you said. Have you noticed any change in any of the various end markets that you have given these uncertainties in the customer behavior in anyway, shape or form?","Hock Tan","Yes, I am sure they are. But I think I am not sure if some of it is related more to macroeconomic variations in those niche markets we deal with versus the bigger concern with respect to tariffs is what I think you are referring to. It\u2019s hard to tell. But as we said, we across so many different end markets, niche markets some of them we do see some of them, your question is, are they all consistently trending down? No, we do not see that, but we do see some that are down and we do see some that are up. And is that an indication that is tariffs versus just very typical macroeconomics can\u2019t really tell, some of the color that I have given you guys almost, are not affected by those. For instance, broadband recovery, I think it\u2019s more tied to the lumpiness and the cycle of carriers and operator investment, especially in Europe and U.S. more than anything else and we are benefiting from that. Meanwhile, cloud spending be it in the U.S. or China is still unchanged and it\u2019s still going on very well. Enterprises, maybe we start seeing some level of slowdown in enterprises, but that\u2019s only down to a small part of our broader system. So, it\u2019s a lot of mix. And at the end of the day, it\u2019s not that clear yet how this will affect the business we are in which is largely enterprises and operators. Our exposure to consumer is limited to those couple of these high-end phones and in that regard, as we all have seen the phone market has not been exactly very strong these past several months.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John Pitzer","A lot of my questions have been answered. But Hock, just to follow on to Ross\u2019 question, you made some comments about cloud\/hyperscale and that\u2019s clearly an area where I think growth has been particularly strong this year and there is some investor angst about whether or not from these high levels that can be sustained into \u201819. I\u2019d love to get your view on that, and as you answer the question, I\u2019d love to get sort of a differentiation between kind of your core Ethernet business and maybe some of your new emerging ASIC business you have with the hyper scale guys, especially around acceleration in AI and how that\u2019s playing out?","Hock Tan","Okay, two questions. Let\u2019s try the first one. The cloud guys, as we see it, the spending is still going on. I mean, their spending pattern to some extent almost is starting to track or copy those of operators, they get lumpy, they don\u2019t spread evenly across a year. But if you take that, that\u2019s part of the reason why we want to go to an annual thing, because if you do it quarterly, it\u2019s not driving me crazy, it\u2019s driving you guys who track us crazy, because it gets very lumpy, especially with the level of spending they\u2019re all coming in and the level of spending we \u2013 they make on our products. But if you look at it across a period of a year, they are sustaining and they\u2019re sustaining, and I really mean the high, the large cloud guys, which includes both China and U.S., but also even the Tier 2 guys. It\u2019s still sustaining. And part of it is also content. We are selling them more and more stuff, as we say, products. It\u2019s not just switching and to some extent routing, it\u2019s not just switching that we started with initially, it\u2019s \u2013 which is what I highlight, and it\u2019s not newer generation of switching as they go to scale out of the data centers and higher capacity switching. We sell interconnects like fiber optics and we \u2013 and that\u2019s \u2013 as it goes from 10 gigabit to 100 gigabit, now 100 to 200 and 400, the price point, the content of those fiber optics goes shoots up fairly exponentially and very nicely.","And then we also do this computing offload, which is really a nice description or broad base of, as I say, you call it accelerators. And true, they are mostly accelerators and deep learning chips, network Ethernet controllers, SmartNICs as some people call them, encryption, compression, video deliveries, chips, all those go and build, the content keeps growing up. And that\u2019s why there\u2019s some level of \u2013 when you pull it all together, where do you see cloud going? And as I said, most of these are not one generation or one year at a time, they go beyond one year. So, overall, we see it as a continuum that is growing. How fast does it grow? It\u2019s that 20% I mentioned in Q4, seems somewhat unusual, but that\u2019s because of the lumpiness and that\u2019s why we don\u2019t want to give you guys the wrong impression, because the quarter before it was closer to 10%. And on average, I would say the cloud guys grow more likely in the high single-digits to 10% year-to-year than a 20% that any particular quarter might mislead us to think, but it\u2019s very stable and it\u2019s there to replace to some extent, the enterprises, the traditional enterprises.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we do have time for one final question, which will come from Timothy Arcuri with UBS.","Timothy Arcuri","Hi, thanks. Tom, I\u2019m just trying to get kind of an apples-to-apples bridge on the $24.5 billion relative to the $23.9 billion that was shown as a pro forma in the presentation for the CA deal. I know you\u2019re losing Veracode and you\u2019re losing some of the stuff around HCL, but you\u2019re also getting a bump from the change in the model in the software business. So, I\u2019m just trying to get a bridge on the apples-to-apples on that $24.5 billion relative to that $23.9 billion that you showed in the presentation? Thank you.","Tom Krause","It\u2019s a challenging bridge only because you\u2019re talking about, first of all, two accounting standards with 605 versus 606 on the CA side. But be as it may, I think the right way to think about it is the $24.5 billion. We\u2019ve talked a lot about where we think semiconductor growth will be. It\u2019s a new way of reporting for us, but we think we\u2019re going to have modest growth on the semiconductor side. And then you\u2019ve got two businesses, you\u2019ve got CA and Brocade, which is constituting the $5 billion that we\u2019re building up on the infrastructure software side. So, we\u2019re quite comfortable based on modest growth in semis and we have articulated I think quite clearly how we get there on top of what at end of the day is a solid Brocade business plus a restructured and reset CA business and that\u2019s how we get to the $24.5.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference.

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Ashish Saran, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Ashish Saran","Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are Hock Tan, President and CEO; and Tony Maslowski, Chief Financial Officer of Avago Technologies.","After the market closed today, Avago distributed a press release and financial table describing our financial performance for the third quarter fiscal year 2014. If you did not receive a copy, you may obtain the information from the Investors section of Avago's Web site at www.avagotech.com.","This conference call is being Webcast live and a recording will be available via telephone playback for one week. It will also be archived in the Investors section of our Web site at avagotech.com.","During the prepared comments section of this call, Hock and Tony will be providing details of our third fiscal quarter results, background to our fourth quarter outlook and some commentary regarding the business environment. We will take questions after the end of our prepared comments.","In addition to U.S. GAAP reporting, Avago reports certain financial measures on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the tables attached to today's press release. Comments made during today's call will primarily refer to our non-GAAP financial results.","Please refer to our press release today and our recent filings with the SEC for information on the specific risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call.","At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Hock Tan. Hock?","Hock Tan","Thank you, Ashish. Good afternoon, everyone. We are going to start today by reviewing recent business highlights in our end markets and give you an update on progress of our integration and then Tony will provide a summary of our third quarter fiscal 2014 financial results.","So during our first quarter, as a combined Company, we\u2019ve made great progress in integrating the Avago and LSI businesses. As you all are aware, in early May this year, as part of our cost reduction program associated with the acquisition of LSI, we announced our intend to eliminate approximately 1,100 positions from our work force, and which would generate most of the forecasted annual cost synergies of $200 million. This is still in progress very much and we believe we\u2019re well on our way to achieving these before the end of fiscal \u201915.","On top of integrating the two companies and their workforce, we\u2019ve also taken decisive steps to reshape our business to make our product portfolio more consistent with our business model. As you know because of this, we\u2019ve agreed to sell two non-core businesses the LSI flash and Axxia businesses.","Now revenue associated with this two businesses was a little over $100 million in Q3 fiscal \u201914 while the NOIs operating expenses for this two businesses exceeded $200 million. So reflecting this, this two businesses will be reported as discontinued operations with revenues and cost taken out of P&L going forward.","However, please note that the guidance we\u2019ve provided for the third quarter still include expected contribution from both the flash and Axxia businesses. And relative to this revenue guidance range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion we provided in May, our Q3 revenues reported were $1,394 million, which is at the high-end of guidance reflecting strong demand for ASIC networking products and seasonal uptick in hard disk drives.","We found revenue contribution from the flash and Axxia businesses, Q3 revenues from continuing operations would be $1.287 billion. So starting with Q3, our reported consolidated financial results will be shown in this manner.","So turning now to a discussion of end markets. As I mentioned in prior quarters earnings call, with a combination of LSI, our mix of revenue now includes revenues from a new end market enterprise storage in addition to the previously defined wireless, wired infrastructure, and industrial.","Starting with wireless, which as you know is pretty much classic Avago not impacted by the LSI acquisition. For fiscal Q3, revenue from our wireless end market met expectation moderately growing by 5% sequentially.","Wireless represented 28% of our total revenue from continuing operations and on a year-to-year basis, wireless revenue grew 28 -- 26%. Within the quarter, we observed continuing demand increases for our FBAR and FBAR related products and seen increased content from Chinese LTE smartphones offset partially by softer demand from Korea.","However, looking at Q4 fiscal 2014, we expect quite a different picture. We anticipate very strong sequential wireless revenue growth in excess of 16%. We expect this growth to largely result from the ramp of a new phone model and a North American smartphone customer. Compounding this ramp is a significant increase in content driven by the increasing proliferation of wireless bands within LTE smartphones.","Moving on to wired, our wired infrastructure end-market includes our ASIC business and our Fiber Optics business which is a combination in fiber optics of optical interconnects, modules that is and components. For fiscal Q3, our wired end market performance expected wired revenue represented 27% of our total revenues, our ASIC business experience significant strength from the prior quarter driven by strong demand from enterprise networking features as well as service provider routers.","Driven by similar trends, our fiber optics business experienced a moderate recovery from the prior quarter, in particular, we saw a strong sequential increase in [ph] [BIDI] fiber shipments used for 40G. We also saw a sustained demand for optical components from fiber to the home deployments in China, but we were capacity constrained within the quarter.","Looking forward to Q4, we expect low single-digit sequential growth -- revenue growth from this end-market. We expect growth in our ASIC business from sustained demand in enterprise switching and routing.","Our leading IP in particular in high speed service with 25G and 50G offerings, continues to position us extremely well and many customers. And in Q4 we expect several design wins in high performance computing platforms and software defined networking switches.","For fiber, however, we expect that to be flattish in Q4. We expect growth in our [ph] [BIDI] products. We expect continued growth I should say in the [ph] [BIDI] products offset however by slow down in 4G LTE wireless backhaul applications.","Moving on to enterprise storage, and as I mentioned this was the new end market for Avago in Q3 addressed by LSI\u2019s hard disk drives and servers, storage connectivity product lines. Starting in Q4, this end market will also include contributions from the recent PLX acquisition.","For fiscal Q3, enterprise storage revenue came in also as expected, brand represented 32% of our total revenues, hard disk drive were strong as we benefited from seasonal strength in this end market as well as certain design wins for custom solid state drive controllers within the quarter.","Our Read Channel in hard drives grew both in near line as well as enterprise platforms, and we saw strength in 3.5 inch desktops. Demand also for PreAmp products was strong as customers build into expected seasonal strength in the quarter. Our server storage connectivity business, which included -- which include our SaaS, rate on the silicon, adapter and software solutions continue to be very stable in Q3.","Looking forward to Q4, our enterprise storage end market expects mid single-digit sequential revenue growth for the core business without contribution from the PLX business. Including PLX contribution, we expect sequential revenue growth for this end market to be a little higher than 10%.","In Q4, we expect server and storage connectivity to grow significantly as our server OEM customers start launching new grandly based platforms using our 12G SaaS solutions. And we expect our HDD business, hard disk drive business, to grow moderately reflecting usual seasonality in the second half of the year.","Finally, moving on to our industrial and our smallest end market, this does also include LSI\u2019s IP licensing business. And in fiscal Q3, this end market saw strength compared to the prior quarter and represented 13% of our total revenues.","Industrial re-sales, in particular, were even stronger especially in Asia and Japan. And overall, distributor inventory continued to decline within the quarter. Looking into Q4, we expect our industrial to continue to grow with mid single-digit sequential growth rate. However, after such a strong Q3, we expect industrial re-sales to moderate and we\u2019re closely watching Europe for weaker demand trends. However, we continue to see strength in Japan and China.","So in summary, for Q4, we expect revenue to grow -- consolidated revenue to grow sequentially in all our end markets. Very strong 16% plus in wireless, low single-digit sequential growth in wired, a little higher than 10% growth in enterprise storage and mid single-digit growth in industrial.","This leads to our overall expectation that revenue from continuing operations for fourth quarter fiscal 2014 to sequentially increase around 20%.Similar to what we experienced last year, we currently expect a increase in wireless demand to sustain into the first quarter of our fiscal 2015.","With that, let me now turn the call over to Tony, for more detailed review of third quarter fiscal 2014 financials. Tony?","Tony Maslowski","Thank you, Hock, and good afternoon everyone. As we previously announced, we\u2019ve a definitively agreed to sell our flash and Axxia Networking businesses and we currently expect both of these transactions to close in Q4 fiscal 2014. Accordingly, the financial results and tables included in our third quarter fiscal year 2014 earnings press release classify these businesses as discontinued operations. As a reminder, we acquired both of these businesses in the LSI transaction.","Before reviewing the third quarter fiscal 2014 financial results, I want to remind you that my comments today will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results from continuing operations unless otherwise specifically noted. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP data is included with the earnings release issued today and is also available on our Web site at www.avagotech.com.","Since the guidance we provided for the third quarter, included expected contributions from both flash and Axxia businesses, I will provide Q3 revenues on a basis comparable to guidance, followed by detailed financial results for continuing operations only.","Please also note that Q3 results include contributions from continuing operations of acquired LSI businesses, while prior period mentioned do not. As the LSI acquisition was completed at the beginning of Q3 2014. In addition, the Q3 financial results did not include any contributions from PLX, which closed in Q4.","Now on to our Q3 results. Relative to the guidance we provided in May, our Q3 non-GAAP revenues including contributions from flash and Axxia businesses, now classified as discontinued operations were $1,394 million coming in at the high-end of our guidance.","Now turning to a more detailed discussion on financial results for continuing operations for the third quarter, Q3 revenues were $1,287 million and all our end markets performed as expected.","Foxconn was a greater than 10% customer in fiscal Q3. Our growth -- Q3 growth margin from continuing operations was 57% which is above our guidance range of 54% to 56%. Please remember that our guidance range included expected contributions from flash and Axxia businesses, both of which typically run at a lower average gross margin than the rest of the business.","Flash and Axxia are now classified as discontinued operations and are not included in gross margin for the quarter. This combined with our revenues coming in at the high-end of guidance resulted in gross margin above our original guidance.","Turning to operating expenses, R&D expenses were $219 million and SG&A expenses were $88 million, driving total operating expenses for Q3 to $307 million. As a percentage of sales, R&D was 17%, SG&A was 7% of net revenue.","The guidance we\u2019ve provided in May for Q3 operating expenses was $386 million, which included the flash and Axxia businesses. After adjusting for the impact from discontinued operations, our Q3 operating expenses were approximately $20 million better than our expectations in May, primarily due to progress in our cost reduction program associated with the LSI acquisition.","Income from operations for the quarter was $428 million, and represented 33% of net revenue. Taxes came in at $24 million for Q3, $4 million above our guidance. This was primarily due to higher income than forecast. Q3 net income was $347 million and Q3 earnings per diluted share were $1.26.","Q3 interest expense and other was $57 million, specifically interest expense related to our debt was $55 million. Our share based compensation in Q3 was $50 million. The break down of the expense for Q3 include $6 million in cost of goods sold, $20 million in R&D, $24 million in SG&A.","In Q4 2014, we anticipate share based compensation will be approximately $52 million and this includes the estimated impact of the PLX acquisition. Just as a reminder, our definition of non-GAAP net income excludes share based compensation expense.","Moving to the balance sheet, our day sales outstanding were 39 days, an improvement from the prior quarter\u2019s 42 days. Our inventory ended at $482 million, and days on hand were 79 days, which decreased 7 days from Q2. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1,277 million and generated $314 million in operational cash flow.","As a reminder, the PLX acquisition which consumer approximately $310 million in cash close after the quarter ended. We spend $95 million on capital expenditures. For Q4 we expect CapEx to be approximately $220 million, which primarily relates to spending to support our continued build out of FBAR capacity as well as Avago LSI integration activities supporting IT and a campus rationalization.","During the quarter, we did not purchase any shares. We currently expect to use some of the anticipated net proceeds from the sale of the flash and Axxia businesses, less the payment for the PLX acquisition towards paying down a portion of our outstanding term loan before the end of this calendar year.","On June 30, 2014, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.29 per ordinary share, which consumed $73 million of cash. This dividend was raised by $0.02 from the prior quarter. Since the inception of our dividend program in Q2 of 2011 to date, our financial performance has allowed us to increase our dividend each quarter.","As a reminder, our Board reviews and determines our dividend policy on a quarterly basis, based on our financial performance and other factors deemed relevant by our Board.","Now let me turn to our non-GAAP guidance for fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business condition, we do not intend to update this guidance. Our Q4 guidance includes the estimated effect of the PLX acquisition, which closed on August 12, about a week and half into our quarter. This guidance is for results from continuing operations only and does not include any contribution from the flash or Axxia businesses.","Net revenue expected to grow in the range of 18% to 22% from Q3. Gross margin is expected to be 56%, plus or minus one percentage point. Operating expenses are estimated be approximately $307 million. Taxes are forecasted to be approximately $38 million. Net interest expense and other expected to be approximately $53 million. And finally the diluted share count forecast is for 279 million shares.","I\u2019m very pleased with the speed of our businesses evolution as in a very short period we\u2019ve significantly transformed Avago increasing our scale considerably with the LSI acquisition, while also selling product lines that do not strategically fit with our long-term business model. This combined with our progress on restructuring cost synergies is driving our non-GAAP operating margins for continuing operations over 30%.","That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","Yes, good afternoon guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Hock, Tony, congratulations on the strong quarter. Hock, my first question just on the wireless business, wondering in the October guidance, if you can help us better understand, up 60% sequentially, how much of that is unit versus content? And in addition to that if you think about the content trends in the LTE market in China where are we today and where can you expect that to go over time?","Hock Tan","Wow! that\u2019s a lot of questions, but let me take the broader question which is what is content versus unit. I\u2019d say probably one per unit to the content. It\u2019s probably roughly what our overall wireless revenue represents. It\u2019s hard to really measure because it\u2019s more than just content -- it\u2019s a mix of products that also starts to shift through it all. But for purposes we\u2019re addressing it in a fairly simple direct manner probably one-third due to unit growth and two-thirds due to content is what\u2019s driving the overall expansion of the revenues.","And to answer your question, yes, it\u2019s all LTE phones. As you know LTE phones have not only to factor in more and more LTE bands roaming bands in multiple continents through multiple carriers, it\u2019s also related to the fact that it has to be backward compatible with a bunch of 3Gs and 2Gs including CDMAs. So the number of bands in every LTE smartphone increases more than linearly. I hate to use the word exponentially, but it almost feels that way. And really the more bands that use in LTE the more chances there are that FBAR and FBAR related content is required.","Not every LTE band needs an FBAR, but the more bands they\u2019re the more coexistence issues exist especially like in China, China mobile where Wi-Fi exists and LT, TD LTE band are 39, 40, 41 has issues operating with Wi-Fi that tends to bring in increased instances of usage of FBAR. So our content in China has -- content wise has gone up quite significantly as I indicated in my remarks and the trend my view is there to stay. Now that is also going on the possibility that there is cleverer ways to do it where you find ways to reduce the band by keeping the phone usage within narrower regions and so that does eliminate -- there is a countertrend to reducing some of this ones that at the expansion of content, but if we look at it broadways, longer term trend it is a trend towards increasing content.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","Hog, that\u2019s really helpful. And then as my follow-up, I believe in your prepared comments you said there were some capacity constraints in your wired business. I wonder if you can just talk more specifically exactly what those constraints were, how much that it limit revenue in the just reported quarter and does the guidance for October assume those capacity constrains have gone away?","Hock Tan","Well, it\u2019s really related to our fab for on edge-emitting lasers. A lot of edge-emitting lasers that came with our CyOptics acquisition year and half ago, and a large part of it goes into the same fab, the same product -- process line, goes into the -- goes into what I call metro networks, single mode fiber optics as well as that same production line goes to produce lasers, components for fiber to the home deployments, and as both strengthened in the last six months, our capacity just jump. As I mentioned, 4G LTE backhaul seem to have slow down somewhat, so that enables us to push more into fiber to home deployments, which is very helpful, but with still capacity constrained even as we expand our capacity gradually this quarter Q4 with still capacity constrained. That\u2019s why how much revenues, I don\u2019t want to be speculative. We don\u2019t sell it, we don\u2019t tell it.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","Great. Thanks. Congratulations again.","Hock Tan","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you for taking my question. Hock, maybe another one on wireless. When I look at the last few years, you\u2019ve always had very strong seasonal Q4s and then we have seen some modest seasonal declines in Q1 flat to down 2%, 3% or so. Now given the very sharp 60% plus growth that you\u2019re expecting in Q4, how should we think about the potential seasonal correction in Q1 or do you think that there is a possibility that growth in China could perhaps correct for any moderation at your North American customer?","Hock Tan","Well, Vivek if I could correct that image -- that picture perception slightly, you\u2019re right. Historically Q3, Q4 were our seasonally up quarters and Q1 rollover. But then what happened in the last couple of years was that has changed. The seasonally strong quarter is Q4 and Q1 maintain before it rolls over in Q2. And given that more recent trends and given what was -- what were behind the reasons behind those recent trends, compounded with continuing strength in China LTE phones, I will say, I would expect as I made in my opening remarks that our wireless strength through this Q4 will likely sustain in Q1 before rolling over in Q2.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And then maybe as a follow-up, as I look at the trajectory of operating expenses, obviously very strong performance in controlling OpEx and with all the divestitures that you\u2019ve done, when I look back prior to the LSI acquisition, I think your OpEx to sales was around 20, 21-ish percent and your Q4 guidance suggests that you\u2019re sort of already at those levels. So I\u2019m trying to put the OpEx to sales as you\u2019ve had historically in the context of more room that you have in the $200 million or so that you had outlined in terms of the cost synergies. So the other way of asking the question as how should we think about OpEx trajectory over the next few quarters? Thank you.","Tony Maslowski","So Vivek, obviously we\u2019re very pleased with the progress. But in that first bucket of what we call real savings, we still have a lot to do. There is stuff to do for the next four quarters, those as I mentioned those 1,100 people are identified, they\u2019re rolling off into these next four quarters. So there is room. So I think the other way to look at and we look at the number of the 307 that we guided to that includes approximately 10 million from PLX. So you can see we\u2019re continuing to do things quarter-over-quarter. Now as I\u2019ve always said, for the six quarters of OpEx reduction we\u2019re going to get some quick reductions in the first couple of quarters like you saw, we kind of flatten out here for the next couple of quarters and you can see it reaccelerate into Q3 and Q4. Again, offset against any standard merits or bonus increases we do in the coming year.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So is it a certain ratio Tony, that we can target or certain absolute levels as we think about lets say the back half of fiscal \u201915 and in terms of the OpEx run rate?","Tony Maslowski","No, because again then you have to -- I\u2019ve to make some guesses on revenue out that far. So I can\u2019t really do that. But again, I think you can see that we\u2019re making good progress and I would definitely not make a headline that we\u2019re done somehow. That\u2019s the key point we want to get across.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank","Hi, guys. Congrats on the strong results. Just for the question outside of wireless, specifically in your wired infrastructure as well as your industrial businesses. There\u2019s been a number of companies that have pointed to a little bit of a slowing there, and investors have been a little bit of concern about a peaking in the cycle. So, Hock I guess my question is, what are you seeing as far as the balance between supply and demand in those segments and how are you feeling cyclical?","Hock Tan","Well, they\u2019re both very different markets by the way of course. So, if I address industrial, yes you\u2019re right there is slowing down in the growth of industrial. I would say industrial as I mentioned. Last quarter, Q3 was industrial re-sale. Our revenue shipping which goes to largely in industrial to distributors, but really resale one of our distributor sale out there which we think was high single digits last quarter sequential growth industrial. And I think this quarter it will slow down to probably mid single digit is what I\u2019m indicating. So, there is a slow down. But it depends on the geography that we\u2019re looking at. I see China and Japan continuing to still be okay. But I see Europe as definitely flattening and starting to slow down -- more than flattened, starting to slow down. North American has been flat in the last three quarters and maybe there\u2019s been a slight increase now to sort of make it out, so you have a mix set of circumstances and I suspect so it depends on product one sells. Like we serve two, three industrial end markets. I\u2019ll tell you they behave very differently. In SOHO drives which is one big area in industrial consumption where we sell a lot of our products into, it\u2019s still good. And SOHO drives use remodels and all that, still good. Inverters continues to be weak, factory automation up sometimes, down sometimes mix habits and we continue to see this mixed bag. And part of SOHO being strong is related obviously to the ramp up of capacity for some of this product ramps that we are talking about in China.","Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank","Okay, great Hock, sorry this is actually Matt Diamond, I\u2019m calling on behalf of Ross who just got disconnected. I want to ask you about the pace of debt repo going forward. Could you shed a little more light on that?","Tony Maslowski","Yes. So, as we mentioned definitely through the sales and also the purchase of PLX we\u2019ll be making some debt pay down and then also from free cash flow going forward. We haven\u2019t really said -- we said it\u2019s going to be kind of in chunks, something in the $0.05 billion range when we do these pay offs and we\u2019re not committing to a quarter-over-quarter type steady pay down. I think you can see what the free cash flow of the company generates, and you can model a modest amount of that going towards the debt pay down over time.","Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank","Understood. Thanks so much.","Tony Maslowski","All right.","Ashish Saran","Can we have the next question please?","Operator","Yes. Our next question comes from Blayne Curtis from Barclays.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital","Hi, good afternoon guys and a great quarter. I was wondering if I could just go back to wireless Hock, obviously a large North American ramp, can you just talk about what you\u2019re seeing in the China LTE market? It was strong for you last quarter. Are you seeing that continuing, there has been some indications of some inventory and moderation. What do you think?","Hock Tan","No, we\u2019re continuing to see strength. Maybe our benefit is most of our demand are very, very much in LTE phones and that\u2019s the niche part of the overall China market as you well know, even though it\u2019s a fast growing niche. And that strength, that demand has been holding up very nicely. We have not seen any significant hiccups, and I\u2019d say it\u2019s not just unit\u2019s that\u2019s driving us, its content in those phones that is also helping our volume.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital","Okay, thanks. And then for Tony, on the CapEx; is this build -- is this is a onetime in October and do you go back to that more $100 million a quarter run rate and with that addition how much was FBAR capacity in October?","Tony Maslowski","Yes, I would say that well over half has to do with FBAR, first off. And as we\u2019ve always said, whenever we add FBAR capacity this capacity pays itself up fairly quickly, so you can see that the couple of $100 million quarter-over-quarter in wireless revenue that\u2019s FBAR related. And if you put in any reasonable gross margin, you can see that we\u2019re going to pay for this CapEx pretty quickly. Now whether or not this continues on this trend forever, it\u2019s doubtful. We have to get some of this FBAR capacity in place. We also had a building that we bought that was supposed to happen at the end of Q3 that pushed into Q4, it was a little under $20 million, so I think that had impact as well. But we\u2019re not giving any long-term CapEx as of yet. You\u2019ll see us do it in a smart fashion as soon as we have line of sight for opportunities.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital","Okay. Thanks guys.","Okay. Our next question comes from James Covello from Goldman Sachs.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Inc.","Hi guys, good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking the question. Terrific results, congratulations. First I guess, high level question, I think immediately after the LSI acquisition you guys had talked about kind of on a go forward basis you\u2019re seeing this being a 6% to 8% long-term growth business if I remember that correctly. Is there any update to that number given the puts and takes the product portfolio since then?","Hock Tan","Good question James. Yes, we did see 6% to 8% because we are doing the math, and that may still be right. But in the short-term as someone said before me long time, all our four cylinders are firing, and one is probably on turbo charge. So, it\u2019s probably the wrong time to ask that question. But we probably still believe it\u2019s a long-term model that is probably maybe high single digits sustainable growth.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Inc.","Terrific, that\u2019s very helpful perspective. For a follow-up, relative to the commentary on Europe industrial in particular, do you think it\u2019s a situation where customers are just kind of seeing the headlines about slower growth or some issues in some of the European areas and they\u2019re taking a more conservative approach on the inventory side or do you think that there is actual inflections in demand in some of those areas? Thank you.","Hock Tan","Thank you. Well there are multiple reasons. In Europe there is this rush in situation that\u2019s not helping very -- in many ways peculiar to Europe. Then there has been, we\u2019ve noticed that now for a while more recently last couple of quarters is exchange rates. The European -- industrial OEMs come from two locations in the world, Japan, Germany. And the German OEMs operating with the Euros have an issue on exchange rate compared to the Japanese. That\u2019s why we are seeing Japanese demand from an industrial OEM for our products sustaining whereas Europeans are flattening. I suspect both had something to do with it. One is domestic demand for us in Europe, but two is also exports related to competitiveness.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Inc.","Very helpful. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from (indiscernible) from JP Morgan.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, thank you for taking my question and solid job on the quarterly execution. Following on the prior question on the OpEx reductions; of the $80 million of lower OpEx that you delivered in Q3 relative to your prior guidance, I estimate that about $55 million of that benefit coming from the SSD and networking spend in products businesses which are now lumped into discontinued ops which means that you guys probably captured about $20 million to $25 million of true OpEx synergies, and more importantly implies that you still have another roughly $25 million of synergies to capture per quarter on a go forward basis. Is that kind of how we should think about it?","Tony Maslowski","Again as we mentioned earlier that you\u2019re correct on the first point. The reshaping of the business, that second bucket we kind of filled up nicely on an annualized basis north of $200 million. On that first one, you got to remember is that the $200 million commitment included both OpEx and some above the line as well. So, you have to take that $50 million per quarter and say some of it goes above the line. So, yes we made great progress in this first quarter. You can see in other, like I said implied progress of another $10 million approximately in Q4, and then we\u2019ll get the rest of it through the next four quarters.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it, great. And then good to see those, the growth in your enterprise storage business. As you think about your HDD segment more from a longer term perspective and given what you\u2019ve observed thus far from the LSI team\u2019s roadmaps and discussions with your HDD customers. What's the opportunity for you guys to actually gain some market share on the HDD controller side just given that your other competitor has close to 70% market share and there\u2019s probably a bias for your customers to drive a more balanced supplier mix?","Tony Maslowski","Its still early in the game, but also one thing I noticed about this business, it\u2019s very, very stable, and no room for hero\u2019s and we\u2019re not into heroics. My best answer to what you said is, no, no I think I see this business as continuing to be single digits growth and very stable its more the operating words. This is more a business of maximizing operating return from a very stable top line.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Thank you.","Tony Maslowski","Thank you.","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley.","Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley","Yes, thank you. Given the strong 60% growth expected in wireless, are you seeing anything in terms of the order environment or visibility in terms of how customers are placing orders?","Hock Tan","In wireless?","Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley","Yes.","Hock Tan","Oh, yes lead times had stretched out, and its -- in our wireless business we pretty much have entire quarters backlog on the books already. So lead time has definitely stretched out and our fab, as we\u2019ve said before and continue to say is running full. So, its -- we have a very well managed environment currently.","Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley","Got it. Okay, thanks for that. And if I could follow up on the margin front Tony, just looking at you printed almost 33% margin this quarter. The model prior to LSI was 29 to 30 and I know you\u2019re kind of on the path to exceeding that. But given the very strong margins here, how are you thinking about over the intermediate to longer term in terms of the potential top margins you can put up?","Tony Maslowski","Well, again I think give us a little more time. We want to get a couple of quarters under our belt of the two significant businesses and we\u2019ll probably do some update to our long-term model both on OpEx, operating margin sometime in the next couple of quarters. But you can see that we accomplished the north of 30, so -- but again we don\u2019t want to give you any implication that we\u2019re done with anything, and there\u2019s a lot left to do here, there\u2019s a lot left to drive out of the cost structure of the combined companies. So again, just you have to be a little patient on the long-term model update.","Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley","Will do. Thanks.","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from Joanne Feeney from ABR Investment Strategy.","Joanne Feeney - ABR Investment Strategy","Yes, thank you and congrats on the quarter and the outlook. I would like to ask a longer term question on the wireless front. You\u2019re obviously benefiting pretty strongly this year from content gains as well as unit growth. I\u2019m wondering what you see in future years. Is this sort of the last [ph] [hurrah] for significant content gains or do you have visibility towards further gains, and what sort of magnitude do you anticipate. And would those be in flagship models or just really from the spread of 4G to emerging markets?","Hock Tan","Okay, I can address it very, very simply Joanne is -- we have visibility to the next couple of generations somewhat as we are engaged in working through architectures or RF architectures on high-end LTE smartphones. And the number of bands and by extension one for one the number of filters that goes into the next generation in the one and N plus two after that, that increase in bands is exponential. It is even been getting more and more bands into each phone. And our sense of it is, within that kind of horizon that we have some obviously some sense, some visibility of not perfect visibility but definitely some especially in, as it relates to RF architectures for smart LTE handsets, the (indiscernible) 4G, 4.5G and obviously potentially beyond that, there\u2019s just more and more bands. And we see that linear expansion of demand for filters. We also see miniaturization which actually requires then all those bands to be squeezed into tighter and tighter spaces which then promotes the use more and more of creative architectures and that relates to pads, especially pads, also the requirement for not just envelop tracking which we already know is happening, but carrier aggregation which therefore pushes in more bands per phone as carriers seek to multiple bands in the same region that they have. All we\u2019ve seen so far and this is not just sticking a finger in the air and hoping for the best. What we\u2019ve seen in what engagements we\u2019re working with or with phone OEMs is that for future phones, future generation phones are going to require a substantial increase in number of bands per phone and with an increased amount of content. From our perspective as we see this current quarter, this current generation as illustrated by this current generation content is the biggest driver of growth for us and with content as you\u2019re seeing here what Tony said, it drives better and better product margin.","Joanne Feeney - ABR Investment Strategy","Great, that\u2019s really help Hock, thank you. And then, as a follow-up question on the capacity side of FBAR and FBAR related products on your competitors BAR product line you both now are adding capacity for next year. It sounds like you both have fairly constrained to meet demand this year. Have you looked at the total markets? Are you seeing any third party providers of FBAR\/BAR type filters that could compress pricing in the future and do you see the current capacity additions as in any way threatening the stability of the pricing environment for those products?","Hock Tan","Filters, and with 4G and coexistent issues and more and more bands per phone in each region, and carrier aggregation driving to the mix, its not being the commodity, not filters, rather they would be [ph] [SAW] filters -- well [ph] [SAW] filters maybe still is, but I can assure you a lot of this FBAR filters, BAW filters are not commodities because it is RF architectures that matter as much, and its whether you put in switching, whether you put in multiplexes, as we call it multiplexes is a components that puts aggregates, I won't use the word integrate but aggregate multiple FBAR filters into one chip. It\u2019s coming into play more and more. And how you architect this whole thing is just as important as the very existence of just FBAR filter fundamental performance. So, no more tricks here now, and those tricks are getting harder and harder. So we\u2019re not unduly concerned though we\u2019re paranoid about the existence of future players into this marketplace because it\u2019s more than just been able to produce an FBAR filter, its also been able to design them together in a phone.","Joanne Feeney - ABR Investment Strategy","Okay, great. Thank you very much. That\u2019s very helpful.","Operator","Okay. And our last question comes from Ian Ing from MKM Partners.","Ian Ing - MKM Partners","Yes, thanks and congrats on the strong execution. First in wired infrastructure, how should we think about Bi-directional optics from here? Are you going to expand beyond more products beyond Nexus 900 at your existing OEM or get into new OEMs and what about the competitive landscape of new entrance possibly?","Hock Tan","Yes, in terms of that question Bi-directional, yes Bi-directional is an exciting thing for us. We put it out in -- it\u2019s not new concept though execution of it, its one of the first. So we\u2019re doing it for 40G and obviously we\u2019re working on doing it for 100G, its just -- well it\u2019s a step up, but it\u2019s the same concept and that\u2019s going on and we\u2019re very excited about that but there are multiple other proprietary solutions too in this market place that we\u2019re also working on. But this is the kind of thing that we love to do in Fiber Optics.","Ian Ing - MKM Partners","Thanks. And then, what are your thoughts on the changing RF landscapes. You\u2019ve got vendors consolidating, there\u2019s more rational pricing possibly with just three players, you have got content increases. Any thoughts on perhaps more meaningfully going after more of the RF there and perhaps more sockets that you other wise wouldn\u2019t go after things like SAW and TCSAW et cetera?","Hock Tan","No, we\u2019re very good in one certain specific areas and as I mentioned many times before the business model of this company is one of being very, very differentiated with technology and basically sticking to what we\u2019re very good at. We\u2019re very good at filtering. We\u2019re very good at combining power amplifier with advance filters and making interesting results out of it be it envelop tracking, carrier aggregation or a combination of both, we\u2019re sticking to that. And I think there is enough opportunities for us especially the point I made earlier, the question from Joanne is that, we see the content for filters just continuing to increase pretty dramatically and unlike power amplifiers where you can integrate multiple bands to be supported by one single multi-mode, multi-band power amplifier, you need one filter for each band. So that increase -- that demand -- that volume increase is going to be very exciting for us over the foreseeable future.","Ian Ing - MKM Partners","Okay, thanks. So ample runway on existing FBAR strategy. Thank you.","Hock Tan","Thanks.","Ashish Saran","Thank you, operator. Thank you for participating in today's earnings call. We look forward to talking to you again when we report our fourth quarter fiscal year 2014 financial results.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen that concludes Avago\u2019s conference call for today.

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Ashish Saran, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Ashish Saran","Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are Hock Tan, President and CEO; and Tom Krause, Chief Financial Officer of Broadcom Limited. After market closed today, Broadcom distributed a press release and financial tables describing our financial performance for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. If you did not receive a copy, you may obtain the information from the Investors section of Broadcom\u2019s website at www.broadcom.com.","This conference call is being webcast live and a recording will be available via telephone playback for one-week. It will also be archived in the Investors section of our website at broadcom.com.","During the prepared comments section of this call, Hock and Tom will be providing details of our first quarter fiscal year 2018 results, guidance for our second quarter of fiscal year 2018, and some commentary regarding the business environment. We will take questions after the end of our prepared comments.","In addition to U.S. GAAP reporting, Broadcom reports certain financial measures on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the tables attached to today\u2019s press release. Comments made during today\u2019s call will primarily refer to our non-GAAP financial results.","Please refer to our press release today and our recent filings with the SEC for information on the specific risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Hock Tan. Hock?","Hock Tan","Thank you, Ashish. Good afternoon, everyone.","Well, we really had a very good start to our fiscal year 2018 with first quarter revenue and earnings towards the upper end of our guidance.","First quarter revenue of $5.33 billion grew 28% year-on-year and 10% sequentially. On the income front, earnings per share were $5.12, which grew 41% year-on-year and 12% sequentially. But, please, just don\u2019t get too excited by this as Q1 was actually a 14-week quarter and did include partial quarter contribution from Brocade, which we closed during the quarter. But, having said this, we do expect business conditions to remain favorable in our second quarter as well. Although the revenue mix by segment will be quite dramatically different.","First quarter revenue, after adjusting for Brocade contribution was all driven by wireless growth. While we expect the second quarter will be driven by double-digit growth of our other three segments, offsetting a very sharp seasonal decline in wireless. As a result, thanks to diversification, second quarter top-line continued to be very stable. ","Let\u2019s go deeper into performance by segment. Starting with wired infrastructure. In the first quarter, wired revenue was $1.88 billion, declining 10% year-on-year, 13% sequentially, and the wired segment represented 35% of our total revenue. As expected first quarter wired results reflected the bottom of the seasonal decline in demand for both our set-top box and broadband carrier access products.","The well known weakness in optical access and metro end markets impacted us as well in this quarter. But in contrast, demand was strong from datacenters, and cloud shipments remained stable.","Turning to the second quarter outlook, fiscal 2018, however, we have a different picture, as demand in this wired segment return with a vengeance. We project strong double-digit sequential revenue growth. And this growth is driven by very strong increase in demand for networking products from cloud and data centers as well as the weighted seasonal recovery in broadband carrier access. Set-top box continued to be flat.","Now, what happened in wired is in sharp contrast to wireless. In the first quarter, wireless revenue was $2.2 billion, growing 88% year-on-year and 23% sequentially. The wireless segment represented 41% of total revenue. First quarter 2018 wireless revenue growth was driven by the ramp of the next generation platform from a large North American smartphone customer. As you may recall, this ramp was pushed out into the first quarter from the fourth quarter as compared to prior years. This push-out coupled with a very large increase in our content in this new platform, drove the substantial year-on-year growth in revenue in the first quarter.","But, as we look into the second quarter of fiscal \u201818, we expect -- we are expecting a much larger than typical seasonal decline in wireless revenue as shipments to our North American smartphone customer will trend down sharply from the exaggerated first quarter. We expect to partially offset this decline from an increase in our product shipments to support the ramp of next generation flagship phone at a large Korean smartphone customer. This phone also comes with an increase in Broadcom\u2019s wireless content on both our RF and Wi-Fi\/Bluetooth combo products. Notwithstanding such volatile seasonal -- seasonality, I should note that year-on-year revenue growth for Q2 in this segment will still be in the double digits.","Turning to enterprise storage. In the first quarter of 2018, enterprise storage revenue was $991 million and included approximately $330 million in partial quarter contribution from the recently acquired Brocade Fibre Channel switch business. As reported, enterprise storage segment revenue grew 40% year-on-year and 54% sequentially. Without Blockade contribution, however, first quarter enterprise storage revenue would have resulted in flat but still stable performance sequentially. Storage segment represented 19% of our total revenue for the first quarter.","Now, the Blockade revenue in the quarter was actually higher than our prior expectation of $250 million, and this has been driven by stronger than expected demand of Fibre Channel SAN switches.","Our server and storage connectivity products also had a strong quarter with substantial increase in revenue driven by a ramp in Purley generation server shipments and this growth though was partially offset by a decline in our hard drive -- hard disk drive business as demand bottomed out during the quarter.","Into the second quarter of fiscal \u201818, the contract here we expect to see is strong double-digit sequential growth in revenue in enterprise storage, driven by robust demand from both enterprise and datacenters.","Finally, industrial, first quarter, industrial segment revenue was $251 million and represented 5% of total revenue. Industrial product revenue remained very robust, grew by over 20% year-on-year, resales also grew by 20% year-on-year and trended up 7% sequentially.","Looking into the second quarter. We expect strong double-digit sequential growth in industrial product revenue and we continue to expect resale to trend up by the same amount.","In summary, therefore, for the first quarter, as we expected, we delivered very strong financial results and completed acquisition of Brocade during that period. Our second quarter fiscal 2018 revenue outlook reflects the benefit of a very well-diversified product portfolio. We expect to fully offset the impact of a much higher than normal seasonal decline in wireless revenue with strong increases in our wired, storage and industrial segments. As a result, we expect second quarter revenue to be sequentially flat at $5 billion on a normalized 13-week basis for the quarter. However, the change in product mix will have a dramatic impact on second quarter gross margin, which we expect to sequentially expand by 100 to 150 basis points.","Tom will provide more color during his earnings guidance commentary on the impact this will have on our Q2 profitability.","With that, let me turn the call over to Tom for more detailed review.","Tom Krause","Thank you, Hock, and good afternoon, everyone.","My comments today will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results from continuing operations unless otherwise specifically noted. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP data is included in the earnings release issued today and is also available on our website at www.broadcom.com.","Let me quickly summarize the results for the first quarter of fiscal \u201818 focusing primarily on balance sheet and cash flow items.","We delivered strong financial results for the first quarter, starting with revenue of $5.33 billion which was at the upper end of guidance. Our first quarter gross margin from continuing operations was 64.8%, 80 basis points above the midpoint of guidance as we benefited from a more favorable product mix in the quarter, driven by higher than expected revenue from the Brocade fiber channel SAN switches.","Operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $2.6 billion and represented 48.2% of net revenue. EBITDA from continuing operations for the quarter was approximately $2.7 billion and represented 50.6% of net revenue.","Our day sales outstanding are running on target at 45 days, a one day decrease from the prior quarter. Our inventory at the end of the first quarter was $1.3 billion, a decrease of a $156 million from the prior quarter as we depleted wireless inventory we had built up to support the large ramp in first quarter shipments. We are pleased with this level of inventory going into the second quarter.","We generated $1.7 billion in operational cash flow, which reflected the impact in the first quarter of approximately $460 million in payments of annual employee bonuses for fiscal year \u201817, $240 million of cash expended primarily on Brocade restructuring acquisition related activities, and an additional $129 million payment to fund the legacy pension plan. Capital expenditure in the first quarter was $220 million or 4.1% of net revenue.","Now, let me turn to free cash flow which we define as operating cash flow less CapEx. Free cash flow in the first quarter was $1.5 billion or 27.5% of net revenue and reflects the impact of the items I just mentioned, including the annual bonus payout, restructuring and pension contribution. Without those items, I\u2019d just note, free cash flow as a percent of net revenue would have been 43%. As a housekeeping matter, I\u2019d also note that CapEx was $94 million higher than depreciation in the quarter. We expect CapEx to continue to trend down and approach our long-term target of 3% of net revenue in the second half of fiscal \u201818.","We also continue to make significant progress in increasing our free cash flow per share. We calculate this metric as a free cash flow divided by the sum of our outstanding ordinary shares and limited partnership or LP Units.","For the first quarter of fiscal \u201818, free cash flow per share was $3.39, based on 410 million outstanding ordinary shares and 22 million LP Units. More importantly, on a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow per share for the period ended Q1 \u201818 was $13.79, an increase of 71% compared to the trailing 12-month period ended Q1 \u201817.","Now, let me turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the second quarter of fiscal year \u201818. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions and we do not intend to update this guidance. This guidance is for results from continuing operations only.","Net revenue is expected to be $5 billion, plus or minus $75 million. Gross margin is expected to be 66%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. Operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $890 million. Tax provision is forecasted to be approximately $103 million. Net interest expense and other is expected to be approximately $114 million. The diluted share count forecast is for 461 million shares. Share-based compensation expense will be approximately $305 million. CapEx will be approximately $190 million.","Our second quarter gross margin guidance anticipates a very favorable revenue mix, driven by strong high-margin networking and enterprise storage product sales and a more than seasonal decline in relatively lower margin wireless product sales. Our guidance for second quarter operating expenses includes a full quarter of Brocade expenses and anticipates our typical increase in employee payroll taxes from the annual vesting of RSUs in the quarter.","Please note that after we complete read [ph] on affiliations in United States, we presently expect our effective cash tax rate to be approximately 10%. We expect to start reflecting this new rate in our non-GAAP results starting with the third fiscal quarter of 2018.","In the second quarter, we are anticipating very healthy free cash flow and expect to deliver results above our target model of 40% of revenue.","Before we open the call for questions, I would like to briefly address this week\u2019s events. Yesterday, we announced that we have withdrawn and terminated our offer to acquire Qualcomm. We\u2019ve also withdrawn our slate of independent director nominees for Qualcomm\u2019s 2018 annual meeting of stockholders. Although we are disappointed with this outcome, we will comply with the order issued on Monday March 12, 2018 regarding the proposed transaction. Importantly, we sincerely appreciate the overwhelming supports we received from Qualcomm and Broadcom stockholders throughout these past few months.","Indeed, I have to say, we are touched by the ISS report issued just last night that continues to recommend the Broadcom independent nominees and by our understanding that based on the vote tally as of today, the 11 Qualcomm nominees are only garnering between 15% to 16% of the outstanding shares, not necessarily something to celebrate down in San Diego.","In any event, back to Broadcom. Consistent with our announcement in November to redomicile the Company, we continue to believe the U.S. represents the best location from which to pursue our strategy going forward and we don\u2019t see this week\u2019s events putting any constraints on our ability to pursue acquisitions more broadly going forward. To that end, we also announced that we continue to move forward with our redomiciliation to the U.S. and now expect to complete this process after the close of the market on April 4th. This timing will allow us to hold our annual meeting of shareholders on April 4th as presently scheduled. Our special meeting for stockholders to vote on the redominciliation will still be held on March 23rd.","So, with this, we know many of you are asking what\u2019s next. Hock and I have had the last couple of days to reflect on this. First and most importantly, we remain focused on delivering superior return for our shareholders. Broadcom benefits from a long history of technology innovation, engineering excellence and product leadership across our 20 franchise businesses. We believe this will allow us to sustain mid single digit revenue growth and increasing operating and free cash flow margins. To reflect our confidence in sustainability of the current business, we will continue targeting aggregate dividends of approximately 50% of free cash flow. This should afford us the opportunity to provide material dividend increases in the future.","The allocation of the remaining 50% of free cash flow is governed by the returns we believe that we can drive via acquisitions versus buying AVGO stock and\/or paying down debt. As you all know, Hock and I are quite familiar with the industry landscape. And sitting here today, we do see potential targets that are consistent with our proven business model and that also can drive returns well in excess of what we would otherwise achieve buying our own stock and\/or paying down debt.","If this view changes, rest assured, we will not hesitate to change our approach. Providing superior returns for shareholders has been and always will be our focus.","One final point I want to make. Qualcomm was clearly a unique and very large acquisition opportunity. Given the maturity of the industry, the consolidation it has seen and our relative size now, our future acquisitions are much more likely to be funded with cash available on our balance sheet and without the need to flex the balance sheet much beyond our current financial policy of 2 times net leverage.","I would like to remind you that the purpose of today\u2019s call is to discuss our quarterly earnings. Consistent with our previous call, please keep your questions focused on today\u2019s financial results. We will not be commenting in Q&A on this week\u2019s events.","That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Craig Hettenbach, Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Craig Hettenbach","Yes, thank you. Hock, can you talk about the strong rebound expected in the wired segment? I know, you mentioned datacenter continues to be strong. Also, anything around kind of traditional enterprise, we are seeing some rebound in enterprise IT spending, and how much of that helps the segment a bit?","Hock Tan","We\u2019ve seen strength and we saw it obviously in bookings in Q1 for shipments in Q2. And we saw very large -- very -- a lot of strength in both enterprise as well as cloud datacenters in both respects. It\u2019s just strong. And it\u2019s strong across full range of our networking products that I commented on. We also saw strong bookings which will translate into revenues obviously in Q2, very strong revenue recovery in our broadband carrier access, which basically reflects DSL, digital subscriber line, PON, and attach enterprise and carrier Wi-Fi. And that\u2019s typically seasonality and it came back very, very strongly.","What we don\u2019t see a sharp recovery is obviously fiber optics in networking, though fiber optics out of datacenters continued to be there -- not continued but has shown renewed strength. So, basically datacenter cloud that are showing -- enterprise showing a lot of strength to offset what I call, metro networks and in our case, still continued flatness in set-top box.","Craig Hettenbach","Got it, thanks for all the color there. And then, just a quick follow-up for Tom just on Brocade, the integration, just now that you have the business, kind of how you see it performing? And then, anything we should aware of just from a margin perspective and as you take some cost out?","Tom Krause","Yes. We\u2019ve been really pleased with Brocade. Obviously that\u2019s something that\u2019s been in the works for some time. And the business we were targeting there was the SAN switching business. It\u2019s continued to sustain as we had envisioned throughout not only close [ph] period but obviously as a very good start as part of Broadcom, going forward. Clearly, it\u2019s a unique asset from a financial standpoint as well, Craig, it\u2019s margin accretive to the Company. We see that continue to contribute positively to earnings and free cash flow. And frankly sort echo some of the comments I said in the prepared remarks, really reflects the kind of transactions we\u2019re looking to target going forward.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Ross Seymore","Hock, I just want to talk about the wireless business. I think, everybody is pretty up-to-date on why the volatility both to the upside and then to the downside in the April quarter, given what\u2019s your largest customer is doing. I want to think a little bit longer term. As we think about the rest of this year and next year, can you talk about what you see from a content perspective across the two components of your wireless business as well as from a market share perspective? ","Hock Tan","Well, a good point. I guess, let\u2019s talk about content. And as I\u2019ve articulated before, earlier, in previous call and that view hasn\u2019t changed. On the sustained basis, I\u2019ll put it over the next five years, in a multiple sockets we have been, which as you know represents both RF frontend, Wi-Financial\/Bluetooth combo chips in wireless connectivity, and touch, basically touch, phone touch and to some extent wireless charging as well. Combined all together, we have those many sockets on a sustained basis over the next I\u2019ll put three years, possibly five years. We see that content sustaining growth in the teens, double digits. This has been the way it was for the last five years and the trend towards increased content whether it\u2019s 4G, 4.5G or 5G, we do not see that changing.","Ross Seymore","How about on share side of things. ","Hock Tan","Okay. On the share side, I mean, I\u2019d say this way. We have positioned the business we are in and it\u2019s not just wireless, by the way, no differently in wired, enterprise storage and industrial, the core businesses, we call them franchises that we are in, all 20 of them product lines. We picked them in product line franchises to be businesses that we are very clearly out there in the lead. Technology and market share and where we continue to invest a lot of money for further innovation for progressing technology. The bottom-line to what I\u2019m trying to get at is, in those businesses, what we worry about or what we have left to worry about are really ankle-biters. And to be honest ankle-biters\u2019 biggest problem, they cannot bite above the ankle.","Ross Seymore","Okay. And I guess as my follow-up question, one for you, Tom. You made it pretty clear about it the use of cash flow on the dividend side, the 50-50 split. But your commentary about what you may do with the other 50%, give a little more detail than we\u2019ve heard in the past, and you\u2019ve included the phrase about paying down debt and share repurchases. Was that meant to be something that those are increased probability or are you just stating the obvious as far as potential uses of the other 50%?","Tom Krause","I think, Ross, what it\u2019s trying to reinforce is that Hock and I are focused on doing what\u2019s in the best interest of shareholders. And we\u2019ve had the opportunity to reflect after this week\u2019s event on obviously the go forward capital allocation strategy. And we feel, looking at the landscape that the strategy we\u2019ve had in place here for quite some time remains the value to drive these returns. And I think we want to maintain that we continue to be very focused on shareholder returns. And if that strategy no longer presents this type of returns, then we will focus elsewhere.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your line is now open. ","Stacy Rasgon","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, given the gross margin upside in Q2 on the heavy mix shift of the businesses, how should we be thinking about the drivers of gross margin into the second half of the year? And given that the mix shift that we\u2019re seeing into Q2, maybe different as we move through the rest of the year, how\u2026","Tom Krause","I will take it. Look, I think, there\u2019s a couple of things going on, both there\u2019s short-term and there\u2019s longer. Let me comment on both. Short-term, when you look at the seasonality in the business over the fiscal year, obviously, the second half of the year is typically more wireless-weighted. Wireless, as everyone knows, tends to carry slightly lower than corporate gross margin. So, I think, I wouldn\u2019t get too excited in terms of where gross margins go from here through the end of this fiscal year. However, that being said, as you look longer term, consistent with the business model, how it\u2019s been driving last 11 years, we continue to see content gains. We continue to have very good product leadership across the 20 franchise businesses. We\u2019ve added Brocade which is margin accretive. So, we don\u2019t see any reason, as I said in the prepared remarks, that as we sustain mid single digit revenue growth, you\u2019re not going to see leverage, not only from an operating and free cash flow perspective but a lot of that\u2019s going to get driven by gross margin expansion. We don\u2019t see any reason that that can\u2019t continue.","Hock Tan","And we have articulated in prior calls as far as a couple of years ago that this business model we have put in place is one that on an annualized basis, take it, as something longer term, we tend to drive gross margin expansion around 100 basis points each year, maybe plus-minus 25 basis points. But year by year, if you look back several years, we\u2019ve grown gross margin or we have expanded gross margin around 100 basis points. And we believe that trend still continues.","Stacy Rasgon","So, my follow-up question, I just wanted to ask about sustainability of the storage. So, we\u2019re seeing some upside, you admitted Brocade was little stronger than you had expected. And I think you\u2019ve talked about this business like longer term, just given the drivers of the different segments maybe flattish. But in reality, it\u2019s quite volatile. We have years where it\u2019s very strong and years where it\u2019s very weak. I know last year when we were seeing the strength in storage, you kind of warned us not to get too excited about the sustainability of that. How should we be thinking about the sustainability of that growth? And frankly, even in your other non-wireless segments, as we\u2019re seeing that strong double digit growth into Q2, how should we think about sustainability of that versus your long-term organic growth target?","Tom Krause","Yes. So, I think you\u2019ve got to unpack it a little bit right there. So, in the enterprise storage, we\u2019ve got obviously the LSI businesses, the SaaS connectivity business which is an absolute franchise. It is going to move from a cyclical standpoint with the Intel server platform releases. Obviously, we\u2019re in with Purley we had very good leadership position with the new products in that area, and so that business is doing well and we expect that can do well this fiscal year. Contrast that with HDD; obviously HDD we think is in slightly structural decline. We also have very good leadership position with those product lines. And so, there has been more volatility than probably Hock and I would have anticipated in that business over the last several years. And I wouldn\u2019t think that would change frankly going forward, as you look out. And then beyond that Brocade, frankly, Blockade is probably the one that\u2019s the most stable in our view. Of course, we\u2019ve owned it shortest period of time, but as you look forward and that\u2019s a business that we think can sustain at the levels that we saw on a full run-rate basis in the first quarter. So, we think when you put all that together, I\u2019d echo kind of where I think you\u2019re going, which is, this is kind of a low single digit type growth rate segment as occurring report?","Hock Tan","And to add to that. The last few years -- what Tom is saying is the only volatile part of it is the hard disk drive business. And that\u2019s relative -- for years, it has [indiscernible] whole enterprise storage business we see there, [ph] components are very, very stable, grow low-single digit, nothing exciting but very, very predictable and stable. What happened probably a year or two ago, was Flash coming in the picture and stoppages and creating impact. To the extent, it creates impact which is on the consumer prime side of hard disk drive and that creates some level of impact. Beyond, as client goes down -- as the portion of the hard disk drive market and the datacenter part of the business expands what we called near line, you will see that volatility start to go away to. And what you will end up with then, our enterprise storage business has an extremely stable business, single-digit growth if at all but extremely profitable.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","John Pitzer","Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on the strong results. Hock, my first question goes back to the wired segment in the January quarter. And this might be kind of a move point just given how strong your April guidance has been. But, I\u2019m still trying to figure out that business being down 10% year-on-year, you characterize it as sort of a seasonal low. But I\u2019d assume year-over-year compare would touch that. And you did have the extra week this quarter that you didn\u2019t have last quarter. So, I guess I\u2019m just trying to figure out what -- you mentioned a bunch of factors in your prepared comments, and trying to figure out what was the most significant factor. And as you think about the long-term growth in this business, to the extent that you have a 5% growth rate for the overall business, how does this business fit in? Because arguably with your exposure to datacenter and cloud, this is probably the business that investors are willing to pay the highest multiple on. But, it\u2019s one that\u2019s over the last several quarters has actually been growing much slower than the other businesses. And I know, there\u2019s a lot of different businesses inside of wired. But how would you think about the long-term growth rate and the moving parts on that?","Hock Tan","Right. That\u2019s the best part of the question. But to try and answer your technical part, which is what the hell happened in Q1 and all that. First, if you compare year-on-year. If you compare year-on-year, which was Q1 a year ago, don\u2019t forget what we did a year ago, there were some exceptional items in a year ago. What we did as part of the integration of classic Broadcom to Avago is where to dispose of certain assets. And as part of that, we sold manufacturing rights, which we articulated at that time when we announced the earnings to certain companies out there as part of the disposal process on overlapping products in the integration. And that checked down the revenue artificial one-time a year ago. So, we had that little compare to hit. And the amount there wasn\u2019t small. It was over $60 million, $70 million, small by total standards of $2 billion but nonetheless it\u2019s just a percentage and you worry about the 10%. So that\u2019s one thing I wanted to add on.","But on Q1, to address your question on it, our wired infrastructure -- our wired business is really two parts when you look at it. One is data center, very much data center enterprise business, which is networking and that\u2019s about just almost -- it\u2019s roughly half. And you have the other half, which is small carrier related, operator -- service provider related, which is really the set-top business that carrier access business and a part of our optics business, optical transceiver business, just as a part of optical transceiver and datacenters. And it\u2019s very interesting that the enterprise and datacenter business which was holding up in January quarter, but the other side was all down, all down, including optical that relates to fiber-to-the-home to networks and operators, especially in China and as well as carrier access, seasonally down, set-top box seasonally down quarter. So, we have one side being dramatically down, one side holding up.","Then comes April, and we see the part that\u2019s down a lot, starts to recover quite strongly, especially in carrier access, operator, [ph] the fiber optics in China on networks and set-box have not, but that part of it popped. [Ph] What we really start to see is also the other -- the half of the business in datacenter enterprise took on huge strength. A big part of it is some of the -- we start to ramp on some certain new products. I don\u2019t want to get into specific, you probably know that they are networking and they are in AI especially as well as various other programs all related to cloud and enterprise been very strong. And that\u2019s what drove this April strength. And that\u2019s the kind of the whole story.","John Pitzer","That\u2019s helpful, Hock. And then, Tom maybe as my follow-up, I think, I understand the OpEx guidance going into the April quarter relative to period cost that come in on the payroll and Brocade. But I\u2019m just kind of curious, given that you\u2019re going from a 14-week to a 13-week, how is that impacting sequential OpEx? I would have thought just having one less extra week would have helped you on the OpEx front. And how do we think about OpEx trending from April on to the second half of the year?","Tom Krause","Yes. It\u2019s a good question. Look, we -- there is a lot of things going on. You\u2019ve got the payroll uptick because of RSUs which is material. You\u2019ve got Brocade transition costs, which we have the benefit of having a longer time between sign and close. So, we\u2019re very much actually past day two [ph] now and are on way to being fully integrated. So that should come off and bring numbers down. So, as we look at the second half of the year, look, I would be thinking, you\u2019re not going to see OpEx go up anymore, probably there is trend down slightly. But we\u2019re running at or about these levels when you exclude the Brocade transition expenses.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Vivek Gupta","Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the continued strong execution. For the first one, Hock, I just wanted to go back to the prior line of question around wired segment, but maybe from a longer term perspective, if you just set aside the seasonal aspects. What is the right way to think about a two to three-year growth rate for the wired business? You obviously have the strength in your cloud switching and AI businesses. But, is set-top-box going to be a headwind longer term, just conceptually, do you think your wired business sort of grows in line above or below your overall company 5% growth rate?","Hock Tan","That is the one that will grow around 5%. And it\u2019s because -- I didn\u2019t finish the previous question totally, I do apologize, but to answer the question on that, when you look at our wired business, it has two parts. One is enterprise datacenters, which includes the switching -- basically a lot of it is a switching, the controllers, routing, even part of routing, and even fiber optic that go to datacenters. That area we have been seeing is growing very, very fast.","Now, occasional hiatus, flattening out, not going down but flattening out is happening generally as I indicated, even though demand continued to be good. But it keeps grow, and grows I would say close to probably on a year-on-year basis probably close to 10%. Then, we have the other side of business, which is more related to network service providers. And those are more volatile, more seasonal. But if you take it on an annualized basis, I would say, it\u2019s practically flat. And that\u2019s why I say on an average let\u2019s say mid single digits, when you average out on a annual basis over a five-year period that it\u2019d be running at that rate. It\u2019s very strong enterprise and cloud products or -- enterprise and cloud and there continues be a lot of innovation in that area, which are right in the cycle, which we drive inside a lot of it, which includes new applications, new ways to optimize datacenters and cloud, less so in enterprise but definitely in cloud. And associated with it fiber optics that ties to cloud computing, and against that a more traditional but nonetheless very, very stable and sticky service provider wired business in the video delivery, set-top box, OTT as well and carrier access, which gateways, both on -- gateways especially for carriers. So, it\u2019s a mix of the two and the dynamics of the two but it\u2019s very clear that big part of the half is growing very fast relatively speaking and the other half doesn\u2019t grow.","Vivek Gupta","Got it. And for my follow-up, I appreciate that you want to talk about the earnings but acquisitions have been a key part of your strategy longer term. And if I look at most of your targets, they have been sort of digital and logic companies. Are you open to also looking outside at perhaps analog or microcontroller assets? So, without being specific about the targets, are there any frozen comps you can think of looking at analog versus digital assets in the future?","Tom Krause","Well, obviously, we don\u2019t want to get into the specifics. And I think what I would say is we\u2019re open to anything that helps. One, it is consistent with our business model; two, it helps us drive the kind of returns well in excess of alternatives. So, we have obviously shown openness. We obviously did Brocade, which is more of an appliance systems business but very consistent with our strategy and will remain that way going forward. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Amit Daryanani","I guess two questions for me as well. On the wireless side, Hock, I think you talked about mid teens content growth and not too worried about competition there. I am wondering, do you think pricing dynamics could be different in the industry as you go forward because two of your largest players, still the biggest players in the industry are really struggling to I would say drive unit growth at this point. So, do you think pricing could be different as you go forward in this industry versus what you are seeing?","Hock Tan","Well, you look at the phone dynamics, actually at the high end, smart flagship status, and if you take the key assumption which we do subscribe to, that flagship status remains and continues. To remain in a flagship status, those phone makers, particular phone makers have to innovate, have to offer features that continue to push their envelope. They are probably more mindful as they will be for cost, overall cost. But a lot of our components are not gimmicks, realize. They are like basic fundamentals to a phone working in various bandwidths. To give you an example of 5G. 5G adds on a lot more spectral bandwidth, which means you did more content. Just simple basic fundamental says that going to 5G means, you find new spectrum bandwidth to operate in an every spectrum you find, you need more components in that direction. You need more bandwidth in wireless connectivity; you push in that direction too. So yes there will be.","Now not necessarily every place points this. Touch screen, people might be cheaper and not push it much into it, we understand that. So that\u2019s a mix of both, which is why I say on a long-term five-year trend, the fundamental feature requirements will be let\u2019s drive growth because you are running with more of higher -- more requirements in terms of performance, even it\u2019s as basic as operating in more spectral bandwidth as you go from 4G to 5G and on and on. And that alone by itself will drive if you continue [ph] that low at least low double digit in content. That\u2019s all getting around it.","Amit Daryanani","Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. And I guess, Tom, if I could follow up with you, you guys have been 43%, 44% net income margins today. I think, your free cash flow margins are about 1,600 basis points or so below that number. Structurally, at what point do you see these two things converging? And ideally, I would hope free cash flow margins improve, not the other your answer. When do you see that happens, when do you see these one off things abating away for you guys?","Tom Krause","Well, I think it\u2019s happening. I mean that was the point of spelling it out for Q2. I mean, in Q1, you do have something that happens every year, which is we pay out our annual performance bonuses and hopefully we\u2019ll be able to continue to payout the bonuses we\u2019ve been paying out over the past many years, going forward. So, I\u2019d expect that. But beyond that, the onetime items around the Brocade acquisition and the restructuring activities there as well as paying down the -- actually one last legacy pensions we have where there is a liability, those are onetime items. So, if you took those away, we\u2019re already running well above 40%, which is actually very much in line with non-GAAP net income. So, we feel pretty good we\u2019re already seeing that convergence especially as you look into Q2.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Your line is now open. ","Harlan Sur","Yes. Thank you for taking my question and great to see the diversification in the business playing out. You guys -- Hock, you provided a longer term view on wired. Kind of more near term, looks like the double digit quarter-on-quarter growth in April is going to take you guys back to year-over-year growth. Given the trend that you\u2019re seeing, strong datacenter and cloud, you\u2019re ramping several new big ASIC programs, hopefully, kind of normal seasonal trends in broadband through the end of the year; second half you\u2019ll be ramping Tomahawk 3, Jericho 2 but maybe still some headwinds on service provider. Net-net, do you expect full year fiscal \u201818 that your wired business is going to grow?","Hock Tan","Yes, for sure. Our fiscal \u201818 compared to fiscal \u201817, we see our wireless business growing, and we articulated that out mid-single digits; there is quarterly ups, quarterly downs that all taken think on an annual basis. It\u2019s just the trend from enterprise but more than that datacenters, switching from the cloud and pushing very hard for a lot more silicon products in those datacenters. Bandwidth, they need more bandwidth, they need setup pipes, [ph] they need offloading, which means chips, controller chips that are getting very smart. And I think that do things beyond what a standard CUP would do. Again, all these opportunities take -- that drive this silicon growth in this area. Bandwidth alone is driving us to keep coming up with newer and newer generation, faster and faster by the way.","Harlan Sur","Great. Thanks for the insights there. And then, the strength in the ASIC business has been highlighted over the past few calls. Switching, routing, AI, deep learning, these are big complex digital chips. But, you also have a pretty strong ASIC franchise in mixed signal analog ASICs, things like human interface, the touch, 3D sensing, wireless power, power management. I hear that you guys\u2019 forward design win pipeline in this segment continues to be quite strong. Can you just talk about the differentiators that the team brings to the table here in mix signal, analog ASICs that is keeping the pipeline pretty strong?","Hock Tan","The goal is -- yes, our mix signal thing or you call it the analog thing and the digital is, we have one of the strongest I call it analog team in terms of DSP and converting analog with real world signals to digital in order for us to do organic stuff, faithfully ADC, analog to digital converters, which is one of our key strengths. So, we don\u2019t publicize it very much because that\u2019s what we do. We have people see us as a very strong digital company but you can\u2019t just do digital alone. What we have is actually one of the strongest analog to digital conversion capability in the world. And that has enabled us to do a lot of things very well in many ways from the public eye. We can do a digital frontend ADC for even things like base stations as an example. And we do it for human interface as part of our capability and we do it for coherent receivers in DSP -- on a DSP basis. We have a strong capability of people who, best way to describe it, virtually walk on water from the view point of many of our customers.","And that has enabled us to keep getting the strong backlog of programs that we are actively engaged in, in the various core business franchises we\u2019re in. This doesn\u2019t deviate us from our core franchises actually, I\u2019d just say that. It just enables us to drive those core franchises deeper and deeper into performance whether it be next generation technology, whether it\u2019s driving 100 gigabit per second studies or driving ADCs that push the boundaries of where -- spend on product, technology, driving products and touch screen controllers and various other things. So, we see that as very useful to capability towards continuing to sustain our leadership in those various core franchises we are in.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research. Your line is now open.","Edward Snyder","Hock, the comment you just made here was actually in line with what I was going to ask you about your core franchises. You\u2019ve got these franchises; you\u2019ve been articulate about where you are going to go, where you don\u2019t go. But there seems to be this other area, the custom ASIC area, you did routers for Cisco few years ago and then you\u2019ve got into AI. And then one of your largest customers, when you got Broadcom, you obviously moved into connectivity. But you also jumped into areas that would be considered unnormal for Broadcom a while ago like wireless charging which market itself is really way below where your margin profile is. But you\u2019ve done really good job of that. So I know it\u2019s not a franchise but isn\u2019t it the case that your custom ASIC is becoming kind of a franchise onto itself with the select groups of customers where you can go in and do things they can\u2019t do and offer service. If that\u2019s the case, what are the boundaries terms of what you can and can\u2019t do in that kind of franchise? Thanks. ","Hock Tan","That\u2019s very, very insightful and perceptive question. You\u2019re right. We have something to see there and we\u2019re very careful. But we have been asked by -- I mean some of it, of course we take [ph] it out ourselves. But in some cases, certain customers who meet technology that pushes envelope like speeds of -- the accuracy and speeds of ADCs for instance. We\u2019ve been asked by certain customers into areas beyond what we\u2019ve touched on. And I also mentioned that on the ADC, on the front end of the base stations as an example where we\u2019ve been told by customers to design a CMOS [ph] silicon, what used to take non-CMOS processes to do and be able to achieve the same performance with much lower power and potential integration possibility. All that comes in. And you\u2019re right, we don\u2019t know where the limits are but we\u2019re very careful that we do not expand resources in the wrong manner back to ROI. Every dollar or every resource we put into a program, we are very conservative, very reserved [ph] you may say about ensuring we get a very good ROI. And that comes in making sure customers put skin in the game together with us when they ask us to do programs where we are expected to as I could say walk on water. We want to make sure that we get a high probability of the good ROI in doing that. But it goes to enhance our overall business model of franchises in the various end markets we are very, very good at.","Edward Snyder","So, it is safe to say in that kind of a context, because the feedback we\u2019ve gotten was that I believe it does sound like you guys do exceptional job in terms of delivering on time and performance that could get. But at least it will puzzle then, because I would have never expected you to get in the some areas that you\u2019ve moved into like wireless charging for example, much more analog, much more low margin. Is it the case that once you start engaging with these customers, like the internal custom ASIC group that they\u2019ll start throwing problems to say can you do this, and so it opens up a mind or much wider swap of technologies that you could go into, if the agreement is cash correctly, so that we maybe see you do stuff that maybe a bit more uncharacteristic to be having custom ASIC group?","Hock Tan","Again very insightful and we see that. And I\u2019d just say we\u2019re very disciplined, extremely disciplined just by the way we do our acquisitions, recent example et cetera, just kidding. But typically, we are very, very disciplined. And here in the use of resources in developing a program that is outside what we consider to be franchise areas, call areas, we will be very, very careful; very, very disciplined. We don\u2019t take everything thrown in our direction.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes Broadcom\u2019s conference call for today.

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Tom Krause, Vice President of Corporate Development. Please go ahead, sir.","Thomas Krause","Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are Hock Tan, President and CEO; and Tony Maslowski, Chief Financial Officer of Avago Technologies. After the market closed today, Avago distributed a press release and financial tables describing our financial performance for the fourth quarter fiscal year 2013. If you did not receive a copy, you may obtain the information from the Investors section of Avago's website at avagotech.com. This conference call is being webcast live, and a recording will be available via telephone playback for one week. It will also be archived in the Investors section of our website.","During the prepared comments section of this call, Hock and Tony will be providing details of our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2013 results, background to our 2014 outlook and some commentary regarding the business environment. We will take questions after the end of our prepared comments.","In addition to U.S. GAAP reporting, Avago reports certain financial measures on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the tables attached to today's press release. Comments made during today's call will primarily refer to our non-GAAP financial results. Please refer to our press release today and our recent filings with the SEC for information on the specific risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Hock Tan. Hock?","Hock E. Tan","Thank you, Tom. Good afternoon, everyone. We're going to start today by reviewing our market business highlights, and then Tony will provide a summary of fourth quarter and fiscal 2013 financial results.","Revenue from our fourth quarter fiscal year was $738 million, represented an increase of 15% from last quarter and an increase of 19% from the same quarter a year ago. Sequential increase was at the upper end of our guidance, which was 12% to 15% growth. To perhaps provide you with some further comparability to last quarter in which CyOptics only contributed about 5 weeks of revenues, our total non-CyOptics revenue grew 8% from last quarter.","During Q4, wireless was very strong, driven by major product ramps and our large smartphone OEM customers. Wired infrastructure was up 22% sequentially, primarily due to a full quarter of revenue contribution from CyOptics. These more than offset the weaker-than-expected industrial revenue, which ended up with a sequential decline of 4%. Let me now provide more color in each of our target markets, starting with wireless.","Revenue from wireless came in above expectation, growing 19% sequentially and represented 47% of our total revenues. Sequential strength was driven primarily by strong product ramps, as I mentioned earlier, and our 2 largest OEM customers. As you may have seen from the independent third-party teardowns, our content in both of these platforms improved substantially compared to prior generations. As a result of the proliferation of LTE today and the challenges in RF designs, our proprietary FBAR filter and integrated front-end module have proliferated in many smartphones. We see this trend continuing to drive our wireless business over the next few generations.","Now looking into Q1 of fiscal 2014. We expect strong demand from our 2 major smartphone OEM customers to sustain and be only partially offset by the seasonal weakness at other OEMs. As a result, we expect overall wireless revenue to be flat, perhaps maybe even slightly down in Q1.","Moving on to wired infrastructures. Wired revenue, as I mentioned, grew 22% sequentially, represented 33% of overall revenues. Our non-CyOptics wired revenue was up single digits after a pronounced 18% sequential growth in Q3. Data center-related demand continues to be strong, particularly for our 40-gigabit-per-second fiber optical products. However, our ASIC service business paused temporarily after a record high during Q3 due primarily from inventory adjustment with major OEMs. Meanwhile, demand for CyOptics Indium Phosphide based optical components was strong due to an uptick in 100G coherent telecom networks and 40G single-mode long reach interconnects in large data centers.","Looking forward to Q1, however, we expect that sustained strength in data center spending in 40G will be partially offset by a pause in carrier routing spending in China. In this Q1 also, we begin to convert the low margin module revenue in China to relate to the high-margin component sales as part of our transformation of the CyOptics business model out of the telecoms in our module infrastructure. Accordingly, we anticipate wired infrastructure revenue to decline mid-single digits on a percentage basis compared with Q4.","Switching gears to industrial, during Q4, worldwide industrial resales were down mid-single digits, driven particularly by softness in China and Japan. Europe and North America, however, remained relatively flat. The decline in China resales reflect that, I should say, restocking by Chinese OEMs during the preceding quarter and showed very much a characteristic volatility of Chinese OEM customers. No surprise, therefore, our industrial sales declined 4% in Q4 and represented about 20% of our overall revenues. Looking forward into Q1, we expect seasonal weakness globally. We will continue to reduce inventory into our distribution channels as we have done so last quarter. Accordingly, we anticipate revenue from industrial to decline mid-single digits too on a percentage basis compared to the preceding quarter.","With this, in summary, I would -- let me recap. Q4 was strong, product ramps in wireless and strong fiber demand in data center buildout and telecoms infrastructure. Q4 -- in Q1 that we're in, we expect demand in wireless to sustain, but year-end seasonal weakness in enterprise spending, as well as industrial, will drive 3% to 6% sequential revenue decline. However, on a year-over-year basis, we expect the trend in our business -- in our major businesses, to remain solid, with a projected high-single digit year-on-year growth for Q1, even without the benefit -- even without the accretion of CyOptics.","With that, let me now turn the call over to Tony for a more detailed review of our fourth quarter and full year 2013 financials.","Anthony Maslowski","Thank you, Hock, and good afternoon, everyone. Before reviewing the fourth quarter and fiscal 2013 financial results, I want to remind you that my comments today will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP data is included with the earnings release issued today and is also available on our website at www.avagotech.com.","Revenue of $738 million in Q4 represents an increase of 15% from last quarter and an increase of 19% compared to the same quarter a year ago. The better-than-expected sequential growth was a result of stronger demand from both wireless and wired infrastructure target markets. Revenue from our industrial target market was below our prior expectation, primarily due to weaker-than-expected distribution resales. In the quarter, Foxconn continued to be a greater than 10% customer.","Our Q4 gross margin was 50.5%, 50 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance. Gross margins improved in specific product categories, offsetting total unfavorable product mix.","Turning to operating expenses, OpEx for Q4 came in at $144 million, in line with our guidance. R&D expenses increased by $8 million to $99 million, primarily due to full quarter R&D spending for CyOptics. SG&A decreased by $1 million to $45 million. As a percentage of sales, R&D decreased to 13% from 14% in the prior quarter. And similarly, SG&A decreased to 6% from 7% of net revenue.","Income from operations for the quarter increased by $38 million sequentially to $229 million and represented 31% of net revenue. Compared to $199 million for Q4 of last year, income from operations increased by $30 million. We recorded a net gain of $11 million in other income, primarily due to a gain in fair value of marketable securities representing minority investments.","Taxes came in at $13 million for Q4, slightly above our guidance. Q4 net income of $227 million increased 21% from the prior quarter. In Q4, earnings per diluted share of $0.89 was $0.15 higher than Q3. The sequential increase in Q4 earnings is attributable primarily to the full quarter earnings contribution from CyOptics, as well as higher revenue from non-CyOptic businesses. Compared to Q4 of last year, net income was $33 million higher, and earnings per diluted share was 12% higher for similar reasons.","I'd like to point out that Q4 2013 marked the record highs for revenue, operating income, as well as net income. Our share-based compensation in Q4 was $22 million. The breakdown of expense for Q4 includes $3 million in cost of goods sold, $8 million in R&D and $11 million in SG&A. In Q1 2014, we anticipate share-based compensation will be approximately $24 million. And just as a reminder, the company's definition of non-GAAP net income excludes share-based compensation expense.","Moving on to the balance sheet, our day sales outstanding came in flat at 52 days compared to the prior quarter. Timing of shipments in the quarter and unfavorable impact of CyOptics DSO continued to weigh on Avago's total DSO. Our inventory ended at $285 million, a slight increase of $1 million from last quarter. Our wireless inventory remained at the elevated level in anticipation of continued strength from one of our large smartphone OEM customers.","Days on hand were 71 days, which decreased 11 days from Q3, given the much higher revenue during the quarter. We also took the opportunity in Q4, given the favorable credit market, to resize our revolving credit facility. As you have seen, we've entered into a new credit agreement providing for a revolving credit facility with an aggregate principal of up to $575 million with an ability to increase it to $675 million compared to our previous $300 million facility.","We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $985 million, and we generated $212 million in operational cash flow. Just to foreshadow Q1 a bit for you, Q1 is a generally weaker quarter for cash generation due to the payment of our annual employee bonuses relating to the prior fiscal year. We spent $57 million on capital expenditures, this was below our guidance for the quarter, mainly because of the timing of equipment delivery. For Q1, we expect CapEx to be approximately $63 million.","During the quarter, we repurchased 852,000 shares, which consumed $33 million of cash. On September 30, 2013, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per ordinary share, which consumed $57 million of cash. This dividend was raised by $0.02 from the prior quarter. Since the inception of our dividend program in Q2 of 2011 to date, we have continued to increase our dividend each quarter.","Now let me briefly recap our fiscal 2013 full year results. Revenue increased by 7% to $2.52 billion, mainly driven by the strength in our wireless business. Avago's overall gross margin decreased by nearly 20 basis points to 50.8% as compared to 51% for fiscal 2012. Net income for fiscal 2013 increased to $731 million, or $2.89 per diluted share, as compared to $700 million, or $2.77 per diluted share, in fiscal 2012.","Now let me turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2014. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions, and we do not intend to update this guidance. Total revenue is expected to be down in the range of 3% to 6% from Q4. Gross margin is expected to be 50.5% plus or minus 1 percentage point. Operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $145 million. Taxes are forecasted to be approximately $10 million. And finally, the diluted share count forecast is for 257 million shares.","That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Hock, can you talk a little bit about what you see in the industrial business being down a little bit more than you expected? I know you said it was resales, but any more color you can give on that, not only in the quarter but in the guide would be helpful.","Hock E. Tan","It's pretty much what I tried to articulate out here, which is -- surely, based on Europe and U.S. industrial geography, it's basically fairly stable. Now, of course, we are heading in our Q1 numbers into a Christmas quarter, so there will be some holidays in which we'll expect that seasonal downturn, as it happens every year, when we hit our fiscal Q1 because of the Christmas holidays and all that. But otherwise, on a run-rate basis, weekly, it's pretty stable in North America and Europe industrial. China, however, which is a big engine on driving industrial -- among the global industrial OEMs worldwide, as well as not just China purchasers, it's a very volatile industrial market. It's up one quarter, down the next, and up again, and that's probably because of the buying characteristics of Chinese OEMs. We tend to behave like this is a PC market almost. So they buy one quarter, we stock up, and then the next quarter it disappears. And if they see the demand coming in, everybody rushes to buy. So you get very volatile demand in China quarter-on-quarter, and we are seeing that. And Japan, it's part [ph] a lot to China, and they get dragged along by China. And so what we've seen over the last quarter and this quarter, too, is China is not -- is relatively down, slightly down, and Japan with it. So overall, because of that seasonality on one side and characteristic buying behavior in China, industrial is kind of down. And the best way to describe is probably down mid-single digits.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. And I guess as my one follow-up, switching gears over to the wired side of things. I know you said you're going to start doing the -- moving away from the module side, so I guess a couple-part question. What are you seeing outside of the CyOptics part of the business? And how should we think about how long that transition out of modules will last and what sort of impact it'll have to the roughly 50 million to 55 million a quarter that CyOptics operates on?","Hock E. Tan","Wow, that's a tough question. Let's start with the easier one, which is the non-CyOptics business, which is largely now -- a lot of it is component sales to the telecoms industry -- infrastructure industry, that is. But let's talk about what we are -- what is Avago's fiber business largely before CyOptics, which is enterprise. Here, the big driver is data centers, large data center build-outs, less so on traditional enterprise networking. In traditional enterprise networking, you won't see a lot of buyout from some of our large OEM customers, recent earnings announcements and commentary. It's kind of flat, very flat. Data center build-outs are one -- big data center build-outs seems to be what drives it, and seems to be what drives a big part of the -- of our growth to the extent that there is growth in some of these areas. And that's 40G. As the business starts -- things start to move from 10G, which is getting mature now, 10G, to 40G, which is exciting fun, one -- the guys who are leading the charge here are data center build-outs. And that is still very good. Meanwhile, traditional enterprise is, at best, flattish, and that's what we see there, in fiber optics, and we translate that into the ASIC SerDes that we supply to several major OEMs in enterprise networking. We see that happening, which is what I mentioned about pause until 40G catches on. Coming back to your second question on CyOptics, no surprise as we indicated to you when we bought this company, is they have a combination of module or subsystem business, especially in China Fiber to the Home, as well as the do component sales into -- especially the new coherent 40 and 100G networks. That business is very exciting, and we're definitely continuing to push on it. As far as the subsystem business, the module business in China, especially as it relates to telecoms infrastructure, as well as Fiber to the Home, those are businesses that are extremely competitive. Our competitive edge are the laser components, chips, as well as lasers and receivers that we sell. That makes us unique and the technology unique. So we are basically transitioning, starting this quarter, as we mentioned, from selling subsystems to selling components to the same customers, to the same end customers and application, I would add. The impact will be a reduction in revenue, which will happen, and -- but an increase in gross margin percentage. And keeping to what we're good at is, as I said, a key part of our business model to be unique, differentiated suppliers. Impact on revenues, basically, what it will likely do is over the next -- over the course of fiscal '14, is probably keep our revenues relatively unchanged, flat over the next 4 quarters.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Schneider from Goldman Sachs.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Hock, I was wondering if you could comment on the wireless business and maybe comment specifically on the typical seasonality you see in the January and April quarters and what you think might be better or worse about that seasonality as we head into this next couple -- this next year?","Hock E. Tan","Okay. Well, used to be, few years back, and it still is to some extent, depending on how you look at it, I guess, is seasonality in handsets simply because, I guess, usually before Christmas, now Chinese New Year as well, but usually before Christmas, year end, promotions happen and handset growth is very strong, especially October, November. December, things roll over and generally is a bloody disaster in demand, and that's typically how handset business grows. As however, the business, especially what matters a lot, the smartphone business, consolidates into 2 very big guys. The timing of product launches, the key product launches of those 2 guys, takes over a lot of the seasonality. Now it happens that those launches, especially on one of the big guys, coincides with year end. So we still see that sharp, very sharp year-end seasonality. For us, we see that particular strength in our fiscal Q4 and our fiscal Q1, the current quarter. Then after that, fiscal Q2, the following fiscal Q2 and Q3 would dip rather precipitously as we go through transition to the next product generation. And then up it goes again, the roller coaster ride again, in Q4 and the following Q1. And that's the new seasonality we are seeing. Not that much different, perhaps, from the old seasonality, except because of consolidation and concentration of customers, it's now become more pronounced.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then as a follow-up, one of your competitors last week, I believe, discussed some potential negative seasonality, even more than normal, into the January quarter because of where Chinese New Year falls. So can you comment on whether you see anything different than you typically would around Chinese New Year? And specifically, on Chinese distributors, are they taking down their inventory precipitously at this point? Or are they pretty much ordering it in consumption levels?","Hock E. Tan","Well, we don't see this -- well, I guess, probably, we are different from that competitor you are referring to in more than one ways. One is, of course, our Q1, as we call it, fiscal Q1, ends in January. And Chinese New Year this time around is at the end of our fiscal Q1. If anything else, before Chinese New Year starts, as you know, it's not demand that determines, it's supply. The factories in China wants to pull in as much as they can before customs and all that -- logistics shutdown in China as Chinese New Year comes on. So for us, our Q1 might see a pull-in, some -- a little bit of pull-in because of that. Not much, we like to think, but there probably will be some. But that's our Q1. Then other competitor might be talking about Q1 from a traditional calendar March quarter. And as it refers to the Chinese guys, see, it's probably -- depending on which customers they have and who they are referring to versus what we have and what we are referring to, for us, obviously, it's very much tied to 2 large OEM, smartphone OEMs. From the Chinese market point of view, we have obviously substantial revenues there, but it's more -- it's certainly not to the level as we see in our 2 largest OEMs, and we definitely do not participate broadly in the sense of substantial share in the Chinese white-box OEMs at this point, except specialized FBAR filters that are needed in -- as new China LTE bands coming. We don't have that broad overview that perhaps another one of our peer group competitor might have. So I can't really comment on that and nor would I say that what we see is similar to what they might see on their business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley.","Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Hock, speaking of China and LTE, there are some rumblings in terms of what bands may or may not ultimately be supported. Any sense in terms of what you're seeing from customers on the opportunity in China into 2014?","Hock E. Tan","Well, we haven't changed our story all along here, which is that TD-LTE will come in. We are covered on the few bands that will encompass TD-LTE. We are pretty well presented. And by the way, more than just LTE bands in China, especially Wi-Fi, WiMAX related to that, it's a big part of phone bands in China. And again, we are pretty well represented there. So nothing much has changed. But they are that few several bands, and they -- there are talks of moving it around. But at the end of the day, all those bands are running around in the range of 2.4 to 2.6 gigahertz frequency band. And there, you do see the need for a lot of FBAR filter requirements.","Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then just a follow-up for Tony. If I look at gross margin coming in just a bit above expectations, your longer-term target is 50% to 53%. How are you feeling about gross margin in 2014?","Anthony Maslowski","Well, again, I think what we've always said is the long-term business model is at 50 to 53%. We have to get over the -- somewhat of a CyOptics overhang because they're dilutive to us, and it's through the combination of improving their business plan, as well as their operation contribution. So I think we're still pretty confident that a slight uptrend in gross margin over multiple years is -- we stick with that long-term business model.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse.","Ryan Carver - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","This is Ryan Carver in for John Pitzer. Hey, quick question on the gross margin guide. You guys talked about a sort of negative mix drawing margins down, but that you were having some company-specific -- or some product-specific drivers that were helping boost it. Could you maybe go in a bit more detail about that? Is that something that's happening specifically in the wireless group? Or are you guys seeing some intra [indiscernible] mixes in other categories that helping that margin profile out?","Anthony Maslowski","Well, again, I think one of the things we continue to be impressed by is how quickly things are improving on our CyOptics business that we purchased. So if you remember, way back to when we first purchased CyOptics, we talked about bringing it over at the low 30s and then making the first digit of 4 some time in this coming year. The pace of change there is a very much on track. We're very happy with what we're seeing there, and then we still see some potential. We're not going to change anything outwardly to you guys, and we'll probably stop talking about CyOptics individually because as the quarters come forward, CyOptics is really a part of what we call our fiber optics components business. So it's more integrated with some of the things we're doing with some of our other products and so forth. But we're very happy there, and then there is a couple other product categories that we won't get into detail on, but improved within the quarter that made a difference to gross margin overall.","Ryan Carver - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And as my follow-up, you guys talked about some of the -- in the wired business, some of the business in China perhaps being a bit weaker than expected on the carrier side. Can you talk a little bit about what you guys are seeing in terms of the carrier build-outs -- our expectations, I think, are for sort of the 200K base station build-outs to happen or be completed come sometime in the middle of '14? Have you guys sort of seen the buy up ahead of those builds? Or I guess any color you could provide there would be helpful.","Hock E. Tan","Well, that's a very interesting question, which has been subject to very immense speculation. That magical -- basically, 200,000 base stations, which is part of what you're saying, the TD-LTE -- the 4G or TD-LTE rollout in China. As far as I'm aware, no contracts have been officially given because no licenses on 4G has been given out in China yet to the carriers. So I guess we're all waiting officially.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","First question, Hock, in the last 2 years, when I look at the April quarter, I think your wireless business was down about 9% sequentially this year and -- but was sort of flat sequentially last year. I think earlier on the call, you mentioned that demand can be very volatile in that quarter, depending on flagship launches. Do you think that volatility is perhaps similar to the ranges we have seen before? Or could it be different this time? And more importantly, are you confident that the wireless business can just conceptually grow at a mid-teens pace next year?","Hock E. Tan","Well, let's take the first part first, the basic cycle within any fiscal year. I think it changes. I don't -- I think the last thing we can assume is that the next year repeats what the previous year goes through in the cycle. But all indications are that -- and the part of it is related to now more than pure seasonality, as I said -- answered in an earlier question. We all calendar seasonality of Christmas and all that is really overriding it. It's the timing of major product launches of a couple of very large OEMs, as you all know. And right -- and one of those OEM launches fairly consistently, at least so far we have seen. The other OEM doesn't behave that same way. So in my -- adjust that profile of that revenue from one, and it probably will. And this coming year, in '14, probably we'll have some level adjustment. But I could be wrong that everything, all things considered, things will work out evenly, like what's happening this quarter. Right? Q1. If you asked me 4 years ago, going back that way, Q1, fiscal Q1, is usually the weakest quarter for our wireless business. Today, it's right up there as the strongest quarter for our wireless business so far in Q1. In fact, as I mentioned, it sustains from the very high Q4 level. The only reason Q1 is maybe down, as I pointed out, is because other than the 2 major OEMs, all -- most other OEMs are actually experiencing the traditional seasonality in their case. So that will be a headwind against the sustaining strength of our 2 largest OEM customers. And that's what we are seeing now. By the next Q4, Q1, say, will the same thing happen? Don't know. Very hard to predict in this business. What we will be sure is we'll go to product transitions to a new generation of smartphones with all those OEMs, particularly the 2 major OEM customers.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And then just as a follow-up to that, from what you can see with all the design wins in the pipeline, and I think you are keeping CapEx at fairly robust levels, so I assume FBAR demand is staying fairly robust, do you think the wireless business can conceptually grow at a similar sort of mid-teens pace as you managed to grow it over the last 2 years? Is that a reasonable assumption to make?","Hock E. Tan","Before I answer that question, let me correct you on the first part. Our robust CapEx, as you put it, is not just on wireless. Having said that, you're right. The last couple of years, a big part of it has been on wireless as we build out capacity in FBAR to meet increasing demand, which drives our increasing revenue growth. But that aside, a substantial part of that CapEx is also related to our wired infrastructure business. We are also building out specific capacity, especially in front end, Indium Phosphide fabs or basically our LED laser fabs in Singapore, especially. We're investing in building out capacity there and improving processes there. We're investing in test equipment for proprietary fiber optics. We've also been taping out a whole bunch of ASICs, which we can -- which we treat for accounting purposes as CapEx as well. So our wired infrastructure business is getting a substantial portion of that CapEx spending. As you all know, I correct you on that. And that also indicates our outlook on those businesses as well. And then finally, coming back to your question on wireless, yes. To be fair, it's hard to sustain the level of growth we have been seeing over the last 3 years in wireless. Purely scale of large numbers, nothing else. Having said that, is it still growing as evidenced by the fact we're continuing putting investment in the fabs. But will it grow as fast as the last few years? I tell you this: it depends on how fast LTE bands, LTE smartphones proliferate in new areas like Europe, China and other -- and perhaps that will determine over the next few years the rate of growth of our wireless business. But we're not planning for it to be growing as fast, to answer your question specifically, as we have grown over the last 3 years in wireless.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah from Nomura.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Cisco's business is down a lot this quarter. It looks like your wired business is holding up better. Hock, is that mainly due to fiber?","Hock E. Tan","Yes. As I indicated, fiber has been doing quite well. That helped a lot. And to be precise, 40G. 40 gigahertz.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. Specifically, in switching, Cisco, on the last call, they talked about basically replacing their Nexus 7000 product line with the 9000, and this is a product that's got to go through some qualification. And it'll launch later in the year, but the -- in the interim, Cisco seems to be facing a bit of an air pocket. And I was hoping you could just maybe talk about the wired business as it relates to some of these new product launches? And how should we think about the trajectory of wired as we go through the year?","Hock E. Tan","Romit, this is a tough question because that will require me to talk about a very beloved customer. So if you don't mind, don't take me -- don't take offense. I prefer not to comment on that as it relates to any customers. Just put it that -- as I mentioned in my earlier comments, 10G is transitioning to 40G, and a lot of 40G right now is in the early stage of it. It's all largely been adopted by the guys who are building hyper data centers who are adopting it. And many of these guys are very untraditional in their ways of adopting architectures in both fiber optics, as well as switching and routing. So that's probably the level of innovation you're seeing in the marketplace and, I guess, changes in the trends, which is why I'm very careful to point out traditional enterprise is still chugging along but relatively flat. The growth is coming from these hyper data center guys who seem to be headed off in very -- pushing the envelope technologies where it relates to switching and fiber interconnects. And we see benefit in that area. On traditional enterprise, things are not very exciting.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I guess, Hock, maybe just asking it a different way, as you look at this next fiscal year, how would you rank order your 3 major product lines or business segments in terms of revenue growth? Would you rank wired, 1; wireless, 2; and industrial, 3? Or differently?","Hock E. Tan","Oh, that's a tough question you're asking now. I will tell you, wired and wireless will be neck to neck. How's that sound?","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Sounds good. That sounds good. All right.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman from RBC Capital Markets.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","If I could focus in a little bit on your spending plan for next year, guidance for the January quarter on OpEx, pretty in line with normal seasonality. You traditionally get a bump up in the April quarter. I think it's due to the FICA tax adjustments. Are there any offsets to that this year? And if you could just give us an update on where you'd like to hold your spending levels.","Anthony Maslowski","Well, again, I think for the full year, as I mentioned on some of the earlier calls, is that last quarter and this quarter, because of some of the adjustments we had to our bonus, are slightly different than previous years. So I think we can potentially hold this spending level throughout the year. Again, there are some challenges in there. There's some opportunity spending that we'll take advantage of here and there. So I think it's -- again, from last year to this year, I think it's, again, not giving multi-quarter forecasts. But I think it could potentially be a peak expense quarter for us. So...","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","If you could, Hock, maybe give us a little bit of insight into what you're seeing on the optical market. A few of your competitors have talked about pricing pressure. I don't know if it's actually in the segments that you're playing or if it's tangential markets there.","Hock E. Tan","Well, it's -- many of you who follow this company knows in our fiber optics business, there is this standard -- we got -- I think the term is MSA standard fiber optic in transceivers or interconnects, which are more [indiscernible] set by [indiscernible] standards and other standards for communication. And then on our other side, we try to promote proprietary standards. On the standard side, yes, I think price competition has always been there and continues to be there, which is what drove us into the proprietary fiber optics business in the first place. We still sell into standard, which we do -- obviously we do, and it's an important part of our business. But it's never been a nice place to be in because prices keeps dropping. You're first to markets, you won't stay there for long because of standard. And sooner or later, price will plunge. And we continue to see that price degradation even now in 10-Gig. Meanwhile -- not yet in 40 but in 10 gig. Meanwhile, on a proprietary site that we do, prices are more orderly and more manageable. And obviously, we kind of -- somewhat immune from the price frenzy that we see on the standard fiber side.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And for my last question, one of your partners or competitors may soon become more of a competitor, that being Qualcomm with the introduction of their RF360. There is talk that, that's going to ramp into a volume production in the first half of the year. Can you give us some insights into how you think that might impact you and how you might be partnering with them?","Hock E. Tan","RF360 involves transporting [ph] power amplifiers into the base band and transceiver, and the transceiver obviously which Qualcomm has a plentiful [ph] of. They still do not integrate in filters. So depending on the bands that this chip -- this RF360 gets applied in, in one handset it goes into and what service provider or carrier, you still may or may not need FBAR filters or SAW filters. And that will never go away. That RF360 doesn't incorporate in their roadmap current or future filters.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ian Ing from MKM Partners.","Ian Ing - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Could you talk more about this SerDes ASIC pause and inventory adjustments at major OEMs? I thought your exposure there was in things like data center servers, things like UCS, which I thought was strong. Or is it more switching and routing?","Hock E. Tan","Well, it may be part of that, but it could be part of the fact that -- see it's also the buying patterns on my customers. And I will not just specifically take it as literally as the translated to mean that there's a slowdown in demand. But we've all seen there is not a strong demand across the board on traditional -- in very much in traditional enterprise. In data center build, yes, depending on who you -- who are the winners and losers. You may see strength or you may not -- or you may see flatness. But we also get the sense that for some of our OEMs, there's been over-aggressive -- over-enthusiastic purchasing in the previous quarter, which kind of lead them to pause, especially with the launch of the next -- a new generation of switches and routers. And I suspect a part of that pause is what we are seeing here. But the other side for it is, I think for some of our OEM customers, the market they are seeing is flat.","Ian Ing - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then my follow-up on the wireless side, could you talk about looking at the smartphone sockets that you're targeting next year, do you have a sense of the adoption rates of these features like carrier aggregation and envelope tracking? I know you've talked about FBAR benefiting from those features?","Hock E. Tan","Envelope tracking is definitely happening in many -- with many, many OEMs, handset OEMs across the board, OEMs across the board in globally. It's already started, as you know, earlier this a -- a few months ago with the launch of the first one, which is the Note 3. Thereafter, I think we are seeing a few other programs coming along with several OEMs. Most of them coming out probably in early part of next year and continuing on to right up to the end of the year. So we see that rollout happening by envelope tracking. Carrier aggregation is somewhat slower. That will even use a lot more FBAR but it's also more slower to get implemented. I think spikes are still being worked out and I probably would guess that you do not really see in any significant amount before end of the year, if not 2015 for carrier aggregation.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of JoAnne Feeney from ABR Investment Strategy.","JoAnne Feeney","Been a lot of concern about where the growth of smartphones is going to occur at the high-end versus the low end, with most people thinking mid- to low-end. And so I guess a lot of us are wondering how Avago is being positioned to serve mid-range or low-end smartphones, not just with your current large customers but with others. Can you describe for us perhaps how you're diversifying into the lower end or if you are, and what you see for unit growth this year for the customers you're serving?","Hock E. Tan","Okay. We work on a very simple premise in this wireless side. Okay? Our gift to this end market is our FBAR technology, filter technology. Okay? Where they need to be used. And where they need to be used depends on bands, the certain bands. Certain bands require FBAR filters to work. Other bands that are easier, their modulation schemes are easier, do not. They get away with SAW filters. If they can get away with SAW filters, typically, they will get -- will use SAW filters. Then there are some bands in the middle where -- with some phone makers where there are issue of coexistence, interference, and then they use FBAR. And all we are really interested in on this simple basic model is find all the sockets that needs good filtering and sticking FBAR filters. And the world moves -- depending on how the world -- depending which part of the world moves in one direction, you -- we see -- we have been seeing an increase in utilization of FBAR. And example, China. China is not about high-end smartphones as you know, not very much. But if TD-LTE shows up and if -- now, TD-LTE only shows up in maybe high-end smartphones, JoAnne. But eventually, like everything else, TD-LTE becomes mainstream. In every phone in China, say, in most ones in China, TD-LTE runs in the frequency based on the bands right overlapping Wi-Fi. You can't run one without the other in that -- in space. So you need FBAR. Even in low-end phones in China, eventually when it goes mainstream. So it's not about high-end, low-end. Having said all that, what has been driving us over the last few years, generations, it's just -- and it's tied to proliferation of LTE bands, too, by the way, is the fact that phones, particularly smartphones -- but any phone if you want to look at it -- is increasing in content. Because any phone that runs LTE has to be backward compatible to CDMA -- to 3G and CDMA and 2G. So cross-cross. So more and more content goes in a phone. As content increases in the phone, which means number of bands each for -- any phone supports increases, the chances of more filters using FBAR in any one phone increases. And I point on my earlier remarks, it's largely -- what we've been seeing the last couple of years is -- 3 years in fact, is content increase in the phone we sell to, less so the number of unit phones that have been sold out there. It's not about number of increase -- number of phones that is driving our growth now. It's the content those phones that we fell into have of our products.","JoAnne Feeney","And then just a quick follow-up. For this quarter coming, you have talked about the wireless revenue looking roughly flat. But clearly, there's going to be a wide range of behavior of your customers. Can you give us a sense of that range? Perhaps, your best customer up certain amount quarter-to-quarter versus the weakest customer down a certain amount? Can you give us a sense of that range or perhaps size for us your 2 largest customers versus the rest of the group?","Hock E. Tan","Not in the least, JoAnne. I have no clue. Anything I give you will be mere speculation, which of course I won't do. So no, I don't really have a good idea.","Thomas Krause","Thanks everybody. Before we close, I want to remind you that we will be presenting at the JPMorgan Tech Forum in the new year, January 7, in Las Vegas, as well as meeting with investors on the 7th and the 8th at CES. I want to thank everybody for participating in today's call. We look forward to talking with you again when we report first quarter of fiscal year '14 results in February. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's Avago's conference call for today. You may now disconnect."]}}
