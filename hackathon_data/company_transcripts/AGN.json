At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Allergan Third Quarter Earnings Call. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Lisa DeFrancesco, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Lisa M. DeFrancesco - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, Nan, and good morning everyone. I'd like to welcome you to the Allergan third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning we issued a press release reporting Allergan earnings from continuing operations for the third quarter ended September 30, 2015. The press release and our slide deck, which we are presenting this morning, are available on our corporate website at www.allergan.com. We're conducting a live webcast of this call, a replay of which will be available on our website after its conclusion. Please note that today's call is copyright material of Allergan and cannot be rebroadcast without the company's expressed written consent.","Turing to slide 2, I'd also like to remind you that during the course of this call, management will make projections or other forward-looking remarks regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. It's important to note that such statements and events are forward-looking statements and reflect our current perspective of business trends and information as of today's date.","Actual results may differ materially from current expectations and projections depending on the number of factors affecting the Allergan business. These factors are detailed in our public periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Allergan disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as expressly required by law.","At this time, as a result of the press release Allergan issued on October 29, 2015, confirming the company has been approached by Pfizer and is in preliminary friendly discussions regarding a potential business combination transaction, the company will not be issuing any financial forecasts that could require additional reporting under Rule 28 of the Irish takeover rules.","With us on today's call are Brent Saunders, our CEO and President, who will provide an overview of our third quarter continuing operations business highlights, and Tessa Hilado, our Chief Financial Officer, will then discuss the Allergan third quarter continuing operations results in more detail.","Also on the call and available during the Q&A are Paul Bisaro, our Executive Chairman; Bob Stewart, President of Global Generics and Commercial Operations; Bill Meury, President of Branded Pharma; David Nicholson, Executive Vice President and President of Global Brands R&D; Paul Navarre, President of International Brands; Philippe Schaison, President of Allergan Medical, and Bob Bailey, our Chief Legal Officer.","With that, I will turn the call over to Brent.","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","Thank, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. It's great to be with you to review our results for the third quarter of 2015. We're obviously been very busy on many fronts and our teams continue to build on the momentum we have had all year. This momentum will propel our future growth.","Turning to slide 5. Allergan's third quarter performance illustrates that we continue to execute on the four pillars of our growth strategy. First, operational excellence is yielding exceptional financial performance and strong results in continuing operations, key products and key geographies. Second, therapeutic area leadership is leading to double-digit growth among many of our franchises. Third, our productive and innovative R&D engine continues to produce. Our team is looking forward to showcasing our R&D pipeline, the success we've had this year and the depth of our pipeline across all seven therapeutic areas later today at R&D day. And we are executing on strategic business deals including our Teva transaction earlier in the quarter, to allow us to focus on growing our business.","With the announcement of our plans to combine our global generics business with Teva in a deal worth approximately $40.5 billion, we are now reporting our Generics business as discontinued operations. Although the business results are consolidated into a single line in the income statement, our Global Generics team continues to perform well.","I'm impressed with the continued momentum in the business and proud of the performance of this team. For example, the Generics R&D team has submitted 25 new ANDAs in the US this year, with 16 of them potential first-to-files. This team is the gem of the generics industry, and they are on track to submit approximately 35 applications by year end.","Outside the US, we filed over a thousand marketing authorizations in critical markets. This year, we have received approval and launched over 25 products in the US, and these new launches are adding to our results. Internationally, the teams in the UK, Russia and other Eastern European markets continue to deliver strong performance. The pre-integration work with Teva is going well, and we remain committed to closing the transaction during the first quarter of 2016.","This plan to divest the Global Generics business allows us to dramatically simplify our operating structure, sharpen our focus on seven core therapeutic areas and reload our capital structure to continue our transformation. We are confident that we are creating the most dynamic company in growth pharma.","Now let me turn to the continuing operations business performance in the third quarter. Our third quarter net revenue grew 90% on a year-over-year basis to $4.1 billion as a result of the Allergan acquisition. On a pro forma basis, sales grew 10% despite the loss of exclusivity on one of our largest products, Namenda IR, which experienced generic competition in the quarter.","Strong sales in key products across our business drove 65% increase in non-GAAP earnings per share to $3.48. Meanwhile, non-GAAP EBITDA rose to $2 billion and cash flow from operations excluding R&D asset acquisitions, restructuring and integration payments was $1.7 billion in the quarter.","Our business continues to drive strong performance. More than half of our products are delivering double-digit volume-driven growth. On a pro forma basis, year-over-year brand revenue increased nearly 13% excluding Namenda IR, divestitures and the impact of foreign exchange.","On slide 8, our growth in the quarter was broad-based. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, we drove double-digit growth from leading brands across key franchises such as BOTOX, Restasis, Linzess, Lo Loestrin and Saphris. We continue to solidify our leadership in key categories with new launches and approvals. Our recent launches, including AVYCAZ, DALVANCE, Namzaric, Liletta and KYBELLA, are all performing well, supported by strong promotional activities. Looking ahead, we will continue to drive growth through new approvals and upcoming launches, including VIBERZI in a few weeks and VRAYLAR in the first quarter of 2016.","In addition to progress made in our R&D pipeline, we are also strengthening therapeutic area leadership through new acquisitions of important programs. In eyecare, we continue to add shots on goal in development opportunities for dry eye disease and eyecare with the acquisition of AqueSys, Mimetogen and Oculeve. Mimetogen, which we just announced this morning, brings a novel topical formulation dry eye treatment that could potentially be used alone and in combination with other dry eye therapies. This adds a Phase III program further strengthening our dry eye pipeline, giving us the potential to launch six new products over the next five years.","In aesthetics, we completed the acquisition of Kythera for its leading product KYBELLA, adding a non-surgical treatment for submental fullness, or double chin. We also announced this morning the acquisition of Northwood Medical Innovation, developer of an innovative implant technology, earFold. earFold is a medical device for the correction of prominent ears.","In CNS, we completed the acquisition of Naurex, which adds potential breakthrough treatments in depression and will be discussed in detail later this morning at R&D Day. And in GI, we recently completed the acquisition of commercial rights to Constella in more than 40 international markets. This adds an important product for our commercial team internationally and helps position us for the potential to add new GI therapies like eluxadoline to our product offering for international customers.","Before I turn the call over to Tessa to review our financial performance in the third quarter, I wanted to touch on our R&D Day and recent commentary on product pricing. Later this morning, David Nicholson, Bill Meury and Philippe Schaison will give an update on the pipeline and the commercial potential it contains. We believe that people will begin to take more active notice of our pipeline after today's meeting.","With more than 70 projects in mid to late stage development, we have multiple programs in each of our therapeutic areas to help us sustain leadership in the areas where we choose to compete. We are building a sustainable innovation engine to power our top-line performance and therapeutic area leadership well into the future. Please join us for an exciting day beginning in about an hour.","Turning to pricing. Pricing has been in the headlines and featured in the presidential debates. But let's not pretend that this is a topic that has just appeared in the news. It's been a focus for many years. We know that cost is a constant concern; so is patient access to medical innovation. Allergan seeks to strike the right balance between care and cost. We operate in an open science model, developing promising products that frequently originate with smaller companies. These companies often lack the infrastructure to bring their products through expensive late stage trials or the commercial presence to recoup their R&D investments. The innovation ecosystem is full of these smaller companies who have extraordinary ideas and brilliant scientists. We want to be the magnet for their great ideas in this new innovation ecosystem.","Our model is designed to bring these extraordinary ideas to market. Our R&D staff is more than 2,000 people strong. They mobilize resources to help regulatory authorities around the world assess safety and efficacy of our products while providing data to payers to reflect their value. Let's face it, this effort is costly and often reflected in the cost of medicine, and it is easy to miss the significant value they represent. They reduce the need for hospitalization, surgery, follow-up visits and more dire medical consequences.","Allergan has a heritage in knowing health system economics very well, and we want to make sure patients have access to important medicines. Like many of our peers, we have patient assistance programs to make sure that patients have access to our medicines regardless of their ability to pay.","We are bold in acquiring and investing in promising treatments for serious diseases \u2013 Alzheimer's, severe depression, glaucoma, debilitating gastrointestinal conditions. Our business model does not involve purchasing old products already in the marketplace and taking excessive price increases. We prefer to acquire mid to late stage drugs and invest extensively in their development. To make those decisions to help people with unmet medical needs requires us to build bridges with physicians, academic medical centers, government, regulators and inventors of these molecules so that they see us a partner who shares in their dedication to improve people's well being.","If you look at our recent development acquisitions, it's all about investing in ideas that can help change the way medicine is practiced. What makes the biopharmaceutical industry great? Inventions that change lives. We will continue to use our resources to advance treatments for unmet medical needs and to tap into the world's best ideas to advance care for patients. We will do this, but we will continue to strike the appropriate balance between care and cost.","In closing, our team continues to focus on execution and our results indicate that we are exceptionally skilled at delivering strong operating results while also doing surprising things to make our company the most dynamic and bold in healthcare. I am so proud of this team's performance and I'm looking forward to what we can do with the strength and focus on just branded pharmaceuticals.","With that, now I'd like to turn the call over to Tessa.","Maria Teresa Hilado - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Brent. Good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 12. Our overall results for the third quarter is on slide 13. In the third quarter we delivered very strong year-over-year performance. On a non-GAAP basis, consolidated revenue for the third quarter was $4.1 billion, an increase of 90% versus third quarter 2014.","Non-GAAP R&D investment for the quarter was $305 million compared to $192 million in the prior year period. Non-GAAP SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 22.4%, a decrease of 3.1 percentage points over the prior year quarter as a result of the synergies realized from recent acquisitions.","Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $2 billion, an increase of 168% versus the prior year, driven by strong revenues and higher gross margins across business segments. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter increased 65% to $3.48 compared to $2.11 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2014.","Our non-GAAP tax rate was 8.4% in the quarter. This rate was below expectations driven primarily by the allocation of the entire interest expense to continuing operations earnings. This rate could change by potential repayment of debt upon the close of the Teva transaction.","Cash flow from operations for the third quarter was $1 billion impacted by recent asset acquisitions. Excluding acquisition related restructuring and integration payments, our third quarter cash flow from operations would be $1.7 billion.","Slide 13. Turning now to our US Brands results on slide 13. The business delivered strong performance year-over-year. US Brands revenue was $2.4 billion for the quarter, up 50% versus the prior year period, driven by the addition of Allergan businesses and strong growth across key products including Restasis, Linzess, women's health products and new product launches including Liletta, Namzaric and AVYCAZ.","Adjusted gross margin within US Brands continued to be strong with margins approaching 88%. SG&A as a percentage of revenue decreased to 18.3% versus 22.1% in the year ago quarter, driven by continued synergy capture from recent acquisitions.","Turning to slide 14 and our US Medical Aesthetics business, third quarter revenues were $457 million, an increase of 9% versus third quarter 2014 results on a pro forma basis. Sequentially, US Medical Aesthetics performance was affected by seasonality related to aesthetics procedures. Third quarter gross margins were strong at 93.9%. SG&A as a percentage of revenue decreased 1.2 percentage points versus third quarter 2014.","Turning to slide 15 and our International Brands results, third quarter revenues were $661 million versus $58 million in the prior year, largely due to the Allergan acquisition. Year over year growth was also driven by fillers and Ozurdex in international markets. Sequential revenue performance was mostly due to seasonality.","Gross margins increased 25.7 percentage points to 83% in the third quarter, due largely to the inclusion of higher margin legacy Allergan products. Segment SG&A increased 3.2 percentage points to 29.8% versus third quarter 2014 due largely to the Allergan acquisition.","Turning to our Anda business on slide 16, revenues increased to $576 million, up from $500 million in the prior year, an increase of 15% driven by trends in our base business and new retail chain businesses. Results include third party revenues and related expenses of generic products manufactured by the company and distributed through Anda.","Slide 17 details our debt capitalization. We ended the third quarter 2015 with total debt of approximately $42.7 billion and equity of $77.5 billion related to the Allergan acquisition and previous financing. In the third quarter, we paid down approximately $231 million of our debt. In October, we borrowed $800 million on our revolving credit facility to fund the Kythera acquisition. Currently, our leverage ratio stands at 3.98 times debt to pro forma adjusted EBITDA versus 3.9 times in the prior quarter due to continued investments in R&D assets. We remain committed to maintaining our investment grade ratings.","And now, I will turn the call to Lisa for Q&A.","Lisa M. DeFrancesco - Vice President, Investor Relations","Nan, I think we can start taking questions. I'd like to ask everyone to limit yourselves to one question, so we can get through everyone in the queue.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Christopher Thomas Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much and congrats on the quarter. Just had a question on SG&A, it was 22.4% of sales in the quarter. Can you help us put that number into context with your longer term 21% to 24%, guidance range I think you laid out in September? I guess, was there anything unusual or any reason to expect that ratio to move higher going forward? Because otherwise, it seems like the company is going to be quickly trending to the low end of that range as top line continues to scale here. And if can slip in a second quick one, we've been getting this question a lot. Can you just disclose the mix of price versus volume driving your growth in the quarter? Thanks very much.","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yes so thanks, Chris. I think with SG&A, our previous guidance and range is still appropriate. Obviously, as you look at this quarter, I understand why you're thinking that way, but I do just put you back to the guidance we issued before. I don't know if Tessa, if you want to add anything.","Maria Teresa Hilado - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, we're within the range. And unfortunately given Irish rules, we can't really provide guidance on a go-forward basis. But I would just say that we are within the range.","William J. Meury - Executive Vice President and President, Branded Pharma","And then on price volume, I'll start with the top products. If you look at BOTOX, Restasis and Linzess, the price volume, or I'll say volume price is probably 80\/20. It's largely driven by pure demand in units or prescriptions. If you look across the entire product line, it's roughly 50\/50. And our price appreciation trades in the single digits.","Christopher Thomas Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yes thanks, Chris.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gerberry with Leerink Partners.","Jason M. Gerberry - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick question on Namenda now that we've now had a chance to see how the generic impact has come flowing through the model. Your updated thoughts on Namzaric; it's a little slow out of the box. Do you still view this as a $500 million to $750 million peak sales product, or should investors think about that peak sales target as more of the combined value that XR and Namzaric could retain?","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yeah. I would start, maybe then Bill can jump in. I think as you think about where we are with Namenda XR, I think the team has worked very hard and accomplished quite a bit. We still focus a lot of our energy and time inside our organization on both XR and Namzaric. The one thing that I would caution is with respect to Namzaric, most of the formulary coverage, although it's quite good right now, kicks in in January because of the Medicare Part B part of this equation. And so I think our expectations are a little higher post broader formulary coverage than it is today. But Bill, anything you'd want to add?","William J. Meury - Executive Vice President and President, Branded Pharma","Yeah, that's exactly right. I would make a few points. The first one is XR is very stable, and that's because the formulary coverage at the end of 2015 and into 2016 is as high as it's been. Next, Namzaric isn't quite as spread, good steady jog. 60% of our use today is coming from Aricept monotherapy. As Brent said, when formulary coverage converts in 2016, and after several months of direct-to-consumer advertising, I would expect over time that the overall business is going to grow and that Namzaric is going to account for a greater and greater percentage of it for one simple reason. It's a better product. If you look at the data, two drugs is better than one, and I think it will take us just a little bit of time to move this category.","Jason M. Gerberry - Leerink Partners LLC","Great. Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yeah. Thanks, Jason.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Amsellem with Piper Jaffray.","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","David?","Lisa M. DeFrancesco - Vice President, Investor Relations","David?","Operator","David, if you're on mute, please un-mute your line. Your line is open. Your next question comes from the line of Randall Stanicky with RBC Capital Markets.","Randall S. Stanicky - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks. Brent, just on the international business, you're still small here, but there is clearly a lot of opportunity in growth outside the US and you've got a pretty big portfolio of products that you could leverage, and I think you called out eluxadoline in the prepared comments. So the question for you, what's the strategy here assuming that you remain standalone, and where does this rank within your business development priorities? Thanks.","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yes. So I think when we did the Allergan deal, we talked about international as being one of the more important longer term growth levers for us. I think that still largely is untapped. We have a very strong team around the world. We have big opportunities to continue to leverage the infrastructure that we have. I think the deal we did with Almirall to buy Constella is a proof point of the types of things we're going to do as we're preparing to hopefully get approval for eluxadoline in Europe over time to be able to have more opportunities to leverage GI as a good move for us.","Obviously, aesthetic medicine is very important. We have lots of opportunity to continue to expand the aesthetic portfolio in Asia, China; I would call out Latin America, Brazil as another market I would call out where we're seeing strong growth. And then of course eyecare is very important to us around the world. And we continue to look for ways to build our portfolio and leadership in eyecare. And in many markets we are number one in eyecare outside the US. So we have a big heritage there, and it's important for us to continue to leverage.","With respect to business development, it remains a priority. We will continue to look for ways to add scale and product flow in key international markets around the world. And if we do that ourselves by eluxadoline approval or our JUV\u00c9DERM approval recently in China or buying Constella or other things, it's an important growth driver for us in the future.","Randall S. Stanicky - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Should we think about this, though, as more of a bolt-on source of capital? I mean everybody is going to be focused on the $29 billion that you have coming in from Teva in Q1, assuming that another deal on the side here doesn't happen. So should we think about international as smaller deal build-out, or could we see more significant capital allocated there?","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yeah, I mean I think about it three ways. It's going to be organically through driving our 70, most of our 70 late stage, mid to late stage programs and global development programs to the extent it makes sense, to doing R&D type deals for international product flow, to buying already marketed products like we did Constella and then perhaps from time to time where it makes sense strategically and financially, bolting on a small business into place like Brazil or China or even Europe.","Randall S. Stanicky - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. That's great. Thanks.","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marc Goodman with UBS.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning, guys. I was hoping you could give us a little more detail on the cash pay businesses as well as just BOTOX overall. What's going on behind the scenes in each of the individual areas?","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yeah, I mean obviously they're an important part of our business. I think the biggest component of the cash pay business is the aesthetics business within US Medical. That business continues to perform exceedingly well. Obviously there was some seasonality in the third quarter as there always is. Philippe, I don't know if you would want to comment on anything particularly. But I think KYBELLA is really starting to get momentum and I was at the sales launch with Philippe and his team last, I guess two weeks ago.","Philippe Schaison - Executive Vice President and President, Allergan Medical","So, we are in the focus of training roughly 1,500 top tier reps on top of the 800 that have been already trained. From a market share standpoint, you can see a guide point, we continue to solidify our market share especially on the filler market. And we have achieved 2 million consumers as part of our BD loyalty program, which is a all time high. So we're thriving and we're doing extremely well and everything is in the green.","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","Just for directional purposes, about 20% of our sales globally come from cash pay business. Most of that is the Allergan Medical. There are some cash pay brands as well, but the vast majority is that from the aesthetics business within Allergan Medical.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","And what about BOTOX and the therapeutic areas like how is migraine doing, overactive bladder, all the key drivers?","William J. Meury - Executive Vice President and President, Branded Pharma","Yeah. You hit the right ones. Those are the main growth drivers for BOTOX therapeutically. Both indications are growing at a high double digit rate. The core indications, the original indications are relatively stable. Listen, in both those conditions, it's a highly effective product and it's also very economical. And the injector base today in the United States for BOTOX is very experienced and comfortable with the product. I expect that both indications can continue to grow for the next several years.","Lisa M. DeFrancesco - Vice President, Investor Relations","Next question?","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Liav Abraham with Citi.","Liav Abraham - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning. I'd be interested in your thoughts on the outlook for Restasis, given as the recent OPUS-3 data for Lifitegrast. And perhaps at the same time, can you just remind us of your formulary coverage for Restasis. Thanks very much.","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yes. Sure. I think Bill probably is best positioned to answer.","William J. Meury - Executive Vice President and President, Branded Pharma","Yes. It's a good question. I don't believe that this is going to be a fight to the death between Shire and Allergan. I've said before that the gap between the prevalent population and the prescription treated population is enormous. It's larger than it is in most categories. The importance of dry eye disease is clear, and it's getting more and more attention because of the impact it has on quality of life, the impact that it can have on vision and positive post-op outcomes. When you look at the data sets between the drug, I would simply say that we'll have to see how Lifitegrast stands up in the real world.","I would also point out that in the second half of 2016, we'll be launching a multi-dose preservative free form of Restasis which I believe is going to be very popular with physicians and with patients for two reasons. The first, it's just more convenient than 60 single unit vials or droppers, and it's also easier to administer. And a big problem with all of these eye drops is they're difficult to instill and it's often a major problem with compliance.","Our promotional program in this category will continue to be at the very top. We have a large sales force that covers primary care, optometry and ophthalmology. We'll continue to run the largest direct-to-consumer advertising program in the industry. And then lastly, we obviously as you ask about formulary coverage, we have preferred status on 85% to 90% of health plan formularies and 90% of that is Tier 2. And so, this is a highly economical option. There's no doubt eyecare professionals are going to try something new. But I believe long term, this category has the potential to double. So there's more than enough to go around.","Liav Abraham - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. I have a question and if you can't answer it, I have a backup. But it's about a technicality, Brent, related to the prior press release. Can we assume that because Pfizer approached you that a business combination means that talks are about Pfizer potentially buying Allergan or not necessarily?","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yeah, I can't answer. So you should go to your back-up question.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","All right. It's more boring. Tessa, can you share the Generic sales and the gross margin and the segment margins in the quarter perhaps?","Maria Teresa Hilado - Chief Financial Officer","Yes. So, given the focus of this call is on continuing operations, what we will be providing is disclosures in our 10-Q which will be filed shortly. What I can say is we had solid performance for the Generic business, and revenues were around $4.77 billion for the nine months, for year-to-date nine months.","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","And remember that just in fairness, that is discontinued operations accounting. So for those that also cover Teva, it's not just a simple one-to-one kind of translation. Is that fair, Tessa?","Maria Teresa Hilado - Chief Financial Officer","That's fair. But it performed according to our expectations, a good solid performance, but you'll get more detail in our 10-Q.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Irina Koffler with Mizuho.","Irina Rivkind Koffler - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking the call, or the question. I just wanted to see how you're thinking about your sales force going forward. Is it the right size? Are there opportunities to be a little bit more efficient, or use alternative distribution models there? Or are you in fact thinking about adding instead?","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","I was going to make a bad joke but I'll stop. Well, I mean for me the sales representative around the world is a very important part of our company, that we tend to put them at the center of the way we think about our business and what they do, as they are the most intimate with our customers. I think we look at our sales force deployment globally very thoughtfully and strategically. For example in facial aesthetics we just increased our sales force by about 75 sales reps.","Philippe Schaison - Executive Vice President and President, Allergan Medical","We're up to 300.","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","Which was already the largest facial aesthetic sales force in the United States, and now it's even larger and more powerful. China, we just invested in our sales force and added sales reps. And so we do look at it, deployment of the sales reps very strategically. In the US, Bill can comment, where we have the most sales reps. It is a very hard-working, dedicated group I think delivering more details than any other sales force in the industry.","William J. Meury - Executive Vice President and President, Branded Pharma","Yeah, that's exactly right. It's certainly the most productive when you look at calls per day and we have roughly 4,000 representatives, but they operate as if it was 4,500 or 5,000 just by virtue they lead the industry in activity. The most significant change that we've made in the past 12 months to 18 months is we've customized the field force. So there's no longer a one-size-fits-all approach. We don't have the same number of representatives in the state of Massachusetts as compared to the state of Mississippi.","And so we will invest in regions and sales force based on the estimated return. But we do operate with a principle, when we launch new products and we have multiple new product launches over the next several years, we will always aim to achieve share of voice leadership. And so details and representatives on a routine basis are being reallocated across the product lines so that we can maximize the value of our business. It's a terrific group. They're well compensated and we'll change, but I don't anticipate any fundamental shifts in our sales force model at this point.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. Thanks very much. I have two financial questions and then a BOTOX pricing question. So with respect to the tax rate, I may have missed it earlier, but how should investors think about your go-forward tax rate? And then when you give 2016 financial guidance in February for the standalone company, how should investors think about what you're going to bake in for debt reduction? Meaning that's a huge swing factor in modeling EPS. And maybe you could just talk about how you're thinking about it at a high level at this point.","And then separately on BOTOX pricing, could you just update us on when a decision will come down on whether Allergan will be able to separate pricing for the cosmetic and therapeutic indications, and more appropriately price BOTOX for therapeutic indications? Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","And so, let me take the last first and then Tessa can take the financial ones. We are continuing with our litigation with CMS around bifurcation of pricing. I really don't have an update on that today but it is something that Bob Bailey and the legal team are staying very focused on, and we'll see how that plays out. And as soon as we have an update, we'll certainly provide it but I wouldn't build any expectations in around that. Second, we continue to think about therapeutic BOTOX as with new toxins for the future, but that's a longer-term strategy as well. So I think for the short term, David, I would just view those prices as being coupled.","Maria Teresa Hilado - Chief Financial Officer","So, in the two finance questions, David, I'll address the second one first. We are committed to providing an update in terms of financials similar to what we've done in the past which should be during the Q1 earnings release in February. And by then to the extent that we have more clarity with regards to how we would deploy capital, assuming the Teva transaction would have closed by then, then we will provide you guidance with regards to capital deployment including debt repayment. One thing obviously that we're committed to is the investment grade rating. So to the extent that we don't deploy the capital, we will pay down the amount necessary to maintain the rating on a go-forward basis.","With regards to the tax question, based on our release, what actually occurred because of continuing operations is that the bulk of, or the entire interest expense was actually allocated to continuing operations, hence the low tax rate. On a go-forward basis, that should trend upwards assuming we pay down debt. But we can't really be precise at this point given our restrictions based on Irish law. But it should trend higher based on debt, if we assume debt paydown.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you very much.","Maria Teresa Hilado - Chief Financial Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein.","Ronny Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning everybody. Thank you for taking my questions. A couple of clarifying ones and more of a strategic one. First on BOTOX, you reported 13% constant currency and think about 9% actual results for BOTOX. It's a pretty big difference given how the product is distributed geographically. Can you just give us a little bit more color on the currencies involved?","Second for Bill, fair to say that if Lifitegrast comes to market the end of 2016, we should expect a weaker Restasis in 2017, 2018 essentially, at least in attenuation for a couple of years in growth of that product?","And then, maybe I think is the meme but we're not to supposed to ask it, but more broadly, Brent, you got actually good results this quarter. You seem to be in the process of actually executing what you told us you would. You got the revenue growth that will put you much above your peers. Your multiple is much lower. Doesn't seem like a great time to engage in friendly discussion with another company. Can you help us think about this a little bit?","Maria Teresa Hilado - Chief Financial Officer","So let me address some of the questions. BOTOX itself, the total BOTOX franchise grew year over year by about 7.9%. We obviously had half \u2013 that's BOTOX specifically.","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yeah, I think the 13% pro forma was for the entire branded business.","Maria Teresa Hilado - Chief Financial Officer","Correct.","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","Excluding Namenda IR, divestitures and the impact of foreign exchange is what I said in the prepared remarks.","Maria Teresa Hilado - Chief Financial Officer","Right, but BOTOX itself year over year grew by about 8%, 13% excluding FX.","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","You're looking at the chart versus what I said, Ronny, right?","Ronny Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","No. I'm actually looking at the \u2013 I'm actually looking at your product slide. BOTOX continued strong growth in both therapeutic and cosmetic of more than 13% excluding foreign exchange. This is the slide 8.","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yeah. That's right. It's hard to hear you, Ronny. That's a little bit \u2013 we hear about every second word. Yeah so you got it.","Maria Teresa Hilado - Chief Financial Officer","So it grew 7.9% excluding FX. Stripping out FX, it would be 13%.","Ronny Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. So BOTOX is growing 13% constant currency in the third quarter.","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","That's correct. Yeah.","Maria Teresa Hilado - Chief Financial Officer","Correct.","Ronny Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Is there a reason why the gap between the currency adjusted and non-currency adjusted is so big? Is there a couple of currencies that went particularly bad this quarter?","Maria Teresa Hilado - Chief Financial Officer","I mean it's largely euro. Plus, we had some protection related to certain hedges that flow through.","Ronny Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Douglas Tsao with Barclays.","Douglas D. Tsao - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Can you hear me?","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yeah. We hear you fine. Yeah.","Douglas D. Tsao - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Just maybe if you could offer some perspective on the upcoming VIBERZI launch, especially given what you've seen from the competitive adoption or the adoption of Salix thus far or the Salix Xifaxan so far in IBS-D. That's helpful. Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yeah I mean, well I'll ask Bill to comment, but we're very excited to be launching VIBERZI. The sales force meeting will be next week. I'll be down there for a few days to talk to the sales reps with Bill. But it's going to be \u2013 we're making a big investment in this launch, it's safe to say. Bill, you want to talk about it?","William J. Meury - Executive Vice President and President, Branded Pharma","Yeah. It's the perfect complement to Linzess. IBS should be thought about as a continuum with constipation on one end and diarrhea on the other. And because we're able to market two products to the same condition essentially, we're able to talk about it in a more complete way. And I think it's a competitive advantage. As it relates to the product compared to Xifaxan, it's a completely different approach to treatment. This drug works on motility and visceral pain or hypersensitivity and Xifaxan essentially is an antibiotic. There's certainly room in this category for more than one product.","Promotionally speaking, this will be one of the largest launches in the industry from an investment standpoint. And I'm pretty sure it's going to be the largest launch in gastroenterology. It's going to be very noisy. We know how to do this. We did it with Ironwood during the launch of Linzess. The DTC advertising will start not one year after approval but only three months. And the promotional effort unlike other companies in the area, will capture not only gastroenterologists but primary care physicians. And there's an interplay in almost every category between primary care and specialty that we can navigate that other companies can't. And I would expect that this drug should do as well as Linzess does on the other side of the market, and could ultimately almost double the size of our GI business over the next five years.","Douglas D. Tsao - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Ariel G. Herman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, this is Ariel Herman in for Jami. So someone already asked about pricing for the third quarter, but going forward you have previously provided a CAGR for your expectations for the overall Branded business. Can you just provide some color around what's baked into that regarding price and volume? And then secondly, can you touch on the competitive dynamics with the potential competition to BOTOX from Revance's product? Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yeah so, I think obviously we're under some restriction under Irish law with respect to guidance, but our pricing as I mentioned during my opening remarks, is always a balance. And most of our key growth drivers are, as Bill indicated, predominantly in a volume situation, not a price situation. As we think about price, we tend to think about mid to high single digit price increases across the portfolio. And so we don't really think of any change or expect any change in our very, I think, conservative pricing policy and the way we think about price. And so, we're not going to \u2013 I don't think you're going to see us change our view, or perhaps better said, our commitment to the 10% growth objectives and aspirations that we have. So, I think that's going to stay fairly normalized for the foreseeable future.","I think with respect to Revance and competitive toxins, I'll ask David to comment as well, but I would just remind you that there are competitive toxins already in the market and more, if you talk to customers, very few care about having an extra few weeks or a month of duration or effect for BOTOX or toxins. And in fact, what they mostly complain about is price. And in our competitors' price, their toxin's at a much lower rate than we price BOTOX, and yet BOTOX continues to be a strong market leader. And so I would just urge you to keep perspective. As what Philippe said earlier, we have 2 million members in Brilliant Distinctions. We have a full range of facial aesthetics. We have the largest field force. BOTOX is the number one branded pharmaceutical brand in the world. And so, this is a very strong franchise with very good staying power. And so, sometimes there's a hammer looking for a nail, duration may be just that. But scientifically, maybe David can comment, too.","C. David Nicholson - Executive Vice President, Brand Research & Development","Yeah, happy to talk about that briefly. Clearly, we'll be talking about BOTOX during R&D Day later today. BOTOX of course is a pipeline in a product. We remain committed to continuing to build the pipeline. We will be launching new indications for BOTOX around the world, so extending our aesthetic reach geographically. And we will be developing BOTOX a new therapeutic application. I would point out, if we're talking about duration, that BOTOX in some indications has a duration for up to nine months. So if you're talking about hyperhidrosis for instance, BOTOX works for up to nine months. And so the duration of BOTOX depends on the use and the dose that we administer. More of this during the course of the day as we walk through our R&D pipeline.","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yes, I would just add, David, BOTOX really is a fortress product. It's got a lot of indications, 10 indications. It's got great brand recognition and has supported by the strongest promotional effort, and it's got good and strong clinical science and experience behind it.","Ariel G. Herman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Lisa M. DeFrancesco - Vice President, Investor Relations","Next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI.","Umer Raffat - Evercore ISI","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Two quick ones. First, can you tell us a bit more about the generics this quarter, what the actual sales were, the year-on-year trends and just some commentary there? And number two, Brent, so in an M&A scenario, is there anything legally preventing you from issuing more in shares than your own share count?","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yeah so, Tessa, you want to? She already answered the generic question.","Maria Teresa Hilado - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Some for generic, what I said earlier was that they had good solid performance, performed according to our expectations. We will provide more granularity for discontinued operations in our 10-Q which should be filed in the next couple of days. But revenue-wise, it was at $4.77 billion for the last nine months.","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","And so your other question, Umer, was about share repurchase?","Umer Raffat - Evercore ISI","No sorry, I meant, can you issue, in an M&A scenario where you're issuing equity, is there anything that prevents you from issuing more in equity than your own entire share count?","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","To be fair, I just don't know the answer. Maybe if you could want to follow up, we can talk to the folks who may know the answer to that. I just don't know, Umer.","Umer Raffat - Evercore ISI","Okay. No problem. Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","Okay.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Sumant Kulkarni with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sumant S. Kulkarni - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I have a quick couple. First is in a relatively small part of your business, that's the breast implants. How well is Allergan positioned to take advantage of some of the competitive missteps there? And second on business development, assuming you remain standalone, what are examples of some therapeutic areas that might excite you among the ones that you are not in currently?","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yes. So, I'll ask Philippe to address the breast implant situation and maybe just a quick overview of what happens following closing.","Philippe Schaison - Executive Vice President and President, Allergan Medical","Sure. So as you know, Sientra stopped selling their implant in the US following what happened in Europe where they lost their CE Mark and their manufacturing plant in Brazil got on fire. So right now, we're converting most of Sientra larger account to Allergan, which is a triple win for us because not only we're gaining market share on the breast implant side, but while we're converting those accounts to the breast, we also strengthen our business for our portfolio of fillers and BOTOX. So for us, it's a triple win. We get the breast implant business as well as the filler and the BOTOX.","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","And I think it carries over to Europe as well, right, Paul?","Paul Navarre - Executive Vice President and President, International Brands","Yeah. Internationally, the situation is the same in Europe. I think we've always had the positioning of high-quality implants and top branch service to customers. So I think anytime there is an event like that on the market, we benefit from it being the leader, so we are seeing that and we're seeing transfer of account and demand as well.","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","And I think with respect to potential future therapeutic areas of interest, we're really focused on the seven we're in. When you think about the seven we're in, we still have a lot of white space opportunity. For example, we're number one in aesthetic medicine and a robust pipeline of projects, but yet mostly focused on the face. There's still a whole body to work with in aesthetic medicine and lots of opportunities in eyecare. Obviously, you've seen us do a lot of things recently to support our robust development organization with dry eye and glaucoma. But there's still more things we can do in retina beyond DARPin and Ozurdex, and there's new opportunities there globally as well.","CNS, a strong presence in Alzheimer's and neurology and psychiatry. But we don't participate let's say in, just as an example, MS or Parkinson's or a variety of other conditions that could leverage CNS. And I can go down through the entire seven therapeutic areas and point to a big white space that would allow us to leverage our infrastructure commercially, our R&D capabilities with very little additional costs but expand ourselves into those therapeutic areas. So that's really the goal.","Sumant S. Kulkarni - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Tim Chiang with BTIG.","Tim Chiang - BTIG LLC","Thanks. Brent, could you talk a little bit more about your focus on the GI space heading into next year? Certainly you've got VIBERZI coming online, you've got Linzess. I noticed that the filing of low dose strength of Linzess, the 72 micrograms. Could you talk a little bit about how that low dose might help you in the chronic constipation treatment market, and is VIBERZI going to be the first detail in the GI space in front of Linzess?","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yes, so I think later today we'll talk more about the pipeline. And certainly, we have more than just low dose. We announced with our partner, Ironwood, the colonic release program for Linzess. And then of course, we have very importantly relamorelin moving its way through the clinic. So maybe Bill could just talk about how we view it from a promotional perspective.","William J. Meury - Executive Vice President and President, Branded Pharma","Yeah, the reason we developed the low dose alongside Ironwood, and also the sprinkle formulation which will be introduced, is to accelerate our conversion over the over-the-counter market. I mean most of the sales for Linzess today are being captured by patients who are using over-the-counter medications. And that will be the primary source of growth in the future. A low dose is going to give physicians some optionality, and for patients it may be better tolerated, though Linzess at 145 micrograms and 290 micrograms, based on our estimation, is extremely well tolerated. The average patient is taking close to 120 days of therapy as compared to Amitiza or Zelnorm which were trading at roughly 90 days of therapy.","Broadly speaking, though, it's a great space. And with VIBERZI, we can pool resources for the two products so that each one is going to get a greater level of effort than they would have if marketed independently. And as Brent said, we'll cover more about the pipeline, relamorelin and the other life cycle opportunities, during R&D Day this afternoon.","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","And maybe then Paul Navarre could just touch on our thoughts around Constella and perhaps later (54:22) and other GI opportunities around the world.","Paul Navarre - Executive Vice President and President, International Brands","Yeah, you mentioned it, Brent. GI is a strategic priority for us. So internationally, we're going to steadily create the franchise. And the first step was to actually buy the rights of Linzess in 41 markets internationally. So that's going to be the first step of creating that franchise, and then we're going to wait for the approval hopefully with the launch of (54:49) in 2017. So I think we have a similar ambition internationally for GI.","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","I think that was our last question, right, Lisa?","Lisa M. DeFrancesco - Vice President, Investor Relations","Yes.","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","So, I would just like to conclude by thanking everyone for joining us this morning. As you know, we're going to transition in just a short bit to our R&D Day. And I hope that many of you join us live as well as via webcast for what I hope will be an exciting and interesting and informative session with our R&D colleagues and commercial colleagues.","And I would just like to end by thanking our team around the world for a great quarter. We have quite a few things going on with integrations and divestitures, and our team continues to stay focused on executional excellence and driving results. And I think this quarter was just another in a long string of proof points that we understand our business and we're focused on execution. So thank you very much and hopefully we'll see you all soon.","Lisa M.

These forward-looking statements reflect Allergan's judgment and analysis only as of today, and actual results may differ materially from current expectations based on a number of factors affecting Allergan's businesses.

Under Regulation FD, in order to be able to discuss this information freely during the quarter, we must be sure that it is in the public domain.","This conference call and accompanying webcast are being simultaneously broadcast over the Internet, with replays available for one week. You can access the information on our website at www.allergan.com.","At this point, I would like to turn the call over to David Pyott.","David E. I. Pyott","Great. Thanks, Jim. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Third quarter sales increased strongly over Q3 of 2012 by 14.0% to local currencies and by 12.9% to U.S. dollars. We're delighted that this is the highest growth rate we have delivered in the quarter since 2008, and that the expansion was broad-based across many product lines and businesses.","Furthermore, we're benefiting from our global reach in all of our operating regions, namely North America, Europe, Africa, Middle East. Latin America and Asia Pacific achieved at least double-digit growth in local currencies in the quarter. This is reflective of the strong growth being experienced in our product markets, and in general, of Allergan's market share gains as we introduce the steady stream of new innovative products to our customers around the world.","Regarding operating performance, we generated non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.23, an increase of 18% over Q3 of 2012, and well above the outlook provided on the last call of $1.18 to $1.20, thanks to the robust sales. This result was achieved after we continued to invest both into targeted sales and marketing programs to launch products and build our markets, as well as into R&D.","Regarding progress with our pipeline, we're pleased that we're delivering most of the major regulatory approvals we're seeing for this year. Since the last earnings call, we have received FDA approvals for VOLUMA and BOTOX for crow's feet lines, as well as the first positive opinion from the French agency for crow's feet lines, marking the first step in the mutual recognition procedure, which should lead to approvals for this indication across the 27 countries in the European Union, as well as Norway and Iceland.","Furthermore, we secured approvals for BOTOX for overactive bladder in Canada, the U.K. and a positive opinion in France. Also, the Japanese authorities approved our Natrelle breast implant products, including the round, soft cohesive line; the style 410 shaped anatomical line; as well as the tissue expander range. As such, Allergan is the only company to have regulatory approval for both breast augmentation and reconstruction in Japan. We expect to secure reimbursement for reconstruction post mastectomy around the end of the year.","Our global partnership with Medytox, excluding Korea, is a reflection of our long-term efforts to continue to build the facial aesthetics in therapeutic markets for neuromodulators, and should result in us offering an expanded suites of products, including a potential liquid presentation. The Medytox transaction is contingent upon receiving certain government approvals.","Regarding LEVADEX in the U.S., we're on track for filing by year end, all the data required by FDA in its complete response letter, and anticipate approval in Q2 of 2014. Regarding the disposal of the Obesity Intervention business, we're pleased that we have entered into a definitive agreement with Apollo Endosurgery and expect to close the transaction before year end.","Regarding RESTASIS and FDA's draft guidance in generics of cyclosporine, we're encouraged that 22 medical societies, patient groups and consumer groups submitted comments, all raising concerns about public health and patient safety if generics were to be approved of Allergan's complex oil and water emulsion. It is noteworthy that not one single submission was made in favor of the draft guidance. FDA's officials, even within the generics division, have admitted as recently as June 2013 that equivalents of ophthalmic drugs is \"an emerging topic\" being considered for FDA's regulatory science enhancement initiative.","Allergan has submitted studies of several test emulsions showing that these emulsions that meet the draft guidelines nonetheless significantly differ from RESTASIS. Based on our investigations, FDA has never, in the past, approved an ophthalmic emulsion based solely on in vitro data. In the coming months, the draft guidance has the highest management attention, and we will take every appropriate legal and regulatory action to uphold sound science and patient safety.","Now commenting the performance of the businesses. I'll commence with ophthalmic pharmaceuticals. Allergan sales increased in Q3 by 9.0% in local currencies with mid-single-digit growth in the U.S. being boosted by strong double-digit growth internationally. RESTASIS with 21% growth in local currencies continues to grow very strongly, not only in value, but also in volume, given good response to our increased investment in direct-to-consumer advertising in the U.S. and an expanding base of prescribers in U.S. optometry. In addition, RESTASIS is growing strongly in Canada and Turkey in particular.","In the glaucoma category, we're experiencing a difficult market in the U.S., and low Q3 growth for LUMIGAN given the impact of generics of major patent expired products. Ex-U.S., we enjoyed strong double-digit growth for both the bimatoprost and brimonidine franchises in the quarter, and are pleased that per IMS data for Q2, that's the last period for which data is available, the LUMIGAN became the #1 selling glaucoma product in the world.","In Europe, we launched GANFORT unit dose in September into the preservative-free category in the first wave of countries, namely in Germany, the Netherlands and the U.K., adding to the launches of LUMIGAN unit dose earlier in the year. In the U.S., we're encouraged that 2014 LUMIGAN formulary coverage in Part D and in commercial plans will be broadly similar to the situation in 2013. And now that we have converted all of the prescriptions over to the improved LUMIGAN 0.01% product, that we can concentrate all our efforts onto growing the brand again.","Regarding the world ophthalmic market per IMS for Q2, IMS shows first half of the year growth of the market at a robust 12%, boosted by 28% growth in retinal therapeutics and Allergan growing end market at 11%. For glaucoma, IMS reports world market growth at only 3% for the first half, given the U.S. situation, with Allergan worldwide growth at a healthy 10%.","Regarding the LUMIGAN franchise, IMS reports LUMIGAN and GANFORT growing double digits in Europe, Africa, Middle East, Latin America, Canada and Asia Pacific, as well as in Japan by Allergan's local partner, Senju, and also outperforming the growth of the Travatan franchise in each of these geographies. Going forward, we expect to benefit from Merck's deemphasis of ophthalmology worldwide.","For the artificial tears category, IMS, for the first half, shows a world market growth of 6% with Allergan underperforming with only 1% growth, given our priority on RESTASIS where it is available. Growth is, however, picking up from the introduction of OPTIVE Advanced, sold as OPTIVE Plus and plus unit dose in Europe, which was recently approved in Mexico, Chile and Turkey. In September, we also launched an exciting new product, OPTIVE Fusion [ph], a breakthrough combination of 2 effective polymers, hyaluronic acid and carboxy methylcellulose, in Italy, Spain, Portugal and Belgium, and we'll roll this product out across the world outside the U.S.","In the U.S., hyaluronic acid is not monographed as an OTC ingredient for ophthalmic pharmaceuticals. This is Allergan's first entry into the hyaluronic acid peer segment, which in Europe accounts for about 20% of the overall market.","OPTIVE Fusion will address the aqueous deficient segment, the dry eye market, while OPTIVE Plus offers relief to the lipid efficient dry eye sufferer.","OZURDEX growth continues on a sharp trajectory driven particularly by Europe and the U.S. We recently received reimbursement pricing in Brazil.","Moving on to BOTOX, sales in Q3 increased by 13.9% to local currencies, in line with year-to-date local currency growth of 13.6%, with year-to-date double-digit growth in both the aesthetic and therapeutic franchises.","Regarding the global market up to Q2, the last period for which data is available, we estimate first half of the year growth at 14%, with Allergan also growing at 14%. Allergan has gained some share in therapeutics as we established the new categories of Chronic Migraine in neurology, offset by some minor share loss in aesthetics as new products enter the market around the world.","Since the last earnings call, we received several major BOTOX product approvals, some referenced early in my comments, but in addition, BOTOX was approved for Chronic Migraine in Norway, for neurogenic bladder in Taiwan and for overactive bladder in Korea, Russia, the Czech Republic and Qatar.","In the U.S., the therapeutic business continues to grow strongly, driven by Chronic Migraine, the 2 bladder indications and an increased growth in neuro rehabilitation, the latter benefiting from a sales force expansion we executed at the end of 2012, and also due to the downsizing of Ipsen's commercial presence in the U.S. in the spring.","Regarding Chronic Migraine, we enjoyed broad access with 93% of commercial lines and 100% of Medicare lines having policy coverage and are continuing to improve results in the prior authorization process to drive down denial rates.","We have a steady flow of new injectors trained and adopting BOTOX into their practices and continuing high levels of product satisfaction, both by patients and their doctors. And emphasis is now in shepherding patients through their first year of treatment, helping to ensure patients become loyal repeat users, and also in decreasing the interval between injections closer to the labeled indication of every 3 months. In order to further build this market, we have invested heavily into branded TV advertising since July to increase patient awareness and to encourage patients to find a trained specialist.","Metrics regarding awareness, website visits and doctor searches are all trending positively.","Regarding urology, sales are on an even stronger upswing than in Chronic Migraine, albeit off a smaller base. Regarding reimbursement, we're able to secure coverage in some major commercial plans in September, with now 79% of all commercial lines enjoying policy coverage. 82% of Medicare lines have coverage.","Over 3,000 urologists are regular injectors out of an overall universe of all urologists at just over 10,000, many of which, of course, do not address incontinence. Urogynecologist, the subspecialty focused on female incontinence, is a group particularly focusing on this treatment option.","Preparing for further major growth in 2014, we're currently deepening our geographic reach by adding a modest number of field representatives in the United States. In Europe and the countries where we have secured reimbursement, we're satisfied with the initial demand for BOTOX for Chronic Migraine and for bladder, as well as with our continuing growth in the base movement disorders categories.","Turning to the aesthetic side of the BOTOX franchise, we enjoyed strong growth in Q3 in most of the principal markets of the world, with only a few exceptions where there are competitive products being introduced, such as is the case in Canada, Australia, Korea and Mexico. We're enjoying very strong end market growth in Russia, Japan, China, most countries in the East and South Asia and Brazil.","In the U.S., based on survey data, market growth in Q3 has accelerated to the low double digits. Furthermore, it is encouraging that BOTOX Cosmetic in September enjoyed 82% share and exactly the same as in September of 2012, with Xeomin share at 5% and the year-over-year gain coming at the expense of this quarter.","In Western Europe, we estimate that the market in Q3 is growing mid to high single digits and that we're currently holding share.","Facial aesthetics in Q3 grew strongly at 21.3% year-over-year in local currencies, in line with year-to-date growth, with all regions of the world registering strong growth levels. Of course, the market is poised for a further strong upswing with the recent FDA approval for VOLUMA and the introduction of our by-credit cost technology, including VOLBELLA and VOLIFT, to markets around the world. VOLBELLA was launched in Australia and Korea in September, VOLIFT in Australia. In the U.S., we're rapidly organizing training sessions for VOLUMA for our customers from mid-November, after which we will ship product. This is anticipated all to occur around mid-November.","In the U.S., based on survey data, we believe that the market in Q3 grew mid-single digits in volume. In Q3, JUV\u00c9DERM was at a market share high with over 35% with year-over-year share gains coming from Restylane and RADIAS [ph].","In Europe, survey data for Q2, the last period for which data is available, shows the market continuing to expand strongly in the double digits, with Allergan leading this growth with the introduction of our new innovative products and rapidly gaining market share. We're encouraged that even markets in Southern Europe are enjoying strong growth.","Performance in the Breast Aesthetics business continued to improve in Q3, with year-over-year growth at 7.5% to local currencies versus year-to-date growth standing at 1.4%. This is due to Europe now coming past the periods in 2012 when the market and Allergan sales surged as a consequence of the PIP scandal and the consequent need for revision surgery.","In addition, we're benefiting in 2013 from the U.S. introduction of the shaped 410 Natrelle implant, continuing mix shift from low-price saline to higher-priced round and shaped gel implants, as well as an initial stocking shipment to Japan.","In Europe, our survey data for Q2 shows that the market end units declined 8% year-over-year due to the PIP issue, and is 7% smaller than in Q2 of 2011. Offsetting this is the market share gains Allergan has made since 2011.","Given the growth in Allergan's Q3 sales in the European region, we're assuming that the Q3 market has posted some recovery. In the U.S., based on survey data, the market is posting low volume growth, and we're willing to concede some market share due to low pricing from Mentor, which has really placed an emphasis on this, whereas Allergan is concentrated in the mix shift to value-added products and service.","Our skin care and other franchise grew 52.0% in Q3 year-over-year, boosted by the acquisition of SkinMedica and offset by a steep decline in SANCTURA XR as the product is being genericized. In terms of real performance, sales of our U.S. medical dermatology products increased 64% in Q3.","Turning to ACZONE, with diminished brand competition and a successful investment since June in direct-to-consumer advertising targeted at the adult female patient, ACZONE is growing rapidly, with the year-to-date August increase in turning prescriptions, per IMS, of 34% in a market growing only 2%. TAZORAC is also benefiting from our focus on the acne market, growing year-to-date trailing prescriptions by 11% and the retinoid market growing 4%.","Regarding real performance of our topical physician dispensed Skin Care business, we're pleased that SkinMedica is substantially outperforming in the U.S. market due to the benefits occurring to customers who are purchasing a full range of aesthetic products from Allergan, as well as due to our sales force presence.","Regarding LATISSE, sales increased in Q3 by 4.9% to local currencies with modest growth in the U.S. boosted by strong growth off a small base in Canada and Brazil.","I'll now pass over to Jeff Edwards who will comment our financial performance.","Jeffrey L. Edwards","Thanks, David, and good morning to all of you on the call. During the quarter, Allergan continued to demonstrate long-term strength of its business model by delivering strong sales and earnings performance. Our ability to exceed our EPS expectations is true reflection of the depth and breadth of Allergan's business and our strong competitive position within each of our specialty areas of focus. Our commitment to diligently managing expenses and thoughtfully targeting investments enabled the company to deliver non-GAAP diluted EPS results above the top end of our expectations.","Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2013 were $1.23, with growth of 18% compared to the third quarter of 2012 from continuing operations. A reconciliation of all of the adjustments to GAAP earnings is set out in our earnings release. Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments, amortization of acquired intangibles and discontinued ops, Allergan's Q3 2013 gross margin of 87.4% increased 90 basis points when compared to Q3 of the prior year, which was driven primarily by improved standard costs and the continuation of favorable pricing, region and product line mix, as well as positive royalty dynamics led by substantially reducing to our royalties.","The non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses to product and sales ratio from continuing operations for the third quarter was 38.1%, totaling $583 million. The comparable ratio and expense value for the same period in 2012 were 38.4% and $520 million, respectively. Consistent with our historic trend, we anticipate a sequential reduction in the non-GAAP SG&A expense to net sales ratio in the fourth quarter of 2013.","Non-GAAP research and development expenses were 16.4% of product mix sales for the quarter, totaling $251 million, an increase in spend of approximately $24 million over the $227 million or 16.8% of product net sales spent in the third quarter of 2012.","With respect to our balance sheet, consolidated Allergan sales outstanding was 54 days, while consolidated Allergan inventory days on hand was 133 days. This quality 54-day DSO result has been generated in spite of continuing ongoing upward pressure related to trends to longer terms in certain foreign markets and emerging markets.","With respect to end-of-quarter DOH levels, they are slightly higher than previous quarters due primarily to the JUV\u00c9DERM VOLUMA inventory build in anticipation of the recently received U.S. approval.","In the third quarter, operating cash flow after CapEx was approximately $545 million. On a year-to-date basis, operating cash flow after CapEx was just over $1 billion. At the end of the third quarter, Allergan's cash and equivalents and short-term investments in cash and equivalents and short-term investments net of debt positions totaled approximately $3.2 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively.","We currently project capital expenditures to be in the range of $150 million to $200 million for the full year of 2013.","Regarding full year expectations for 2013, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $6,125,000,000 to $6,200,000,000, and our full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.74 and $4.76, which includes -- excludes the impact of the 2012 R&D tax credit reported in 2013 as a non-GAAP adjustment and includes the $0.07 estimated dilution impact related to the MAP Pharmaceuticals acquisition.","With respect to the divestiture of the Obesity Intervention business on October 28, 2013, Allergan entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Obesity Intervention business to Apollo Endosurgery for an upfront cash payment of $75 million, subject to certain adjustments and certain additional considerations. The transaction is expected to close in 2013, subject to customary closing conditions. For your information, expectations for other lines of the income statement and specific product sales expectations are included in the current release.","With that, operator, I'd like now to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Ronny Gal with Sanford Bernstein.","Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","The question's about BOTOX. Can you tell us a little bit about the price per unit of BOTOX? Has there been upward pressure on the product? And should we think about the liquid talks as launching both aesthetic and therapeutic, or are you likely to target that product into 1 of the 2 market segments?","David E. I. Pyott","Ronny, I missed the point on upward pressure. It sounded good, but I want to answer precisely what you're driving at. I like upward pressure.","Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So we obviously do a survey of aesthetic franchise every quarter. We noticed that some of the physicians were discussing fewer discounts on the lower end of the market, which suggests as to what upward pressure on price per unit of BOTOX in the United States.","David E. I. Pyott","Yes, okay. I'll take that question first. Clearly, if one looks at the baseline of 2012 when we naturally expected the reintroduction of Xeomin, why it's a market share leader, not only invest to grow the category, but also to defend. And if we now then move a year later, obviously, when you start, let's say, doing less promotional activity, you do have a good effect in terms of net selling prices post direct-selling reductions from list to net. So good work being done in terms of net price realized. Your second question regarded our collaboration with Medytox and liquid. Clearly, liquid would have predominantly greatest interest in aesthetics, but we're also looking at some other things with Medytox as well. It's a very interesting company in Korea with good science.","Operator","The next question is from Ken Cacciatore with Cowen & Co.","Ken Cacciatore - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Just the question is if you look at -- you have a very clean balance sheet and you've combined that with a global commercial platform. It would seem obvious to many of us that you should be hoping or seeking to leverage your balance sheet more aggressively. But when we talked to investors, some argue that there aren't actually many assets available in your therapeutic categories or in aesthetic and derm. So it's an issue that you'd like to be more aggressive, but can't find the assets? Or you just don't think being more aggressive with a balance sheet is necessary or wise here?","David E. I. Pyott","Okay. So this is always the acquisition question. We're constantly looking at various deals that can be acquisitions of companies, they can be licenses, they can be collaborations. And I think if you just run your eye across our press release, you can see, just in the last 3 months, we've done some things, although they haven't really devoured vast amounts of cash. So clearly, let me restate what has always been the overarching goal, which is to put our balance sheet to work. But of course, you also want us as investors to be good stewards of our capital and invest and acquire wisely, both for good strategic reasons and also for good return.","Operator","The next question is from Douglas Tsao with Barclays.","Douglas D. Tsao - Barclays Capital, Research Division","David, I was just hoping you could perhaps provide some context for the new approvals that you've had recently in the Aesthetics business, in particular, VOLUMA, as well as BOTOX for crow's feet. I suspect or we've heard that there are sort of off-label use of those products and those sort of indications already, but obviously, new approvals allow you to market into the -- into them, specifically. So can you help us understand how you expect to sort of capitalize on this and how significant are these approvals?","David E. I. Pyott","Okay, so let's take VOLUMA first. This is a product that clearly has been heavily expected by, particularly, the key opinion leaders because those are the people that typically travel to conferences in Europe and indeed Latin America and Asia. And so they've heard from their colleagues, sometimes they've observed their colleagues injecting this product. As I've shared in my remarks, if we look at already robust market growth in Europe post VOLUMA introduction, VOLBELLA, VOLIFT, Allergan is growing of the order of 2x faster than the market. So you know who the locomotive is. Also, as a reminder, if we look at Canada, which is probably the most similar market to the U.S., not just due to geographic proximity, but other reasons, I estimate that the introduction of VOLUMA added to probably about 40% market growth over about a 2-year period. So clearly, the U.S. is a bigger market, you got to be careful with applying percentages to a bigger and bigger breadbox. But clearly, we're going to have, really, a dramatic effect and we're going to invest very heavily in training. Coming back on to BOTOX for crow's feet, that will be the only area where you'd be correct, that there has been some off-label use of BOTOX for crow's feet around the world where there are some markets, however, where it is already indicated. The real advantage for us is now that we can conduct training because, of course, we always want to ensure great results by as many of our injectors as possible. And the only way to address these issues was through medical affairs hitherto extremely inefficient and now, we command training programs. And I think it's going to also reinject reasons -- (reinject) and really create more stimulus for physicians to go back for advanced injector training. And that will have a benefit not just on crow's feet, but for the indicated -- hitherto indicated for head lines as well. So these things are really significant. And I think when you reflect upon all of my market share data, you can see the world consumer is alive and well, even in places like Southern Europe where I still -- maybe I'm not that surprised because I live there, but I'm amazed by just how much consumers still have money in their pocket to remain looking great.","Operator","The next question is from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","David, I can't imagine that you're very happy with Allergan's share price performance over the past 2 years, we're now approaching through the second year of underperformance, and the lack of transparency on the sustainability of the generic RESTASIS franchise continues to create investor anxiety. Can the company -- I know you've already commented upon -- on VD [ph], but can you comment on your sense of urgency to explore other value-enhancing opportunities? You do have tremendous balance sheet capacity, you have tremendous restructuring capacity. How high a priority is this, just given the years of underperformance? And as a related question, are there any scenarios ahead of May 2014 where investors can gain visibility on whether there are ANDAs on file for generic RESTASIS?","David E. I. Pyott","Okay. So first of all, if you reflect upon my remarks about RESTASIS, our absolute conviction is that the science just isn't there for creating bioequivalence based on an in vitro pathway alone. Now obviously, we're taking every possible step that we can, also to try and educate those in the agency that are willing to listen to us. We've commented upon our test emulsions being completely different than RESTASIS. However, following, if you like, the cookbook that they put out, that would suggest that the cookbook just doesn't work. Now, how the agency, meaning the generics division, will comment in the public domain, one can only conjecture. That's their business to do their business. So in a nutshell on RESTASIS, we're planning clearly to uphold good science and patient safety. That being said, we're not ostriches around here. We do think about scenarios and we've clearly talked about our ability to restructure, if it became necessary. Jeff, on the last call, also remarked about our ability to buy back stock should we be required to do so in a negative scenario. And I think earlier, when I was addressing the issue of acquisitions, it's quite clear that we have a lot of capacity for acquisitions, and we do our homework quietly and discreetly. And you do see some activity from us. And maybe one day, there'll be something bigger. You just -- like you saw back in 2006 when we acquired Inamed.","Operator","The next question is from Marc Goodman with UBS.","Marc Harold Goodman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","David, you mentioned glaucoma is an area...","David E. I. Pyott","Can you speak up, Marc, just so I get all your points.","Marc Harold Goodman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I'm sorry. David, you mentioned that glaucoma was an area of weakness in the quarter, tough third quarter in the U.S. I think you said it was due to generics impacting now, and I was a little confused why are the generics impacting more this quarter than they have in the past. And then secondly, can you just update us on emerging markets? How's the growth going there and what are some new countries that you're looking to expand in over the next year or so?","David E. I. Pyott","Okay. So if we look at glaucoma, you can really see it's a tale of 2 different cities because if we look at LUMIGAN, year-to-date, the number happens to be the same. We've had a double-digit decline in sales of LUMIGAN in the United States, offset by double-digit growth or literally, internationally, meaning the whole conglomerate of the rest of the world x United States. So very different market conditions. Now to be fair beyond LUMIGAN alone, of course, we have the benefits overseas of GANFORT and now, we have the introduction of LUMIGAN unit dose, most recently, GANFORT unit dose. And preservative-free in Europe is probably of the order of 5%, 6% of the overall glaucoma category. So I'm just giving you the context. It's not going to change the course of LUMIGAN growth, but it's a nice, little additional booster. So another positive thing coming back to United States is we've now completed the switch from 0.03%, the original product, to 0.01%. That clearly consumes some energy to make sure that happen logistically with as many prescribers as possible. Now that's behind us, we can really focus on growing the brand again. We have some good data in the marketplace, recent studies conducted by Medical Affairs showing that when patients move from another prostaglandin to LUMIGAN, they can get an additional drop in pressure of the order of 3 or 4 millimeters of mercury. And we know from our interactions with glaucoma specialists that this data is quite compelling to them. So I'm being careful to look for silver linings in black clouds, but in recent months, there does seem to be a little bit of an uptick in volume of prescriptions and growth year-over-year. Looking at emerging markets, historically, we've been growing in the upper teens. That continues to be the case, we have some really good growth numbers. When you think back not just on my comments on this call, but prior ones in terms of all the product introductions we've been receiving, it's pretty easy to work out that the BRIC countries, if we just want to take a subset, Brazil, Russia, India, China are all doing well. For us, Japan is kind of an emerging market, although, of course, it's not, for most, just due to the history of the spinoff of AMO a decade ago. And so Japan is also in a really good upswing right now, both directly through Allergan for aesthetics, breast prosthetics just on the cusp. And then we don't see the sales, but we see the economic benefit of the success of GSK with BOTOX Therapeutics and Senju with our glaucoma products. And Jeff kind of makes remarks, and that explains why the royalty receipts are growing quite healthily. In terms of new markets, ones we're looking at next are ones like Vietnam, Indonesia. We're deepening our presence in the Middle East. We're going to create a hub in Dubai. I was just listening today about the huge new airport they're constructing. It is really a zone of enormous activity right now. And we're also further out looking at not just North Africa where we're present, but other parts of Africa, because the time will come in the next 5 to 10 years. And there is an increase in disposable income and improved physician training, which is the real key, of course, for our products. So I hope that gives you a good overview of all of those things. And a comment I would make about the health of our markets, I think many analysts and investors underestimate the carrying power of our long list of approvals since 2010, which number no less than 11. And as you know, products don't suddenly happen in a year. They take 5, 6 years typically to get to peak.","Operator","The next question is from Seamus Fernandez with Leerink.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","So just a quick question on -- if you can provide us with an update on the progress with LEVADEX. And again, David, how you would see LEVADEX enhancing and sitting into the BOTOX market? And if you would seek to expand the sales force early on next year to promote that product, should we see -- should we see approval prospects being positive?","Scott M. Whitcup","So this is Scott. I'll take the first part of the question and turn it over to David in terms of marketing and positioning. So on the LEVADEX, as David said, we've been gathering the data required to answer all the questions from the FDA's complete response letter. We believe that currently, in-house, we have those data. We'll put together our response, and as we stated, have that submitted back to FDA by the end of the year. Currently, by timelines, they would have a couple of quarters to go through that, which is why we'd said we expect approval second quarter of 2014.","David E. I. Pyott","Right. So coming back to the marketing side of the house, I don't want to say that delay is ever a good thing, but at least, it's given us the opportunity to single-mindedly focus on establishing BOTOX for Chronic Migraine in neurology practices. So delay is never good, but at least, we've had no distraction of trying to establish 2 products simultaneously. That being said, we think the call overlap with BOTOX for Chronic Migraine is extremely high. This will be a sales visit where you can just roll straight from one product into the other. Regarding coverage beyond the neurology specialty alone, we've been very careful to limit the amount of training capacity we offer to non-board-certified neurologists so far. And as that capacity becomes available, then we extend. So I think the best way to think about a bigger move into expanding sales force into the very top end of other specialties. And I think the word PCP is probably not right because when you really look at these physicians, they're not board-certified neurologists, but they certainly look like neurologists when you see what they prescribe. And being a practical kind of person, at that point, I don't really care what kind of doctor you are long as you're qualified and knowledgeable. So in summary, I think the expansion into the top end of others will occur sometime in 2015, following on from Scott's remark that we expect product approval in Q2. So we want to focus on the neurology specialty first and then go for expansion.","Operator","The next question is from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","David, my question is about pricing. Generally speaking, I think that most investors, including me, think of Allergan as having upside to price in various categories of its business. So my question is can you comment on the Mentor price pressure in a little bit more detail and then talk about opportunities for price inflation in other areas at the company, in particular, for BOTOX?","David E. I. Pyott","Yes. I think when you reflect upon my comments, if I take -- let's take the Aesthetics business first. You'll see that we've done a pretty good job of mix shift inside the Breast Aesthetics business. So we've avoided what I'd call price discounting practice by others. And maybe, to some degree, it's a fight between the 2 other companies trying to -- it's a little bit of a race to the bottom. We have abstained from that, particularly in the United States. When you think about my comments about dermal fillers, there are 2 we've done, I think, a good job, where new products that are better performers in terms of delivery of results. And we look at the VOLUMA label, which is a very favorable, saying, duration up to 2 years. And quite frankly, one of the reasons VOLUMA took so long to get approved was FDA needed to see the long-term data that this product does indeed, as it should, hyaluronic acid go away. So as much as I was frustrated waiting, as they say, sometimes the best things take time. And I don't want to say JUV\u00c9DERM is like or VOLUMA's like great wine, red wine, but it is a great product. So lots of good mix shifts both within breast aesthetics, as well as fillers. And I think, clearly, in the past, I've signaled that we believe a time will come where it's time to take some very modest increases of price for BOTOX as well, given that we haven't had a price increase in the United States for, I could be wrong in my numbers, but it's like 2008. So you can do the math, it's a long time. And clearly, we're -- on the therapeutic side, we're the one and only in migraine and neurology. And BOTOX, in the scheme of biologics, is a very, very economical product to payors and with great results. So overall, I'd like to tell you a good outlook for pricing. And of course, one thing I admitted to answer on the last call is, of course, for next year, LEVADEX is another nice growth driver as we indeed we expect OZURDEX for DME to be both in the U.S. and Europe.","Operator","Greg Gilbert with Bank of America.","Gregory B. Gilbert - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I have a 2-part question on capital deployment. David, one element of your acquisition strategy has been to find companies that can offer 10% or better revenue growth. I was wondering though if you and the board are open to deals that create economic value and add to franchise value even if they don't meet that revenue growth threshold. And then as a follow-up to your comments on share buyback, it sounds like you view that as an emergency lever rather than something that could be a good idea near-term. Any comments on that?","David E. I. Pyott","Right. Well, why don't I take the last one first where I would be personally disappointed if we just were to go into a stock repurchase program because we're unable to find any other better ways to deploy our capital. Now, that being said, if Jim Hindman has some ridiculous sum of money in his treasury, even I get off my throne and become practical, right? Then your question on profile of potential companies, clearly, we're looking to franchises that have growth potential because Allergan is a growth company. Assuming that we manage our way through the generic challenges of LUMIGAN and RESTASIS, we have really good growth outlook for the coming 5 or so years. So then answering your question on assets that might not have such great growth profile, one could extract huge synergies, and therefore, get growth that way. I would be much more skeptical about them, although like everything, if there was a real compelling story that I believe there was a multi-year benefit that Allergan would be a company with greater and improved strategic position at the end of that, then that's something I would consider. So I'm not so adamant to say never, but I would certainly be looking with quite skeptical eyes on why would we be doing something like that. I'm not really interested in same strategic position, just cutting the haircut of cost for 1 or 2 years and then arguing that we're a better company at the end. I don't think you as investors would particularly believe us either.","Operator","David Maris with BMO Capital Markets.","David W. Maris - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","On the pipeline, can you tell us what you expect out of the upcoming AAO? And in particular...","James M. Hindman","David, could you speak up a little bit?","David W. Maris - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Maybe you could just tell us a little bit of what you expect from the upcoming AAO, in particular on DARPin, what should investors look for in the data or ignore in the data that would give any insight into why a fixed dose regimen might work?","Scott M. Whitcup","So David, this is Scott. On the DARPin data, our plan is to go through the full Phase II program. So as we've said, there's 3 stages to that program. The first, stage 1 was a dose escalation. I think from there, you'll get some idea on efficacy in duration. The Stage II was a randomized comparison to RESENTIS [ph], but as we've said, there was PRN [ph] treatment and no loading doses. So from there, I think you'll have to realize that the key data to give you an understanding of what you might expect in Phase III is the typical paradigm where patients receive 3 monthly loading doses and then you go to a fixed schedule. That, we're investigating in the Stage III. We'll talk about the study design, but we'll not have data from that last stage. I tend to ignore no data so I wouldn't ignore anything, but I think there'll be enough data for investors and physicians and scientists to understand the potential of DARPin and to understand the decisions we've made on the development program. And that will be presented at the Retina Subspeciality Day, which is just before the official AAO meeting.","Operator","David Buck with Buckingham Research Group.","David G. Buck - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","First, David, for the Japanese market for breast implants, can you talk a little bit about the...","James M. Hindman","David, can you talk up? I'm sorry, we can't hear.","David G. Buck - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","So on Japan and breast augmentation, can you talk a little bit about the pace of the rollout? For glaucoma in the U.S., can you talk about whether you're still expecting to see a soft market and some of the same dynamics in 2014? And then for RESTASIS generics, can you talk about what needs to happen for the FDA to, in fact, basically backtrack on their draft guidance, what are the next steps?","David E. I. Pyott","Okay. So the first question was on timing of rollout of Japan breast aesthetics line. As I've stated, x factory, there is a small initial stocking effect already in Q3. There'll probably be a little bit more in Q4 in terms of getting real sales underway that will start from the beginning of '14. Looking at the U.S. glaucoma market, I commented in my prepared remarks that formulary coverage for LUMIGAN is pretty much the same across the board for both commercial plans and Part D. So my expectation is that we will start gaining a little bit of market share in LUMIGAN in 2014 given the data we have and the focus we have on the product. And finally, in terms of predicting what generics division will do on RESTASIS, I really wish I was a soothsayer, but I'm not. And all I can do is take the appropriate action on our side. And I suppose one question that hasn't been asked that I should be addressing is to say some people say, well, will we know if and when you file the citizens' petition? And the answer is maybe we won't have to. But clearly, if the agency doesn't take the appropriate action, we'll be given no other recourse. And when that filing occurs, it becomes public extremely quickly. So that means everybody knows at the same time.","Operator","The next question is from Liav Abraham with Citi.","Liav Abraham - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a question on long-term guidance.","David E. I. Pyott","We can't hear you. If you could talk really closely into the microphone, please.","Liav Abraham - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So my question is on long-term guidance. Can you concern that you're still confident in your aspirational targets of medium-term, double-digit earnings growth? And then also earlier this year, you spoke about 10% medium-term topline organic growth. Is this something that you are still comfortable with? And can you remind us of the primary drivers that will help you attain this goal given the incremental pressures to your drive franchise, not just from a generic, but also from potential incremental brand of competition?","David E. I. Pyott","Right. Well, I mean, I think if you first of all reflect upon my remarks about upholding good science and patient safety for RESTASIS, I believe that we can be successful in defending the RESTASIS franchise for quite a long length of time. So that's a very important starting point. Nobody has directly asked me the question about the LUMIGAN patent trial. The way that I would put that in context is to say the general arguments about the novelty of the formulations and the patents are extremely similar to all of the other glaucoma patent trials that we've gone through in the last, call it, 10 years. That being said, of course, and some of you know that I'm a lawyer, every time you go to court, you have a different judge and a different jury. And patents are both swords and shields. And when you put them up for attack, you cannot guarantee that you'll win on every occasion. So I have to give that a fair balance. So those 2 things stated, assuming that we're successful in defending RESTASIS from inappropriate bioequivalence and in vitro assays and we prevail in the LUMIGAN trial, the outlook for this company looks strong. And I can reiterate about 10 percentage revenue growth and double-digit earnings growth on a non-GAAP basis. And when you think through why I say that, that is because almost all of our markets worldwide are in good growth situation. Even in glaucoma, when you read the transcript or maybe you jotted it down, end market, IMS reports Allergan growing 10% year-to-date June in glaucoma, which is pretty good considering that the market only grew 3% also per IMS worldwide year-to-date June. And think about the 11 products we've had approved since the end of 2010, if I just take the FDA data, let alone all the other incremental approvals we've had, whether it be in Europe or Asia or elsewhere. And I do give you a lot of detail on that on every call. So some really good metrics, some good situations to give us really carrying power for the next 5 or so years. And that, of course, stating the obvious again, is all based on things we know today and no fantasies of the acquisition or license deal that's just around the corner. We never count those until they're signed.","Operator","The next question is from Annabel Samimy with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Annabel Samimy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Most of them have been answered, but I did note that a common theme here are on OZURDEX. It was growing sharply and that you also mentioned that it's one of the medium-term growth drivers in DME. So can you help us understand that market a little bit, what sharply means, and how big does the DME opportunity offer to you?","David E. I. Pyott","Right. So why don't Scott handle, if you like, the medical condition side first and then I'll add some color in terms of how big this could be.","Scott M. Whitcup","So in terms of diabetic macular edema, OZURDEX has been approved for 2 relatively small indications of uveitis and retinal vein occlusion. Because of the epidemic in diabetes, unfortunately, the number of patients with diabetic eye disease is exploding. There are anti-VEGF therapies out there that have been approved, but if you look at the data, there is a significant proportion of patients, some studies, approximately 30%, who either don't respond well to the anti-VEGFs or who need additional therapy. And we believe that the data will support that OZURDEX is a great treatment for diabetic macular edema and that they're, even with anti-VEGF therapy, a huge unmet need. In addition, OZURDEX has given approximately every 6 months. And for patients who have the burden of requiring oftentimes monthly injections, this is a great alternative. So we believe that the DME approval will help further spur growth of OZURDEX. And I'll turn it over to David in terms of the growth rate.","David E. I. Pyott","Yes, well, considerable means of the order of magnitude of 50%. I think to give investors a greater handle on this, we will certainly consider once DME's approved, sharing what are the sales with you because I certainly appreciate seeing is believing. And I think another thing also that probably has, to some degree, confused investors is the fact that we're so dramatically outselling OZURDEX in Europe relative to the United States. And with all respect for you, of course, most of you are based in the United States, and naturally, you then tend to consult key opinion leaders in this country, and that is totally normal, whereas in Europe, there are some markets that are very, very strong for OZURDEX. In fact, when I look at our patient share, now don't get confused between patient share and value share, given that LUCENTIS is -- and [indiscernible] are very expensive products, we're in the double-digit number in terms of patient share in retinal disease. So that gives you a little bit of an insight on what could be coming down the road.","Operator","The last question is from Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse.","Vamil Divan - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So just one quick one. I know -- I appreciate the comments you've made around...","James M. Hindman","Can you please speak up? I'm sorry, we can't hear on this end.","Vamil Divan - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Sure, sorry. I appreciate the comments you made around RESTASIS and around the FDA. Now just around the RESTASIS X, if there's any comments you can provide regarding, if nothing else, just timing, how long that might be...","James M. Hindman","Yes, Vamil, it's cutting out. [Technical Difficulty]","Vamil Divan - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just about RESTASIS X, if you can provide any color around the potential for that product in terms of timing and how long it would take to get through a Phase III potential to the market?","Scott M. Whitcup","Okay. So what we've said is that you will see posted on clinicaltrials.gov approximately end of this year that the study design for RESTASIS X, it will give you some insight into what the product is for competitive reasons we haven't settled out. But that study will be a Phase II. So although we're excited about the potential, it's still a bit away from Phase III in the market. But you'll get some initial insight end of this year and then we'll start talking more about what it is subsequently.","James M. Hindman","We'd like to thank you for your participation today.

After today's prepared remarks, we will have time for a question-and-answer session.","Thank you. It is now my pleasure to turn the call to Lisa DeFrancesco to begin. Please go ahead.","Lisa M. DeFrancesco - Allergan Plc","Thank you, Maria, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to the Allergan fourth quarter and full-year 2016 earnings conference call.","Earlier this morning, we issued a press release reporting Allergan earnings from continuing operations for the quarter and full year ended December 31, 2016. The press release and our slide deck which we are presenting this morning are available on our corporate website at www.allergan.com.","In the press release table, you'll notice we're using the term performance net income per share, which is the equivalent to what we used to call adjusted non-GAAP net income per share. This is a change in nomenclature only. There's no change to the calculation of this or any other Allergan reported metric.","We are conducting a live webcast of this call, a replay of which will be available on our website after its conclusion. Please note that today's call is copyrighted material of Allergan and cannot be rebroadcast without the company's express written consent.","Turning to slide 2 and our cautionary statements related to forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures, I'd also like to remind you that during the course of this call, management will make projections or other forward-looking remarks regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. It's important to note that such statements and events are forward-looking statements and reflect our current perspective of the business trends and information as of today's date. Actual results may differ from current expectations and projections depending on a number of factors affecting the Allergan business. These factors are detailed in our periodic public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Allergan disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements except as expressly required by law.","Turning to slide 3 and our agenda for this morning, with us on today's call are: Brent Saunders, our Chairman and CEO, who will provide an overview of our fourth quarter business highlights; Bill Meury, our Chief Commercial Officer, who will provide an overview of our commercial performance in the quarter; David Nicholson, our Chief R&D Officer, who will provide highlights from our pipeline achievements in 2016 and upcoming milestones. And Tessa Hilado, our Chief Financial Officer, will then discuss the Allergan fourth quarter continuing operations results in more detail. Also on the call and available during the Q&A are Rob Stuart, our Chief Operating Officer, and Bob Bailey, our Chief Legal Officer.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Brent.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Great, thanks, Lisa, and good morning, everyone.","In 2016, Allergan completed many bold actions to transform our company into a branded growth pharma leader. It wasn't an easy journey; divestments never are. It took a long time to complete the generics sale to Teva. It was challenging to follow the changes in our financial, and it was difficult to cut ties to legacy people, systems, and processes while harmonizing to newer streamlined systems.","But I'm very proud of the resilience of our team. Together, we remain focus on driving the four key value drivers for shareholder return, growth, margins, pipeline, and capital allocation. Thanks to their focus, we have a good report card for 2016 and a positive outlook for 2017 and beyond.","Turning to slide 5, let me walk you through how we did on each one of these four value drivers. First, we had commercial success across our therapeutic areas. We drove double-digit growth in key brands like Botox, Restasis, Juv\u00e9derm, Lo Loestrin [LoLo], and Linzess, and we showed yet again that our team is excellent at product launches.","Second, our model and our attention to cost helped us create a branded growth pharma leader with leading gross margins and operating margins.","Third, David will discuss key milestones in the R&D pipeline, but I wanted to highlight what a productive R&D team Allergan has. They were on a roll with 21 major approvals, 18 major submissions, and they added new programs to expand our therapeutic areas into new adjacencies like NASH and Crohn's disease.","Fourth, on the capital allocation front, we took aggressive, opportunistic, and strategic action in deploying the proceeds we received from Teva. We executed a $15 billion buyback, including a $10 billion ASR. We paid down $10 billion in debt. We announced our first-ever dividend, and we also added 12 new steppingstone deals into our pipeline, including an accretive deal with LifeCell. Let me touch on that now, turning to slide 6.","We just closed the LifeCell deal last week, and I got to spend last Friday morning with our new colleagues. They are proud, energetic, entrepreneurial, and eager to be part of a world-class aesthetic MedDerm and regenerative medicine company like Allergan. They understand that the strategic fit is strong, since the lifestyle product line is very complementary to the Allergan plastic surgery line, and we call on many of the same customers. Given our portfolio, customer relationships, and global infrastructure, they also see a clear advantage of having these businesses under Allergan's ownership. With 2016 sales of approximately $450 million, LifeCell is a durable business with strong margins that will be immediately accretive to our 2017 earnings and beyond.","Turning to slide 7, now let me turn to the financial performance in the fourth quarter and full-year 2016. Non-GAAP revenue from continuing operations was up 7% in the fourth quarter and 15% full-year 2016 to $14.6 billion. On the same basis, performance net income per share, what we previously called non-GAAP EPS, was up 16% in the fourth quarter and 2% in the full year to $13.51. And we generated $6.3 billion in adjusted cash flow from operations.","The report card for growth looks good this quarter, setting us up for growth in 2017 and beyond. Tessa will review the performance of our segments and the detailed outlook for 2017 in just a few minutes.","You can see on slide 8, growth was strong across our seven therapeutic areas in 2016. Excluding exchange, most are growing double digits. Bill will dig into products more in just a moment, but let me highlight the following: Eye Care up 10%; Aesthetics\/Dermatology up 11%; GI up 11%; Women's Health up 19%; Urology up 9%; and Anti-Infectives up 19%. Even CNS was up 8% in 2016 excluding Namenda IR and foreign exchange. This is a top-tier growth story. It would be hard to find a company in our industry that can match that kind of performance across so many different therapeutic areas in 2016.","Overall, our business is very healthy and it's a great picture to have so many products growing. Our company is built on growth products in each of these therapeutic areas, which is why I'm so confident in our future.","Before handing off to Bill, I'd like to address the macro environment in the United States. With the new President, a new pending head of Health and Human Services, and hopefully the rapid announcement of a new FDA head, we are optimistic that the new administration is pro-growth, pro-innovation, and against overregulation that can stifle investment in growth.","We are pleased to see a number of our peers are following our lead and have become more vocal about the actions they are taking to price their products responsibly. For us, our social contract means balancing investment and innovation with pricing and access as well as quality and education. It's Allergan's commitment to the people who count on us to find new treatments for their most pressing medical needs because it is the right thing to do and because we have such strong confidence in our business and our R&D pipeline will sustain our future growth.","Now let me hand the call over to Bill Meury, our Chief Commercial Officer.","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Thanks, Brent, and good morning, everyone.","Brent talked about our growth in 2016. Even in a year of never before seen transformation, we produced strong results. Growth came from every reporting segment. It came from all of our product lines. It came from every region, both the U.S. and internationally. And our growth was balanced between volume and price, for our key products even more so on volume and demand than price.","Here are a few highlights. We launched over 10 new products this past year, including, Vraylar, Viberzi, Kybella, and Namzaric. We had double-digit sales growth in Aesthetics, Botox Therapeutics, Linzess, and others. I'll show you how they all did in the fourth quarter in a moment. The Restasis sales stream remains durable with a double-digit sales increase over prior year despite the entry of an alternative treatment to the market. And lastly, we kicked off our GI business internationally with Constella. 2016 was full of great accomplishments, and I think the outlook for 2017 is just as bright.","Turning to slide 11, this slide tells a good story about the quarter. Linzess is the fastest growing product in the company, up 36% this quarter. Also, we're very pleased with the performance of Viberzi. It looks and feels just like Linzess. We'll talk more about Viberzi in a moment.","Excluding FX, Botox is up 14%. This number reflects a combination of the cosmetic and therapeutic businesses. Migraine had a particularly strong contribution. Both sides of the business are doing very well.","Within the Aesthetics business, the Juv\u00e9derm line of fillers continues to grow globally and this quarter is up 29%. Our Eye Care franchise is powered by the durability of Restasis, which was up 13%. Ozurdex also had a great quarter, up 24%. Growth was partially offset by declines in Asacol HD and Namenda XR, as anticipated. Sales for the products in the All Other products line was relatively stable.","Turning now to slide 12 and our key new product launches, after approximately one year of promotion these four products are annualizing at $450 million in sales at the end of 2016. The table is set for 2017. Generally speaking, awareness levels are high and demand is strong. Formulary coverage for the pharmaceutical products is well developed. Each one of these products is in a strong position as we head into the new year. I'll touch on each one now.","2016 was foundational in terms of training and education for Kybella. We focus on training injectors on how to use the product, identifying patients, and managing expectations. For 2017, we've taken several steps to shore up this business, including: expanding our Masters training program; launching several new promotions; and ramping up our DTC advertising to an even higher level.","It's important to keep in mind that the adoption cycle for a facial injectable is very different than that of an oral pharmaceutical. We're building a market and educating an injector base. That work is done and our goal in 2017 is to drive utilization with the approximately 10,000 injectors that we trained in 2016.","Vraylar and Viberzi were at or above expectations in 2016. Both products have strong demand with a broad and deep prescriber base. They both have excellent formulary coverage, and we expect to demonstrate robust growth in 2017.","With Namzaric, demand has more than doubled since the launch of the full indication. Formulary coverage is exactly where we need it to be, with coverage in eight of the top nine plans. Our focus now is on execution. We like what we see with Namzaric.","To summarize, these four products will represent a much more meaningful portion of our sales and growth in 2017 and beyond.","On slide 13, you can see we expect to have nine additional new launches upcoming across four therapeutic areas where we have received approval already or approval is imminent. As you can see from the slide, we have a nice balance of new product launches and product improvements. Some are U.S. based; some are international. All these will strengthen our existing franchises and maintain our focus on unmet needs.","Here are a few highlights. Most notably, we're launching three new products in Eye Care, two for dry eye and one for glaucoma. For dry eye, Restasis MDPF has been approved and will launch in mid-March. For True Tear, we're expecting approval soon. In glaucoma, the XEN Gel Stent already launched internationally and is now approved in the United States and was launched earlier this week.","Rhofade is a vasoconstrictor for rosacea. This is a dermatological condition that has a significant impact on quality of life and for which there are very few treatment options for the 13 million patients with the condition. We expect Rhofade to be very well received by the dermatology community and could be a sleeper in our product line, with multi-hundred million dollar sales potential.","The Linzess 72-microgram launch gives physicians more dosing options to tailor therapy and will continue to drive conversion of the over-the-counter market. Linzess will be the only product in the market that has two indications, a demonstrated effect on constipation and pain, offers three doses, and has widespread formulary coverage. In 2007 (sic) [2017], we'll focus on our leadership both inside the United States and internationally on driving volume and market share, launching new products, and maintaining high formulary coverage.","So with that, I'll turn the call over to David. Thank you.","C. David Nicholson - Allergan Plc","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. Let's turn to slide 15.","Before I discuss R&D deliverables in the fourth quarter and full year 2016, I would like to touch on one of the cornerstones of open science, building the pipeline. This defines our approach to identifying, acquiring, and developing the best game-changing ideas and innovation in our therapeutic areas. We added 12 game-changing programs to our pipeline. These programs could change the way diseases with significant unmet need are treated.","In CNS, along with our pipeline Heptares, we are developing novel muscarinic agonists for the treatment of neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease. And we recently entered into an option agreement with LTI for a potential breakthrough treatment to slow the progression of Parkinson's disease.","In Eye Care, we acquired a peri-ocular ring technology for the treatment of glaucoma and other eye conditions and a novel gene therapy candidate to alleviate sight loss associated with retinitis pigmentosa.","In Medical Aesthetics and Dermatology, this year we added a number of programs, including ROR Gamma-T, a first-in-class compound for psoriasis and potentially other autoimmune disorders.","In GI, we established a leadership position in NASH with cenicriviroc, or CVC, evogliptin, an FXR agonist. We also added a selective anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibody for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. And we entered into a licensing agreement with Assembly Biosciences for microbiome programs for IBD and IBS.","When you look across these programs, you see highly differentiated, innovative medicines for unmet medical needs that strengthen and build depth across our therapeutic areas.","Turning to slide 16 and discussing delivering the pipeline, during 2016 and early 2017, our R&D team truly delivered. As Brent mentioned, we have achieved outstanding results. Amongst over 100 global submissions, we achieved 21 total major pharma and device approvals, including our XEN Gel Stent for glaucoma, Rhofade for rosacea, Restasis multi-dose, and Linzess 72-microgram. Amongst more than 100 submissions globally, we made 18 major regulatory submissions, including our submission for True Tear in the U.S. and submissions for Botox in the U.S. and the EU for the treatment of forehead lines.","We have made excellent progress in our pipeline of more than 70 programs. I'm going to focus today on six first-in-class or best-in-class compounds, which we are calling our six stars. We have advanced or are in the process of advancing these programs into Phase 3 development.","In Women's Health, we announced positive results from the second Phase 3 trial of Esmya in uterine fibroids. I will discuss these results in a few moments. In CNS, we initiated our Phase 3 program for ubrogepant in acute migraine treatment and initiated our Phase 2b program for atogepant in migraine prophylaxis. Remember, if successful, these will be the first oral CGRPs approved for the treatment of migraine. We also initiated our Phase 3 program for rapastinel, a potentially game-changing treatment for MDD, a condition that desperately needs innovation.","In Eye Care, we have met clinical trial enrollment targets in our AMD abicipar program and plan to complete enrollment this year.","And in GI, we are preparing to begin Phase 3 development for relamorelin, our ghrelin agonist for diabetic gastroparesis, and CVC, our first-in-class once-daily oral immuno-modulator for NASH.","These outstanding results and progress on key programs are being delivered by a team of more than 2,000 talented scientists and R&D professionals, who are focused on delivering important new treatments for patients.","Turning to slide 17, we recently announced positive data from the second of two Phase 3 studies for Esmya. When approved, this will be the first non-invasive oral treatment for uterine fibroids approved in the United States. I'd like to take a moment to briefly review the data from the Phase 3 program.","As a reminder, in May 2016 Allergan and Gedeon Richter announced positive results from the VENUS I trial, on the left-hand side of this slide. The study met all the co-primary and secondary endpoints for both ulipristal treatment arms. The co-primary efficacy endpoints were percentage of patients with absence of uterine bleeding and timed absence of bleeding.","In the second study, Venus II, shown on the right-hand side of this slide, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of ulipristal over two treatment cycles. Again, ulipristal met all the co-primary and secondary endpoints. Significantly more patients in both the 10-milligram and the 5-milligram groups achieved absence of bleeding compared to placebo.","Additionally and importantly, in both VENUS studies we saw very significant quality of life improvements in ulipristal-treated groups in comparison to placebo. When approved, this breakthrough treatment could have a profound positive impact on the lives of women suffering from this condition, where current treatment options are limited.","As I've outlined, we have made real progress both in building and delivering our pipeline. Of course, we have many more milestone deliverables in 2017 and beyond. Our continued excellence in identifying the best science matched with our strong results in advancing innovation validates our open science approach.","As always, I thank our global Allergan R&D team for their outstanding work and dedication in driving innovation, delivering results, and for their commitment to the work ahead for the patients we serve.","Now, I will turn the call over to Tessa.","Maria Teresa Hilado - Allergan Plc","Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone.","Turning to slide 19, in the fourth quarter we delivered strong year-over-year performance. Non-GAAP continuing operations net revenues, which now exclude Anda Distribution, were $3.86 billion, a 7% increase versus prior year, primarily impacted by double-digit growth in key brands, including Botox, fillers, Linzess, Restasis, and LoLo, as well as new product launches. The growth was partially offset by Asacol HD loss of exclusivity, which occurred in August of 2016, and a decline in Namenda XR due to lower demand and the shift of our promotional efforts to Namzaric.","Non-GAAP gross margins for the fourth quarter were strong at 87%. The decline versus prior year was primarily attributed to the accounting treatment of sales that went through our Anda Distribution business. Non-GAAP operating margin was 48.4% in the fourth quarter, a decline of 3.4%, as a result of higher R&D expenses, with products advancing into Phase 3 clinical studies, including rapastinel, oral CGRPs, and abicipar, as well as increased sales and marketing investments to continue to support new launches, such as Vraylar, Viberzi, and Kybella, offset partially by lower G&A expenses.","G&A expenses increased sequentially, primarily as a result of favorable transactional foreign exchange, which benefited the third quarter of 2016. Excluding this impact, G&A increased 5% sequentially.","Performance net income per share of $3.90 reflects growth of 16% versus the prior year, largely driven by share count reduction. Excluding the impact of the share buyback, performance net income per share in the fourth quarter grew 5% versus the prior year.","Our non-GAAP tax rate was 10.4% in the quarter.","Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was negative $60 million. Excluding taxes paid on the gain on sale of the generics and Anda Distribution business, R&D asset acquisitions, and restructuring payments, adjusted cash flow from operations remained strong at $1.5 billion. Our GAAP financial metrics and reconciliation from non-GAAP to GAAP can be found in our earnings release issued this morning and posted on our website.","Turning now to our fourth quarter revenue performance by segment on slide 20, U.S. specialized therapeutics were $1.57 billion for the quarter, continuing double-digit growth of 10.6% versus the prior-year period, driven by strong growth across Facial and Aesthetics of 23%, Eye Care of 7%, Botox Therapeutic of 14%. Key products performed well, with Botox fillers, Restasis, Ozurdex, and the recent launch of Kybella contributing to the strong performance.","Our U.S. General Medicines business fourth quarter revenues were $1.53 billion, remaining stable versus prior year, driven by strength in our key products, including Linzess, LoLo, and other Women's Health products, along with new product launches of Viberzi and Vraylar, offset by the losses of exclusivity of Asacol HD, Namenda IR and Enablex, as well as lower Namenda XR revenues.","International fourth quarter revenues were $753 million versus $691 million in the prior-year period. Excluding foreign exchange of approximately $15 million, international revenues in the fourth quarter grew 11% versus prior year, driven mainly by continued strong growth of Botox Therapeutic and Botox Cosmetic at 12%, (26:00) at 34%, and Ozurdex at 27%.","Asia-Pacific, Latin America, Canada, and Western Europe continued to be the largest growth contributors versus prior year, while Turkey, Middle East, Africa, and Asia-Pacific were the fastest growing regions versus prior year.","Turning to slide 21, we ended the year in a favorable capital position with total debt of $32.8 billion and net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.6 times. We expect to continue to repay our contractual maturities, which will reduce debt by $2.7 billion by the end of 2017 at an average coupon rate of 1.8%.","Turning now to slide 22 and our 2017 forecast, we are beginning 2017 in a strong position and we are focused on growth. Our forecast is based on diversified revenue growth from key products and new launches with manageable losses of exclusivity. We are also committed to managing operating expenses below our sales growth. As a result, we will continue to generate industry-leading margins and strong cash flows. We expect full-year 2017 branded revenue to be between $15.5 billion to $16.8 billion, which reflects mid-single-digit growth of our standalone business and now the addition of LifeCell as of February 1. This also reflects the potential negative foreign exchange impact on revenue of approximately $100 million.","Our gross margins are expected to finish the year between 86% and 87%, consistent with our expectations that gross margins will be impacted by: one, product mix as partnered products such as Linzess and Vraylar experience strong growth; the loss of exclusivity in March of Minastrin, which is a high-margin product; and lastly, lower than our average gross margins with the addition of LifeCell.","Our non-GAAP SG&A of approximately $4.3 billion to $4.4 billion reflects continued strong investments in our key products and product launches and the addition of LifeCell. Note that we expect minimal synergy capture for LifeCell this year as we focus on expanding our footprint in plastics and regenerative medicine.","Non-GAAP R&D spend of approximately $1.450 billion to $1.550 billion reflect support for our 2017 projects, including important advancements of our six stars, which are all either in or entering into Phase 3 clinical studies. We expect R&D to be fairly evenly spread throughout the year.","We are committed to having operating expenses grow less than sales in 2017, and we will continue to manage expenses prudently.","Net interest expense\/other is forecast to be approximately $1.075 billion and will be back-half weighted as other income in the first two quarters of the year includes dividend income from Teva.","Our tax rate for the full year is anticipated to be approximately 13.5%. Average 2017 share count is forecasted to be approximately 356 million shares, and assumes a third quarter settlement on the ASR. Our share count will be higher in the first half of the year at 357 million to 358 million shares. Our guidance reflects our best estimate considering the current progress of the ASR settlement, and we don't expect any material adjustments.","As a result, we expect full-year 2017 non-GAAP adjusted performance net income per share to be in the range of $15.80 to $16.30, reflecting strong double-digit growth in the range of 17% to 21%.","We also wanted to provide you with some framework for the first quarter of 2017. For the first quarter, we expect total reported revenue of approximately $3.5 billion, which will be the lowest revenue quarter for the year. This reflects our normal seasonality, the addition of two months of LifeCell, and the impact of an anticipated change in U.S. wholesale buying patterns. We expect the fourth quarter to be the highest quarter of the year, with the second and third quarters relatively stable sequentially.","We have set the stage for a very strong 2017. Given our confidence in the growth and profitability of the business as previously announced, we declared our first quarterly dividend of $0.70 this quarter to be paid on March 28, 2017 for shareholders of record as of February 28. We expect to grow this dividend annually.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Brent, who will discuss his 2017 priorities.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Thank you, Tessa.","In closing, in 2016 Allergan has been on a journey of transformation. That work is behind us, and now our future is bright. We will remain focused on fourth key drivers of shareholder value: revenue and earnings growth; advancing our R&D pipeline; maintaining industry-leading margins; and capital allocation to drive growth and strong shareholder returns.","At this point, operator, I'd like to open the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert of Deutsche Bank.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes, thank you. First of all, Brent, as an Irish domiciled company, do you have a seat at the table with the new administration? And could you foresee any tax reforms on the horizon that could be anything other than a net positive for the company?","And as a quick follow-up, I was hoping, Tessa, you could discuss your outlook for cash flow for the year and comment on why half of a year for income from Teva, dividend income. Is that because you plan to sell at midyear? Thanks.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Great question, Gregg. Yes, absolutely, we are engaged with the new administration and certainly the key folks within Congress and the administrative agencies that regulate us. And I have personally spent the appropriate amount of time doing that engagement, but I do try to spend most of my time operating the business.","I think with respect to tax reform, we are plugged in. I think there's a lot of discussion, yet there's no real plan yet for what tax reform will look like nor when it will appear. But I do think most of the proposals we see would be beneficial to a company like Allergan or situated like Allergan. Now that certainly could change because details do really matter in tax reform. Something that could be detrimental or have a negative effect could be a border adjustment, although minimal, and certainly we aren't any differently situated than any of our peer group. But certainly that's something we keep an eye on.","Maria Teresa Hilado - Allergan Plc","And your second question, Gregg, as you know, the lockup expires in August. And for planning purposes, we just assumed dividends for the first two quarters. But in August we will evaluate whether we would sell the Teva stock. But obviously, as we've said in the past, we are not long-term holders of that stock.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And cash flow outlook for the year overall, Tessa?","Maria Teresa Hilado - Allergan Plc","Cash flow outlook for the year excluding the one-timers, which we've separated out over the last couple of quarters, would still be about $1.5 billion to $2 billion dollars per quarter.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Schott of JPMorgan.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thanks very much. First one just on Restasis, can you elaborate on the assumptions for flat sales in 2017? And you showed solid growth in 4Q and you took a price increase earlier this year. so just how are you thinking about dynamics here, including price versus volume?","And then a quick follow-up related to tax. When I look at Allergan, you currently have a structural tax advantage relative to your U.S. peers. You've got full access to your cash flow. But some of those advantages could lessen or disappear with U.S. corporate tax reform as you look out to 2018 or whenever reform happens. I know tax and cash access alone aren't drivers of the transaction, but does this prospect of tax reform change in any way how you're thinking about capital deployment in 2017? Thanks very much.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","So let me quickly answer the tax question, and then I'll turn the Restasis question over to Bill. Look, I think we look at deals, particularly accretive deals, through a very strong strategic screen first, and then secondarily and equally importantly is the financial metrics. Clearly, having any kind of financial advantage makes that second analysis easier or potentially stronger, but I don't worry about losing that advantage because of good U.S. tax reform.","I think to be fair, the benefits or the pros for Allergan, which still has a very large U.S. business and is a U.S. taxpayer, is good. I think the more vibrant the U.S. business place is because of smart, good tax reform, the better for Allergan as well. So I don't give that much thought. But as long as we have an advantage, we'll certainly use it as best we can but never in a way that would violate our commitment to doing strategically sound deals.","Maria Teresa Hilado - Allergan Plc","And if I could add relative to your specific question, I don't think it changes our view on capital deployment specifically for 2017.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","I don't think we'll see tax reform in 2017 at this point. And I think with Restasis, I'll turn it over to Bill. But obviously, we're still in the early innings of a competitive launch, and so we're watching the situation carefully. But, Bill, do you want to expand on that?","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Chris, the big story here has been the market is up, as you know, roughly 30% since the introduction of Xiidra. Pure demand for Restasis in the fourth quarter was very reassuring when I think about the 2017 outlook. We had a 3% to 4% increase in volume despite the introduction of a major competitor.","I think the target that we set for 2017 is a realistic one. Could we beat it? Perhaps, as Brent said, though, it's still very early. I think we're going to find out over the next six months what the market is going to look like. I do think it's going to be a stable situation between two products. I firmly believe that we're going to maintain majority market share. We're focused on the launch of the multi-dose preservative-free product in March, and then True Tear, which is an electroceutical, in really the second half of the year primarily.","In terms of price\/volume, we could have some volume erosion in the low single digits with some modest price appreciation, or frankly it could be the reverse depending on what we do with health plans on the formulary front. But I will tell you the formulary coverage is not an unpredictable factor in this story. It's going to be strong in 2017. We have a real advantage in Medicare Part D, where 40% of our sales are, and I expect that to be the case for 2018. And so, like I said, realistic, perhaps we can exceed it, but as you know, competitive launches are unpredictable and so we just have to stay focused on it.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Marc Goodman of UBS.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Bill, if you could just \u2013 Restasis in the quarter, just specifically, just tell us, was there any inventory changes at all? Was there anything strange? It was an unusually large quarter. Or was there just better pricing because rebates got \u2013 in the previous quarter it was just baked in?","And then maybe you could just talk about a couple of the other markets that are competitive, how you're viewing Linzess versus this new product from Synergy, and what's happening, Viberzi versus its competitors in the GI space. Just talk about a couple of those dynamic markets. Thanks.","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Yes, sure, Marc. Listen, on the Restasis front, there were no surprises, no major swings in wholesaler buying patterns. We had a solid mix of volume and price. Like I said, volume was in the 3% to 4% range, and we got a little bit more in price. If there was a day or two of inventory swing, that's just normal fluctuations, but no real surprise.","As it relates to the writer number, which is something you have to watch for in these launches, it's been stable at 25,000 writers on a weekly basis. That usually can be an early warning signal of whether there's going to be disruption in your business, and we're not really seeing anything.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","The other thing I would just quickly add on Restasis, remember, in the fourth quarter we do do some programs to bridge people through their co-pay in the first quarter, and so we do see a little bit of increased demand in the fourth quarter and then the seasonality hits back in the first quarter because we've bridged them through with a 90-day supply.","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","That's right. As it relates to Linzess and plecanatide, the first thing I would say is there are 1 million patients on Linzess and there are roughly 30 million people that suffer from CIC and IBS-C. There's a lot of market here.","In terms of how the products compare, cross-study comparisons, as you know, Marc, are virtually impossible. I would simply say that we have two indications. I said it in the opening remarks. We have two indications, a demonstrated effect on constipation and pain. We're going to have three doses. Formulary coverage is solid. And the promotional hurdle in this market is very high, and we have right now enormous marketing reach. We have over 200,000 writers. We cover almost 100,000 of them directly. And my expectation is that Linzess is going to be, again, the fastest-growing \u2013 one of the fastest-growing products in the company. I think that's going to be the case for the next several years.","The 72-microgram launch couldn't come at a better time. We developed it specifically to accelerate conversion of that mild, moderate, intermittent patient that generally is taking over-the-counter medication. I think the business is in a good position. My sense is if plecanatide is introduced, it's going to be used in Linzess failures and second, and that's not going to disrupt our growth rate.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Louise Chen of Guggenheim.","Louise Chen - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi, thanks for taking my question. I had a question on Esmya. You highlighted that as one of your top-star products. I'm just curious why your product is better than others that are in development. And do you think your product can be used as an alternative to surgery? And in the EU and other areas of the world where Esmya is approved, how long have patients actually been on drug? Thanks.","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","I can talk about it a little bit. Listen, I'll go back to the cross-study comparison point. That's very hard to draw comparisons. But what I will say is my view is that the benefit\/risk ratio of Esmya relative to elagolix or next-generation elagolix or Bayer's compound is pretty well established, and I think David can speak to that. My sense is that Esmya has the potential to be a first-line option and used in a broad population of patients relative to a GnRH agonist, which might potentially (43:12) be used later in therapy and in a more narrow population of patients. When you look at the bleeding control data, the impact on tumor size in our Phase 3 studies, whether you look at the ones done internationally or in the U.S., it's profound and it's significant.","The other key advantage that I think we're going to have is we'll be first mover for uterine fibroids, and that's important when you're introducing a completely new concept and a non-surgical option. I'll turn it over to David to add any more.","C. David Nicholson - Allergan Plc","Maybe just a little bit more color, Esmya has a selective progesterone receptor modulator, has little effect on circulating estrogen levels, has a very low propensity to induce hot flashes, which distinguishes it from some of the other compounds being developed for this indication.","You asked about surgery. What we really anticipate with Esmya is at the very least there's a substantial delay before surgery is necessary. And of course, it is a big advantage if we can delay surgery in women suffering from uterine fibroids because when you go in with surgery and macerate the fibroids, you are spraying potentially malignant cells around the uterus. So we do anticipate an advantage there.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Next question, operator.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Liav Abraham of Citi.","Liav Abraham - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning. Brent, perhaps you can comment on your thoughts on capital allocation at the moment given where the share price is now versus where it was towards the end of last year, how you're thinking about buybacks versus transactions, M&A transactions. And then to the extent that you're interested in M&A, how you're thinking about accretive versus R&D deals.","And then on R&D deals, just given the number of these that you've executed on over the past several months, to what extent are you able to integrate and follow up on and execute on R&D transactions within the R&D organization at this point? Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yes, sure, great question. Look, I think with respect to capital allocation in 2017, we're not really looking to add another buyback. And I still think our stock is undervalued, but we have to complete and settle the ASR that we have in place. Having spent about $15 billion on stock repurchase since the Teva deal closed, I think we have done the right thing for our shareholders, but the remaining focus will really be on deploying our capital for both accretive transactions and pipeline building transactions.","If you look at 2016, we spent round numbers about $5 billion on transactions, of which about $3 billion was LifeCell, so certainly weighted towards an accretive transaction in 2016. I suspect you'll see that be the case in 2017. Obviously, we are opportunistic. If great science or something profound came through, that could be subject to change, but we are focused on having more weight towards accretive transactions that are strategically sound and growth oriented in 2017 while still continuing to invest in science and building out our pipeline.","With respect to integrations, it is a core competency of Allergan. Rob Stewart leads the integration group. We do have this down to a science. And considering the types of integrations or pre-integrations we did last year, whether it be Pfizer or the Teva divestiture, the things that we've been doing on the steppingstone on a relative basis seem simple. Yet we do treat each one very seriously. We've really tried to integrate the cultures and learnings from what made the smaller company successful, and we try to treat people as fairly and as appropriately as possible. And I think our track record speaks for itself. Our colleagues are generally eager to join the company.","A great example in R&D, for example, is Tobira, where we went into NASH, an adjacency. The Tobira team, led by Laurent Fischer, stayed and is now our liver and NASH R&D group inside of the R&D organization, staying in their same office in South San Francisco and continuing to think even bigger about how to solve the disease than they were as a standalone. So we do really try to do these thoughtfully. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Finkelstein of Susquehanna.","Andrew Finkelstein - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Good morning and thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the buying patterns you referenced in 1Q. I take it it's more of an industry-wide phenomenon. But also to what extent does that reflect the increasing impact of deductible resets on patients? How do you evaluate some of the early year-to-date prescription trends? To what extent are we seeing that, and if we make year-on-year comparisons for products in the first quarter? Thanks.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Maybe, Tessa, why don't you take the first part on the inventory, and then we'll talk about prescription trends in the first few.","Maria Teresa Hilado - Allergan Plc","So sequentially Q4 to Q1, you see the normal seasonality that occurs in Eye Care and other reimbursed products in anticipation of larger co-pay and deductibles. But in Q1 in particular in 2017, we expect wholesalers to reduce up to potentially one week of inventory, and we incorporated that in our forecast. Given our announcement that we would do price increases on January 1, we believe they took that into consideration and will probably trend towards lower inventory levels. Usually, it's three to four weeks. We anticipate them to be at the lower end, but that's incorporated in the forecast.","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","As it relates to quarterly sales momentum or flow, typically as you know, the first quarter across most businesses is lighter, and then there's a recovery in the second quarter. Depending on the business, you can see a little bit of an adjustment in the third quarter, and usually your fourth quarter is the strongest. That's generally the cadence. Not a new trend, it's perhaps a little bit more pronounced today than it was several years ago because of what you mentioned. Coverage gaps or coverage shifts, high-deductible plans, co-insurance can impact prescription fill rates.","We don't see it across the entire product line. You'll see, for example, in Aesthetics the growth rates can be pretty strong in the quarter. Restasis typically has a lower first quarter, but it's really nothing new, and I don't think we're going to see any surprises in the first quarter. We take various steps to \u2013 at least on the commercial side of the business as opposed to the government reimbursed side, we take several steps on the commercial side to maintain patient access to medications, whether it's various co-pay assistance programs. And they can be effective but they're not perfect, and I think that's why you can see some adjustments to sales levels as you end one year and start the next.","Andrew Finkelstein - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","And do you expect Aesthetics to have the same quarterly patterns throughout the year as in the past?","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Yes, that's exactly right. I would expect \u2013 what you saw in 2016, you'll see again in 2017.","Maria Teresa Hilado - Allergan Plc","So you'll see seasonality for Aesthetics in Q1 and Q3, which is the typical seasonality.","Andrew Finkelstein - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thanks very much.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Next question","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Cacciatore with Cowen.","Ken Cacciatore - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi, thanks. Brent, I'm just wondering with the LifeCell acquisition and the launch of XEN implant, just your appetite for more devices versus traditional pharmaceuticals as you think about business development.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yes, it's a good question, Ken. We tend to try to focus on leadership in our therapeutic areas is how we talk about it with you guys and the investment community. How we tend to talk about it internally is our customer. And we try to look at how do we best service the customer, whether that be a plastic surgeon, a dermatologist, an ophthalmologist or optometrist. And so as we get more experience in surround-sound service and innovation for the customer, we become exceedingly more comfortable with different types of products.","So this year we'll do XEN. We'll do the electroceutical True Tear. Obviously, we're going deeper into plastic surgery. We already had a very large robust business in plastic surgery with implants. And so I think we're doing it in a way that allows the organization to best service the customer but also learn and get smarter. And so there's high innovation and the strategy is sound and the financials work. We become a little less focused on whether it's a drug, a device, a combination of the two, or capital equipment or the like. We just look at the strategic and financial rationale of how to best service the customer.","Ken Cacciatore - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal of Bernstein.","Aaron Gal, Ph.D. - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning and thank you for taking my questions, quickly if I can, two. Botox MDD I noticed that the trial closed. It's not clear; you've got two different dates when you're going to report that trial. Is this coming up, and roughly what's the timing for that?","And secondly, you haven't mentioned Estrace. There's the potential for a generic in 2017. How are you guys dealing with this with your guidance?","And as long as we're with Tessa, Tessa, assuming the stock does not run up, you're going to get $2 billion back from the buyback process. Are those $2 billion dedicated to further buyback, or are those going back to general purposes?","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","So, David, do you want to take MDD? Then maybe Rob Stewart can talk about Estrace and then Tessa can answer the last part.","C. David Nicholson - Allergan Plc","So just quickly on MDD, the trial is completed. We're in the process of locking the database and making certain that everything is tidied up. We should have the results over that sometime in March.","Robert A. Stewart - Allergan Plc","On Estrace, Ronny, at this point we're still watching to see whether or not that there would be a launch. We would be prepared to launch an authorized generic in the event that that happens, but we're not assuming any near-term Estrace launch.","C. David Nicholson - Allergan Plc","And, Ronny, just on MDD, of course we will be looking at the data in its entirety, including all the IIT [Investigator Initiated Trial] data before we make any decisions about moving forward or not.","Aaron Gal, Ph.D. - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","That's a bit scary, but thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Well, you know depression studies are difficult, particularly a high consumer rate. I have no idea what this study is. I'm not forecasting or reading any tea leaves. But anytime you do a depression study, we have a lot of experience doing them. You've got to be very, very patient.","Maria Teresa Hilado - Allergan Plc","So your question, Ronny, about the ASR, we are committed to completing the $10 billion ASR. The share count average that we provided for 2017 of 357 million shares reflects that. Remember that we have to settle the borrow, which the borrow was delivered to us in November, and that was actually done at the price which we disclosed of about $187 per share. The stock has run up obviously, which is a good thing, but we're also subject to a collar which provides protection for us if the stock continues to rise. But we are committed to completing the $10 billion ASR.","Aaron Gal, Ph.D. - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great, thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jami Rubin of Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you, just a couple if I may. First, Brent, for you on the operating margin, if I look at your guidance for 2017 and take the midpoint, it does reflect a slight decline from 2016. And obviously having a 50% operating margin is unusual and a positive, but I think the real question is where directionally should we think about that margin. Where is it going? Your SG&A as a percentage of sales at the midpoint would be around 27.8% of sales, which is high relative to the industry average. So help us to think about where those margins are going. Is there upside to gross margins going forward? Is there downside to SG&A as a percentage of sales? And I presume R&D is really dependent upon success of Phase 3 assets, so we'll just have to wait. But if you could generally talk about where the operating margin is going, that would be helpful.","And then secondly for you, Tessa, a question on GAAP versus non-GAAP cash flow from operations, there's still a very wide gap between the two, with the fourth quarter reporting negative cash flow from operations versus $1.5 billion in adjusted cash flow from operations, and I see your guidance this year is for negative cash flow on a GAAP basis. Obviously, the company is very busy with deals et cetera, et cetera. When are we going to start to see GAAP and non-GAAP from a cash flow perspective start to narrow? Thanks very much.","Maria Teresa Hilado - Allergan Plc","So let me address the gross margin question. For 201,7 it really reflects to a large extent the variances. It's product mix with partner products such as Vraylar and Linzess that pay royalties. Remember also, Jami, that Minastrin we lose in March, which is a high-margin product. And then LifeCell was also dilutive to the gross margins. When you also compare 2016 to 2017, half of that variance is explained by the Anda accounting treatment, and probably that issue is best discussed offline. We actually provided a table on table 6 that explains that phenomenon and why there's a variance there. On a go-forward basis, I think gross margin to a large extent is really going to be affected by product mix. That was the biggest driver from 2016 to 2017. And as I explained, there are different puts and takes there.","On operating margin, you're absolutely right. The midpoint is roughly 27.8% for 2017. We are committed to growing expenses lower than sales. I do think there is room there on a go-forward basis. This year is unusual in the sense that with the addition of LifeCell and minimal synergies, given the fact that we want to expand that platform, that's where we're comfortable. But on a go-forward basis, I think SG&A as a percentage of revenue is one where there is absolutely room.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","I would just add one comment. I agree with Tessa. I think that you have to look at Allergan with that margin structure with arguably that we do the most primary care details United States. We spend the second most on DTC. And so we really do invest in our products and promotion with strong return on investment analysis on each one of those dollars spent. And so the leverage really comes from sales growth. And where we can see margin improvement is as some of these six stars advance and become potential blockbusters, a bunch of them we own outright, some have some modest royalties, and some have some mix royalties, but product mix will continue to be a focus.","Maria Teresa Hilado - Allergan Plc","Then on cash flow, Jami, this quarter there are a couple of things that drove that. One was the taxes paid on the gain on sale of Teva, which was roughly $700 million. That obviously won't be recurring. There may be further adjustments as we true up taxes, but I think that's probably the last large payment. And then secondly, there were restructuring charges, including additional compensation for Foresight, Vitae, and Tobira. And so obviously to the extent that we don't do any other acquisitions that impact cash flow related to this, then that will also go away. So I think you would get GAAP to non-GAAP closer, but there are always additional adjustments to that number.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Next question, operator.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Maris of Wells Fargo Securities.","David Maris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, a few. Brent and Bill, fillers continue to grow exceptionally well in both the U.S. and internationally. Are the things that are driving the growth different in the U.S. and internationally, and can you give us a little bit of color on what's driving that?","Secondly on Kybella, it's a small product, but it seems to still be struggling a little bit. So with 7,000 injectors and $12 million of sales, it's about $1,700 per doctor. So can you tell us a little bit about or give us some insight into is it an 80:20 rule, or is it very concentrated? What's the difference between maybe the top quartile writer and the average writer?","And then lastly, Tessa, the dividend was an added benefit this past year. Do you have a target payout ratio for the next five years, or do you think in five years it will be about where it is now? Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","So maybe the easiest one to answer is the dividend. We don't have a payout ratio. I'm answering for Tessa because it's an easy one, but we do expect to increase the dividend over time. And so we'll see how that goes. We are committed to it, and we're committed to increasing it appropriately over time.","Maria Teresa Hilado - Allergan Plc","I think it's a balance on the level of flexibility we want to have. We are a very focused growth company obviously. So for us, establishing a firm payout ratio today is an antithesis to growth. However, we are committed to increasing that dividend annually.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","With respect to fillers, and maybe Bill can take Kybella or add to my filler comment. I think with respect to differences between the U.S. and international, I would say that outside the U.S. they're regulated as devices. And so we tend to see the products first available in Europe and outside the U.S. and then come to the U.S. a few years later. So the injector base outside the U.S. has more experience, they're more creative, and they do more interesting things. And they teach us a lot about how to launch in the U.S., where generally we're going the other way with many other products.","The difference between fillers and Botox is fillers really shape the face. And I think as we continue to expand the product line and the different types of fillers for different indications, we're giving the medical aesthetic practitioner more optionality to do less invasive facelifts or face reshaping. And that's something I think that the medical community has really embraced is this non-invasive, fast-recovery shape re-facing through fillers. I don't know Bill, if you would add anything to that.","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","No, I think that's right. I think a lot of aesthetic physicians think about fillers in terms of utility. And they can smooth, they can soften lines, they can volumize, and they can shape the face. And if you talk to an aesthetic physician, that's where this market is going. It's a next step past Botox. And they have a lot more experience internationally for all the reasons that Brent mentioned. And there's just more demand overall, David, across all age cohorts and across the world, regardless of where you go.","As it relates to Kybella, I would just make a couple comments. First, fat reduction, whether you're talking about the face or the body, we're of course involved with the face, is the place to be. Demand for these procedures is very high. I think it's going to continue to get higher. My sense is that this part of the market is where the facial injectable market was 10 years ago.","The problem that we're solving for right now, you mentioned it, is we are an inch deep and a mile wide. We spent the year, we trained 10,000 injectors. There's a great deal of awareness, and what we have to focus right now on is moving this market from awareness and trial to adoption. We need to have more expert injectors. We have revised the economics around Kybella. And we're selling two treatments so that there's follow-up, which is important to a positive aesthetic outcome. And then the direct-to-consumer advertising levels will be maintained on high. And we're going to see how this plays out over the next 6 to 12 months.","This is an important year. I've mentioned before that if you went back a decade and looked at year two sales for the fillers, namely Juv\u00e9derm and Botox, it was roughly 20% of where they are today. And if we can push this thing to $100 million or near $100 million, then we're going to have a very serious product in the United States. We just launched it internationally, which will provide incremental sales in 2017, 2018, and 2019. And that's how we're looking at it. Brent?","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","And then you keep building it by adding new indications. And so if this indication can deliver that kind of result and David's team continues to expand the label like we've done with the fillers and Botox and everything else, the formula is there. So we've got to really focus on adoption in 2017, as Bill said.","David Maris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great, thank you very much.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Sure. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat of Evercore ISI.","Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question, maybe first with David. David, what are you seeing on a blinded basis for the liver tox profile of the ongoing Phase 3 oral CGRP? And I understand you have a few months of patient experience now.","And then perhaps a second one for Brent and Tessa, I just wanted to get more color on the change in accounting nomenclature to the performance net income. And I was just curious why the change if metrics are identical and whether SEC had feedback on the accounting for upfronts for R&D payments or something else. Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","So, David, do you want to take the CGRP?","C. David Nicholson - Allergan Plc","Yes, sure, I'm happy to. Hi, Umer. We're very happy with the way enrollment is going in the Phase 3 studies with ubrogepant and the Phase 2b study with aptogepant. Clearly on the ubrogepant studies, we're actually recruiting ahead of schedule. Obviously, everything is blinded, but so far in a blinded fashion we haven't seen anything of concern in terms of liver toxicity. Everything is still blinded, but nothing of any concern seen to date.","Maria Teresa Hilado - Allergan Plc","So our discussions with the SEC really have been limited towards the change on nomenclature and additional disclosures. There was no other conversation, and so therefore there was no change in the calculation methodology.","Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC","Got it. Tessa, so why change it then from non-GAAP net income?","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","We could debate this, if you want, for hours.","Maria Teresa Hilado - Allergan Plc","I think the simple answer is we wanted to provide clarity that in fact this is a performance measure and this is the measure that we use as a management team. If you look at the industry, there really isn't any one standard in our conversations with them. We wanted to comply with a change in the name, so it was easy.","Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC","Got it. And by the way, David, thank you for that answer. Thank you very much.","C. David Nicholson - Allergan Plc","Great, yes.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sumant Kulkarni of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sumant S. Kulkarni - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, thanks for taking my question. How is the company thinking about managing the potential loss of exclusivity on Restasis? And you mentioned Rhofade could be a sleeper hit. Could you give us a sense of the ramp there to the potential hundreds of millions of dollars?","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","So look, I think with Restasis, we feel very strongly in our intellectual property position. We have five or six \u2013 I'm sorry, off the top of my head, six Orange Book-listed patents to 2024, and we think we are in a very strong position with respect to Restasis. Obviously, we also think about all of our products in terms of innovation and how to continue to expand, and the multi-dose format of the product has patents that go out to 2031, I believe.","Lisa M. DeFrancesco - Allergan Plc","2032.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","2032. See, I keep getting corrected by Lisa. So I think we've got a lot of durability in that franchise, and we'll continue to look to add novel and new ways to treat the disease, whether it be True Tear or new molecules or new ways of delivering drugs to the eye.","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","As it relates to Rhofade, listen, there's a big unmet need right now in the dermatology community. I think every dermatologist is going to try this product. And if it performs, you'll see fairly rapid adoption. I would think about it as a gentler Mirvaso, which was a very potent and effective product. Sales ramp, think about a 3 to 5-year picture, which is pretty typical. Maybe a little bit faster, but I would think about it in terms of 3 to 5 years.","Sumant S. Kulkarni - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Randall Stanicky of RBC Capital Markets.","Randall S. Stanicky - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks, guys. I wanted to go back to migraine. You're going to have the refile of Semprana in the back half of this year. That should put you on market for an important acute launch in the first half of 2018. How should we think about the ramp alongside of Botox for chronic and really the growth trajectory of both of those through 2018 and beyond as we see some of the see CGRPs start to come to market?","And then the add-on to that is are you currently happy with your migraine footprint, or is there a desire to add more assets in that area? Thanks.","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","As it relates to our migraine footprint, we could have the broadest and deepest product line in the industry with Semprana, which is an inhaler, Botox, which is an injectable, and of course we have the oral CGRPs. I like the way it looks, and we cover both acute and chronic.","I'll start with Botox. And I've said this before, it is the growth driver for Botox Therapeutic. It's as effective in chronic migraine as any product in development. There are less than 200,000. As successful as we've been with Botox, less than 200,000 people receive it, and there are anywhere from 3 million to 5 million who actually could benefit from it. So even with the introduction of CGRPs, I believe that there is a place for Botox, and it's going to continue to be a growth driver. It's as effective. The benefit\/risk ratio is at least as good and certainly better understood than anything that's in development, and it's highly economical. It's one of the best bargains in the industry on the therapeutic side, and so I think it's always going to have a place.","The CGRPs I think are going to take from all this off-label use. It's one of the largest off-label markets in the industry. Opioids, NSAIDs, PCAs, anti-depressants, anti-epileptics are all being used because there is nothing.","As it relates to Semprana, it could be a faster acting alternative to triptans. And at least in the Phase 3 trials, there wasn't a great deal of rebound headache, which can be a problem with triptans. You don't have some of the triptan-related side effects with dihydroergotamine that you may with an Imitrex or one of the others. And I think the category has the potential to really, really develop on the chronic side. And on the acute side of course, there's no alternative right now to the triptan class. And I think that's what Semprana will be, and then of course ubrogepant.","Randall S. Stanicky - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Should we think about Semprana in a similar way that we think about Viberzi and Linzess? You're adding a product. There's not much incremental spend, and we could see some synergistic benefits given that you're adding an acute to an existing product. And again, so you're playing in a very underpenetrated market.","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Yes, the thing I like about it is we're set up in neurology. We have plenty of capacity to take care of all these products. I also like the fact that neurologists and primary care physicians, and we can cover that segment too, have had no alternative for triptans for a long time, and I think they want and need one. The failure rate in migraine isn't quite what it is in the antidepressant market, but managing pain is tough and they need more alternatives. If we can get it across the finish line, it will be a nice add-on to our Neurology business.","Randall S. Stanicky - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great, thanks.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we do have time for one more question. Our final question will come from the line of David Amsellem of Piper Jaffray.","David A. Amsellem - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thanks. So, Brent, you had alluded to a view that the shares are not fully valued. So I guess the question here is give the dynamics around the cash pay\/consumer\/medical aesthetics business, which are fairly strong, would you consider potentially a split-up of the company into a consumer cash-pay piece and a prescription-strength piece as a means of unlocking value? And is that something that would be on the table down the road? Thanks.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","So it's not on the table. Look, we just went through a transformational 2016. I think we're looking at our company today and the business we have with great enthusiasm and opportunity for continued leverage and development across our therapeutic areas. And so it's not something that we're discussing or debating. In the future, I always say nothing is off the table because we don't know what the future will bring. But I wouldn't want to encourage any speculation or discussion around us breaking the company apart. That's not on our agenda and it's not something our board is discussing.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","So with that, operator, I just want to quickly thank everyone for joining us. We're very proud of what we achieved in 2016. We're looking forward to continuing to focus on execution in 2017 and keeping you updated as we go. Thank you for joining us.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I would like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Jim Hindman, Senior Vice President, Treasury, Risk and Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","James M. Hindman","Thank you, Terri. Good morning. With me for today's conference call is David Pyott, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Edwards, Executive Vice President, Finance and Business Development, Chief Financial Officer;  Dr. Scott Whitcup, Executive Vice President, Research and Development, Chief Scientific Officer; and Jim Barlow, Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller.","Before we move ahead, I would like to remind you that certain statements that we'll make in this presentation are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements reflect Allergan's judgment and analysis only as of today, and actual results may differ materially from current expectations based on a number of factors affecting Allergan's businesses.","Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. In the second quarter, Allergan sales grew versus the second quarter 2011 by 8.7% to local currencies. And due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to virtually all of the world's currencies by 4.8% in dollars.","Year-to-date, we've been able to grow Allergan's total sales by 9.5% year-over-year in local currencies, despite challenges in the global economy. Benefiting from our global footprint, our international sales in the first half grew double digits in many businesses namely: Ophthalmic pharmaceuticals, BOTOX, dermal fillers and breast aesthetics. In fact, all of our consumer-facing businesses performed rather well so far this year.","Regarding operating performance we generated in Q2, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.07, marking an increase of 11.5% over the prior year and $0.01 over the top end of the range of expectations provided at our last earnings call.","Year-to-date, non-GAAP diluted EPS has increased 11.6% versus 2011. In the first half of the year, we have also continued to invest in the long-term success of Allergan, investing $457 million or 11.4% more on R&D on a non-GAAP basis. For a reconciliation to GAAP numbers, please consult our press release.","Now commenting on the performance of the individual businesses. Ophthalmic pharmaceutical sales increased in Q2 versus the prior year at a slightly lower rate than normal, at 6.5% in local currencies and 1.9% in dollars, and with year-to-date growth at 9.1% to local currencies and 5.9% in dollars.","The year-to-date growth in local currencies is more in line with the historical performance for this business. The Q2 growth rate was dampened by the U.S., which I'll comment further, while international sales grew in local currencies year-over-year, 11.0%, and year-to-date, 12.2%, with double-digit growth in all the 3 -- in all the x U.S. operating regions: Europe, Africa, Middle East, Latin America, Asia-Pacific and Canada.","The IMS Global report for the first quarter of 2012, the last period for which data is available, shows Allergan growing in-market at 8% and outperforming Alcon, Novartis when one excludes the retina segment. Compared to the first quarter of 2011, the IMS reports shows Allergan gaining share strongly in glaucoma and in retina on a small base, as well as an uptick in share in artificial tears, driven by the recent launches of OPTIVE Advanced marketed as OPTIVE Plus outside the U.S.","In the U.S., Q2 ex-factory sales growth was limited at 3.3% with year-to-date growth versus prior year at 6.9%. Per IMS, U.S. acquisition dollar sales growth year-to-date June was 11.8%. RESTASIS growth versus prior year per IMS continued on the strong trend, with quarter-to-date June growth of 16.1% and year-to-date growth at 14.1%, as more and more physicians recognize the value of treating dry eye symptoms early in the progression of this disease.","LUMIGAN franchise performance merits closer commentary with a decline of 3.2% in Q2 in local currencies and year-to-date growth in local currencies at 1.8%.","Ex-U.S., Q2 performance was strong, with LUMIGAN and GANFORT continuing to gain market share in all key markets and a decline in the U.S. due to increased commercial and Part D rebates, as well as a reduction in trade inventory.","Per IMS year-to-date, June, U.S. LUMIGAN sales increased year-over-year 16.2% in acquisition dollars and 3.5% in trailing prescriptions for retail and mail order. An analysis of the updated outlook for the LUMIGAN franchise for the second half of the year will demonstrate that we foresee renewed growth in the LUMIGAN franchise due primarily to the benefits of price increases in the U.S.","Regarding the status of our 2013 contracts with CVS Caremark, I wish to provide a fact-based analysis. We lost our preferred status only on the commercial formulary, which is less important than the Part D formulary. A branded competitor offered a rebate structure, which did not make any financial sense for us. Plus, we do not like losing any account. This only amounts to less than a handful of share of overall LUMIGAN prescriptions in the United States and has been partially offset by another formulary win.","In summary, we believe that our overall formulary positions in 2013 will be broadly similar to those in 2012. Due to the excellent acceptance of LUMIGAN 0.01%, which accounts now for 61% to trailing prescriptions and is based on a superior profile relative to the original LUMIGAN, we announced this week that we plan to no longer manufacture LUMIGAN 0.03% by the end of 2012 for the United States market.","In our outlook, we have factored in further U.S. LUMIGAN 0.03% inventory reduction between now and year end. Given the availability of generics of brimonidine, we're glad that the ALPHAGAN and COMBIGAN franchise continues to enjoy growth, both in the U.S. and worldwide.","Rounding out my commentary on Ophthalmics, our Canadian business is growing strongly, driven by a strong uptick of RESTASIS, paid for by private insurance, as well as completion of the successful conversion of the LUMIGAN franchise to 0.01%, marketed as LUMIGAN RC in Canada.","Successful launches in Mexico of LUMIGAN RC and Zypred have driven very strong growth this year. OZURDEX is performing particularly strongly in Europe. In June, the Scottish Medicines Consortium issued a positive coverage review. During the quarter, OZURDEX was launched in Mexico, Argentina, Singapore and Turkey.","LASTACAFT is off to a strong start in Brazil. OPTIVE was launched in Venezuela and OPTIVE Plus in the U.K., Switzerland, Austria, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia. The Spanish government has dereimbursed TEARS from August 1, which on the one hand, will introduce turbulence into the marketplace. On the other hand, based on other similar experiences in other markets, will give us opportunities as the clear market leader in Spain to position and price products on a premium.","Regarding BOTOX, we enjoyed a continuing ramp-up in sales. In Q2, the franchise grew 13.6% in local currencies and 10.2% in dollars, with double-digit local currency performance of both the cosmetic and therapeutic franchises.","The therapeutic franchise is clearly benefiting from the recently approved indications of Chronic Migraine, neurogenic overactive bladder, and in the U.S., upper limb spasticity. Since the last earnings call, we have received additional country approvals  for Chronic Migraine in the Czech Republic, Denmark, Costa Rica, Bahrain, Kuwait and Jordan. NICE in the U.K. issued its final guidance recommending use in the National Health Service for patients who have not responded to 3 prior preventative treatments and whose condition is appropriately managed for medication overuse. This means that the Primary Care Trusts in England and Wales have until the end of September to make funding and resources available for this patient group.","Regarding neurogenic bladder, we received additional approvals in Switzerland, Hungary, Slovakia, Serbia, Panama, Egypt, Jordan and The Philippines. In Canada, we received a positive recommendation in the common drug review with action now to be taken by the individual provinces. Additionally, we filed an application to help Canada for approval of the idiopathic overactive bladder indication.","BOTOX therapeutic growth was particularly strong in the United States, Latin America and Asia Pacific. In Europe, we are impacted by government-mandated price cuts and low tender prices offered by some competitors, which have the effect of converting reasonable unit growth into low market growth and value.","In the U.S., BOTOX therapeutic market share remains very high at over 93%, with the remaining 7% being shared by Dysport, Myobloc and Xeomin in descending order. The ramp in U.S. Chronic Migraine treatments continues on a strong trajectory. We have now trained approximately 5,800 individual physicians and have started to train pain specialists and a very targeted number of general practitioners with high indices, both migraine patients.","Regarding access, 92% of all lives and commercial managed care plans now have some level of policy coverage. The volume of insurance verifications continues to rise and the number of denials to prior authorizations is on a declining trend.","In a recent patient survey, over 60% of all patients reported being satisfied with their overall treatment regimen and over 90% stated that they would continue with BOTOX.","In the core movement disorders area in the U.S., which includes the upper limb spasticity indication, we're growing in the low-double digits. Regarding the progress of the neurogenic overactive bladder launch, we have trained approximately 1,800 individual physicians since launch. At the American Urology Association, there were many lectures in BOTOX and we received a considerable degree of interest.","Regarding insurance access, 88% of commercial lives have some level of policy access: 93% of Medicare lives; and over 90% of Medicaid lives. Age and profile of spinal cord patients and multiple sclerosis patients are quite different from one another.","Trends in insurance verifications and denial rates are following the same pattern as in the commensurate time frame of the Chronic Migraine launch.","Now moving over to the cosmetic side of the business. The U.S. return to growth in Q2 subsequent to Merz ceasing to ship product. Additionally, sales were boosted by both the BOTOX 10-year anniversary campaign as well as the Duet Dividends promotion, incentivizing consumers to use both JUV\u00c9DERM and BOTOX Cosmetic.","Based on our survey, we estimate that BOTOX had over 80% share in the quarter, moving up from a low point of 75% in the January to February time frame. In June, Xeomin still had a reported residual share of 2% as inventory has drained.","In Q2, we estimate that the U.S. market grew double digit in volume. Outside the U.S., we benefited in Q2 from strong growth across a wide range of countries: in Latin America; Asia; and emerging markets in Europe, Africa, Middle East.","Even some European countries performed well, offset by some market share loss in Southern Europe, where competition is still in their launch phases.","Facial aesthetics. Sales rebounded from the weak ex-factory shipments in Q1, with Q2 sales increasing year-over-year by 23.5% in local currencies and 18.0% in dollars. Further to our commentary on the last earnings call, this was due to the timing of our Duet Dividends promotion in the U.S., which took place in Q2 in 2012 versus Q1 in 2011. Year-to-date sales increased 10.5% in local currencies and 6.9% in dollars.","In the U.S., we estimate that we had over 37% share, gaining over 100 basis points relative to Q2 of 2011. Year-to-date, overseas, we have enjoyed strong growth in many markets across Asia Pacific, Latin America and Europe, Africa, Middle East.","Even in Western Europe, we have recorded gratifying sales increases. This is explicable by the strong position acceptance of our new VOLUMA Plus lidocaine in a 1 mL syringe, which, in turn, has driven market share increases in Europe and also other markets where it is available. This category-leading product was also launched in Q2 in Australia and Korea.","Breast aesthetics had another strong quarter, with Q2 sales increasing over Q2 of 2011 by 10.2% in local currencies, by 6.0% in dollars. Year-to-date growth was 14.0% in local currencies and 11.1% in dollars. All of our overseas regions, namely Europe, Africa, Middle East, Asia Pacific and Latin America recorded very strong growth.","In the wake of the PIP scandal in Europe, it is evident that many surgeons and their patients chose Allergan's implants for revision surgery, given that we are the clear market leader in Europe. While the rate of our sales increases have somewhat attenuated, we still have some great growth rates in many of the European countries, and surprisingly, robust sales in Southern Europe.","In the U.S., we've seen good growth, not only in volume, but also we benefited from improvement in product mix, with higher price silicone gel products and tissue expanders. So far, the new competitor, Sientra, has only picked up limited share. In Korea, we received approval for the 410 shaped silicone gel implant range and we'll be commercializing this shortly.","Our skin care franchise grew in Q2 9.8% year-over-year in local currencies and 9.3% in dollars. Year-to-date, 18.8% in local currencies and 18.5% in dollars over the prior year. ACZONE sales continued to increase rapidly, with acquisition dollar sales per IMS VONA increasing year-to-date 49%. ACZONE, even prior to the genericization of Duac, have become the clear market leader in the anti-inflammatory acne category.","TAZORAC acquisition dollar sales increased year-to-date by 3%, with market share starting to pick up a little, given greater sales force attention. LATISSE Q2 sales increased year-over-year by 19.9% in local currencies and by 18.7% in dollars, benefiting particularly from a promotion in Q2 in the U.S.","In the U.S., we received a summary judgment from the U.S. District Court in Orange County pursuant to an action for unfair competition that Athena's RevitaLash advanced eyelash conditioner is a drug and not a cosmetic. We're currently waiting for this federal judge's ruling regarding terms of an injunction.","In response to the court's action, Athena has suspended domestic sales of this product. From a market analysis, we estimate that Athena had the highest share of the LATISSE knockoffs. Continuing our process of innovation, we, today, introduced a 5 mL pack of LATISSE to the U.S. market, which should offer consumers greater convenience relative to the current 3 mL pack for achieving their goal of longer, darker and thicker lashes. We also launched LATISSE in Q2 in Taiwan and Russia.","Sales of LATISSE continue to progress well in Canada, Mexico and Brazil. The SANCTURA urology franchise declined 31.4% in Q2 year-over-year and 19.0% year-to-date. In terms of in-market acquisition dollars, SANCTURA has declined 5.3% year-to-date. Since the district court finds our SANCTURA XR patents to be invalid, we have moved all commercial efforts in our urology team to the launch of BOTOX for neurogenic bladder.","The obesity intervention line declined in Q2 year-over-year at 21.5% in local currencies, 24.1% in dollars, broadly in line with the past trend in constant currency. Year-to-date, the line declined 18.3% in local currencies and 19.9% in dollars. It is encouraging that the decline in the overall U.S. bariatric market is flattening, with the rate of decline in the last 3 months to May estimated at 2% compared to a 6% decline throughout the year 2011.","On the negative side, the share of banding has dropped from the low 40% in 2011 to 33% in May, with bands losing to gains in sleeve gastrectomy, which had garnered a 31% share in May.","Within bands, LAP-BAND enjoys a roughly 90% share. As commented for the last 6 months or so, we have directed considerable effort to improving reimbursement, with results expected in the new insurance policy year of 2013.","So far, we've succeeded in improving bariatric policy in 41 million commercial lives. Clearly, in a time of high unemployment, high-patient co-pays are a barrier to even those patients who have insurance coverage.","I'll now pass over to Jeff Edwards, who will comment our financial performance and outlook.","Jeffrey L. Edwards","Thanks, David, and good morning to all of you on the call. During the second quarter of 2012, Allergan generated good operating results despite costs related to U.S. health care reform, ongoing overseas pricing pressures, somewhat choppy European economic environment and the challenges that accompany a stronger U.S. dollar environment.","Despite each of these challenges, the debt and breadth of our business and continued focus on rational expense management and thoughtfully directing investments allowed the company to achieve non-GAAP diluted earnings per share above the top end of our EPS guidance for the quarter.","Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the second quarter was $1.07, marking an 11.5% increase over 2011 results for the same quarter. A reconciliation of all of the adjustments to GAAP earnings is set out in our earnings release.","Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments and amortization of acquired intangibles, Allergan's Q2 2012 gross margin of 86.3% increased 20 basis points when compared to Q2 2011. This year-over-year improvement in gross margin is a continuation of favorable product mix on both a year-over-year basis and a sequential quarter basis.","The non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses to product net sales ratio to the second quarter was 39%, totaling $572 million. The comparable ratio and expense value for the same period in 2011 were 40.2% and $563 million, respectively. This decrease in percentage of SG&A reflects our commitment to continuing to develop our leverageable and scalable business model as we undertake thoughtful evaluation to our structure and investments to ensure that they continue to generate positive financial returns while simultaneously maintaining a certain level of financial flexibility, which can be adjusted, if necessary, in response to changing circumstances.","We continue to believe the Allergan's non-GAAP SG&A expense to product net sales ratio will be further leveraged in the second half of this year. Non-GAAP research and development expenses were 15.8% of product net sales for the quarter, totaling $232 million, an increase in spend of approximately $7 million over the first quarter of 2012 and nearly $20 million over the second quarter of 2011.","With respect to our balance sheet, consolidated Allergan days sales outstanding was 54 days, a 3-day reduction from the first quarter result, while consolidated Allergan inventory days on hand was 117 days, a 5-day reduction from the first quarter result.","In the second quarter, Allergan's operating cash flow after CapEx was approximately $395 million. At the end of the second quarter, Allergan's cash and equivalents in short-term investments and cash and equivalents in short-term investments net of debt positions totaled approximately $2.7 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively.","With respect to stock repurchased, the company executed against the 10b5-1 plan involving approximately 6 million shares in the first half of 2012. This program has been extended into the second half of 2012 and we expect to repurchase an additional 4 million shares with a continued focus of offsetting the dilutive effect of share-based employee compensation plans.","With respect to our expectations, what we've provided today with our earnings release accounts for Allergan's current perspective on the state of the global economic environment and foreign currency markets for the remainder of 2012.","While Allergan has produced good results during the first half of 2012, there are still a number of variables that may influence performance during the second half of the year, including potential movements within the macroeconomic environment and continued volatility of foreign exchange rates. Like many multinational companies, Allergan regularly monitors and measures the impact of foreign currency movements on our financial results. Although we have seen a meaningful strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus most major foreign currencies in the recent past, we have a clear understanding of the value of this currency movement, and today, are comfortable with our ability to continue managing its impact.","As a reminder, Allergan does maintain a hedging program that combines the natural hedges and offsets we have in place as a consequence of our structure, as well as the use of vanilla options to further limit our exposure to foreign currency movements.","For the third quarter of 2012, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $1,370,000,000  to $1,445,000,000 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.02 to $1.04. Regarding full year expectations for 2012, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $5,650,000,000 and $5,800,000,000, and our full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $4.15 and $4.19, which represents growth of between 14% and 15%.","Our product net sales expectations reflect a reduction of $50 million from the top end of the range provided within our previous expectations. This decision is attributable to a significant negative currency movement, both incurred and projected. We currently estimate a negative currency impact of approximately 3% to 4% on sales growth across the year. Also, we are reducing the top end of LUMIGAN franchise product net sales expectations by $30 million.","This action is due primarily to currency headwinds, the previously discussed plan to discontinue LUMIGAN 0.03% in the U.S. and the related channel inventory reduction that will result from it and increased commercial and Part D rebates.","Lastly, we are reducing the top end of the facial filler product net sales expectation by $30 million due to both currency headwinds and more modest market growth than was originally expected. Note, we estimate the U.S. filler market growth to be in the high-single-digit range in 2012.","Consistent with our May 2012 expectations, we continue to expect full year pretax equivalent impact of approximately $110 million related to U.S. health care reform and $40 million in incremental overseas pricing pressure.","In addition, as previously communicated, our 2012 expectations assume that the U.S. R&D tax credit will be renewed in the fourth quarter of 2012, with full year retroactive benefit impacting Q4 results.","For your information, expectations for other lines of the income statement and specific product sales expectations are included in our earnings release. So with that, operator, I would like now to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Shibani Malhotra, RBC Capital.","Shibani Malhotra - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","David and Jeff, I guess this is a question for you. In light of the global macro concerns...","David E. I. Pyott","We can't hear you.","Shibani Malhotra - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Sorry. I was going to say, in light of the global macro concerns that have been impacting the market, and also, with your competitors, can you talk about Allergan's mid-teens earnings aspirations over the next few years?","James M. Hindman","Terry, operator, we're having problems with that.","[Technical Difficulty]","Operator","Your next question will come from Catherine Arnold, Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Catherine J. Arnold - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","The glaucoma market outside of the U.S. is, obviously, a very important driver for you. And I wondered if you could kind of give us a perspective on where we are in terms of penetrating eligible patients in some of the bigger markets that are more important to you? And how that business sort of breaks out in terms of cash versus government pay?","David E. I. Pyott","Well, the biggest difference overseas, of course, is availability of GANFORT, the combination of LUMIGAN and timolol, which, in most markets where it's available, is perceived as maximal medical therapy. And that is, of course, because in most markets, LUMIGAN, as single agent, is perceived as the most potent drug. And then of course, having the convenience of adding in timolol is great for simplicity and compliance. How many drops do you, as a patient, have to take per day. In terms of your question on government reimbursement or effectively out-of-pocket, of course, it basically comes down to -- if you look overseas, Canada, Australia, Europe, government programs so effectively paid for by somebody else. Whereas once you go to markets like, say, Brazil or India, in the final analysis, although you receive a prescription from a doctor, with the rare exceptions of those with private insurance, you then go to the pharmacy and then you get money out of your pocket to fill the prescription, either for yourself or members of the extended family. I think Scott Whitcup has something to add.","Scott M. Whitcup","Yes, just in terms of Europe specifically, there's been a focus of some of the ophthalmologists on wanting preservative free formulations. And so at our R&D day, this past March, we announced that we will have a unit dose of both GANFORT and LUMIGAN hopefully approved in 2013, which, again, just adds to a strong glaucoma portfolio in Europe.","Operator","Comes from David Risinger, Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","My question is for Scott. Scott, I'm hoping that you can comment on the timing for LATISSE for hair loss. On clinicaltrials.gov, it indicates that the 2 Phase III trials in men and women are supposed to be completing in September. So that's next month. Just wondering, specifically, what investors should expect in terms of communication i.e., would you issue a press release before you present data at a medical conference? Do you not plan to disclose that data at all? How should we think about being informed about those Phase II results later this year?","Scott M. Whitcup","Sure. So like you stated, we have 2 programs: one in typical male pattern baldness; and 1 in female hair thinning. Both of those trials are fully recruited. Our plan will be to present those data at medical conferences, and those should be next year. We won't have the data until just before that, especially for our Phase II program. We wouldn't plan to issue a press release, but are always committed to try to get those out into medical conferences as soon as we can.","Operator","Your next question will come from Shibani Malhotra, RBC Capital.","Shibani Malhotra - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So just very quickly, I think this question's for David and Jeff. In terms of the global macro environment and the concerns around the cosmetic business that a lot of investors have been talking about recently, how do you feel about your aspirational and if earnings growth over the next years of mid-single -- sorry, mid-teens year-on-year?","David E. I. Pyott","Okay, I'll take that. I think if you listen to all of the facts I gave you regarding all those franchises, I think we can say the consumer is alive and well. If you think of, say, the U.S. market first, I gave data saying we believe that the neuromodulator market for aesthetic use is going double digit currently. Jeff, in his remarks, stated that we believe, for the full year 2012, the market will be growing high-single digits. And when you think about the remarks I made about Europe, and clearly, that's the place that we do look very carefully, we have there some fabulous growth rates, even in the so-called old Europe, let alone, the new Europe or Russia or the Middle East and so on. And I think, really, what it's driven by is multiple factors. One is, if you look at the breast aesthetics market, which, we've often felt was a leading indicator for consumer behavior, given hopefully, it's a onetime decision or a decision for a long time, market very, very robust. And I think this is us as market leader benefiting from the problems of lack of quality of PIP, and clearly, we are, by far, the market leader. We believe we have just over 50% market share in Western Europe in breast implants. Then when I look through BOTOX Cosmetic or VISTABEL, those markets look healthy. And fillers, clearly, the market's good and we're picking up share due to innovation, which is really driven by VOLUMA, and most recently, the introduction of the new smaller-sized product, which is really appreciated not only by the doctors for ease of injection, but also speed and comfort by the patients. So when I look across the world, obviously, I'm looking very carefully for cracks in the wall, but things are pretty darn good and it's difficult to forecast years and years into the future. Otherwise, I should be working for the Federal Reserve or the Bank of England or somebody. But assuming things continue in this kind of mode, we would certainly like to reiterate our aspiration of mid-teens earnings per share growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from Greg Gilbert, Merrill Lynch.","Gregory B. Gilbert - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","David, I think your current job's better than those. But -- as you look at your current business and geographic mix and where the existing pipeline might take that, are you content with where that's heading at a high level or you thinking any differently these days about M&A strategy? Europe's in a good financial position, and this isn't just a question about which pillar is next, but are you thinking about M&A any differently at a high level, I guess, given what you've observed in the marketplaces in the last year or two?","David E. I. Pyott","Great. Well, first of all, clearly, we're benefiting from the wave of approvals we had in 2009 and '10, and now our job is to internationalize those approvals, which, when you just think about the long list of countries I give you, clearly, is occurring. Clearly, we have a commitment to pushing out the edges of the world to the few white spaces or the weaker spaces that we have. We're really pleased that Russia is off to a great start, our most recent venture. Also, we're very pleased that China really is beginning to hit its stride, both in medical aesthetics, but also ophthalmology. So all that's going pretty well and we continue to think about what could be the next markets we might add, really, probably, when you look at sort of the east of Europe and then headed out into Asia. Going back to the bigger question of M&A, clearly, we want to put our free cash flow to work. I think in our largest businesses, ophthalmology and medical aesthetics, a lot of opportunities come to us because clearly, anybody who wants an asset that might want to sell it or share it or partner it would think of us, and it's not altruism because in theory, we should be able to pay more for that asset than somebody else, given our strengths and our regional -- and our worldwide distribution. Where we're putting more effort the other way is really looking at neurosciences and urology, and one of the great things with our mix is that we can be fairly agnostic. It could be a drug, it could be a drug delivered in a device, or it might even be a device. So very clearly, we're pleased with our internal growth motors, but we'd like to supplement them using, frankly, our balance sheet and to intelligently acquire new sources of growth, where, we believe, we can add value in a meaningful way to the businesses we would license or acquire.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ronny Gal, Bernstein.","Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I agree with Greg that I think you got a better job right now, David. Questions about BOTOX. So you keep on being surprised about how strong the product is, and to some extent, we're having a hard time disaggregating the units versus the price. Can you just help us understand, is the growth of BOTOX driven in any way by price or essentially, are units offsetting some price decline elsewhere? And similarly, are we seeing BOTOX growing because essentially it's entering into new markets or are we seeing a still very significant unit growth in the established markets?","David E. I. Pyott","Okay. Well, I'd say the very high level units and price are very similar. Maybe a little bit of price pressure in Europe. We always have to pay attention where governments have mandated on the therapeutic side price declines. We have to keep an eye what is the differential between that and VISTABEL i.e. the aesthetic side because I think you're all very aware that -- I mean the same happens in United States with diversion. But in Europe, there's lots of parallel trading from lower-priced markets to higher-priced. So net-net, you can tell very healthy unit volume growth, which is reflected in my remarks because I did say in local currencies in Q2, both therapeutic as well as aesthetic, both grew double digits. Then in terms of new markets, the only one that's sort of been, I would say, a good filler this year has been Russia, given that we had a lower base in the prior year through a distributor. And clearly, prior to taking over the business, we wanted to make sure we controlled deliveries because otherwise, we all know when you take over businesses, often, people will have filled up the channel nicely for you, and we were able to tap down supply so that we, at least, didn't end up walking into an overstocked position when we start at the beginning of the year. So net-net, a very healthy unit growth. One last thought, many of you on the sales side, conduct surveys, and of course, I read them carefully. And I think in terms of same-store sales, maybe your surveys are accurate. But of course, what you can't measure is all the new people wanting to come into the marketplace because of course, many physicians are trying to escape the pressures of managed care and they'd much rather be in a nice business where the patients basically pay cash or credit card.","Operator","Your next question comes from Frank Pinkerton, SunTrust.","Frank H. Pinkerton - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And Jeff, I guess this is a question for you, and it's one I've asked in the past, but just want to harp on again. I mean, $2.7 billion-ish sitting on the balance sheet, are you guys properly aligned there? I know Greg asked earlier about M&A, but when you think about putting that capital to use, is that really the best place for it to sit there, earning today's rates? And just to remind you, I'm sure someone from the Wall Street Journal is listening, and your CFO position on that poll is at risk with your answer.","Jeffrey L. Edwards","Yes, that was a low blow. So you threw me on a loop there, Frank. I've got to gain my composure. So yes, we talk about it a lot, and as we noted in my commentary, we're buying additional 4 million shares in the second half of the year. So we are focused on capital deployment. We bought 6 million in the first half of the year. I will tell you the free cash we generated in the first half of the year, we used almost all of it. So we are very much focused on capital deployment. David commented M&A and what we're focused on, and it goes beyond M&A. It's also product and technology access, whether it be through acquisitions or licensing or partnering. I talked a lot about this at the conferences I present at. So we understand your point of view and we agree that given the right opportunity, we'll be there and we're very much focused on deploying that capital in the right ways, looking for ways to further leverage that P&L we've got and take advantage of the nice liquidity position we have and access to capital that we have. So no disagreement there. I will remind you the $2.7 billion doesn't buy you much in our world, but we'll continue to look for those good opportunities. And we can talk about it further the next time we get together.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Amsellem, Piper Jaffray.","Rebecca M. Forest - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","This is Rebecca Forest for David Amsellem. Could you please talk about your level of confidence that potential generic filers on RESTASIS will have to do full trial for approval. And any color on the progress of your next-generation RESTASIS program?","Scott M. Whitcup","So this is Scott. Yes, we get a lot of questions. Currently, if you look at FDA regulation, a clinical trial is required to get an A-, B-rated product to RESTASIS. If you look at how RESTASIS was approved, and we've had discussions with the agency, the trial to get an A-, B-rated RESTASIS approved is quite large with a very low profitability of success. And we monitor it, and today, we don't know if anyone would go that route, so it's something that we watch very closely. Clearly, our next-generation RESTASIS, that we refer to as RESTASIS X, will have even more novel technology and be much more difficult on top of RESTASIS to copy in a generic world. And we don't talk much about that program for competitive reasons, but at the appropriate time, once we have more clinical data and are ready to, those will be presented at clinical conferences as well.","David E. I. Pyott","And of course, what you can see is various companies trying to come up with branded competitors, which, of course, is completely legitimate. Yes, at some point, we're not going to be the only game in town for therapeutic dry eye. But even for that, of course, there have been many very difficult situations where those products haven't succeeded in the United States. So not really outside the United States either. So obviously, we track all those companies and products to see where they are and what their data is.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Cacciatore, Cowen and Company.","Ken Cacciatore - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","David, I just want to follow up on some of your BOTOX commentary. As I look at the guidance and try to look at it on a constant-currency basis, it looks like in H2, you could be growing, actually, accelerating your growth year-over-year from H1. So I was just wondering if you could put that into context of the migraine launch, maybe where we stand with the DTC and the success you're seeing here in terms of patient accruals and reorder rates?","David E. I. Pyott","Yes. Well, I very much follow your conclusion. The team internally knows that as successful as we are ramping up growth, we've got to keep at it. And of course, that's why I look at all the leading indicators of not only training, but access, insurance verifications, and things are on a very good track, and that's why I really, sort of very high level, were saying when we look at the neurogenic bladder launch, it's sort of following in its metrics, obviously, completely different conditions. But if you like the launch patterns are very similar, and that's also looking very good. So indeed, we are planning to grow a lot more in the second half. And of course, when you look at Q3 numbers, I think most analysts have correctly deduced that the currency hit probably will be the highest in Q3, if rates stay where they are on world currencies. And of course, as much as we talk about the euro, for us, our -- one of our biggest markets overseas is Brazil. And their currency was really hot for a while, and now it's come down a little bit. And when we translate that back into dollars, that affects us. And -- but as Jeff said, the economic impacts of that, we have extremely buttoned down and planned for.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Seamus Fernandez, Leerink Swann.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Just very quickly, David, can you just give us your characterization. It looks like LUMIGAN, actually, in the quarter, tracked a little bit below. Just wondering how much of that was actually destocking that's already started on the 0.03%? And then how should we see that destocking progress through the balance of the year to your expectations? And then the magnitude of the full conversion to LUMIGAN 0.01%?","David E. I. Pyott","Yes, fine. I'd say when you really sort of think about all the comments I made, probably the biggest single item to think about is: a, foreign exchange impact, which, you could say to some degree, isn't real, it's just translating foreign currencies into dollars; secondly is inventory reduction, particularly in Q2. As you alluded, some destocking of LUMIGAN has already occurred because, of course, whether you're a wholesaler or a retailer, you could see how the product was swinging over to 0.01%. And in the back half of the year, we've certainly planned for further reduction, as we basically take it down to 0. And of course, that's a good place to be when the new year starts up in January of '13, so I would say, think about inventory and then also the impact of rebates. Where on the access side, we've done very well, and that's why I wanted to put that whole Caremark commentary into context. It really was in the context of a ball moving up and down the 5-yards line. This was not a big deal. This is the win-lose. You lose some, you win some, and it really didn't change where we'll end up in 2013 in any meaningful way.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Annabel Samimy, Stifel, Nicolaus.","Annabel Samimy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I want to switch to something a little bit more esoteric. You mentioned the bariatric franchise or bariatric market, rather, was flattening a bit and maybe coming out of the decline in growth. Can you just give us some color about how you think about the market now that you have some obesity drugs that have been approved by the FDA and how that might impact the bariatric market, bariatric surgery, et cetera.","David E. I. Pyott","Yes, fine. Well, I mean, obviously, we're looking for improvement in general meteorological conditions. And if the overall bariatric market is going down a lot, that makes our job of getting LAP-BAND and ORBERA back to growth even more difficult. As I've stated many times, all our emphasis has been on how do we improve reimbursement access. And we have made progress, but of course, as we have always pointed out with most insurance plans following calendar years, it's much more about waiting for the next calendar year to see a real change in policy. Regarding obesity drugs, my view is that sort of Venn diagram, that circle scarcely touches this one. It's a different type of patient in terms of the amount of -- the number of pounds or kilos they want to lose, and I think that well touches much more diet change and exercise. And I know a little bit about that because in my prior life a long time ago, before I joined Allergan, actually, I was the biggest marketer of what would be called in this country, as diet aids and slimming products in Europe, in both pharmacy and grocery. So I have some memories in my head that I'll never forget, and it's quite a difficult market.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marc Goodman, UBS Security.","Marc Goodman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","When you look at SG&A, I'm just curious if you could give us kind of a behind-the-scenes, just the push-pulls that are going on here? Obviously, there's more spending on emerging markets, but where are you kind of cutting back on spending just to kind of manage the business? And then if you can just give us a flavor for how that -- and how we should think about spending for the next 6 quarters, what will be the push-pulls there? Obviously, we have VOLUMA potentially coming to the stage, you have the overactive bladder, but I wouldn't think you'd have a lot of incremental spending on those. So maybe next year, SG&A is leveraged even more than it was this year.","David E. I. Pyott","Sure. As I've often stated, from a very high level, in periods of dollar weakness, I encourage my colleagues to bring me a wish list. And the wish list has to have metrics on it, i.e. if I'm nice enough to give them $1 million, what will that do to drive both sales and bottom line? So it's almost like lining up with David's fedwindow, though, to stick to those jokes. So I do prefer my job. So -- and obviously, in times of dollar strength, the margin flips the other way. And frankly, we just start maybe tightening the belt a notch or maybe 2 in terms of things like travel and how many people go to medical conventions because, of course, at the very margin, those things may be over a 3- or 4-year, you could argue, have some difference. But in the short term, none at all. So now going to sort of the higher level, where you are saying when we look over the balance of this year and to next and where we'll potentially there could be increased expenditure. Well, on a very high level, not really because if you think about idiopathic overactive bladder, we've already created the BOTOX sales force for urology in the United States. And sadly, one says that we won't make any money on SANCTURA. But now we have soon -- we have more detail capacity, given that we're not spending any more time on SANCTURA. So that opens up space for idiopathic, which, hopefully, will be approved early-ish next year, 2013. In Europe, the margin, of course, as we're getting those approvals and get reimbursement, we're adding people. But it's kind of dozens and certainly, not hundreds. And if I go to your comment about fillers, basically, we have the sales force in place. And now we can just keep on adding products to the bag and move around what is our detail focus, if you like. And whether the sales force have been spending time on JUV\u00c9DERM Ultra or hopefully, next year, VOLUMA doesn't make a lot of difference. You can just move around the capacity. And there is a real source of leverage, not because of need to rein in spend, but it just makes strategic sense. And then as you alluded here and there, there will be emerging market additions. But of course, as I often point out, another 100 salespeople in India don't cost anything like another 100 salespeople in the U.S. or Germany or somewhere like that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Buck, Buckingham Research Group.","David G. Buck - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Jeff, by the -- narrowing the guidance for this year, you talked about how you're managing some of the headwinds and particularly, in the international business in Europe. Can you give some sense of look maybe, David as well, of how you see the health of the reimburse business in Europe and ex-U.S. overall as we go into 2013, what the headwind increase might be and how you plan to match it?","Jeffrey L. Edwards","Well, if you're talking about pricing, every year, we go through this process of trying to determine how governments will impact reimburse markets in Europe. And every year, really, as long as I've been here, we've had pressure, and we've grown accustomed to dealing with that pressure. Over the last 2 or 3 years, as you know, we've seen an increase in that pressure, and we dial that into the budget process and we anticipated going into the new year. So I hate to say we're used to it, but we're used to it. And our expectation is the governments in Europe will continue being prudent with what they do and how deal with it. They're all looking for places to cut. We don't have our heads buried in a pile of sand here. Our expectations are that we're -- what we're seeing this year could very likely be what we see next year as well. So that's what we're planning on. Any additional comments?","David E. I. Pyott","Yes, I mean, when I look at industry data, and obviously, I know a lot of other people in pharmaceuticals and devices, and you can really say our business has held up very strongly compared to the experiences of both large as well as medium-sized companies. So we just watch it very carefully. And I suppose it's the power of innovation and the final instance.","David G. Buck - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","I guess, Jeff, just a follow-up. And this is one of the years where you've been calling it out, I think it's $110 million or so in pricing. Should we be expecting that level to stay constant or an incremental $110 million, an incremental $200 million? I mean what sort of delta that we might be expecting?","David E. I. Pyott","Yes, well, we haven't changed that number. And obviously, it's premature for next year.","Operator","Will come from Steve Willoughby, Cleveland Research.","Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company","Just a question regarding your comment on the dermal filler market now growing at high-single digits. If you could remind us where that was growing previously? And then your thoughts on what's allowing BOTOX Cosmetic to continue the double-digit growth rates, given that it sounds like dermal fillers are maybe a little bit softer.","David E. I. Pyott","Yes. Well, if one looks back over a year ago, I recollect what I was saying is that dermal fillers probably were going high teens then. I think that was still where we were benefiting from the innovation of lidocaine. And like everything, trees just don't keep growing to the sky, but I still think it's very healthy that the fillers market in the U.S. is growing healthily. And I think when we have the opportunity of introducing VOLUMA, that will create another huge wave of growth. And my closest market to draw the analogy from is Canada, and I've often stated that we believe that the introduction of VOLUMA to Canada probably increased the overall Canadian market. I don't just mean us, although we're, by far, the market leader as company by 40%. Of course, that's absolutely huge. And now that we have the 1 mL format in Europe, when I look through all the markets, you can say this is the power of innovation, despite economic malaise in certain places. I think when one looks at BOTOX Cosmetic, it's interesting that it's growing even faster than filler. In many markets, my theory is that there's an equilibrium where, one day, the neuromodulators and fillers will be somewhere around the 50-50 mark. And then it's based on history, based on approval timings, relative strength of companies and so on. But certainly, very, very encouraging that the U.S. market continues to grow double digit. And that, I'd like to think, is due to the investments we put into training physicians, how to conduct these procedures to enable great results for their patients.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Douglas Tsao, Barclays.","Douglas D. Tsao - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a quick question, David, to follow up on your comments regarding LUMIGAN. Where are you in terms of the contract negotiation process for formulary for 2013? Obviously, you noted that you can -- you've had a win to offset Caremark but -- and you expect 2013 to be consistent. Just curious when that process should be completed?","David E. I. Pyott","Yes, I would say that from a formal point of view, there are a couple of contracts where the ink isn't dry on the sheet of paper yet, but we have a pretty strong indication of where it's going to go. So I would say the lion's share of these contracts are done or almost done. And that's why I made the comments I did about seeing, from everything we know, overall formulary position in 2013 will be very, very similar to 2012.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen, Wells Fargo.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Scott, you hosted a very positive R&D Day this past March. There's a perception, I think, that there aren't that many catalysts in 2012, the second half, but I think that changes in the first half of 2013. Could you please remind us of the key product launches over the next 12 months and key data releases we should look for? And specifically on bimatoprost for baldness, do you expect that to be at AAD in March?","Scott M. Whitcup","I think, if you're talking about key catalysts, clearly, regulatory approval of BOTOX for idiopathic overactive bladder, as we presented at R&D Day in March, is our biggest opportunity. We've presented some of the data, but more to come. But overall, the findings were very strong, and so, we will continue to roll out data. On the aesthetic side, as David commented, VOLUMA's just a terrifically innovative product wherever we've introduced it in the 1 mL with lidocaine packaging, it's done well. That's sitting at the FDA. It's filed. I think it's a unique product, which is why FDA will look over it carefully, but the data are strong, and so, that could be a very important launch in the United States for '13. As I commented earlier, we've got 2 products: unit dose LUMIGAN; and unit dose GANFORT to help our glaucoma franchise in Europe. So that's another important launch as well. And in terms of earlier-stage data, again, you commented on the bimatoprost for scalp hairloss. We haven't made -- until we have the data, we won't decide which meeting to submit that to. So we'll let you know once the abstracts are submitted. And then Q1, as we look at LATISSE globally, is Europe. So that was already filed, and we're hoping to have approval late this year, early next year. So lots of approvals and launches. And then given my ophthalmology background, a lot of focus as well on our anti-VEGF DARPin program, and so, there should be some data from our Phase II program next year as well. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of the pipeline, and my guess is that, that will help. And then my colleagues remind we as well that we have another file in on the aesthetic side, which is BOTOX for crow's feet. So again, what that allows us to do is expand physician training on label, which we focus on and also will give us publications and should help the BOTOX Cosmetic franchise, both in the U.S. and globally.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Nachman, Susquehanna Financial Group.","Gary Nachman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","David, from what you're hearing on BOTOX OEB so far in neurogenic, what's your sense for how much of an impact to idiopathic indication could have next year? And how quick that ramp may be since you're sort of laying the land in that market already this year?","David E. I. Pyott","Well, obviously, all of our representatives and commercial people are extremely tightly schooled in not talking about idiopathic overactive bladder because that's an absolute no-no. But clearly, when you look at it from the physician's point of view. Whether you're injecting 15 times into the bladder or 30 times, from a technical point of view, is not really much different. The one thing, of course, they do read the data carefully on is avoiding retention. Clearly, a big issue. But I would say compared to other launches, once you train the doctor to do neurogenic, broadly speaking, they are set up to go rapidly to idiopathic once it's approved. And then it all comes down to the reimbursement. And of course, as I remind you, we should have a permanent CPT code in place in January. So that will be very helpful.","Operator","That will come from the line of Gregory Waterman, Goldman Sachs.","Gregory Waterman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","On BOTOX therapeutic growth versus cosmetic growth, I know you gave a number of data points. I'm looking for just a little clarification. First, I think you mentioned double-digit growth on both aesthetics  and therapeutic. Last quarter, you mentioned a higher double-digit for therapeutic versus cosmetic. Is this still the case, and what magnitude? And then, I guess, more generally, if you could characterize the acceleration in year-over-year therapeutic growth second quarter versus first quarter, and also thinking about the second half of the year?","David E. I. Pyott","Yes, no, I think you're very insightful, gatoring my words carefully. If I stick to Q2, both the franchises grew at very similar rates. And that, for me, is encouraging on 2 fronts: one is that as you were stating, and as I answered it in an earlier question, the therapeutic side should continue to accelerate, really, driven off the benefits of the ramp in Chronic Migraine and neurogenic bladder in the U.S. also, some earlier launches overseas; and then, of course, very encouraging is that the BOTOX Cosmetic side of the house, despite everybody's fears about the global consumer, continues to perform very well.","James M.

You may begin your conference.","Manisha Narasimhan","Thank you, Jacqueline. And good morning, everyone. I would like to welcome you to the Allergan first quarter 2019 earnings conference call.","Earlier this morning, we issued a press release reporting Allergan earnings for the quarter ended March 31, 2019. The press release and our Slide deck, which we are presenting this morning, are available on our corporate website at allergan.com.","We are conducting a live webcast of this call, a replay of which will be available on our website after its conclusion. Please note that today's call is copyrighted material of Allergan and cannot be rebroadcast without the expressed written consent.","Turning to Slide 2, I would also like to remind you that, during the course of this call, management will make projections or other forward-looking remarks regarding future events or the future financial performance of the Company. It's important to note that such statements and events are Forward-Looking Statements and reflect our current perspective of the business trends and information as of today's date.","Actual results may differ materially from current expectations and projections depending on a number of factors affecting the Allergan business. These factors are detailed in our periodic public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Allergan disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements except as expressly required by the law.","During the call, we will refer to non-GAAP figures. Our GAAP financial metrics and reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP metrics can be found in our earnings release issued this morning and posted on our website. In addition, all global and international growth rates referenced this morning are on an ex-FX basis.","Turning to Slide 3 and our agenda this morning. With us on today's call are Brent Saunders, Chairman and CEO; Bill Meury, Chief Commercial Officer; David Nicholson, Chief R&D Officer; and Matt Walsh, Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available during the Q&A is Bob Bailey, our Chief Legal Officer.","With that, I will turn the call over to Brent.","Brent Saunders","Thank you, Manisha. Good morning and thank you for joining us on our call today. Our first quarter results reflected ongoing strength of our core business across our four key therapeutic areas Medical Aesthetics, Eye Care, CNS and GI.","This represented the 9th consecutive quarter of core business growth. The growth prospects of these businesses remained strong, driven by product line depth, new product flow, commercial expertise, and a robust pipeline with five potential FDA approvals and new product launches anticipated over the next 18 months.","As a management team and Board, we are focused on strengthening and growing our business, while executing disciplined capital allocation and returning capital to shareholders. At the same time, we are realistic about the challenges and risks facing the business and the work we need to continue to create value for our shareholders, customers, patients and colleagues.","We understand that we need to continue to earn their trust through our performance commercially, operationally, and in R&D, and we are committed to acting with urgency to do just that.","Now, let me turn to the quarter's results on Slide 5. We had a good start to the year with continued growth of our core business, which was up 4.4% year-over-year. Against a backdrop of continuing product LOEs, our total revenue was stable excluding the impact of foreign exchange.","We made progress on building several important brands, which we expect will be key drivers of long-term growth. There are many standouts in the first quarter, such as BOTOX, JUVEDERM and VRAYLAR, as well some brands which we are working on further bolstering. Bill will address these in greater detail.","In R&D, we believe we are well-positioned with five anticipated FDA approvals over the next 18 months or so. They include cariprazine for bipolar depression where we expect a regulatory decision later this month; ubrogepant for the acute treatment of migraine where we expect a regulatory decision in December; CoolTone, a new muscle toning system as part of CoolSculpting family, which we expect to launch toward the end of the year.","Bimatoprost SR, which is a dropless glaucoma therapy where we plan to make a regulatory submission in the first half of the year; and abicipar for wet age-related macular degeneration where we plan to make a regulatory submission also in the first half of this year.","In the first quarter, we reported top line results from the Phase III rapastinel program and we were deeply disappointed that these studies were not successful. Our commitment to bring new medicines to patients in need remains unchanged and our pipeline supports this commitment.","Across our four key therapeutic areas, we now have 46 programs on the pharmaceutical side and 30 programs on the device side. I'm happy to report that we achieved solid results in the first quarter, while remaining disciplined and shareholder friendly in terms of capital allocation. You will hear more about this from Matt.","Slide 6 provides an overview of the key drivers of our financial results in the first quarter of 2019, and illustrates that our core business, accounting for about 90% of total revenues reached $3.2 billion. This continued strength of our core business, together with our emerging pipeline, positions us well for 2019 and beyond.","Slide 7 provides more focused look at our core business, which is comprised of promoted brands and brands with ongoing exclusivity. The first quarter of 2019 is the ninth consecutive quarter where our core business has delivered consistent year-over-year growth.","Since 2016, our core business has grown by over $3 billion and currently accounts for 90% of our revenues. In 2017, our core business made up 79% of our revenues; and in 2018, it accounted for 87% of our revenues.","Looking ahead, we expect to work our way through the impact of the LOEs, and reach a place where our core business generates almost all of our revenues.","Before I turn the call over to Bill, I wanted to take a moment to comment on the results of our recent annual shareholder meeting and the extensive discussions we, as Allergan's leadership team and Board of Directors, have had with our shareholders in the weeks and months leading up to it.","Let me start by saying that I take seriously the opinion of our shareholders, including David Tepper, we have benefited from the candid and constructive shareholder feedback, and I shared their desire to create more value at Allergan. Our focus and interests are 100% aligned with those of our shareholders.","We have been on this transformation journey for almost three years since the sale of our generics business. Since then, we have worked to grow our key products, add depth and breadth to our pipeline, and build scale to compete in four therapeutic areas.","I share in the disappointment that the value creation has not materialized yet. But when I look at the strength of our core business, the potential of our pipeline and the dedication of our team and Board, I have great confidence that it will.","So, how are we going to do that? First, we will continue to focus on growing our core business and realizing value through the pipeline. That means keeping our teams focused, delivering excellent service to our customers and driving key R&D milestones.","The sense of urgency to create value is high and the Board is actively and continuously reviewing alternative avenues that could unlock value in the near-term. I assure you that the Board, management team and I recognize the urgency and we will take decisive action to drive value-enhancing opportunities.","Now, let me turn the call over to Bill.","Bill Meury","Thanks, Brent. Slide 9 is a product level sales analysis for the first quarter ranked in terms of sales growth versus prior year. We had a strong start to the year, posting double-digit growth rates for several of our major products.","Botox Cosmetics, Vraylar, Viibryd, Zenpep, Juvederm, Ozurdex and Lo Loestrin were standouts in the quarter. Other key brands, Natrelle implants, Alloderm and CoolSculpting were down versus prior year, which I will discuss shortly. Overall, our core business performance was solid and we anticipate growth strengthening throughout the year.","At the bottom of the graph, and as expected, total sales growth was impacted by products already facing loss of exclusivity as well as the restated sales decline ahead of anticipated generic competition.","Now, I will touch on our key therapeutic areas, starting with our largest Medical Aesthetics. Globally, sales for our facial injectable line, Botox and Juvederm, were up 13% versus prior year. Demand was strong domestically and internationally, and demand was broad based across both the aesthetic dermatology and plastic surgery segments.","Turning to Botox, I will talk about our results, the outlook for the market and our toxin development programs. US Botox sales were up 17% and international up 8%. Sales for Botox in the United States, were powered by a significantly larger consumer activation program, with advertising, digital and PR efforts; an expanded sales force to reach more practices and achieving higher levels of customer service; and a first quarter promotional offer for top customers.","Additionally, we added a quarter of a million people to our Brilliant Distinctions loyalty program in the first quarter, which is the best quarter in the history of the program. We have added one million in the last 12 months for a total of six million members.","This is relevant because 67% of our Botox consumers are BD members and they visit their practices 23% more often and spend 36% more per year than non-members. It's an important asset for customers and for Allergan.","Now, for a few comments about the aesthetics market. The prospects for growth here are excellent. There is both a youth movement and a prevention movement under way and Allergan has launched three digital ventures in partnership with aesthetic practices to attract new consumers including Allergan Data Labs.","Which is a data science and digital marketing group now fully operational in Irvine. They are launching the largest digital marketing campaign ever for Botox on Mother's Day, which we expect will attract tens of thousands of new users and loyalty members.","In terms of competition, it's the reality of a growing market. Aesthetics has never been a one-product market and never will be, but it is an efficient market, which means, in the end, it will likely support three products, not four, five or six.","Our strategy, like that of our customers, is to compete on quality, innovation and customer service, not on price. That is the only sustainable strategy in our view. When it comes to neurotoxins, customers and patients are more outcomes and service sensitive than price sensitive. We are well positioned to defend this business we.","Finally, on the product development front, we are developing one of two types of products, products that either help providers deliver even better aesthetic outcomes or products that attract new consumers.","Right now, we are advancing new indications for Botox, masseter and platysma, a new pre-filled syringe for Botox and three completely novel toxins including a liquid, a rapid-acting short duration and a long-acting, which are in various stages of development.","Turning to Juvederm, fillers have been a step change in aesthetics. They have given providers the ability to volumize, lift and shape. Juvederm is the number one filler in the world. Sales internationally increased 18%, with exceptional performance in Asia-Pacific, Middle East, Africa and Europe. New product launches, including Volux last month in Europe and new consumer programs are fueling demand around the world.","In the US, sales were up 6% versus prior year. We expect sales growth for the year to be higher than the first quarter, which was impacted by strong buying in the prior fourth quarter of 2018. For reference, fourth quarter sales in 2018 were up 14% last year.","Turning to Slide 11, CoolSculpting. Our first quarter sales, of course, were below expectations, off 4% versus prior year due to consumer demand and a reduction in system sales in the United States. We have a lot of work to do in this business in the short-term, especially in the U.S., which I will talk about shortly.","Long-term, the outlook for CoolSculpting is still positive for two reasons. First, we are set up to launch three new CoolSculpting systems in the next two to three years, which will improve outcomes for the procedure and underlying demand.","And, second, we have only scratched the surface of the body contouring market with an estimated penetration rate of less than 10%. There is still a large untapped pool of consumers to reach and convert and we expect sales for the year to be up 5% to 10% globally despite our first quarter performance.","We had several priorities when we acquired CoolSculpting. They were expand the US installed base, which is now 50% larger than it was two years ago; reorganize the international business; accelerate the development of new CoolSculpting technologies and drive consumer demand.","In roughly two years, we have achieved three of the four. Right now, more focus is needed on consumer marketing and activation. We have exceptionally high awareness levels. We have 7 million consumers visiting our website, an install base totaling 4,000 accounts and 6,000 systems.","So, the foundation here is solid, but our consumer conversion rate is low. We are taking a number of measures to fix that, including Allergan Data Labs is launching a new digital initiative to drive website traffic conversion with the first-ever free cycle promotion.","We are also partnering with high-end health clubs around the country and conducting marketing events at luxury malls and wellness centers to move consumers from awareness to usage. We are changing the approach here from a focus on not only practices and systems, but also consumers.","Two other important sources of future growth for this business in 2019 are International and CoolTone. In International, we have restructured the business, transitioning from a distributor model to a direct promotion model. We are now doing business directly in 69 countries and have 3,000 systems placed around the world.","Next, CoolTone will launch in late 2019. This is a muscle toning system that is complementary and will be marketed alongside CoolSculpting. We will be taking orders for CoolTone by midyear and shipping equipment in early Q4.","Now, with any launch, current capital sales slow as providers want to see new package offers -- what new package offers might look like. We expect capital sales to rebound upon the launch of CoolTone.","Allergan sales in the first quarter were impacted by a supply constraint for donor material. The supply situation has stabilized and is expected to improve throughout the year. Sales growth of this business should trade in the mid-single digits.","Sales for our Natrelle line of breast implants have been impacted by regulatory changes related to our textured implants internationally. Our 2019 sales outlook anticipated these changes.","In the US, FDA conducted a public hearing on breast implant safety. David will talk more about this shortly. Note that, in the US, over 90% of our business is smooth implants.","Turning to Slide 12 and CNS. Sales for Botox were at expectations, up 6% for the first quarter. The year-over-year comparison was impacted by the fact that the first quarter of 2019 had two fewer selling days than the first quarter of 2018. Adjusting for quarterly selling days, Botox growth was in the high-single digits.","In terms of the market, the migraine prevention market is 10% to 15% larger than it was a year ago. Our share of new chronic migraine patients is 47%, remains stable. We estimate that only 2% of CGRP patients were switched from Botox and combination use is limited. As we have said before, we expect the growth rate in 2019 will be in the mid to high-single digits.","Sales for Vraylar in Q1 2019 totaled $144 million, up 70%. This product continues to exceed expectations on almost all metrics, including prescribers, prescription levels and formulary coverage rates.","The growth catalyst for Vraylar in 2019 is the anticipated new indication for bipolar depression, which is currently under review at the FDA. Target audience at detailing levels for Vraylar will be almost doubled in May to cover not only psychiatrist, but also primary care physicians.","Turning to Slide 13 on GI. Underlying prescription demand growth for Linzess in the first quarter was in the double digits. This was offset by a lower average selling price and trade buying patterns, resulting in a net revenue gain of 1% versus prior year. Sales for Zenpep were strong, up 19%.","Turning now to Eye Care. Our glaucoma business was impacted by pricing headwinds in the United States and the impact of trade buying patterns internationally. We expect this franchise to be stable for the year. Ozurdex sales increased 10%. Our supply situation has improved significantly, and we expect all markets to be fully restocked in the second quarter.","Restasis prescription demand was relatively stable year-over-year. This was offset by a lower average selling price. Sales orders for Restasis MDPF have been replaced by the Restasis single unit vials as we work through a back order situation, which we expect to resolve by the second half.","Finally, turning to Slide 14, our international sales totaled $802 million, up 1% versus prior year. Excluding the impact of Natrelle implants, sales were up 5.2%. The growth drivers were Juvederm, CoolSculpting, Botox Cosmetic, and Botox Therapeutic.","The Asia-Pacific, Middle East, Africa region continues to be the most important growth driver in our International business. In the quarter, LACAN sales were further impacted by trade buying patterns for our Eye Care business and lower Fibristal sales and generic Restasis in Canada.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to David.","David Nicholson","Thank you, Bill. And good morning, everyone. We made significant pipeline progress in the first quarter of the year. Before I talk about progress, I will begin with the readout from our Phase III program of rapastinel as an adjunctive treatment in major depressive disorder. I was very disappointed by these results.","Despite the setback, our commitment to bringing innovative medicines to patients with unmet needs in mental health remains unchanged. We expect to present detailed data from the rapastinel program at an upcoming medical conference.","We still have two studies with rapastinel ongoing. One in suicidality and the other in monotherapy. We will perform an interim analysis of these studies to check for futility, and we will see this data later this year.","Turning to Slide 16, which highlights the major upcoming catalysts for the year. As you heard from Brent, we expect approval of five major programs over the course of the next 18 months. Most near-term is the anticipated approval of cariprazine for bipolar depression where we have an FDA action date later this month. As recently announced, our NDA has been filed for ubrogepant, our oral CGRP inhibitor for the acute treatment of migraine, and we have an action date in December.","Also within CNS, we expect to report in the second half of the year top line results from the ongoing Phase II study of AGN-241751, our oral NMDA modulator. This agent has the same mechanism of action as rapastinel. The oral formulation allows us to evaluate the safety and efficacy of more frequent dosing.","Turning to Eye Care. We recently reported safety data from the MAPLE study for abicipar in neovascular age-related macular degeneration. Data from this study showed a decrease in the rates of inflammation compared to that previously reported in the Phase III CEDAR and SEQUOIA studies.","We view this decrease in inflammation rates a step in the right direction and we will continue to work on improving the formulation. We expect to make a regulatory submission in the US in the first half of the year, followed by a submission in the EU in the second half of the year. We also expect to make a regulatory submission for Bimatoprost sustained release in the US for the treatment of glaucoma in the first half of 2019.","In Medical Aesthetics, we are excited to be launching CoolTone, a muscle toning system utilizing high frequency electromagnetic stimulation aimed at fast-twitch skeletal muscle. In addition, versions 3.0 and 4.0 of CoolSculpting are expected within the next two to three years.","Slide 17 provides a summary of the key events we anticipate over the next 18 months. We continue to advance the rest of our mid to late-stage pipeline according to our targets and expectations.","Turning to Slide 18, our pharmaceutical pipeline has 46 programs in various stages of development, with two that are currently under regulatory review and 10 programs in Phase III development.","Our development programs continue to remain aligned with our timelines with the exception of brazikumab. This IL-23 monoclonal antibody is being developed in a competitive space with a large number of competing trials.","Similarly, as outlined on Slide 19, we continue to develop our device pipeline with 30 programs in development. This will continue to drive innovation within Medical Aesthetics. This is a rich development portfolio in line with our leadership in this area and, as such, we have more than doubled our R&D investments in devices in Medical Aesthetics over the last two years.","In the quarter, the FDA held a two-day advisory committee to discuss the benefits and risk of breast implants and dermal matrices. The agency recently announced that textured breast implants will remain on the market, and are considering actions to be taken to improve product labeling and communication .","We are excited about the future of our R&D organization. As always, I thank my colleagues in R&D for their hard work, as well as the investigators and particularly the patients who are participating in our clinical trials.","And now, I will turn the call over to Matt.","Matt Walsh","Thank you, David. And looking now to the key financial highlights on Page 21. As Brent mentioned earlier, our core business continues to be strong and we are delivering on our key financial commitments through the first quarter of 2019.","Starting at the top of the Page, net revenues in the quarter were $3.6 billion, flat year-over-year on a constant-currency basis, which means the 2% decline in reported revenues was due solely to foreign exchange translation.","The highlight of the quarter was the solid performance of the promoted brands with ongoing exclusivity, which was up 5.3%. This entirely offset the 27% decline in LOEs and divestitures, which now includes the generic entry of Canasa.","Our core business, which comprises 90% of total revenues, grew 4.4% at constant currency and was actually over one percentage point higher at 5.5% excluding the impact of regulatory changes in the international textured implant market.","A few things to bear in mind as we think about 2019 revenues. First, from a phasing perspective, our first quarter tends to be our seasonally slowest quarter revenue-wise historically. And second, as we stated when we issued 2019 guidance, we expect revenue growth rates to accelerate in the remaining quarters of 2019 as we annualize the back half 2018 issues related to the Ozurdex recall and Alloderm donor supply.","Now, turning to margins. Non-GAAP gross margin grew 50 basis points to 86.7%, primarily driven by favorable product mix. Operating margins, however, declined 270 basis points to 45.2%, which was driven by two key factors.","First, in sales and marketing, we increased expenditures in our Facial Aesthetics business and we bolstered our commercial footprint internationally, especially in Asia Pacific. And second, we increased R&D spending to support ongoing late-stage clinical development programs.","Turning to the lower section of the Slide. Non-GAAP performance net income per share was $3.79, representing a 1% growth year-on-year versus the first quarter 2018, which reflects the impact of share buybacks during 2018 in the first quarter of this year.","Slide 22 provides an overview of our P&L line items for the quarter, most of which I have already discussed. I would, however, like to highlight two important line items, our net interest expense and our tax rate, both of which are meaningfully favorable to prior year, and this was contemplated in our 2019 guidance.","I would now like to discuss a significant GAAP accounting matter and provide the appropriate context. Each quarter, we monitor goodwill and intangibles for indicators of impairment.","In the first quarter, we recorded a $2.5 billion goodwill impairment in our General Medicines reporting unit, primarily related to the failure of rapastinel in Phase III clinical trials and, to a lesser extent, timing true-ups of other R&D programs.","Bear in mind that this goodwill impairment in our Gen Med reporting unit is not related to the acquisition price of Naurex as this was 100% expensed, this IP R&D, at the time of the acquisition in 2015.","Rather, this impairment is a consequence of the removal of future anticipated cash flows related to rapastinel and the timing true-ups of other programs from our long-term financial projections. This in turn lowered the fair value of the Gen Med reporting unit as of March 31 below book value.","While the strong performance we have seen across other parts of Allergan support increased fair values, those increases are in other reporting units which, under GAAP, do not impact the goodwill impairment test of the Gen Med business.","Turning to Slide 23 now and returning to the quarter's results, here we see an overview of our financial results by reporting segment. US Specialized Therapeutics experienced a decline of 2.3% in revenues, which was driven by lower Restasis sales, as well as the sale of our Med Derm business in 2018. Contribution margin was down 290 basis points, driven by the revenue decline, coupled with the increase in promotional spending in our facial aesthetics business.","Looking at U.S. General Medicine, the segment grew 2.1% year-over-year. This was driven by double-digit growth across key brands, including Vraylar, Viibryd, Lo Loestrin and Zenpep. This growth was offset by the continued impact of products facing LOEs, which in this quarter also includes the generic entry of Canasa.","Contribution margin increased 90 basis points due to higher revenues and the benefit from lower promotional selling expenses, resulting from the restructuring initiatives. Lastly, on international revenues, these grew 1% on a constant currency basis and was significantly impacted by foreign exchange translation.","On a constant currency basis and excluding the impact of the regulatory changes in the textured Implant market, international revenues increased 5.2% year-over-year. Contribution margin declined 40 basis points, due in part to the textured implant issue as well as increased investment into high-growth regions, especially Asia-Pacific.","Now, turning to Slide 24, you can see our operating cash flow in the first quarter was strong at $1.2 billion and this supports our 2019 guidance of $5 billion to $5.5 billion. Our priorities on capital allocation remain unchanged.","First, reinvestment in our business for growth in our four key therapeutic areas. During the quarter, we acquired Envy Medical, which increases the breadth of our Medical Aesthetics offerings to now include skin resurfacing and dermal infusion.","Second, debt reduction, which is important in the context of the anticipated Restasis LOE. Third, funding and prudently growing our dividend. And fourth, share buybacks as a means to manage earnings dilution that would result from asset sales or from long-term equity-based incentive plans.","And as you can see on our capitalization table, we continue to work toward our capital allocation goals. We ended the quarter with $23.5 billion in total debt and $1.8 billion in cash and equivalents, which brings our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio to 2.8 times as of March 31.","Coming up in the second quarter, we have a scheduled debt maturity of approximately $800 million and we intend to retire using cash on hand and operating cash flow. We remain committed and on track to achieve our target net leverage ratio of 2.5 times by the end of 2020, which would, of course, enable us to sustain our commitment to an investment-grade credit rating.","With regard to share buybacks, we said on the last call that, as part of our 2019 guidance, we intended to repurchase $800 million of shares during the year. We accomplished this entire amount in the first quarter, which completely utilizes the 2018 $2 billion share repurchase authorization.","We have the 2019 $2 billion share authorization available to us. However, it's important to note that our revised guidance contemplates no further share repurchases during 2019. As previously mentioned, this assumption may change depending upon the progression of asset sales.","Moving now to guidance on Page 25, we are revising guidance upward for 2019. Starting with net revenues, we are raising our full-year outlook and now expect 2019 net revenues to be between $15.1 billion and $15.4 billion, $100 million higher on the low and high end from the previously provided guidance of $15 billion to $15.3 billion.","We now assume a mid-May LOE for Restasis and the increase in revenue guidance is driven by the additional Restasis exclusivity. Our updated revenue guidance continues to contemplate strength in the core business, which is expected to grow at a rate similar to last year in the mid to high single-digit range.","Additionally, we continue to incorporate headwinds previously discussed related to Ozurdex, textured implants, industry wide pricing pressure and foreign exchange translation, and we believe our revised guidance is appropriately conservative across all these points. We continue to expect non-GAAP gross margins for the full-year to be 85% to 85.5% based on our product mix and LOE assumptions, including the impact of generic Restasis.","Our non-GAAP SG&A and R&D expense remains unchanged, as we continue to invest in growth drivers for our key businesses and in advancing our clinical programs in development. Should there be a sustained benefit of incremental Restasis revenues versus our expectations, we would look at opportunities to reinvest a portion of these proceeds back into the business. And this would be similar to what we executed in 2018.","Besides revenue, the only other guidance item that is changing is performance net income per share, which we are increasing from greater than or equal to $16.36 to greater than $16.55. As with revenue, this increase reflects the assumption of additional Restasis exclusivity to mid-May on top of solid core business performance, which is soundly in line with our expectations at this point.","For reference, each additional month of Restasis exclusivity is estimated to add an incremental $60 million to $70 million in sales. Also, please note that our guidance does not include the impact of any significant asset divestitures. If or when we complete these, we will provide an update on the impact to our key financial metrics, including non-GAAP performance income per share.","Until such time as there is a generic Restasis, we expect to provide quarterly financial guidance, both top and bottom line. With our seasonally slowest quarter of the year in Q1 now behind us, we are forecasting sequentially stronger top line performance for the remainder of the year.","For the second quarter 2019, we expect total reported net revenue between $3.85 billion and $4 billion and non-GAAP performance net income per share between $4.20 and $4.40.","And with that , I will turn the call back to Brent.","Brent Saunders","Thank you, Matt. As reflected in our first quarter results, we had a solid start to the year. We are seeing continued momentum in the core business, progressing our pipeline and excited about the launches that we have ahead and, certainly, remain confident in the targets we have for the remainder of the year.","We have covered a lot today. So, let's maybe start the Q&A and I will ask Jacqueline to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Ken Cacciatore from Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Ken Cacciatore","Hey, good morning, Good morning. Brett, question for you, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you talked about the recent shareholder vote that you and the Board continue to look at alternative avenues to unlock value.","So, my question is what would push you and the Board to take these alternative avenues. Is there a certain metric or is it just non-performing share price? Can you give us a sense of what would prompt maybe a different turn into than what you are doing?","And then, along those same lines, what are you hearing as you speak to your shareholders? Is there a common theme that you could discuss with us? Maybe a common frustration they point to and how do you address it? Thank you.","Brent Saunders","Yes. Thanks, Ken. So, look, let me answer your questions perhaps in reverse order if that is acceptable. In terms of the shareholder engagement, both the management team and our Board did, which was significant over the last few months, I think there is a common theme from our shareholders, which is a frustration in the performance of the stock price.","Let me be clear. I share that frustration. I understand that frustration. I'm a very large shareholder relative to my own personal holdings in Allergan and most of the management team is likewise situated. And so, that is something that was loud and clear and we need to make sure that we do everything we can to unlock value and create a better shareholder return for our shareholders over the long-term.","And so, that is clearly, I think, the top issue we heard and we heard it loud and clear. And our Board heard it loud and clear. And I think that was a very constructive and positive experience for our Board members to hear from probably close to 50 different shareholders that they engaged with. So, I think that is pretty straightforward.","I think in terms of prompting us to do something different, the way I would come at it, I would say it's multi-factorial. We have a very experienced and engaged Board. We also have a refreshed Board with several new members with lots of different experiences in this industry and in other businesses.","And I would say that given the frustration on shareholder return, given the strength of the core business, given the pipeline that we have and then put that in the context of the operating environment, the political environment, the regulatory environment, the global environment, we continue to look at what are the ways that we can unlock value.","And I would say that is something that we do regularly and continuously and now, I would say, with a sense of urgency. And so, the Board is on it. The Board is engaged. And stay tuned.","Ken Cacciatore","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Marc Goodman from SVB Leerink. Your line is open.","Marc Goodman","Yes. Morning. David, can you talk about what do you think happened with rapastinel? And talk about the oral pill 751 and whether we should still feel confident are you still confident that that can work?","And then, separately, can you just talk about the breast aesthetics outlook and just review with us how you all are thinking about this now? We have a panel that seem to be not so dire. We have a commentary from the FDA. It doesn't look like it's that big a deal. What is going on in Europe? Just give us a sense of how we should be thinking about that business now. Thanks.","David Nicholson","Yes. Thanks, Mark. So, regarding rapastinel and 241751, and I can make a few comments about breast implants and perhaps Bill from a commercial perspective. We will talk about that mainly. So, look, with Rapastinel, we have the positive Phase II study and then we performed the Phase III programs in adjunctive MDD using once-a-week dosing. And we know that, with ketamine, another NMDA receptor modulator, that such a regimen can be effective in depression.","Now, clearly, when we look at animal models of depression or psychiatric disorders, rapastinel and 751 are incredibly effective in those models. Having said that, some very recent data has shown the more frequent the dosing in those animal models, the greater the efficacy. And that holds true both for rapastinel and for AGN-241751.","But, clearly, I don't know the answer yet. But with 241751, because it's an oral compound, we can test and are testing more frequent dosing. So, by analogy, with the animal data, that may give us a greater chance of showing efficacy with this mechanism of action because 751 has the same mechanism as rapastinel and we plan to have data with 751 by the end of 2019.","Yes. Regarding breast implants, I was present at the advisory, the two day advisory committee that the FDA held recently. And recently, the FDA told us that based on that advisory committee and their other analysis that the textured breast implants, which was the main topic of discussion there, will remain on the market, although they are going to discuss labeling and enhancing communication with the various manufacturers.","Of course, majority of implants that are used in the U.S. are, in fact, smooth implants. There will be a discussion with the FDA about dermal matrices, but that is a different topic. Of course, conversations around the world about taking place with various regulatory authorities about textured implants, and perhaps Bill could pick it up from here.","Bill Meury","Yes, Mark. I think the hearing that the FDA held in Washington was very constructive. As you know, they heard from patients and surgeons and companies. The actions that they are contemplating relate to labeling, informed patient consent, as well as data reporting and collection. And I think all of those things are appropriate right now.","As a commercial matter, 70% of the sales for our Natrelle implants are in the United States, 30% are International. For the purposes of projections, the International business has been appropriately adjusted for our 2019 outlook and beyond.","And as it relates to sales, in the United States, even in the context of the actions FDA is contemplating, I expect that to be a stable business. I think, there was a lot of coordination between the companies and the plastic surgeons to make sure that women's safety is the number one priority here, and I think the business will be stable as we move forward.","Manisha Narasimhan","Okay. Next question, Jacqueline.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Schott from JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Chris Schott","Great. Thanks very much for the question. I was just hoping you could elaborate a little bit more on the CoolSculpting dynamics. I guess, specifically, what in your view triggered this lower consumer uptake or conversion and what gives you confidence that you can fairly quickly turn this around to be able to grow the business this year?","And, If I could, just one follow-up to Ken's question. Brent, I know you've been asked about the idea of a breakup of the company on and off for what seems like the past few years. And I'm sure you are pretty sick of answering it.","But, I guess, given the sustained valuation discount, do you further reconsider some form of split in the company if we don't see a recovery in the share price? And that is a question we constantly are getting from investors. I would just love to hear your latest thoughts on it. Thanks so much.","Brent Saunders","Yes. So, maybe let me answer the second part and then Bill can talk about CoolSculpting. So, look, you are exactly right, Chris. I do get the question quite a bit around split. In fact, I think I very publicly and very clearly addressed this at a Leerink conference a couple of months ago.","And let me just reiterate what I said there, which still holds true, is I have always remained open-minded and the Board remains open-minded to that idea if we believe it's something that creates long-term value.","There are number of factors that go into looking at that one. You just said which is the sustained valuation discount is something that is clearly important. We also tend to look at some of the other important issues, which I mentioned at Leerink and at many other times, like scale particularly outside the U.S. and that is something that is improving as that business grows.","We clearly need to protect Botox as a brand, which is both a aesthetic and therapeutic product and one of the most important brands in the Allergan family. So, that is something that we would have to clearly be thoughtful and meticulous in terms of how we thought about that.","And then scale of R&D as the science of medical aesthetics is clearly moving in the direction of biopharmaceutical R&D versus just medical device R&D. And so, those are just a few of the things that we tend to look at outside of financial complexities and other things like that. But, look, everything is on the table. I said everything was on the table.","Our Board will regularly and actively evaluate these types of decisions. And I think I also made clear in my answer to Ken, they are going to do that with a sense of urgency. So, stay tuned and we will see where we go.","Bill Meury","Hi, Chris. As it relates to CoolSculpting, first, this is getting a lot of attention right now, as you can imagine, I will tell you that the problem we are facing is not due to market saturation, it's not due to customer satisfaction and it's not due to competition, right? I think that is important to recognize. We are managing, I think, two issues in addition to my earlier remarks.","The first one is, when we acquired Zeltiq, we knew that we had what I would describe as an innovation for a new product cycle gap when we got into this 2018 to 2019 period, In other words, if you go back between 2013 and 2017, over a five-year period, there were six different applicators launched for CoolSculpting.","And each applicator opened up a different area of the body and sustained a pretty robust growth rate over that period. It's been fairly quiet for the past 18 to 24 months, and I think we have fixed that right now. We are going to launch CoolTone at the end of 2019, and then we are set up for two additional system upgrades over the next two to three years. Think iPhone 8, 9 and 10.","The second issue is that, after several years on the market, we are dealing, to be fair, with a different type of consumer. We have essentially got to all of the early adopters and now we are working on a group of late adopters.","And they have more questions and they are somewhat more cautious. And so, we have really shifted our focus from, as I mentioned, practices and system placements to a more consumer model. I think the outlook for the business, it's still very positive. You have to recognize that CoolSculpting has a long runway.","And if we are successful with CoolTone, next generation CoolSculpting, and then with our skin tightening technology over the next, let's call it, two to three years, and we are successful both domestically, internationally, this business should reach our initial expectations or come very close.","Manisha Narasimhan","Next question, Jacqueline.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Liav Abraham from Citi. Your line is open.","Liav Abraham","Good morning. First, Brent, I would be interested in how you are thinking about deal making and augmenting your pipeline, particularly on the pharma side as programs either mature or sale, it's been pretty quiet on that front for the past year, at least. I would be interested in your commitment to your open science approach as opposed to potentially enhancing your internal research capabilities. And then, secondly, perhaps for Bill, I would be interested in your view on the pricing outlook for the toxin franchise in 2019 and beyond, given an additional entrant into the market. Thank you.","Brent Saunders","Yes. Thanks, Liav. So, look, let me start by saying that R&D and innovation is the lifeblood of Allergan as it is for any biopharmaceutical company. It's important for us. And I think Bill just kind of explained it in the context of CoolSculpting to have continuous innovation to drive growth. That holds true across the entire portfolio.","When we look at the therapeutic side of our business, which is important, clearly, we are focused on four therapeutic approvals and launches over the next 18 months that are really important for us, whether that be bipolar depression for Vraylar, ubrogepant, abicipar, Bimatoprost SR but, as David mentioned, we also have 10 Phase III programs continuing to advance, whether that be relamorelin or brazikumab or a variety of other things that are listed on the chart in the presentation.","I think when we look in the earlier pipeline, we absolutely need to continue to look to enhance and increase our opportunities to bring real innovation to patients. Some of that will come through some of the collaborations we have already established. So, for example, we have an IND that was accepted or approved related to our partnership with Editas for Leber disease and we expect to enroll patients later this year.","Our first IND with the microbiome and our assembly was also approved, and we will start to enroll patients as well. We are enrolling patients already in that one and we have a variety of other partnerships like that as well that will continue to throw off development candidates. So, there are a lot of activity and we constantly look for new science and new partnerships and new collaborations.","And, in fact, to the second part of your question, upgrading skills is a continuous process. We are always looking to enhance our capabilities in R&D and in science. And, in fact, we announced last quarter or right around the JP Morgan Conference.","I believe, that we were opening up our office in Boston and moving our head of external science and innovation to Boston and building out and hiring and recruiting in the Kendall Square area new science and scientists and capabilities. And so, that is actively under way and we believe that is the right place to have an additional office for our R&D organization.","Now, we are in Southern California, we are in South San Francisco, we are in New Jersey, we are in the UK, and we are in Boston, as well as a few other places. And so, I think we have got a good spread and we are committed to recruiting the best scientists and the best minds that we can to supplement our thinking.","You want to talk, Bill?","Bill Meury","I think that as it relates the aesthetics market and pricing, I think it's a good question. This market has and I think will continue to trade on innovation and customer service. As you know, it's on a very, very solid growth trajectory. It's hard to predict what some of the other companies might do.","I would just say that I think price discounting is tempting, but it can be a trap long-term. It's a slippery slope. It lessens the perceived value of a product. It cuts in the profits, cuts in the customer service, cuts in the R&D. The way we think about it is the value of our products and services right now exceed the prices that we charge.","And if we don't believe that at some point in the future, we make an adjustment. I think the focus here has got to be on attracting new users to the category and introducing products that improve outcomes for those consumers. And that is where we stand right now. I think the business is in great shape as we head into the next several quarters of 2019.","Manisha Narasimhan","Great. Jacqueline, next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason Gerberry from Allergan. Your line is open.","Jason Gerberry","I don't think I work for Allergan. But, hey, Jason Gerberry from Bank of America. Hey, guys. Can you just comment - I know you commented on about 2019, but just sort of curious , your 5% revenue CAGR and how that stands in the aftermath of the rapastinel failure and the MAPLE trial, the tolerability perhaps not hitting the target of some of your competitors on the market. So, can you talk a little bit about, in lieu of those things, are there some positive offsets that have occurred in your mind that could pick up the slack there to show overall level of confidence in the 5% revenue CAGR would be great. Thanks.","Brent Saunders","Yes, absolutely. And if you are looking for a job at Allergan, give me a call later, but [indiscernible] employment. Thanks, Jason.","Look, yes, we are absolutely committed to the 5%. I think some reasons to feel confident about that are the nine consecutive quarters of core business growth, which is now 90% of Allergan and I think will ultimately become most of Allergan over time.","Areas like facial injectables that grew 13% this quarter, looking at products like Vraylar and even Zenpep and Viibryd that are growing above expectations. We saw Lo LOESTRIN and Ozurdex strong at roughly 10% or better year-over-year. And so, those are reasons to be confident in that core business.","Clearly, as we look at the back part of that guidance, the pipeline needs to participate to enable us to reach that target. And rapastinel was frankly not a big part of that guidance. It was further out. So, it really doesn't impact our thinking there.","Esmya did and we have already incorporated that into our thinking. But we have seen improvements in other parts of the, the pipeline, right? So, they were all risk adjusted when we made the comment. We know that the profile of ubrogepant looks very positive and the risk benefit there looks very positive.","Obviously, we need an FDA approval, but that looks good. Bim SR had surprisingly positive results as well and that is being filed in the first half of this year. Abicipar is the only true 12-week anti-VEGF. While we are improving the inflammation, we still believe that could be a very nice product in the forecast, and so that is moving forward.","International growth continues to look solid and will be a big contributor. And so, bear in mind, our outlook was adjusted for some of the asset sales, and so we continue to exceed expectations in the delivery of our quarters. And I think all those reasons combined, both positive and negative, give us reason to be confident.","Jason Gerberry","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore. Your line is open.","Umer Raffat","Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question. Brent, you said everything's on the table and Board is evaluating decisions. My question is, what are your and what are Board's thoughts on the types of valuations some non-pharma spins are getting from the market, for example, Alcon. And what is the timing of when we can hear something from the Board?","And then, one for David as well , if I may. David, from AAN, we saw ubrogepant safety data presented yesterday. And there were five cases of rhabdomyolysis mentioned in there, of which four happened at the higher dose. My question to you is, this wasn't broken out in a proper safety table, but it was more like in patient history comments. So, the question is, how was that term rhabdomyolysis defined in those patient histories. Was it just CK elevation or was it CK elevation plus organ manifestations? Thank you.","Brent Saunders","Yes. So, thanks for the questions. Umer. I will address your first one. And it really I think was answered in Chris' question as well, which is, look, we look at everything. And, clearly, when you see the sustained valuation disconnect, I told you we also evaluate how the market is evaluating and valuing other comparable alternatives.","Alcon would be one of those inputs that clearly we would look at as one of many models to evaluate these types of decisions. We also have new Board members with different experiences and we have a Board that just was out talking independently to 50 plus shareholders. And they heard the sense of frustration.","So, our Board has regularly and continuously evaluated the strategy of this company. They are actively engaged in those discussions and they feel a sense of urgency. I'm not going to put a timeline on that, but I will be very clear again. Our Board gets it. They heard it directly from our shareholders and there will be a sense of urgency.","David, you want to answer?","David Nicholson","Yes. the rhabdo question. Thanks, Umer. Yes, interestingly, just general comment first, we increasingly see cases of exercise-induced rhabdomyolysis in our Phase I studies these days across the Board, across multiple projects. I personally believe that is because people are doing more intense workouts these days. And when I discuss with my colleagues, heads of R&D from the pharmaceutical companies, they see it as well.","Now, back to ubrogepant, the cases are primarily diagnosed based on creatine phosphokinase release from skeletal muscle plus patient history discussions. When we are talking about the incidence of rhabdomyolysis in the ubrogepant studies, you've got to look at -- of course, at the totality of evidence.","And we do see cases of exercise-induced rhabdomyolysis in placebo standard of care cases, as well as in the ubrogepant arms, case rates differing in arms between studies. But across the whole ubrogepant database, the rates were 0.2% in placebo standard of care treated individuals and 0.2% in ubrogepant treated individuals.","Umer Raffat","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ronny Gal from Bernstein. Your line is open.","Ronny Gal","Good morning. I'm going to skip here the discussion about the company breakup, given I think we exhausted that. So, I have got two for Bill. Bill, CoolSculpting, I understand the argument you are making around what we are going to push the product. I guess, the question is, is this part of delivering the expected results from patients who are already using it. And I was wondering if you might have some data about attrition rate, and especially in comparison to attrition rates on fillers or on Botox. That is, are we seeing the same kind of repeat use rate from even the early adopters of CoolSculpting as we see from the more established products where benefit is established.","And second, back to the General Medicine business, it seems that the pricing you are obtaining and just looking year-over-year for the Eye Care product, for the IBD products, are a little bit lower than they were in 1Q 2018. And just talking to the peers, it seems like it's more of an effort to go ahead and press down some of those older category for discount. So, when we think about kind of like the pricing you obtain from those areas of older products going forward, should we assume kind of the small negative number in terms of pricing over the year or should we still expect [indiscernible] to slightly up?","Brent Saunders","Okay, thanks. Ronny. As it relates to CoolSculpting, I think consumer satisfaction with the procedure is high. A couple of points about that. If you take a look at RealSelf and you look at the Worth It rating for CoolSculpting, it's roughly 78%. Now that trades a little bit lower than a facial injectable, but that is not surprising for a body contouring procedure.","Satisfaction levels will trade lower if a patient does not receive an adequate number of treatment cycles. Right now, that number is at roughly five. Ideally, if you talk to most plastic surgeons, it should be six to eight. And so, with adequate treatments in a given area of the body, the satisfaction for CoolSculpting is right where it has been and where we expect it to be.","As it relates to repeat visits, there isn't a reoccurring revenue stream. In other words, once someone receives their six to eight cycles for a given problem area, then it's, in many respects, a permanent solution. And so, I think that deals with the CoolSculpting question.","I would also say that when you take a look CoolTone and the next generation CoolSculpting system, as well as the skin tightening solution, each one of those should enable plastic surgeons and derms and other product providers to improve outcomes for patients.","As it relates to the General Medicine business, I think you have it right, I think about price, whether it be for Linzess or for Restasis or for our US glaucoma business, as being neutral and there could be some downward pressure on it. I think that is the reality of the healthcare system right now.","I think the positive in all this for us is that prescription demand for these businesses - obviously, Linzess is very solid and the product is on the market for seven years now and prescriptions were up 10% and units were up 14%. As it relates to the more established businesses like Restasis or glaucoma, demand is relatively stable. And so, you will see a little bit more price pressure read through to the sales line on those businesses. But I think your outlook is right.","Manisha Narasimhan","In the interest of time, we will take two more questions, please.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from David Maris from Wells Fargo.","David Maris","Good morning. If you could just remind us where you are on the marketing push that you had mentioned in the Aesthetics Day that you are going to put, I think, it was $150 million in DTC. Are we in the early stages of that or is it front-end loaded this year? And any sort of either engagement metrics or patient acquisition cost metrics, even trend-wise that you are seeing and early feedback, that would be great.","Brent Saunders","Yes, I would say, the program that we described at Medical Aesthetics Day is up and running. I think we are starting to see very, very solid results. In fact, the Botox Cosmetic growth rate in the first quarter of 17%, while part of that was due to a one-time promotional offer, the underlying demand for the product in the quarter was in the double-digits.","I mentioned in my remarks, Brilliant Distinctions is a real asset for us. I would describe it as a note around Botox. We added 250,000 members in one quarter, which is the best quarter we have had in the history of the program.","The digital ventures spotlight, which is an online destination for all things beauty, we had 1.5 million visitors to it in the first year. That number will approach 2 million very, very shortly. We are running a Mother's Day promotion, which I mentioned, and there was a sign-up opportunity for a sweepstakes.","I won't get into the details, but we had roughly 50,000 women sign up in roughly a week. And so, I think all of the digital and consumer advertising work that we are doing is attracting new consumers into practices for plastic surgeons and dermatologists, which is ultimately what our aim is.","Manisha Narasimhan","Jacqueline, next question, please.","Operator","Your last question will be from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Vamil Divan","Great. Thanks for getting me in and taking my questions. So, maybe I will sneak in two, if I'm last. So , just one on your guidance, you beat your guidance for the quarter pretty handily on performance net income per share. Your guidance for next quarters, second quarter is higher than where consensus is.","But your full-year actually went up by a little less than what you beat by. So, I'm just trying, get a sense, is there anything you are seeing in the models as it relates to the second half of the year, that maybe needs to come down or something or is this maybe just a little bit of conservatism as you think about the back half of the year?","And then, the second one, maybe just a cleanup, I think for a long time that is been talked about, Botox Therapeutic opportunities in depression, afib and others. I'm not really seeing that in your slides anymore. I'm just wondering if there is any work that is still going on for other therapeutic opportunities. Thanks.","Brent Saunders","Matt, you want to take the first part of the question on guidance?","Matt Walsh","Yes, sure. So, you actually answered the question, Vamil, when you said it's really related to timing. It's a little bit early in the year to be calling up of the full-year. Right now, to this point, the business is progressing well. It's progressing according to our expectations, but it's just a little bit soon to be calling it up and we will revisit this shortly when we issue second quarter results.","Brent Saunders","David, you want to touch on Botox Therapeutic development?","David Nicholson","Yes. Thanks, Brent. Happy to do that. Yes, thanks for the question. And, of course, we are continuing to develop multiple opportunities for Botox and our related toxins. Bill, in his comments, mentioned the fact that we have multiple toxins in development.","We are looking at different ones for different opportunities regarding specifically therapeutic uses. Yes, we are planning to continue the development of a toxin in depression and we are also in Phase II trial with a toxin in atrial fibrillation following open-heart surgery. So, yes, those trials continue, the development continues.","Brent Saunders","Well thank you. This concludes our call. I would like to just end by thanking our colleagues around the world for delivering a solid quarter and staying focused on our customers and patients and making sure that we deliver on our commitments. We look forward to keeping you updated. And we will be in touch soon. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I would like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Jim Hindman, Senior Vice President, Treasury, Risk and Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","James M. Hindman","Thanks, Christie. Good morning.

You can address this information on our website at www.allergan.com.","At this point, I would like to turn the call over to David Pyott.","David E. I. Pyott","Great. Thanks, Jim. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Performance this year is in line with our long-term growth aspirations of delivering sales growth around the 10% mark in local currencies and earnings per share growth in the mid-teens.","In the second quarter, sales increased over Q2 of 2012 by 10.9% in local currencies and by 10.6% in U.S. dollars, with year-to-date year-over-year growth at a similar rate of 10.0% in local currencies and 9.5% in U.S. dollars.","Regarding operating performance, we generated non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.22, an increase of 16% over Q2 of 2012 and well above the outlook provided in the last call of $1.18 to $1.20, thanks to robust sales.","Year-to-date, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increased 17% over 2012 after we continued to strongly invest into R&D, the long-term driver of business success in our industry. On a non-GAAP basis, we have this year increased R&D investment by 15%, with R&D standing at over 17% of sales. For a reconciliation of these numbers to GAAP, kindly consult our press release.","Regarding progress with our pipeline, we are pleased that we're on the way to delivering most of our regulatory milestones for the year. We're able to file OZURDEX for diabetic macular edema a few months earlier than planned, both in the U.S., as well as in Europe.","Regarding LEVADEX, subsequent to a meeting with FDA in mid-June, we received input regarding stability metrics for our optimized manufacturing process in our newly-acquired facility. We have full agreement with the FDA on all these requirements and expect to submit stability data by year end, which should lead to an approval in Q2 of 2014.","Regarding DARPin, Allergan started in Q2 the third stage of the Phase II clinical trial, studying the safety and efficacy of the anti-VEGF DARPin in age-related macular degeneration. In this trial, patients are randomized to 1 of 2 doses of the anti-VEGF DARPin, or ranibizumab, i.e. LUCENTIS.","All patients received 3 loading doses of their assigned treatments at weeks 0, 4 and 8. Patients in the ranibizumab group will then receive additional ranibizumab injections at weeks 12 and 16, with the final study visit at week 20. Patients receiving the 2 anti-VEGF DARPin groups will receive sham injections at weeks 12 and 16, with the final study visit at week 20.","This study employs the conventional use of 3 loading doses to eliminate existing retinal fluid and then assesses the duration of this treatment effect. This study design will help finalize the treatment regimen for Phase III. In addition to studying dose, duration and efficacy, this trial will also assess safety, including the potential effects of improvements in the manufacturing process on ocular inflammation as we saw some limited ocular inflammation in the second stage, although substantially less than with the original manufacturing process. Results from this trial may be used to guide additional changes in manufacturing that are planned prior to Phase III studies and commercialization.","Regarding bimatoprost for scalp, we plan to start enrolling patients this quarter, the first of the 2 additional planned Phase II studies. The details are now posted on clinicaltrials.gov.","Commencing with ophthalmic pharmaceuticals, Q2 worldwide sales growth recovered to 8.0% in local currencies, closer to the long-term trend line as worldwide sales of the LUMIGAN franchise came back to 5.1% growth over Q2 of 2012. This was mainly due to return to ex-factory sales growth in the U.S. for LUMIGAN. In the U.S., we have now virtually completed the transition of prescriptions to the newer and improved LUMIGAN 0.01% formulation.","During the process of discontinuation of LUMIGAN 0.03% formulation in the last 6 to 9 months, overall inventories of LUMIGAN, both at wholesale and more importantly at retail, were reduced. This trade in inventory reduction is now behind us.","Year-to-date, in terms of withdrawals from wholesale, IMS reports an acquisition dollars sales increase of 7.6%, caused by an increase in price of 12%, offset somewhat by increasing rebates to secure formulary positions.","As a marker of volume performance, trailing prescriptions of LUMIGAN are down 3% in the glaucoma market, impacted by generic latanoprost. Regarding future performance, we are encouraged that we have recently published data on the benefits of lowered intraocular pressure when patients are switched from generic latanoprost to LUMIGAN 0.01%.","A key driver of growth in ophthalmic pharmaceuticals was also RESTASIS, where sales increased 10.5% in local currencies, with strong growth in the U.S. and even stronger growth in the small base in overseas markets, such as Turkey and Korea.","In the U.S., we experienced strong volume growth, driven both by a large increase in the number of details delivered by our sales forces in both the ophthalmology and optometric channels, as well as by an increase in investment in DTC, including a new TV commercial, which has delivered measurable improvement in terms of recall of advertising and patient action.","Regarding the FDA's draft guidance on generic cyclosporine, we'll be submitting potent cautionary arguments regarding the scientific challenges of in vitro assays and patient safety. We'll further contemplate taking every appropriate legal and regulatory action. This being stated, we'll be conducting in our strategic planning process, as is the norm, various scenarios of outcomes and timelines for potential RESTASIS generics.","Regarding worldwide ophthalmic performance and referencing the IMS report for Q1, the last period for which data is available, IMS shows the ophthalmic pharmaceutical market growing by a robust 12%, boosted by retinal therapeutics increasing 30% year-over-year and Allergan growing at 10%, and the glaucoma category growing only 2% due to the impact of generics. Allergan in Q1 grew 8%, also thanks to a strong uptake of COMBIGAN.","Regarding the LUMIGAN franchise, it is of note that IMS reports 3% growth for the U.S., with international sales increasing 12%, also benefiting from GANFORT. As a point of difference to foreign markets, only the U.S. has a profit in scientific retail for the pharmacists to try and switch a branded prescription to a generic.","In Europe, the LUMIGAN franchise has been boosted by the launch of LUMIGAN unit dose in Germany, the U.K., the Netherlands and Scandinavia. In Europe, there is a submarket for BAK-free products, which we're now entering.","We also received, for GANFORT unit dose, a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency, which will lead to the first licenses and launches later in 2013. GANFORT was also approved in China, an important approval for that market, but it will take some time to establish formulary coverage.","The artificial tears category in Q1 per IMS grew 5%, with Allergan sales being flat. In Spain, due to austerity, the Spanish government de-reimbursed almost all artificial tears, which has led to the market being virtually halved in volume. As Allergan enjoyed an almost 50% share of that market, we have been impacted hard.","Allergan should improve with the introductions of OPTIVE and OPTIVE Plus unit dose in many additional markets around the world. This product is marketed in the U.S. as OPTIVE Advanced. In the U.S. year-to-date, Allergan tear sales have increased 11% and the category growing 9%.","OZURDEX growth continues on a steep trajectory, driven particularly by Europe and the United States. The product was recently launched in Russia, Turkey, Kuwait and Jordan.","Moving on to BOTOX. Sales in Q2 grew 11.8% in year-to-date, 13.5% year-over-year in local currencies, with double-digit year-to-date growth in both the therapeutic and aesthetic categories. Regarding the global market in Q1, the last period for which data is available, we estimate the growth was 15%, with Allergan increasing at 16%. Accordingly, BOTOX market share moved up slightly to 76%, with share gain in therapeutics as we build up with the newest indications for chronic migraine and bladder being offset by small share loss in aesthetics.","Since the last earnings call, we have received approvals for BOTOX for neurogenic overactive bladder in Singapore and Morocco; and for overactive bladder in Hungary, Poland, New Zealand, India, Oman and Chile. Importantly, we've also reached agreement on public reimbursement for BOTOX for neurogenic bladder in Australia.","In the U.S., the therapeutic business continues to grow strongly, driven by chronic migraine, the 2 bladder indications and upper limb spasticity. Regarding chronic migraine and reimbursement, we have high levels of coverage in terms of policy, with 92% of commercial lives covered and 100% of Medicare lives. As almost all physicians submit for reimbursement prior to injecting patients within a prior authorization process, it is significant that we have been able to drive down the numbers and percentage of claims being rejected to quite low levels, thus, securing access for most patients.","Regarding training, we're continuing to invest in deepening injector experience by local live programs and preceptorships in order to increase rates of adoption and productivity. In addition, we have created a dedicated practice management group to assist physicians with the organization of a BOTOX clinic and improve the patient flow.","Beyond working on increased physician capacity to handle patients, we've also stepped up our efforts to educate patients about the availability of BOTOX by launching the first branded television campaign for BOTOX for chronic migraine, which started at the end of June. Since that date, we have seen a major increase in a number of website visits and also page views of what we call Find A Headache Specialist. Since approval of neurogenic overactive bladder, we have trained over half of the universe of urologists and urogynecologists. User and patient satisfaction is high.","During 2013, we have almost doubled our sales in the neurology channel, albeit off a small base in 2012. Reimbursement for overactive bladder is still a barrier as we complete negotiations with insurance providers. As of June, we now have 82% coverage of Medicare lives and 42% of commercial lives, just a short 5 months post FDA approval, but [ph] now our rates for prior authorizations are falling steadily.","In the movement disorders area, we are both growing the market, as well as maintaining high market share. With Ipsen's recent announcement to restructure their U.S. operations, we will face less competitive pressure as less than 10 field personnel will be deployed in the key account structure.","In Europe, we are pleased that the market seems to be growing above mid-single digits, and that BOTOX is gaining share based on initial uptake of chronic migraine and in neurology and in addition, thanks to improved execution in movement disorders.","Turning to the aesthetic side of the BOTOX business. We enjoyed strong growth in Q2 in most of the principal markets of the world. Exceptions are Canada, where we are drawing down inventory in Q2 in the doctor's office after a combined promotion with JUV\u00c9DERM in Q1, strategically timed to be just ahead of the launches of Xeomin and Dysport; and also in Australia, where Galderma is heavily price discounting Azzalure, the cosmetic brand of Dysport.","We're enjoying very strong in-market growth in Russia, Japan, China and most countries in East and South Asia. In the U.S., based on survey data, it seems that the market in the first half of the year grew high-single digits, and that BOTOX, at 81% market share in April, enjoyed the same share as in April 2012.","Xeomin share has stagnated at 5% for several months now, with the significant part of the share stemming from free goods and samples. In Western Europe, we believe that the market is growing mid-single digits, and that we have now been able to contain our market share loss to Azzalure and Bocouture.","Facial aesthetic sales in Q2 increased 9.4% in local currencies year-over-year after the torrid [ph] Q1 year-over-year growth of 33% in local currencies, thus, producing a more normalized growth rate of 19.5% year-to-date. As we advised in the last call, Q1 was boosted in the U.S. by a buy-in against a price increase and due to the timing of promotional activity in the U.S. and Canada. Hence, Q2 sales growth in the U.S. and Canada was modest. Market conditions in the U.S. remain healthy as the market seems to be expanding around 10% year-to-date in volume.","We're very pleased that JUV\u00c9DERM per survey data enjoyed record market share with almost 40%, making some gains against Restylane. The growth in the market is particularly encouraging as demand from patients has not yet been further stimulated by the introduction of VOLUMA, which, after the positive recommendation from the FDA panel, we expect to launch before year end.","Outside the U.S., JUV\u00c9DERM sales grew strongly in Q2, with major increases being recorded across the Europe, Africa, Middle East region and in Asia and all of those countries where the Vycross collection has been introduced, that is VOLUMA; then followed by VOLBELLA for lips; and VOLIFT for nasolabial folds, a product with superior malleability. The new products create growth on top of continuing growth for base JUV\u00c9DERM.","In the European Union, the market is continuing to grow in the mid-teens despite general consumer spending restrictions as patients respond to the advantages of the newest generation of products in terms of performance, durability and comfort.","The market has also responded to the Vycross collection in the same manner in Brazil, Argentina and Chile. VOLBELLA was launched in Q2 in Canada, Greece, Bulgaria and the Ukraine, utilizing training experts from Western Europe.","Performance in the breast aesthetics business improved in Q2 for 2 reasons: firstly, as we begin to anniversary the surge in demand we experienced in early 2012 in the aftermath of the PIP scandal and an ensuing need for replacement surgery; and secondarily, due to the introduction in the U.S. of the shaped-anatomical 410 Natrelle impact. Sales in Q2 increased 5.7% to local currencies but are still down 1.3% year-over-year due to the unusually high Q1 in 2012 for the reasons aforementioned.","In Europe, our survey data for Q1 shows that the market declined 19% year-over-year. As a better measure of long-term trends, it is noteworthy that the European markets in units in Q1 of 2012 was only 3% smaller in units than Q1 of 2011 despite the poor economic conditions and any negative perceptions of breast augmentation surgery due to the scandal. Over this time, Allergan, as the quality and price leader and, by far, the #1 player, has gained considerable market share.","In the U.S., sales in value increased strongly due to the introduction of the premium-priced 410 implant and due to further mix shift from low-priced saline to higher-priced gel implants. In terms of volume, we believe that the market in units is marginally declining at 2% to 3%.","In units, we're also impacted by the launch of the Sientra products, which had virtually no base in the prior year. As a strategy, we have not engaged in the price discounting practiced by Mentor to defend their position against Sientra, but have preferred to lose a few points of unit share.","Year-to-date, we have enjoyed major growth in the emerging markets, principally Russia, China, Brazil and Argentina. Our skin care and other franchise grew 38.6% in local currencies, boosted by the acquisition of SkinMedica, offset by the disappearing sales of SANCTURA XR, post the launch of generics, and very strong growth of the medical dermatology business, which grew about 35%.","In the topical acne market growing about 2% in prescriptions, ACZONE is rapidly gaining share, with more and more physicians adopting the product, with IMS reporting an increase in Q2 acquisition dollar sales of 52% versus prior year. In order to further stimulate growth, we commenced TV, as well as print advertising, targeted to the adult female patient in June.","Regarding TAZORAC acquisition dollars, again, as reported by IMS, Q2 growth is 21% versus prior year, with TAZORAC being the only growing branded single retinoid agent.","LATISSE sales increased 6.1% in Q2 and 6.8% year-to-date in local currencies versus prior year. 2013 sales in Canada and Brazil benefited from our promotional investments. In the U.S., LATISSE has benefited from the larger sales force deployed after the integration of LATISSE into an expanded SkinMedica sales organization. The SkinMedica product range is benefiting from some new product innovations, as well as becoming part of the overall Allergan product offering.","I'll now pass it over to Jeff Edwards, who will comment on our financial performance.","Jeffrey L. Edwards","Thanks, David, and good morning to all of you on the call. Allergan's high-quality second quarter performance was a reflection of our ability to generate consistently strong sales investments and earnings performance.","During the quarter, we were able to overachieve both sales and EPS expectations, while we continue to support our objective of making meaningful investments into the present and future growth drivers of the business across both the commercial portfolio and our research and development pipeline. The depth and breadth of our product portfolio and significance of both our therapeutic area and geographic footprints provide the company with the flexibility and latitude needed to balance performance and investment decisions.","Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the second quarter were $1.22, with the growth of 16% compared to the second quarter of 2012 from continuing operations. A reconciliation of all of the adjustments to GAAP earnings is set out in our earnings release.","Excluding the effect of non-GAAP adjustments, amortization of acquired intangibles and discontinued operations, Allergan's Q2 2013 gross margin of 87.4% increased 110 basis points when compared to Q2 of the prior year, driven primarily by improved standard costs and the continuation of favorable pricing, region and product line mix, as well as positive royalty dynamics, led by substantially reduced SANCTURA royalties and further offset in other revenue by good performance from both of our partners in Japan, Senju on ALPHAGAN and LUMIGAN and GSK on BOTOX Therapeutics.","The non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses to product net sales ratio from continuing operations for the second quarter was 38.4%, totaling $606 million. The comparable ratio and expense value for the same period in 2012 were 38.6% and $551 million, respectively. We continue to believe that Allergan's non-GAAP SG&A expense to product net sales ratio will be further leveraged in the second half of this year.","Non-GAAP research and development expenses were 16.9% of product net sales for the quarter, totaling $266 million, an increase in spend of approximately $38 million over the $228 million, or 16% of product net sales spent in the second quarter of 2012.","With respect to our balance sheet, consolidated Allergan days sales outstanding was 53 days, while consolidated Allergan inventory days on hand was 126 days. In the second quarter, operating cash flow after CapEx was approximately $442 million. At the end of the second quarter, Allergan's cash and equivalents and short-term investments and cash and equivalents and short-term investments net of debt positions, totaled to $2.7 billion and $513 million, respectively.","As a reminder, we issued approximately $600 million of new long-term debt at an effective weighted average rate of approximately 2.23% in the second quarter of 2013 to help offset the use of cash and equivalents for the recent acquisitions of SkinMedica and MAP pharmaceuticals.","With respect to our performance aspirations for the third quarter of 2013, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $1,500,000,000 to $1,575,000,000 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $1.18 to $1.20, including the dilutive impact of the MAP acquisition.","Regarding full year expectations for 2013, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $6,050,000,000 to $6,200,000,000 and our full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.72 to $4.76, which excludes the impact of the 2012 R&D tax credit reported in Q1 2013 as non-GAAP adjustment and includes the $0.07 estimated dilution impact related to the MAP Pharmaceuticals acquisition.","With respect to the divestiture of the obesity intervention business, we continue to make progress toward separating this business from Allergan. We have received several purchase offers for the business unit, progressing with additional diligence processes that may lead to other offers. If we are not fully satisfied with the value and related terms of these offers following further negotiations, we would consider other options such as of the sale of specific assets or a wind down of the business.","For your information, expectations for other lines of the income statement and specific product sales expectations are included in the current release.","So with that, operator, I'd now like to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Maybe the first -- my question is on RESTASIS and maybe the generic guidance. Maybe if you can talk little bit about when we'll see your response to the FDA draft guidance and maybe if you could give us a little bit of color as to why you believe the in vitro pathway is inappropriate.","David E. I. Pyott","Okay. I'll take that one, Larry. Thanks for the question. I think it's obvious to all that we have put to work the best minds in terms of internal resources from clinical, regulatory, legal. And we've also hired some of the best external experts with experience in these matters. I think you'll appreciate that we are working through all of our strategies, all of our arguments, and that these will become public right around the deadline, which is due, which is, of course, I think everybody knows, August 19. So I think that will be the next time where you can really take a very close look at the approach we are embarking upon.","Operator","Our next question is from Annabel Samimy with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Annabel Samimy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just curious, given some of the recent developments with the pipeline and potential lowering of the generic hurdles for RESTASIS, can you tell us how in the near and medium term you're prioritizing some of the various options to drive shareholder value, whether it's BD, M&A or use of capital for share buyback or dividends? And also, with regard to M&A, historically, you've done some smaller strategic acquisitions, given the recent activity. Do you have any compulsion to go -- to start thinking bigger?","David E. I. Pyott","Right, that one sounds like for me again. So I think, really, top of the heap there is delivering very solid operating performance. And many occasions, I've talked about our midterm growth aspirations being around about 10% sales growth in local currencies and then around mid-teens in terms of our earnings per share. So I think when you reflect upon what we've done in Q2, you think about the outlook for the rest of the year, I think we're well on our way to delivering that. I think also, it's very important to remember the huge number of approvals that we've received since 2010, and we still have several more to come this year, beginning of next year. So then moving on to the subject of M&A. We constantly look for external assets, whether there be technology assets to add to our pipeline. Also, as a quick reminder, I have explained on several occasions that in the coming 5 or so years, there will be a major step-up in R&D from roughly $1 billion-plus this year to roughly $1.5 billion some 5 years from now. So you can see we have resources available to bring in more technology. And of course, in addition, we're always looking at companies for marketed products. So despite, I think, many observers believing that something materially has changed, really not that much has changed. We're going about our business to deliver strong results. And then afterwards, it's up to those who are investing capital to decide whether Allergan, at this current price, is a good investment. I can only show you the numbers. The investment community clearly has to come to their own investment choices and trade-offs.","Operator","Our next question is from Greg Gilbert, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Gregory B. Gilbert - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes, my question is for Scott, since we only have one, I'll ask it this way. I was hoping, Scott, you could summarize what you know DARPin now and what you need to see from here and when you might see it in order to recommend to David and the board that going into Phase III is the right thing to do.","Scott M. Whitcup","So thanks, Greg. David outlined the study design for the third stage of our Phase II. Clearly, our goal is to have a product that gives patients benefits and physicians benefits compared to the already approved and commercialized anti-VEGF treatments. In that second stage, we were looking at doses that were giving anti-VEGF blocking effect of about tenfold greater than what's out there. Some of the comments were that we should have gone to loading dose and fixed dose right off the bat. But because we're giving substantially more drug than previous trials, ethically and investigative feedback suggested that we needed to look at the effects of the single injection. We did that in Stage II. And of course, you can't learn everything you want to in a given trial. We felt comfortable based on those data that we could go to the study design that's more conventionally used, where you give 3 loading doses of the drug to get rid of most of the VEGF in the eye and then see what the actual duration is with a fixed dosing schedule. So we will get that from our third stage. I think those data will give us good information to the dose, duration and guide us on our Phase III study design. We also noted in David's comments that we saw some inflammation in the initial studies. As is common with biologics, we're continuing to improve the manufacturing. We saw a decrease in the inflammation in the second stage from the initial material, but we have additional manufacturing improvements that are planned. And so looking to see in this next Stage III how much inflammation there is, if any significant inflammation, will also guide us on what we need to do before Phase III. So in sum, we believe that a lot of the data from this next Stage III will be critical to determining final study design and what, if any, additional manufacturing changes need to be made prior to Phase III. And as we've also stated, these retinal programs are very expensive. So we want to be sure when we go into Phase III that we've worked out all the science and that we have a very good chance of getting a commercially successful product at the end of that. So hopefully, that helps.","Operator","Our next question is from Marc Goodman with UBS.","Marc Goodman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","David, if you could just come back to the question about strategy and M&A. I guess, let me just ask it maybe a different way. I mean, DARPin is clearly going to be a great product, but it's delayed and it's not going to come out in the next, let's say, 4 years. And if RESTASIS does, in fact, go generic during the next, let's say, 2, 3 years, whatever it is, during this 4-year period, what in the pipeline is going to be critical enough in addition to maybe the base business that's just going to grow longer than we think and better than we think in order for you to reach your goals of roughly 10% and 15% top and bottom line?","David E. I. Pyott","That's why when I answered the earlier question, I think most importantly is to think through of the carrying power of growth in our markets, our ability to grow or sometimes where we have very high share, like BOTOX, defend on market position. And as I've often shared with many of you, I think some people maybe underestimate the carrying power of the business, of the recent approvals. On top of that, of course, we still have some to come. I think VOLUMA is a very important one. When you reflect upon all the data points I've given you on this call and prior ones, this is a very unique product that leads to major market expansion. Obviously, we realized with OZURDEX that we were going into the 2 smallest of the retina segments first, that's because the trials were easier to execute. And we all know the famous foot in the door is better than -- in a small segment, than waiting for the big segment that just takes double the time. That moment is coming with the hope for approval of OZURDEX for diabetic macular edema in the U.S. and Europe, which won't be so far apart. And then based on those 2 regional approvals, of course, we would expect the normal roll-through to all the other principal markets of the world. So one other thing I need to come back around is to say, -- reiterate what I said about RESTASIS in my prepared remarks, which is, clearly, there are various scenarios. Obviously, our plan is to win in this argument. However, we will clearly work on scenarios of downside. And then, of course, as you somewhat hinted in your comment, one can also -- on a downside case, also start opening up various sub-scenarios of what the timing of the entry of a generic might be. So as is the norm for us, that's just part of our strategic planning process. And when you look at scenario A, maybe that's the best one, easiest. And then you look at B and C, and under those scenarios, you then ask yourself, \"What else would be do to readjust our business plan so we can continue to deliver numbers?\" Obviously, the other ones that are out there still, LEVADEX, the short delay really doesn't have an effect of any materiality in 2014, a bit more in 2015 but not large. And then, of course, we also have Vicept coming along for rosacea. And I think when you reflect upon my comments, you'll also probably realize that the incremental investments we've made in DTC for RESTASIS, for BOTOX, for chronic migraine and ACZONE will all drive further growth. One other one I should probably mention would be Serenity or SER-120 for nocturia. So there are plenty of things out there. And obviously, as part of our overall franchise building in facial aesthetics beyond the filler side, we're also continuing to make sure BOTOX gets appropriate use, once trained and was approved, for other areas of the face, such as crow's feet lines, which should be approved both in U.S. and Europe shortly. So lots of good things going on. And I would like to humbly submit relative to most companies of our size really a lot of different growth vectors that we can play with to deliver the results that we are aspiring to.","Operator","Our next question is from Liav Abraham from Citi.","Liav Abraham - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","My question is for Scott. I'd be interested in your thoughts on the competitive dynamics in the dry eye market even if we don't see a generic RESTASIS in the near to medium term. I understand that the hurdles for the approval of a novel dry eye products are high, but there are a few products in development that seem very interesting and are either in or approaching late-stage development. And I'd be interested on your thoughts on these and how you view the potential for incremental branded competition in the market for 2016.","Scott M. Whitcup","Sure, I'm happy to do that. I'd say, firstly, that dry eyes is one of the most common conditions in that market, and patient demand will continue to grow. I think that's, in large part, what's driven the growth of RESTASIS. We've always expected that down the line, RESTASIS won't remain the only prescription dry eye product. So we looked that there may be things like Shire's acquisition of a dry eye candidate and some others in the Phase II stage that eventually, some of those may get approved. As you point out, the approval of any dry eye product is very difficult, mostly because of patient variability, so the hurdle rate remains high. And in addition to what's on the outside, we, as well, are looking internally at some additional pipeline candidates. So probably within the next year, you'll hear about a couple of new entries for us in dry eye, as well as we've been working on the so-called RESTASIS accent. We've publicly stated that, that should enter the clinic next year. So in terms of the RX side, yes, there's a competitive market. The hurdle remains high. We will also have some candidates. And there's room for more than one product. Again, the market is so large and the patient demand so high that we expect the market to continue to grow despite competition. The second piece of that is the tears market. Because dry eye is such an important category, the tears market continues to do well. And we spend a fair bit of R&D dollars on continuing to innovate in the tears market as well. David mentioned that we do have a number of approvals and launches, and we'll continue to be bringing new products out continuously over the next several years.","Operator","Our next question is from David Maris with BMO Capital Markets.","David W. Maris - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","David, having the top line and EPS aspiration goals, I think, are very good for investors. But if you didn't have to worry about those goals and earnings and growth targets and the public markets for the next few years, what would you do differently? Where would you invest differently? Would it be more in selling and promotion? Would it be -- what type of R&D areas would you go after? Would they be giant things, like stem cells and artificial vision? Or would it be more into the aesthetics? Trying to get an idea of -- again, not that you should do away with the aspirational goals, but what areas are most interesting thing for you if you didn't have those constraints?","David E. I. Pyott","Well, the way I'd answer that question is that I really don't believe in the very hypothetical situation that we're a private company, that there would be any material difference in our behavior. I'm a great believer in operating discipline and increased efficiencies. And in fact, if I start with R&D, when I talk with Scott Whitcup and his team, I sometimes say, \"Well, it's great that the R&D budget could be another $500 million per year roughly 5 years from now.\" But of course, with that comes great challenges in terms of how do we maintain our clarity of thinking, how do we maintain our agility and maintain our ability to continue to bring things through the pipeline? I think on the sales and marketing side, you've heard for a long time, in our case, well over a decade, my belief that in the pharmaceutical and medical device industry, all of us need to get more efficient. And therefore, I'm quite pleased with the improvements we're making year in, year out, and we plan to continue along that road, all of which gives me a fair degree of confidence and, of course, predicting anything with absolute perfection 5 years out, wouldn't that be cool? I should be probably working on the buy side. That was a joke, by the way. I'm very happy where I am. But you'd appreciate what I'm saying. I think then, stepping back further, when you think about Allergan's portfolio, both of marketed assets, as well as pipeline, we remain an extremely diversified company. And diversification is a good thing when it comes to ability to handle, hopefully only small shocks [ph]. And so far, over the years, we've risen to all the different challenges that came our way. If I think back historically, a major worry of the investment community, say, 6, 7 years ago, was how will BOTOX fare in the face of competition, whether it was therapeutic or aesthetic. And I think if I'd, at that point, read the market share number that I just read 20 minutes ago, 76%, you'd have all thought that there are probably some drugs that will be very useful to my forms of delusion. But this is true. So we've come through that challenge very well. And we're really putting all our efforts beyond dealing against some of -- dealing with these other challenges, and focus and concentration of great minds of ability is a great thing.","Operator","Our next question is from David Buck with Buckingham Research Group.","David G. Buck - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Just a clarification first, I guess, if I heard the answers to the prior questions, David, there's not an incentive to necessarily speed up the funnel of M&A candidates. But getting on to the question, since you have had SkinMedica and also LEVADEX acquisitions in the past year and some buy-ins with the distributors, maybe for Jeff, can you talk a little bit about what the sales and earnings benefit and decrement for those might have been and what the expectation should be as we close out the year?","Jeffrey L. Edwards","Thanks, David. We don't break out the specifics related to those transactions. As you would imagine, given that they were both relatively modest in size, the contribution, certainly, with respect to SkinMedica first year have been modest. I think I can say without question that our commercial teams, R&D organizations, G&A organizations, have done a very good nice job of integrating those assets into the Allergan business. Likewise, with respect to MAP, focusing on the research and development organization and our manufacturing organization, getting their arms around all of the issues and loose ends that existed at the time we acquired those businesses has been done with great professionalism. We've made wonderful progress and organizing our thoughts so that they were consistent with the thoughts of the FDA, identifying timelines that were achievable at a high probability of success. So I think we're making great progress on both fronts. We're seeing an acceleration of performance with respect to SkinMedica year-over-year. And our expectations is that, that acceleration will continue into the second half of the year. On the BD front, we don't make specific comments about what we're doing and what we intend to do. I say the same thing internally. Every morning I wake up and I put my pants on the same way. And that will continue on a going-forward basis. We know it's important. It has always been important. Whether it was a year ago or this year, we look for opportunities with the focus on logic and discipline, making sure that they fit with our strategy and our business model, whether they be large or small, early stage, late stage or product. We understand, just like you do, the importance of that process. So we're marching on. We're very focused. We're not taking our eye off that one. I can say, \"Trust us.\" Well, that's hard to do, I understand. But we work forward, and we're not changing the way we're going about this. We understand the importance of being very, very focused and very, very diligent.","Operator","Our next question is from Ken Cacciatore with Cowen and Company.","Ken Cacciatore - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Just a clarifying question first. Is this new formulation or the new DARPin study, did you already make some tweaks to the manufacturing and, therefore, this new set of products that you're using has that tweak? Or are you going to wait and see what the results are? And then secondly, did the inflammation cause a high level of discontinuation, meaning, was the inflammation a separate issue? Or did it have some impact on the durability findings that you had?","Scott M. Whitcup","So thanks, Ken. We made changes in the manufacturing between the first study and the second stage. The second stage and the third stage will be the same manufacturing process. But there were already changes that we knew we were going to be making subsequent to that. In terms of the inflammation that we saw, I don't believe that it was a major cause of discontinuation and didn't really change our ability to assess the data. We didn't see actually that much inflammation that it impacted study results. But our goal is clearly to get this manufacturing as optimized as we can and to get inflammation rates as low as possible before we commercialize.","Operator","Our next question is from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","My question is related to the BOTOX pricing lawsuit against HHS. As I understand it, Allergan is requesting that HHS declare that it's not required to report ASP data for BOTOX Cosmetic. And if Allergan is successful, then you'd have more flexibility to raise the price of BOTOX Cosmetic and separate that from the medical side. I guess, my first question is, am I characterizing that right? And second, when will we get an answer, please?","David E. I. Pyott","Right. Well, the first part to what you said, I'd agree with you that we're requesting that we're no longer obligated to provide pricing data for Cosmetic. What we then choose to do after that, I'm not sure I would characterize it exactly the way you said it. But clearly, it gives us options that we don't currently have. I wish that I had the government on an exact timeline, but I think we'll be able to tell you a bit more by the beginning of next year.","Operator","Our next question is from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","David, just to get a follow-up. Obviously, FDA is very difficult to predict, and I think we were all surprised to see the new RESTASIS guidance and appreciate that you're putting up a good fight. But in your contingency plans, I would imagine that there will be a lot of room to restructure, given how high your SG&A ratio is. Can you talk about how variable your costs are and how realistic it would be to bring down those costs and, at the same time, continue to reach your ambitions of 10% top line growth? And then, just secondly, can you remind us what sales are of RESTASIS outside the U.S.?","David E. I. Pyott","Okay. Well, first of all, I think you'll get a much closer look at what our arguments are, you will decide how potent or not that you find them. I think then moving to the other side of the ledger where we're planning for success, but we also have to plan for intrusion. You're quite right that we've had very high SG&A ratios relative to the rest of the industry. And of course, if you think of the ratio I mentioned for R&D as well, 17% of sales, that's on the high end as well. So the good news is that we have a lot more room for maneuver than most companies, and that will be helpful as we start doing that form of scenario planning. I think then we've never broken out the non-U.S. portion of RESTASIS, but you should just consider them as being modest.","Operator","Our next question is from Seamus Fernandez with Leerink.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","So David, just a question on the international opportunities for some of the existing products. You talked about some approvals, BOTOX migraine and overactive bladder in some other markets. We are seeing some gains in the U.S., with the U.S. sales kind of picking up. How much of that is sort of FX related in the short term? And then, longer term, how do you sort of see the international versus U.S. sales balance really shaking out? And again, obviously, considering -- I think we can consider a better case scenario for RESTASIS as you are at this point.","David E. I. Pyott","Well, obviously, I like your final comment. I hope that both you and I are right. Going back to BOTOX, clearly, in the short swing, the biggest opportunity for migraine and bladder is the U.S. And part of that is just because of what you hear from all companies is the delay effects elsewhere in the world. So even once you've got an approval in some country in the European Union, the time required to then get full access to patients across the European continent probably is about 2 to 2.5 years. And it depends on each country, whether you have to go through Nice, whether you -- France is probably -- well, Germany would be the best in terms of quick action. France, probably, it's a major market, comes on stream fairly quickly. And when you look to Southern Europe, basically, the Spanish government has been saving money by just not getting around to issuing answers on what is the reimbursement price. So we're pleased that we've cracked those codes in Spain and Italy. But the point I'm making is it's a long swing effect in many of those markets. Another one that I mentioned today, Australia, the so-called PBAC. This is the government reimbursement plan where we've now come to an agreement on how Australian patients will get access to chronic migraine. Another one would be Canada, which, of course, these days is a 2-speed market. There's not only a private -- a public market, there's also a considerable private market. That part, we've accessed. On the public side, we're still working through many of the provincial formularies. So net-net, what does that all mean? Assume that new BOTOX indications are just longer swing. They take time to come through, but they will come through.","Operator","Our next question is from Randall Stanicky.","Randall Stanicky - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Scott, maybe for you, what's the earlier we could see RESTASIS X hit market? And then if we did see a generic RESTASIS, is OTC an opportunity for you or are the hurdles too high there?","Scott M. Whitcup","So in terms of timing on RESTASIS X, when something's in Phase II, we don't give approval timelines. It will depend a lot on the data. In terms of OTC, I think the review division tends to be conservative. It would be a ways out before RESTASIS could, if ever, go OTC.","Operator","Our next question is from Andrew Finkelstein with Susquehanna Financial.","Andrew Finkelstein - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","So my question was on the expenses. As we think about the rest of the year and your guidance, it seems to imply that SG&A, in particular, on an absolute basis, comes down a bit in the second half. Can you talk at all about the timing of the investments you've made this year? It seems like the DTC was a big factor in 2Q. But as you're evaluating the return on those investments, how do you think about the potential to -- where you're putting your marketing dollars in the back half of the year, given the demands of your various businesses?","Jeffrey L. Edwards","The investments we make on an absolute basis in dollar terms typically continue to go up over the course of the year. However, on a ratio or percentage basis, because sales are higher, those ratios improve. So it's not like we're hitting the brakes on what we'll be investing behind in the promotional, selling and marketing categories, and that would include DTC. It's simply a function of how the ratios work. So all of the promotions, all of the investments we choose to make are pressure tested. Of course, each of the functions are asked to tell us what kind of return they expect to generate. And we do go back after the fact and discuss whether or not those returns were achieved or not. And of course, that data is used for subsequent decisions. Sometimes they work; sometimes they don't. More often than not, they do because of the way we approach the process. So with respect to DTC, we know that we get very nice results with respect to RESTASIS. We've seen nice results as it relates to our dermal filler platform. We're beginning to see nice results as it relates to BOTOX for chronic migraine. So in each case, those items are successful. David, anything else? ACZONE is something we've begun this year as well, and we're beginning to see nice results for that as well. So it's not as if we spread the peanut butter very, very thinly. We take a very focused approach. We focus on those areas that have seen good response in the past, and that's our expectation going forward. We'll do the same. We're considering things like OAB as well, but that will be in the future once the product is better established.","Operator","Our next question is from Douglas Tsao with Barclays.","Douglas D. Tsao - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Scott, perhaps you could provide some perspective on the positioning for OZURDEX in the DME market and do you see it taking share from other steroids being used? Or do you think that it has the opportunity to take share from laser phototherapy?","Scott M. Whitcup","So on the DME, as David said, we got OZURDEX approved for 2 of the smaller indications first, and we've always felt that the diabetic macular edema was probably one of the best markets for OZURDEX. We know that the anti-VEGF therapies work quite well. The problem is that, depending on the data you look at, somewhere between 30% up to 40% of patients are resistant to anti-VEGF treatment. We believe that represents a good opportunity for OZURDEX. I think it will take some share from laser and other corticosteroids. I think as there is an approved reimbursed product with a good efficacy and safety profile that can take those anti-VEGF resistant patients, it will establish a nice commercial opportunity for OZURDEX.","Operator","Our final question comes from Tim Lugo with William Blair.","Tim Lugo - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Perhaps I missed this, but can you update us on your primary care aspirations for BOTOX migraine? I know you spoke about this a couple of quarters ago. Is this still dependent on the LEVADEX approval?","David E. I. Pyott","Yes, absolutely. I think in our own minds, we've had the view that roughly 12, 15 months post LEVADEX availability on the market, we would go into a deployment at the very top end of PCP. Just to repeat what I've often said before, when you actually buy the SCRIP data, which obviously is anonymous from data sources, you can see a lot of these people who are not board-registered as neurologists sure look like neurologists when you look at what they're prescribing. So that gives us a very good guide to where there could be a productive cause [ph]. So in the short term, of course, the fact that we're delaying the deployment into that physician group is saving SG&A dollars. Obviously down the road, we will make that appropriate investment because we believe that's another driver of growth not only for LEVADEX, but also back into BOTOX for chronic migraine. And reiterating something I was really saying before, beyond the way I answered the question about x U.S. sales in BOTOX Therapeutics, remember, all of the BOTOX indications have very long cycle compared to most pharmaceuticals. And I think it's difficult for you to gauge that as analysts on the outside. But that's one of the reasons I talk about the long-term carrying power from all the approvals we had since 2010 and the ones that are still around the corner and is really our way to get through the next 5 years.","James M.

[Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Manisha Narasimhan. Ma'am, you may begin.","Manisha Narasimhan","Thank you, Kanesia, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to the Allergan fourth quarter and full-year 2018 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning we issued a press release reporting Allergan earnings for the quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.

With us on today's call are Brent Saunders, Chairman and CEO; Bill Meury, Chief Commercial Officer; David Nicholson, Chief R&D Officer; and Matt Walsh, Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available during the Q&A is Bob Bailey, our Chief Legal Officer.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Brent.","Brenton L. Saunders","Thank you, Manisha. Good morning and thank you, everyone for joining our fourth quarter and full-year 2018 earnings call.","There are three key themes I would like highlight on the call today. First, we delivered solid financial results in the fourth quarter finishing up a strong 2018, underscoring the strength of our core business. Second, our R&D pipeline is advancing and we expect many significant clinical and regulatory milestones in 2019. And third, based on the strength of our core business, the emerging pipeline and continued focus on strong execution we feel confident about our outlook in 2019.","Turning to Slide 5. 2018 was a year of steady strategic progress for Allergan and we achieved the financial and operational goals that we had set at the beginning of the year. I\u2019m very proud of our teams operational R&D and non-GAAP financial results in 2018.","In 2018, we made significant headway with our pipeline and delivered positive clinical results from six late-stage development programs across therapeutic areas. We made 10 major registrational submissions globally, including for VRAYLAR in bipolar depression, and we expect an FDA decision in May.","On the migraine front, we reported compelling data for both Ubrogepant and acute treatment and prevention of migraine and Atogepant for episodic migraine. Assuming these two oral CGRPs are approved, we will have one of the most comprehensive migraine portfolios in the industry.","We have made significant progress with our eye care pipeline and reported positive Phase 3 data for abicipar in wet AMD and with Bimatoprost SR in glaucoma and are on track to make regulatory submissions for both later this year. In the GI space, we've advanced three important late stage programs, Brazikumab and safety map and IL-23 antibody for inflammatory bowel disease, Relamorelin for diabetic gastroparesis, and CVC for NASH.","With 13 pharmaceutical and 10 device programs in late stage development, we're well positioned to launch one or two new products each year for the next several years. In 2018 despite the sales impact from products losing exclusivity or LOEs, we maintained healthy margins and invested in our core business for growth. And we took a disciplined approach to capital allocation, which was balanced across driving growth, strengthening our balance sheet and returning attractive levels of capital to our shareholders.","In 2018 our net performance -- our performance net income per share came in at $16.69 for the full-year, which is above the high-end of our most recently provided guidance range. We generated strong cash flows of $5.6 billion, improved our balance sheet and continued to return capital to shareholders. And we reduced our outstanding debt by over $6 billion and executed more than $2.7 billion in share repurchases in 2018 alone.","Our 2018 performance reinforces our commitment to successfully execute our strategy and create a global biopharma leader focused on four key therapeutic areas: medical aesthetics, CNS, eye care, and GI. Taken together, these accomplishments give me confidence in our ability to continue producing solid results in 2019 and beyond, while also delivering innovation that will have an enduring impact on patients, customers, and shareholders.","Turning to Slide 6. I will briefly review the key drivers of our 2018 performance. Our core business, which accounted for 87% of our total revenues in 2018 was $13.8 billion, growing 8.3% year-over-year at constant currency. This was driven by robust growth in many of our anchor brands such as BOTOX Cosmetic, BOTOX Therapeutic, JUV\u00c9DERM, VRAYLAR, Lo LOESTRIN and LINZESS.","Core business growth in 2018 was offset by declines in brand spacing LOEs. Divestitures of nonstrategic assets and in the later part of the year some shortfalls in international business associated with the recalls of OZURDEX and textured breast implants in certain international markets.","We believe we have resolved the OZURDEX issue and expect supply to be normalized in the second quarter. Overall, our core business continues to perform well and is poised for durable growth over the long-term.","Slide 7 provides a brief snapshot of key financial metrics for the quarter and for the full-year. You will hear more about this in the financial guidance for 2019 from Matt. Of note, our guidance does not take into consideration any impact from potential future divestitures.","Before I turn to our goals for 2019, I'd like to provide an update on the sale process that we've been conducting for Anti-Infectives and Women's Health. On Anti-Infectives we're in the final stages of this process and believe that it is that this business is more likely than not to be sold. While we do not yet have a completed transaction to announce at this time and there are always risk to completing a transaction, current facts and circumstances are indicating that a sale of Anti-Infectives is probable over the near-term.","For Women's Health, we've concluded that the highest value proposition for this business at this time is to continue managing it and optimizing it. As a result, we're winding down the advisor led process. We will continue to explore future opportunities to unlock value with Women's Health. Several flagship products in Women's Health were up 15% year-over-year, which is a true testament to the scale and expertise of our Woman's Health team and I'd like to recognize them for their strong contribution.","Looking ahead to 2019 and beyond, our strategy for long-term growth is clear. Outlined on Slide 8 is a snapshot of our four main businesses, which represent over 80% of our top line sales. We're committed to these areas and take a long-term view of each of these for three reasons. First, we have product line in depth and own a number one or number two position.","Second, we\u2019ve a clear line of sight to innovation and new product flow. And third, our regulatory development and commercial expertise are competitive advantages. Medical aesthetics in eye care are the largest and global, followed by CNS and GI, which have strong future growth potential.","The other key point here is that each of these businesses is supported by several mid to late stage pipeline products. In other words, each business has a bench of future growth catalyst in development. I expect that we will launch more new products than any other company in these four therapeutic areas.","And finally, we intend to accomplish these goals with disciplined and balanced capital deployment. These clear strategic priorities combined with our resolute focus on strong execution, operationally, commercially, and financially, give me confidence that we are well-positioned to create sustainable growth and shareholder value in 2019 and beyond.","Now let me turn the call over to Bill for more detail on product highlights.","William J. Meury","Thanks, Brent. Slide 10 is a product-level sales analysis for the fourth quarter ranked in terms of sales growth versus prior year. We had another solid quarter with double-digit sales growth for a number of our major products, BOTOX, VRAYLAR, JUV\u00c9DERM, and Lo LOESTRIN were standouts in the quarter.","Other key brands, including OZURDEX, ALLODERM and CoolSculpting, had lower growth rates for the quarter and the year which I will discuss shortly. The core business is in an excellent position as we start 2019.","At the bottom of the graph and as expected, total sales growth was impacted by products already facing loss of exclusivity as well as RESTASIS sales decline ahead of anticipated generic competition.","Slide 11 reflects full-year sales results for our top eight or flagship products. These products account for over 50% of the core business and most of their growth. Collectively, sales for these products increased by $1 billion -- approximately $1 billion in 2018 and six of the eight increased by 10% or more versus prior year. BOTOX was the biggest growth contributor and VRAYLAR was the fastest growing. The fundamentals for each one of these businesses are strong for 2019.","Now I will touch on our key therapeutic areas, starting with our largest one, Medical Aesthetics. Turning to Slide 12, for the full-year 2018 sales for Medical Aesthetics were up 13%. Sales for BOTOX Cosmetics, JUV\u00c9DERM and ALLODERM were very strong and up 14%, 12%, and 18%, respectively and drove the majority of our Aesthetics business growth.","Sales of ALLODERM were well above expectations, driven by more product utilization per surgery. Sales in the fourth quarter, however, were impacted by a constraint for donor material. We anticipate donor capacity to increase during the course of 2019 and that sales will continue to grow.","For the full-year 2018, sales for CoolSculpting globally were up 6.3% pro forma. Consumable sales, which represent 64% of the total were up 12% both in the United States and internationally for the year. System sales declined 2% due primarily to price in the United States.","Importantly, we added almost 1,200 systems in the United States, representing a 24% increase versus the prior year. In 2009 (sic) [2019], we estimate sales growth for CoolSculpting will be driven primarily by consumable demand off of a much larger installed systems base and overall greater contribution from our international business.","We estimate roughly 50% of 2019 CoolSculpting growth will come from international and 50% from the U.S. By way of comparison in 2018, international sales for CoolSculpting represented only about one-third of total growth.","We will also be launching a new body contouring system in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2019 called CoolTone. This is the first of three new systems that will create the most comprehensive body contouring solution in Aesthetics to address fat reduction, which is the foundation of treatment and muscle toning and skin tightening. Our CoolTone device is complementary and will be marketed alongside CoolSculpting.","In 2019, our primary focus for Medical Aesthetics is maintaining our market leadership and expanding the category. And we've taken the following steps to maximize sales: we've expanded our field forces for facial injectables and body contouring by 20% to drive better and broader customer coverage. We\u2019ve significantly increased the scale of our consumer and digital marketing programs, including new consumer campaigns for both BOTOX, which launched yesterday and JUV\u00c9DERM which launched in October.","We plan more injector in CoolSculpting training programs than we did in 2018 and finally we expect to launch a new customer service portal in the first quarter which will make doing business with Allergan even more efficient. The fundamentals and outlook for this business continued to be very strong in 2019 and beyond.","Turning to Slide 13 and CNS, our flagship products as you know are BOTOX and VRAYLAR. Sales for BOTOX were up 13% and were ahead of expectations. Growth is coming from all indications, migraine, spasticity and OAB and across all channels.","I want to take a moment to talk about the impact of new products on BOTOX, specifically in migraine. No different from the last quarter, we\u2019ve not experienced a visible impact on BOTOX demand from any of the approved CGRP monoclonal antibodies. The branded migraine prevention market had nearly doubled since the launch of Aimovig. And we've a 50% share of new patients with BOTOX.","As I\u2019ve talked about before, we expect BOTOX and CGRP antibodies to coexist in a much larger market. And we expect the growth rate in '19 will be at least in the mid-to high single digits. We estimate today that only 2% of Aimovig patients were switched from BOTOX, and it appears that combination use is also limited at this time. Finally medical benefit coverage for BOTOX in 2018 was broad and we expect the same in 2019. The underlying growth of this business is volume based.","Sales for VRAYLAR in '18 totaled $487 million, up 69%. This product continues to exceed expectation on every metric, including prescribers, prescription levels and formulary coverage rates. And our consumer campaign is producing exceptional returns. The growth catalyst for VRAYLAR in '19 is the anticipated new indication for bipolar depression, which is currently under review at the FDA. Over time, this is projected to be one of the most important products at Allergan.","Turning to Slide 14, on eye care and GI. In eye care, full-year revenues for our glaucoma business were stable on a year-over-year basis. OZURDEX sales declined 6% impacted by a product recall. We expect to fully resolve the supply situation in the second quarter. U.S sales were up 13% versus prior year. RESTASIS prescription ban was stable year-over-year. This was offset by lower average selling price and lower trade inventory levels.","Turning now to GI. Sales for our IBS line LINZESS and VIBERZI totaled $963 million. Underlying prescription demand for LINZESS in 2018 was very strong at 13% versus prior year. This was partially offset by lower average selling price, resulting in a net revenue gain of 9% versus 2017. The outlook for this business is positive with OTC conversion being the primary source of growth. We\u2019ve a strong following in both GI and primary care, very high consumer awareness and widespread formulary coverage. And we will continue to invest in LINZESS alongside our partner Ironwood to maximize sales and profitability.","Sales for ZENPEP in 2018 were up 12%, and growth is coming from increased utilization in the GI segment and from our highest dose, ZENPEP is expected to be a solid growth contributor again in '19.","Turning to Slide 15, our international sales were up 6% in 2018. The growth drivers were BOTOX Cosmetic, JUV\u00c9DERM, and CoolSculpting as well as BOTOX Therapeutic, which were partially offset by the recalls of OZURDEX and textured implants. Excluding these events, international sales grew 9% for the full-year. The Asia-Pacific\/Middle East\/Africa regions continue to be the most important growth drivers for us and the outlook for the international business is very strong.","And with that, let me turn call over to David.","C. David Nicholson","Thank you, Bill. 2018 was another important year for the R&D organization. As highlighted on Slide 17, we progressed our pipeline in all four of our key therapeutic areas. We have positive data readouts from several late stage programs. For Cariprazine, we've reported positive Phase 3 data and have a regulatory submission under review for the bipolar depression indication with an FDA action date in May. We\u2019ve also initiated additional clinical studies for Cariprazine as an adjunctive treatment in major depressive disorder.","For ubrogepant, our oral CGRP inhibitor, the acute treatment of migraine, we reported positive data from two Phase 3 efficacy and safety studies, a long-term safety study and also safety study in healthy volunteers. We expect the regulatory filing in -- with the FDA very soon.","For atogepant, our oral CGRP inhibitor for the prevention of episodic migraine, we reported positive data from a Phase 2\/3 study and have a Phase 3 study in episodic migraine as well as the requisite long-term safety study ongoing. We will initiate Phase 3 studies in chronic migraine in the first half of the year. For the Bimatoprost SR, we have reported data from two positive Phase 3 studies and I will be providing some additional details on this program later in the call.","For abicipar, we reported and presented data from two positive Phase 3 studies and expect report data from the ongoing MAPLE study in the first half of this year. This study evaluates a optimized formulation. For Brimonidine DDS in geographic atrophy, we reported and presented positive Phase 2 data in 2018, and expect to initiate Phase 3 studies in the second half of the year.","Our Rapastinel Phase 3 program for major depressive disorder is ongoing. And we expect to report in the first half of the year top line data from three studies of Rapastinel in the adjunctive setting as well as data from a relapse prevention study.","Separate Phase 3 studies of Rapastinel as monotherapy in major depressive disorder are either underway or about to commence. We also have a Phase 2 study of Rapastinel for suicidality in major depressive disorder ongoing. AGN-241751, our oral NMDA modulator is in Phase 2 clinical development for MDD. This agent received fast-track designation from the FDA.","Turning to Slide 18 and Bimatoprost SR. Here we've reported data from two positive Phase 3 studies. Bimatoprost SR is a first-in-class, biodegradable, intracameral implant providing slow release of Bimatoprost, a differentiated approach to treat glaucoma beyond daily eye drop treatments. While drops are effective, compliance remains a big challenge and results in sub optimal outcomes for patients.","Our U.S Phase 3 program comprised of two identical studies, each enrolling over 500 patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. They were randomized to receive either Bimatoprost SR or Timolol. Over the 12-week primary efficacy period, Bimatoprost SR reduced intraocular pressure by approximately 30%, easily meeting the predefined criteria for noninferiority to the study comparator, Timolol, in both studies.","Importantly, both the studies demonstrate the potential for the majority of patients to remain treatment free for at least one year after their last of three implants was inserted at four months intervals. In both studies, Bimatoprost SR was well-tolerated by the majority of the patients. Based on these positive data, we plan to make a regulatory submission with the FDA in the second half of 2019.","Turning now to Slide 19. As we heard from Brent, 2019 is shaping up to be another critical year for pipeline progress and data readouts. Summarized here are some of the key events we anticipate this year and beyond. We plan to make significant advances in late stage programs across all four of our key therapeutic areas. In addition to the important developments in the pharmaceutical pipeline, we are also making significant progress with innovation in Medical Aesthetics, including the anticipated launch of CoolTone in the fourth quarter of 2019.","Before I turn the call over to Matt, I would like to take a minute to highlight both our pharmaceutical as well as the device pipeline. Turning to Slide 20, our pharmaceutical pipeline has over 45 programs in various stages of development with 13 programs in Phase 3, including innovative earlier stage programs in the areas of Medical Aesthetics, genetically validated targets, gene editing, optogenetics and the microbiome. Whilst all of these programs may be successful, we have depth across all our therapeutic areas.","Turning to Slide 21. On the device side, we have 30 programs in development. The majority of these programs enhance our Medical Aesthetics portfolio and include a new line of facial fillers. As always, I thank my colleagues in R&D for their hard work as well as the physicians and especially the patients who participate in our clinical trials.","With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Matt.","Matthew M. Walsh","Thank you, David. Turning now to the key financial highlights on Page 23. Fourth quarter results exceeded the high-end of guidance that we provided last quarter both for revenue and non-GAAP performance net income per share.","Net revenues for the fourth quarter were $4.08 billion, 5.7% decline compared to the prior year period. In addition to the impact from LOEs and divesting the medical dermatology business, fourth quarter results also faced a challenging comparison to the prior year period, which happened to be very strong quarter.","Net revenues for the full-year were $15.8 billion, a narrower 1.1% decline versus prior year. Foreign currency translation created a 1.3 percentage point growth headwind for Q4, but had a de minimis impact on fiscal year revenues. In the fourth quarter, the core business grew 3% year-on-year on a reported basis and 4.5% at constant currency.","We saw three near-term headwinds which impacted results in total, although none were significant individually. First the OZURDEX recall, which occurred in Q3 and carried into Q4. And second, the recall of textured implants in certain international markets, and third the negative impact from foreign exchange translation.","Normalizing for the impact of these near-term headwinds the underlying core business growth was 6.4% at constant currency, which more closely aligns with the strong core business growth realized in prior quarters.","For fiscal year 2018, the core business delivered over $1 billion in revenue growth offsetting almost the entire $1.2 billion of revenue decline from LOEs. Strong performance in the promoted brands with ongoing exclusivity, together with all other revenues drove 6.9% core business growth. This figure represents true organic growth and that it excludes benefits of the 2017 acquisitions of CoolSculpting and regenerative medicine, as well as the impact of foreign exchange translation\/","Now moving to the -- now moving to margins in the middle of the page. Fiscal year operating margin of 47.9% aligned closely to prior year as the impact of lower operating costs due to restructuring essentially offset a 1 percentage point decline in gross margin which was driven by product mix into a lesser extent the product recalls just discussed.","You can also see that our fourth quarter operating margin declined 330 basis points as compared to a very strong result in the prior year period. The decline was due to the lower revenues as previously explained and also the phasing of both R&D and SG&A spending, which were more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter in part due to reinvestment of RESTASIS profits back into the core business to fund growth initiatives.","Moving to the lower section, non-GAAP performance net income per share in the fourth quarter declined 12% reflecting the revenue and margin issues just described. On a full-year basis, our fiscal year 2018 non-GAAP performance net income per share increased 2% versus prior year as the decline in non-GAAP performance net income was more than offset by lower share count due to buybacks that we executed throughout the year.","On Slide 24, you can see a more complete look at our key P&L line items for the fourth quarter and the full-year as compared to prior year. I\u2019ve already covered most of the highlights, but a couple of additional items to touch on. Net interest expense improved in both Q4 and the full-year largely due to lower average debt balances as we continue to reduce debt.","Net interest expense was further reduced as a result of our 2018 leverage neutral refinancing, which we undertook to optimize the currency mix of our total debt. Not otherwise mentioned on the slide is the GAAP accounting item for which I like to provide some color.","We monitor goodwill and intangible assets for indicators of impairment each and every quarter. This quarter we recorded a GAAP impairment charge of $5.4 billion with the key drivers being a $1.6 billion intangible asset impairment related to KYBELLA and a $3.5 billion impairment related to goodwill of our U.S general medicine segment, a portion of which was allocated to our Anti-Infectives business which is now classified as held-for-sale as a result of the event status of the sale process which Brent covered at the outset of the call.","Turning now to our fourth quarter performance versus prior year by reporting segment on Slide 25, U.S Specialized Therapeutics revenue declined a 3.9%, was mainly due to lower RESTASIS as well as lower sales of the divested Med Derm business. Contribution margin also decreased 350 basis points due to the revenue decline coupled with higher sales and marketing expenses, which were in part driven by timing.","U.S Gen -- U.S General Medicine continues to be the segment most impacted by LOEs as reflected by the revenue decline of 8.4%, which more than offset the strong performance of VRAYLAR and Lo LOESTRIN. Contribution margin increased 140 basis points with the impact of lower revenues was more than offset by favorable partnership true-up credit on LINZESS and expense savings from restructuring.","International revenue decline of 5% was significantly impacted by foreign exchange translation as well the impact of recalls. At constant currency, revenue grew 1% versus prior year, which expands to 8.5% excluding the impact of OZURDEX and textured implants. Contribution margin was also impacted by the same issues resulting in a 310 basis point decline versus prior year.","Turning to Slide 26, you can see on the left operating cash flow on a last 12 months basis for each ending period. In the fourth quarter, operating cash flow was strong at $1.5 billion, driving our fiscal year 2018 operating cash flow to $5.6 billion, which was above our prior guidance. On the right, our capitalization table shows the disciplined actions taken towards capital deployment and return of capital to stakeholders.","A couple of points to make here. We ended the year with total debt of $23.8 billion after paying down $6.2 billion or approximately 21% of debt outstanding at the start of the year. Gross and net leverage ratios are down to 3x and 2.8x, respectively as of December 31. On share buybacks, we repurchased a total of $2.7 billion in 2018 including $750 million completed during the fourth quarter.","We have $800 million remaining under the 2018 $2 billion share buyback authorization. And as we announced this morning, our Board just recently authorized a new $2 billion share buyback program, which we expect to deploy similarly and that is with the priority on offsetting dilution created by long-term incentive plans as well as potential earnings dilution from asset divestitures that we may complete.","Our capital allocation priorities continue, as stated previously. First, reinvestment in our business for growth in our four key therapeutic areas. Second, debt reduction, which is important in the context of the anticipated loss of RESTASIS exclusivity. We continue to pursue a target net leverage ratio of 2.5x by the end of 2020 and we will maintain our commitment to investment-grade credit rating. Three, funding the current dividend and prudently growing that dividend annually as the performance of our business allows, and last and finally share buybacks as we just talked about.","Moving now to Slide 27, our 2019 guidance. Let's start with net revenues. We expect fiscal year 2019 net revenues to be between $15 billion and $15.3 billion, which assumes RESTASIS exclusivity through March 31. This revenue guidance also includes anticipated headwinds previously discussed related to OZURDEX and textured implants in certain international markets as well as industry-wide pricing pressures and foreign exchange translation headwinds.","We expect non-GAAP gross margin for 2019 to be between 85% and 85.5%, reflecting the impact of product mix, including the anticipated RESTASIS LOE. Our non-GAAP SG&A expense is expected to be between $4.1 billion and $4.3 billion, which supports continued investments in key long-term growth drivers within the core business.","We expect non-GAAP R&D expense to be between $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion, which reflects increased investment in our pipeline as we continue to advance key programs in clinical development as you just heard from David.","Net interest expense\/other of approximately $800 million reflects interest savings from debt reduction, but also lower interest income from reduced cash balances relative to 2018. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in 2019 is expected to be between 13% and 13.5%, and our average 2019 share count is forecasted to be approximately 332 million shares, which assumes completion of the remaining $800 million under the 2018 $2 billion share buyback authorization.","As a result, and as previously committed, we expect full-year 2019 non-GAAP performance net income per share to be greater than or equal to $16.36. And please note that any significant asset divestitures should they be completed will be dilutive enough to non-GAAP performance net income per share that we have to revisit this and most of the other metrics for which we provide guidance.","Continuing down the page, reported cash flow from operations for 2019 is expected to be between $5 billion and $5.5 billion with the key assumptions being RESTASIS exclusivity through March 31 and success-based development milestones premised upon 100% achievement. In line with our previous commentary, we will continue to provide quarterly guidance until there is a RESTASIS generic entrant.","So for the first quarter of 2019, we expect total reported net revenue between $3.4 billion and $3.55 billion, as most of the revenue pressures in 2019 we discussed are more heavily weighted in the first half of the year, and non-GAAP performance net income per share between $3.40 and $3.60, which reflects a more even phasing of operating expenses throughout the year.","Then wrapping up the financial discussion, we finished 2018 with solid results. Our core business drivers continued to deliver strong growth. We\u2019ve right sized the business to absorb the impact of LOEs and other headwinds, all which positions us well to achieve the targets we\u2019ve set for ourselves in the coming year.","And with that, I will turn the call back to Brent.","Brenton L. Saunders","Thank you, Matt. We're pleased with our performance and progress we achieved in 2018. Looking into 2019, we're taking off from a position of strength and expect another year of rapid progress in execution. I\u2019m excited about the future of Allergan and its potential for long-term value creation, which will be driven by our product lines and development of our highly promising pipeline across all four key therapeutic areas. I would like to thank confident, hard-working Allergan colleagues around the globe, who are driving our strategy forward.","I would now like to turn the call over to the Q&A section. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Chris Schott","Great. Thanks very much for the questions. I guess, my first is just on CoolSculpting dynamics in 2019. I guess, two parts here. First, I know you said we should expect consumable driven growth. But should we still think about system sales declining as we go through '19? And can you also, on that same topic, just some additional color on the growth drivers internationally, is earning markets in particular we should be thinking about there? My second question would just on U.S BOTOX Therapeutic as we move into 2019? Hello?","Brenton L. Saunders","Chris, go ahead.","Chris Schott","I guess my question there, are you just -- are you more confident in your outlook for growth there now that we\u2019ve seen a few quarters of the CGRP launch or is it still too early to tell at this point? Thanks very much.","Brenton L. Saunders","Great. So Bill you want to take this?","William J. Meury","Yes. Chris, as it relates to CoolSculpting and the outlook for 2019, I would expect that systems revenue over the next 12 months will trade in the mid-single digits and will be primarily driven by the international recovery, which as you saw in the fourth quarter was very, very strong. We placed a record number of systems in 2018. That's going to provide an important platform for consumable growth, which I think in trade in the double digits. And then I would -- again keep your eye on that international business, which looks very good right now and then finally the launch of the CoolTone system. And I think that pretty much covers the questions on CoolSculpting. As it relates to BOTOX Therapeutic, I thought about it this way. There were two tests. The first test was 2018 and I think that we passed it. The growth rate in the quarter was 13%. The business looks very, very good. But to be fair there's a second test and I think by the second half of 2019 we will have a better sense of how this migraine market is going to look. There is no question when you look at the IMS data that the market is much bigger today than it was nine months ago. There's also no question that demand for BOTOX has been stable. We didn't have a quarter in 2018 that was below 10%. So I like the way it looks as we go into the year and we'll provide an update on the next call.","Brenton L. Saunders","Operator, next question.","Operator","The next question is from David Maris with Wells Fargo.","David Maris","Good morning. On the BOTOX competition that\u2019s expected this year and next year, Brent, if -- what do you expect if Evolus is approved that its discount would be relative to your list price just to gain share? And does your guidance include the increased ad spending as well as any sort of additional promotion that you'll have to do, if you do any to combat this new potential entrant? Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders","Yes, so I will take a stab at it, and Bill please feel free to add any commentary. Look I think that with respect to our guidance we have full -- fully baked in our increased spend to support BOTOX and anticipate -- anticipated competition in the marketplace. So that is completely within the numbers Matt provided. With respect to discounting, I would tell you that if you looked kind of anecdotally at what happened during the Christmas season with discounting from the existing -- the already existing competitors on the marketplace, it was fairly significant versus that the price of BOTOX. And so we have been competing against very steep discounted products for years and BOTOX has done very well despite that. So I don't -- I can't speculate what they will do, but I don\u2019t think there's a lot of room to be successful with just a pure discounting strategy. I don\u2019t know if Bill has anything else he would add.","William J. Meury","Yes, the only thing I would add David is, one is it's not a zero-sum game. This market as much growth potential as, I think, any market in healthcare. We don't view it as a market share battle at this point. I don't think toxins are interchangeable. They\u2019re definitely similar, but in the hands of very large injectors. There are differences and even if they\u2019re subtle there, they\u2019re important. I think there are two market segments here. There's the branded segment, which is essentially BOTOX and then there's an undifferentiated segment. And it's an efficient market and over time I don\u2019t think it's going to support more than three products. It's not going to support four or five or six. I don\u2019t see why an aesthetic specialist would buy inventory and inject so many different toxins. And BOTOX has been a practice builder for these physicians. It's the only toxin that is requested and it's a gateway for physicians and our focus is on maintaining it and it's supported by the largest sales force in aesthetics, the largest training program in aesthetics and the only -- really the only loyalty program in aesthetics. And so I think the outlook for this business over '19 and beyond its still very good.","Brenton L. Saunders","Thanks, David.","David Maris","And just one follow-up. For the new BOTOX ad I think that came out today or recently, and then the filler ad that came out in the fourth quarter, as those are rolling out, are you seeing patient acquisition that looks different from what you\u2019ve had in the past? And I don't mean just the volume of patients, but the age grouping or gender or is it really just an expansion of what you already have? Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders","That\u2019s a good question. Total patient acquisition is climbing and the first place we see it is in our BD enrollment, which is up significantly since we launched the JUV\u00c9DERM campaign. But the age cohort for BOTOX has been trending younger and younger given as you know this millennial movement, in the past five years a number of millennial users in aesthetics has tripled from our estimation just under 300,000 to over 1 million. I would say in the next five years millennials will be the largest consumer aesthetics products and services replacing the generation X.","David Maris","Okay, great.","Brenton L. Saunders","Thanks, David. Operator, next question?","Operator","Your next question is from Jason Gerberry with Bank of America.","Jason Gerberry","Hi. Thanks. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, Bill, just a follow-up on CoolSculpting. Can you just comment where you think you're going in terms of additional hardware placements in the U.S market in the coming year? And how quickly are you getting a turnaround on that investment, or what I call an investment grade in terms of offering at a lower price to your end customer? And then my second question is just on U.S drug pricing, realizing that your recent pricing increases were in line with your prior company pledge. I\u2019m just kind of curios, we\u2019re seeing the industry pivot to more mid single-digit list price increases. And so just curious, Brent, to get your comments on, is this sort of where you think the industry is headed in terms of further kind of compression around those price dynamics? Thanks.","Brenton L. Saunders","Yes, so maybe I will take the drug pricing question and then turn it over to Bill for the CoolSculpting question, Jason. Look I think with respect to drug pricing, we have anticipated for years now that price would not be a lever that could be pulled by this industry. And in fact we did memorialize that in our social contract a couple years ago and changed our strategy several years ago to focus on more innovative pipeline developments across our therapeutic areas. When you look at price and this is consistent of how we thought about it last year this year and over the next several years, it's basically a nonfactor, right? We saw no price appreciation on a net basis in '18. We anticipate no price appreciation on a net basis in '19, and we baked no price appreciation into our outlook on a go-forward basis. So I think the fact support what our assumption was a few years ago, which is price was not going to be a growth driver in any way shape or form in this industry, not unique to Allergan, but across the entire industry as you had expected. So we kind of don\u2019t think about price essentially.","William J. Meury","As it relates to the CoolSculpting, we -- like I said, we placed a record number of systems in '18, which was roughly 1,200. I think we could trade right around a thousand in 2019. We did have some choppiness as you saw in the third and fourth quarters. But look we just -- I think we've just scratched the surfaces of body contouring market. Over time or since the introduction of CoolSculpting, we\u2019ve treated roughly 1.5 million people. And based on countless number of surveys that we\u2019ve done, we estimate that there could be 30 million or 40 million people who are aesthetically minded and interested in the fat reducing type treatment like CoolSculpting. And so I think the runway here it's still very, very good. I think the launch of CoolTone and any other new system that we introduce over the next several years when we have two other, which I would call 3.0 and 4.0, this business has the potential to grow at a nice steady rate.","Brenton L. Saunders","Thanks, Jason. Operator, next question?","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question is from Marc Goodman with SVB Leerink.","Marc Goodman","Good morning. The first question is on the revenue guidance for 2019. It just seems a little weaker than we were expecting. And you mentioned some of the issues, but I was hoping you could help quantify it like how much is FX impacting? How much is the breast aesthetics issue impacting OZURDEX impacting? And then second of all, Dave, maybe you could just talk about Cariprazine in depression. What studies have been done, what needs to be done? Just give us the timelines on that, so we can have an understanding there? And then on ubrogepant data at a medical meeting, when can we be expecting to see that for the long-term safety data? Thanks.","Brenton L. Saunders","Great. Thanks, Marc. Matt, you want to take the first revenue guidance?","Matthew M. Walsh","Sure, sure. So for our 2019 guidance let's start out by noting that the core business will be growing on the same order that we saw in 2018. So that\u2019s 6.9% growth in the core business that we realized in 2018 that will roll forward into 2019 in excess of 6%. It'll add about a $1 billion of top line growth. We are respecting about a $1.4 billion of LOEs. And then the other issue is related to the near-term headwinds. I'll try and dimensionalize those a bit for you in terms of how they were incorporated into our planning. So for textured implants, we had said that the international market for textured implants was about $60 million as we incorporated that into our planning for 2019. We've expanded that a bit to include some knock on effects in other ex U.S market, so that\u2019s about a $100 million relative to what our normalized expectation for 2019 would have been. OZURDEX is about half that. Let's call about $50 million and pretty importantly FX translation will be impacting us relative to 2018, that enumerates to about $150 million. But I'd just close out by saying that the core business will be delivering growth aligned with what we saw in 2018.","Brenton L. Saunders","So David you want to cover cariprazine in MDD?","C. David Nicholson","Yes, and ubrogepant -- yes, happy to do that. Yes, so with cariprazine as adjunctive treatment for MDD we already have one positive study. Late last year, we initiated two more, so we are presently enrolling patients in two more adjunctive MDD studies. Enrollment is going well. We anticipate enrollment being completed by mid '21, but that obviously depends on the recruitment rates. You also asked about ubrogepant and when we will be presenting additional data. We are planning to make presentations on ubrogepant at the -- at AAN, at the Headache Association as well as the International Headache Society. We are in the process of submitting abstracts and exactly what data we present, well obviously it depends on approval and acceptance of the abstracts. But we will be making presentations at all three of those major meeting during the course of this year.","Brenton L. Saunders","Thanks, Marc. Operator, next question? Operator?","Operator","Okay, Your next question is from Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse.","Vamil Divan","Hi. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. So a couple I have here. One just on the impairment charge you took. I know you mentioned $1.6 billion was related to KYBELLA and then $3.5 billion was goodwill, $622 million I think was for Anti-Infectives. Can you just parse out the rest of that goodwill impairment because a pretty large delta between that and the Anti-Infectives, one? And then second one I have is on Rapastinel. I\u2019m just trying to get your perspective on -- I know you have the data coming up from the acute studies in the first half of the year. I\u2019m trying to get a sense of how important that data is as you think about the outlook of that product? We\u2019ve been highlighting it as a potential important catalyst, important data set, but I noticed in your press release you didn\u2019t sort of list it under your key development when you listed out your key pipeline updates for milestones for 2019. So just want to make sure not overstating that and to wait for the longer term data there. Thanks.","Brenton L. Saunders","Great. So you want to talk about, Matt, the impairment?","Matthew M. Walsh","Yes, sure. So the impairment of goodwill really relates to the Gen Med segment as a whole. And so for accounting purposes, because of the held-for-sale status of Anti-Infectives, a portion of that had to be allocated to that business, but really what we're looking at is an adjustment to the carrying value of the entire segment, it's not done on an individual asset by asset basis.","Brenton L. Saunders","Okay. With respect to Rapastinel, I will give you my two cents and David feel free to chime in. Quarterly it is an important development. We have about five programs for Rapastinel. Our studies are ongoing for Rapastinel and concluding all them and getting the data is an important milestone for us. I put that in the context of the category, which is -- there is a tremendous need for a novel and rapid onset antidepressant. So not only for Allergan, but for patients this is and it could be a very important advance. So we\u2019re very interested in seeing those results later in the first half of this year. We also have 13 other Phase 3 programs that were equally excited about and so it's like trying to pick your favorite child, but all of them are important to us and I\u2019m not sure I would read anything into the press release as trying to diminish the importance of any one of these late stage programs. David anything you would like to add?","C. David Nicholson","No, I think you covered it, Brent. Yes, it's good.","Brenton L. Saunders","Great. Thank you.","Vamil Divan","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Ronny Gal with Bernstein.","Aharon Gal","Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Two if you don\u2019t mind. The first one around BOTOX neurology. I understand the statement about the success there in maintaining the growth of franchise. But can you take us a little bit deeper, I mean, you got -- it's over a 100,000 patients have begun to use anti-CGRP this last quarter. How come BOTOX is not being here? Is it being served through a different group of physician, different channel? Are patients being presented with the option of using a CGRP using BOTOX instead? Is it people who had failed or are not eligible for anti-CGRP? It's just trying to understand if this is some sort of a data fluke or actually there's something you can point to that that makes this more sustainable. And second -- and it's a second commercial question, is you have multiple questions from very, very high gross to net. Now you can significantly reduce the amount of money paid to the channel if you reduce the list price of some of those products, especially in eye care. I was kind of wondering of how you think about the gives and takes of reducing list price on some of those products and is this something that we could potentially see in 2019?","William J. Meury","Yes, thanks, Ronny. As it relates to BOTOX and neurology, first of all, I think if you look at the IMS data, I think it has a new name now because they were acquired.","Aharon Gal","IQVIA.","William J. Meury","Yes, IQVIA. There is nearly 200,000 new patients that are placed on the CGRPs and mostly Aimovig. At least -- that\u2019s you can ask the management teams at Amgen, Teva, and Lilly, but that\u2019s at least my take on it. And the reason why I think you haven't seen a material impact on BOTOX is fairly straightforward. First of all, half of those 200,000 patients have episodic migraine. And so they're really not in our universe of users. You can see that in the IQVIA data too. Next is think about the large off label market for the prevention of migraine. You have literally over 15 million prescriptions being written between products like Topamax or generic topiramate, TCAs and beta blockers. And so if you look, although this data is not perfect, if you look at the IMS data, you have roughly 70% of use for CGRPs, it appears to me coming from new patients, continuing patients, and then switches from generic agents like topiramate. And so it's not surprising that you have BOTOX coexisting in the market with the CGRPs and to be fair what I think is most reassuring as we think about BOTOX long-term is that with the number of new patients for the prevention of migraine -- the branded prevention of migraine nearly doubling, the CGRPs to a certain extend become a gateway to BOTOX. And I suppose the reverse is true. And when you look at the data on BOTOX, the effect of BOTOX on migraine in terms of prevention of migraine days on a monthly basis can't be beat by any of the CGRPs. And it's in the benefit risk ratio of BOTOX is pretty well characterized, and so like I said there were two tests here, '18 was the first one and I think the second -- the first half of 2019 is the second one. It's too early to call this, but the business looks very healthy right now.","Brenton L. Saunders","And I would just underscore the one point, Bill made Ronny, which is well the CGRP antibodies are clearly a good advance -- a needed advance for migraine sufferers. To the Wall Street community they\u2019re new and they\u2019re exciting, but to the headache specialist that I interact with and Bill interacts with, it's just another tool. They don't view it as superior to BOTOX. And so we should keep in mind while the pharmaceutical industry and the people who follow the industry are excited about a novel new entrant, the clinical implication is just another tool, a good tool, but just another tool. And so they will select for their patients as they feel appropriate between the two therapies. And then as it relates to your question on eye care and pricing, look, you know that pricing and discount dynamics are fairly complicated. There are multiple stakeholders involved. It's going to take time to figure out. What I\u2019m focused on right now is that we\u2019ve a pretty good handle on our discount rate in eye care as we look out in 2019. And then when I look at the pipeline, which will be abicipar, Bimatoprost SR, the bim ring, I think those products are going to be easier to price than the products that we have in the market today. And that\u2019s how I think about it for now. Thanks Ronny. Operator?","Operator","Your next question is from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger","Yes. Thanks very much. So, Brent, could you just discuss a little bit how you're thinking about bigger picture strategic optionality longer-term? Some investors are convinced that the best course for the company is ultimately to have the attractive high-value portfolio as part of the higher value company and the lower valued assets elsewhere. Just wondering if that\u2019s still something that might be possible down the line? And then, Matt, could you just comment on the IRS proposal to close the tax loophole related to intercompany loans and how we should think about the risk to the tax rate going up longer-term? Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders","Yes, sure. Thanks, David. Well our focus at Allergan is to really have winning strategies for our four core therapeutic areas, Medical Aesthetics, CNS, eye care and GI. I think I covered that well in the prepared remarks both in our capabilities in those areas as well as our current portfolio products and our bench of late stage mid-to early-stage pipeline products. So we feel reassured about our ability to compete for the long-term in all four of those. Our Board is constantly thinking about strategic alternatives and value creation moves. We do that on a regular basis and very specifically on an annual basis in a more formal way. Right now our strategic direction is quite clear as I just outlined, but as the industry develops and as we develop within the industry, we're always thinking of what\u2019s the right move for our shareholders for the long-term. So anything is always possible.","Matthew M. Walsh","And on the tax part of your question, David, so to state the obvious Allergan like all taxpayers is subject to the rules that you mentioned. These have been a long time coming, they\u2019re not a surprise. So we\u2019ve been oriented in our tax planning appropriately for some time. So including the new December proposed regulation. So our tax rate at 13% to 13.5% for 2019 incorporates all of that already.","Brenton L. Saunders","Great. Operator, next question?","Operator","Your next question is from Seamus Fernandez with Guggenheim.","Seamus Fernandez","Great. Thanks for the question. Can you guys just talk a little bit about Rapastinel and your plans for revealing the data? Do you have any data in-house yet? And if not, what\u2019s the plan for revealing the data? Should we expect multiple press releases with each trial or is the plan really to bring in all of the data at one and then reveal multiple trials simultaneously? And is that what we\u2019re likely to see later in the first half of this year as you mentioned? And then just a quick second question. Haven't really had many questions on the GI biz. Can you guys just give us your sense of the key drivers to the GI biz business near-term and then longer-term with the two main Phase 3 pipeline assets that are rolling through the pipeline? Thanks.","Brenton L. Saunders","Sure. David, you want to cover Rapastinel?","C. David Nicholson","Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Seamus. The three acute maintenance and the open label trials have completed enrollment. That\u2019s all on ClinicalTrials.gov. And we are absolutely on schedule and plan to have the top line results in the first half of the year. If the study is coming close enough to each other, we are going to top line result all three at the same time.","Brenton L. Saunders","If, for whatever reason they end up being spread far apart, then we will top line them separately, which is essentially our policy within Allergan, if closing time we bundle them and if there's a substantial difference between the time that the multiple studies read out, we do them individually. It's quite conventional in the industry to do it that way. Bill you want to talk about the GI?","William J. Meury","Yes. Listen, in terms of the marketed products, I would -- we\u2019ve really four: LINZESS; VIBERZI; CARAFATE; and ZENPEP. I would take LINZESS and ZENPEP. I would take LINZESS and ZENPEP and put that into the growing bucket and then VIBERZI and CARAFATE into the stable buckets. Clearly of the four, LINZESS is the flagship. I think the underlying prescription demand for that business is very, very reassuring despite some of the pricing headwinds that we\u2019re facing, we had a very, very good quarter both in terms of underlying prescription growth and top line growth. And the partnership with Ironwood continues to be very productive. And then when you look at the pipeline, I think it's a little underappreciated right now because we are in the middle of Phase 3 and we need data. Brazikumab is an IL-23 biologic for IBD Crohn's and ulcerative colitis and we're doing head-to-head studies versus Humira and versus Stelara. And so if those studies are positive it should be a significant contributor in the future. Relamorelin is probably the most potent prokinetic on the market for gastroparesis and again that\u2019s in Phase 3. There is really nothing available for gastroparesis, you could look to Reglan or Propulsid as the last two pro-motility agents, both very successful commercially. We have to produce more data and then of course we have to the CVC program, which we will report out towards the end of 2019, 2020 -- excuse me, beyond that. And that's also very interesting and so we're building a bridge I would describe it from the marketed products today which are in good position to a pipeline that could be very promising.","Brenton L. Saunders","Great. I think we\u2019ve plan one or two more questions, operator.","Operator","Your next question is from Umer Raffat with Evercore.","Umer Raffat","Hi. Thanks so much for taking my questions. I realized there has been a few questions on Rapastinel, but I just want to clarify. Have you guys not had any Phase 3 report internally yet? And should we expect volatility and variability between depression trials as we\u2019ve seen with other programs? And then, Bill, just very briefly on LINZESS, do you see commercial dynamic evolving once Trulance starts leveraging [indiscernible] portfolio wide rebating structures? Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders","David you want to \u2026?","C. David Nicholson","Sure. Yes, so regarding Rapastinel, as I mentioned and answer to the previous question, yes, we expect to be able to top line the results in the first half of 2019. Thanks for the question about the variability of depressions that is. Look, we certainly with the monoamines modulators, the -- which are effective antidepressants. The ability to distinguish those agent from placebo in clinical trials is a well-known issue with a smaller proportion of well-controlled clinical study actually demonstrating a significant difference between the active drug and the placebo. Clearly as we move into the -- into a new mechanism of action, we still anticipate large placebo effects in the trials whether or not it's going to be more difficult to distinguish the activity of agents like Rapastinel with other mechanisms of action, the monoamines modulation from placebo, time will tell as we roll out the data.","Matthew M. Walsh","And then, Umer, as it relates to Trulance, I don't see it as a threat. LINZESS has got two indications, three doses, formulary coverage that took us eight years to build. We\u2019ve over a 1,000 people promoting it and we spend tens of millions of dollars in direct-to-consumer advertising and I don\u2019t want to minimize the impact of an alternative, but I can imagine Trulance is going to be relevant to LINZESS in '19 or any year after that.","Brenton L. Saunders","Great. I think we\u2019ve time for one last question, operator.","Operator","Your next question is from Liav Abraham with Citi.","Liav Abraham","Good morning. Thanks for fitting me in. A couple of questions, firstly on BOTOX Aesthetic growth in 2019. Growth in BOTOX Aesthetic was very strong in 2018 at double-digit. What assumptions do you have in your guidance on BOTOX Aesthetic in 2019, given the impact from a potential new competitor? Do you still anticipate that double-digit -- this double-digit growth can be maintained? And then secondly, maybe forgive me Matt for asking the question again, but I didn\u2019t quite understand your response to a previous question regarding the impairment charge on the general medicine business. What was the driver behind this fairly large charge? Can you be a little bit more specific or repeat your answer? Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders","Great. So, Bill, you want to talk about BOTOX Aesthetic?","William J. Meury","Yes. Liav, I would say that in 2019 you have a U.S and an international business internationally. We should be trading in the double-digit range and in the United States that could be a high single-digit to double-digit outlook.","Brenton L. Saunders","Great. And, Matt, you want to cover the impairment driver for Gen Med?","Matthew M. Walsh","Sure. On the goodwill impairment, let's just quantify the adjustment to the carrying value of that segment was on the order of 10%. And in our second quarter Q, we disclosed that was a segment that had amongst the lowest headroom for impairments of our reporting segments, and then we ended the year with a enterprise value of the company given where the stock was trading, that then caused that headroom to fall south of book value. And then that was combined with a general increase in market interest rates, which raised our cost of capital for these calculations by about a point. So the adjustment relates more to those sort of macro issues than it does to any single individual asset or group of assets in the portfolio, just how the calculations are done.","Liav Abraham","Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders","Great. So I'd like to thank everyone for participating in the call. We look forward to keeping you updated as the year progresses. And I'd like to thank our colleagues around the world for a very strong 2018 and we look forward to delivering another strong 2019.

We are proud to be starting the year with a strong quarter, continuing a strong momentum we ended within 2017. Our results underscore the hard work of our Allergan colleagues across the globe and their commitment to executing on both our strategic plans and our annual guidance.","Our business continues to perform well with stable and durable branch driving a growth trajectory that will help offset the expected impacts of LOEs within our portfolio. Overall, we\u2019re in a very strong strategic and financial position. We\u2019ve made great portfolio of integrated therapeutic areas with some of the best most durable assets in our industry.","To help me out with core business combined with our pipeline optionality reinforces our confidence that we will be able to deliver an approximately 5% revenue CAGR from 2017 to 2022. Our margins and cash flows are strong and we\u2019ve made significant progress in terms of reducing our leverage.","Today, I will briefly review the results from the quarter and our business drivers. Bill and David will go into more detail on our product highlights and R&D portfolio. Matt will review the financials, and then I will be back to provide an update on the strategic review before turning it over to Q&A.","Turning to Slide 5. In the first quarter of 2018, revenues were up 3% year-over-year, adjusted operating margin was up 260 basis points, non-GAAP performance net income per share increased 12%, and we had another strong quarter at cash flow generation. Keep in mind that this strong performance was achieved despite approximately $200 million in sales declines due to loss of exclusivity on ESTRACE, NAMENDA XR, MINASTRIN and ACZONE.","We anticipate that we will face some additional to line pressure during the year from LOEs, including RESTASIS, but we\u2019re working hard to meet that pressure head-on.. Our teams have been proactive and hardnosed in reducing our operating cost base, and we are on track to reduce cost by approximately $400 million.","While taking costs out of the company, we have also continued to drive development of the R&D pipeline and has hit several key milestones in the past few months. This includes delivering two positive pivotal Phase 3 studies for Ubrogepant, an Acute Migraine and a third positive pivotal study for VRAYLAR in bipolar depression. This is just the beginning of the clinical data read-outs and pipeline accomplishments we expect to achieve this year.","For example, we also expect Phase 3 clinical data for abicipar. Results from the first Phase 3 study of bimatoprost SR, announcement of Phase 2 data for atogepant and beginning Phase 3 trials for brazikumab and crohn\u2019s, to just name a few of the important milestones for 2018.","We are also very actively managing the lifecycle of our key products. VRAYLAR is a great example of how we\u2019re continuing to invest in clinical trials for new indications that have the potential to be multipliers of the current market potential for VRAYLAR. For BOTOX, we have applied new indications in development, two in cosmetic and three in therapeutic. The market across cosmetic and therapeutic indications remains significantly underpenetrated and we see a long runway ahead for us in earnings potential for this globally unique brand.","David will talk more about the pipeline, including multiple shots on goal on our mid to late-stage pipeline in each of our key areas of focus. While our teams have been very focused on day-to-day business and pipeline execution, we have also deployed capital to pay down debt and further delever the balance sheet, while accelerating our share buyback program. We are now at a gross debt to EBITDA ratio of 3.2 times, which is in line with our target for the year.","In the first quarter of 2018 alone, we paid down $3.6 billion in net debt and completed our $2 billion share repurchase program. And we returned $320 million to preferred and ordinary shareholders in cash dividends. With the strong results, we\u2019re delivering across all four of our focus areas. We\u2019re increasing our full-year 2018 revenue and non-GAAP performance net income per share.","Turning to our performance drivers on Side 6 illustrates that we\u2019re successfully strengthening our core business, while ensuring that we deliver our new sources of value. We now had nearly 90% of our total revenues coming from promoted brands with ongoing exclusivity and other established products.","If you exclude the impact of M&A and foreign exchange, our underlying business grew approximately 6% this quarter versus prior year. This helped to offset the impact of several anticipated LOEs this quarter and the outlook remains very bright.","We have a robust product line with breadth and depth in our key therapeutic areas and a promising pipeline within our focused areas. We will remain disciplined in our capital allocation activities with a focus on investing in our business to support the long-term growth, reducing leverage and returning capital to shareholders, while making prudent investments to strengthen our position across our key therapeutic areas.","This update is indicative of how we\u2019re delivering on the objectives that we set in place earlier this year and our strong confidence in the business going forward. We have a lot to be excited about.","Now, let me turn the call over to Bill.","William Meury","Thanks, Brent. Good morning. Turning to Slide 8. The first quarter was highlighted by strong sales versus prior year for many of our flagship products. In Medical Aesthetics, growth was led by BOTOX Cosmetic up 10% BOTOX Therapeutics was also very strong in the quarter, up 15% and there was demand across all indications. Also in CNS, VRAYLAR continues to exceed expectations reaching $84 million in the quarter, up 58%.","In GI, LINZESS sales were up 8%, Zenpep sales were up 14%, and VIBERZI sales were up 14%, too. In Eye Care, growth was led by sales for OZURDEX, which continued to grow at double-digit rate, up 13%. And finally, in women\u2019s health, strong growth for Lo LOESTRIN continues, up 15%.","As expected this quarter, we faced generic competition for ESTRACE Cream, NAMENDA XR, MINASTRIN and ACZONE, which as you can see in the slide, impacted revenue growth by approximately $200 million.","Turning to Slide 9. Our Medical Aesthetics business was strong across the Board in the first quarter and the outlook for the year and the long-term is excellent. Now frequently, I get asked questions about overhangs from alternative toxins. Here\u2019s how I think about it. Alternative toxins may enter the space and we\u2019ve dealt with this before. It\u2019s the reality of a growing and lucrative market.","History has proven to us that the best strategy is to focus on what we can control, which is expanding the market, which is added inflection point and driving demand for our products. And if we do that, this business will continue to thrive.","Every aspect of Allergan Medical Aesthetics is bigger and stronger today than it was three years ago when we began to run the business, including sales, product offerings, which total over a dozen, commercial capabilities and pipeline. And we will continue to invest heavily to create an unprecedented level of awareness and interest in our products in the years ahead.","This year, we launched nationwide DTC campaigns for BOTOX and CoolSculpting. We\u2019re launching the U.S. Allergan Medical Institute, which is a branded proprietary program that will train tens of thousands of injectors and brings our entire portfolio under one training umbrella. And we\u2019re expanding our consumer loyalty program with over 3.6 million active consumers. These things among others have taken years to build are difficult to replicate and give us a major competitive advantage.","Now in Facial Aesthetics, sales for BOTOX Cosmetic and JUV\u00c9DERM are expected to increase at double-digit rates in 2018. As projected during last quarter call, our first quarter sales were partially impacted by the timing of promotional offers and our year-end physician rebate program in 2017. Sales trends will normalize over the remainder of the year. Our Body Contouring business had an exceptionally strong quarter in the United States with sales up 31% versus prior year on a pro forma basis and we exited the quarter with 3,400 accounts.","With our expanded sales force, we drove an 85% increase in systems revenues. Total system placements came in just shy of record setting levels in the fourth quarter of 2017. And for the 12-month period ending March and since our combination with ZELTIQ, system growth is up 30%, compared to a flat period prior to the merger.","International CoolSculpting sales were impacted by the ongoing restructuring of our distribution model and we expect performance to improve in many markets in the second-half of the year. Overall, we remain optimistic about the prospects for this business.","In Plastics and Regenerative Medicine, first quarter sales were up 15% on a pro forma basis versus last year. ALLODERM, our tissue matrix for breast reconstruction, continues to exceed expectations with sales up 29% on a pro forma basis. Breast sales were also strong this quarter up a 11%. We expect growth for the balance of the year, but at a low to mid single-digit level.","In Eye Care, excluding RESTASIS, we have a formidable $2 billion global business with sustainable low to mid single-digit growth outlook. In the quarter, our glaucoma business remained stable with solid international growth, offset by a moderate decline in the U.S., driven primarily by trade buying patterns.","OZURDEX posted 13% growth in the first quarter. And in Dry Eye, the overall business declined 12% versus prior year with 4% demand growth for RESTASIS in the U.S. being more than offset by trade buying patterns and lower net pricing. Demand for MDPF, or Multi-Dose Preservative-Free, RESTASIS has now reached approximately 25% of the total brand and it\u2019s still growing with targeted field force support.","Turning to Slide 10, the prospects for CNS franchise remain bright, while driven by BOTOX Therapeutics and VRAYLAR today. We have multiple shots on goal in the pipeline, including new indications for VRAYLAR and BOTOX Therapeutic, CGRPs and rapastinel.","Let\u2019s look at VRAYLAR. It continues to exceed expectations and be the fastest-growing branded anti-psychotic on the market. VRAYLAR volume grew a 11% quarter-over-quarter, despite first quarter seasonality and payer dynamics. We initiated direct-to-consumer advertising in February. Since the launch of DTC, we\u2019ve seen a 43% increase in new patient starts, which is above expectations and one of the most successful DTC campaigns we\u2019ve ever launched at Allergan, the outlook for this business is excellent.","With BOTOX Therapeutic, one common misperception that migraine and migraine alone is the growing part of BOTOX, but there\u2019s much more than that. Growth is coming from all three indications, migraine, specificity and OAB with a strong diversified revenue stream.","In the quarter, BOTOX Therapeutic sales grew 15% versus prior year, driven mainly by volume. As it relates to migraine, we expect to be the only company that can offer physicians a two-prong solution, which consists of Ubrogepant for acute migraine and BOTOX for prevention. The products are complimentary and there is an opportunity for sale synergies here.","In GI, we invested the flagship product, of course, and it\u2019s on its way to $1 billion in sales. In the first quarter, revenues grew 8% versus prior year with volume demand growing at 16%. The key source of LINZESS growth continues to be dissatisfied OTC patients. We initiated a new DTC campaign, which has increased our new patient acquisition rates to an all-time high. Our partnership with Ironwood remains very strong and productive.","Last thing on VIBERZI, demand is stable. We\u2019ve right-sized our investment behind the brand for profitability and our promotional attention is on a core group of approximately 15,000 users.","Finally, turning to Slide 11. In international the strong momentum continued in the first quarter with sales up 9%, excluding foreign exchange, with growth coming from every region. In Medical Aesthetics, BOTOX Cosmetic and JUV\u00c9DERM grew 15% and a 11%, respectively, and are now approximately the same size.","We\u2019ll be launching consumer campaigns around the world to support our JUV\u00c9DERM collection business, which is the fastest-growing part of our international aesthetics business. The international opportunity here is significant, especially in Asia Pacific, Middle East, Africa. The outlook for the international business continues to be very positive.","Now let me turn the call over to David.","David Nicholson","Thanks, Bill. Good morning. The first quartet has been a very productive one for R&D, highlighted by positive Phase 3 studies, Cariprazine and Ubrogepant. We continue to progress our pipeline and we look forward to more data read-outs during the remainder of the year.","Turning to Slide 13, we recently announced positive results from the third and final Cariprazine Phase 3 study in bipolar depression. In this latest study, AMD 56, as shown on the right-hand side of the slide, the 1.5-milligram dose, again, showed a statistically significant reduction in MADRS total score compared to placebo.","The 3-milligram dose in this study did not show statistical significance, compared to placebo. But as you can see from the slide, it did, in fact, show a numerical benefit similar to study AMD 53, shown on the left. You know, studies Cariprazine was well-tolerated from the side effect profile was very similar to that observed in all other Cariprazine trials. We now have a complete dataset that we will be submitting to the FDA in the second-half of the year.","Turning to Slide 14. We are very pleased with the positive results from our single-attack Phase 3 studies with Ubrogepant for the acute treatment in migraine. We presented the data from ACHIEVE I at the AAN Meeting in Los Angeles last week. And the results from ACHIEVE II last Friday in a webcast, which is available on our website.","I will just make a couple of comments on the highlights from ACHIEVE II. ACHIEVE II is a U.S. multi-center randomized trial, evaluating the efficacy and safety of two doses of Ubrogepant, 25 and 50 milligrams, compared to placebo for the acute treatment of migraine. Co-primary endpoints were pain freedom and absence of the most bothersome migraine associated symptom, the two hours post dose.","As shown on the slide, both doses results in a significantly greater percentage of Ubrogepant patients achieving pain freedom compared to placebo. The 50-milligram dose also demonstrated a significant benefit and the most bothersome symptoms. Note that in the real world, data supports an upwards of 40% and 60% of patients will experience pain freedom after dosing at three hours and six hours, respectively.","Across both trials, the Ubrogepant was very well-tolerated, demonstrating a similar safety profile, the placebo. No cases of liver enzyme elevations were adjudicated to have a probable relationship with the drug and no cases of Hy\u2019s Laws were observed. We now have two well-controlled studies, which meet the registration of co-primary endpoints.","Multiple doses show statistically significant and clinically meaningful outcome measures. Migraine is underdiagnosed and undertreated, the significant need for new treatments. The data we presented are an important milestone to us progressing a new treatment options for this disease. We look forward to the results of the two long-term safety studies, which are expected in the second-half of this year.","Turning to Slide 15, we continue to advance the rest of our mid to late-stage pipeline, according to our timeline, targets and expectations. The exception is our lead oral ROR gamma T project for psoriasis. Due to safety signals observed in the Phase 2 study, this project has been terminated.","We continue to see ROR gamma T as a valid targeting drug discovery, and are now exploring alternative formulations and indications. In Women\u2019s Health, the NDA for ESMYA for the treatment of abnormal bleeding associated with uterine fibroid was accepted last year and we now expect an FDA decision in late August.","We continue to support Gedeon Richter, regarding the ongoing EMA\u2019s Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee\u2019s review of the post-marketing data. Note that no additional cases of severe liver injury of interest to PRAC have been reported since our last earnings call. We expect the EMA final recommendation on ESMYA to be completed in the first-half of this year. All of our other programs were on track. We\u2019re looking forward to additional data read-outs from several of these programs later this year.","As always, I thank my colleagues in R&D for their work, as well as the patients participating in our clinical trials.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Matt.","Matt Walsh","Thank you, David. Let me open by saying that I\u2019m pleased to be on my first earnings call as CFO of Allergan. It\u2019s already been two months since I started. And I can tell you that I\u2019m impressed with the Allergan organization and culture, as well as the strong talent pool within the finance, IT and business development functions, which I lead.","Prior to joining the company, when I was on the outside looking in, I was impressed with Allergan\u2019s unique business model that pairs Medical Aesthetics and biopharma together under one umbrella. And now that I\u2019m here, our first quarter results bear out the strength of this combination.","Turning to the key highlights of the first quarter on Slide 17. As Brent mentioned at the beginning of the call, Q1 demonstrates solid year-over-year financial performance across all of our commitments and a strong step toward our 2018 goals.","Starting with the upper left quadrant, you can see net revenues in the quarter were $3.67 billion, a 2.8% increase versus prior year and 1.1%, excluding the benefit of foreign exchange translation. The highlight of our first quarter revenue profile was the strong performance of the promoted brands as ongoing exclusivity, which together with other revenues drove 6% core business growth versus the prior year.","Note that this figure represents true organic growth conservatively presented and that it excludes the impact of currency translation and also excludes the impact of acquisitions. The strength in first quarter revenue performance reaffirms prior statements about our top line expectations for 2018.","As expected, the quarter was impacted by revenue declines in LOE products, which as a group, declined 38% versus prior year. In aggregate, this outcome was aligned with our expectations and we will continue to see these declines during the year, all of which has already incorporated into the guidance that we provide.","Moving to the upper right quadrant, non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 86.2%, a decline of 110 basis points versus prior year, due primarily to product mix as lower margin products, for example, our 2017 acquisitions in Regenerative Medicine and CoolSculpting displaced sales of LOE products, which carried somewhat higher margins.","More than offsetting the modest decline in gross margin, adjusted operating margin improved 260 basis points to 47.9% versus 45.3% last year and this had two primary drivers.","First, we\u2019re seeing the benefits of lower operating expenses from the successful execution of the restructuring program we previously announced, which targeted $400 million on an annualized basis. This is driving most of the operating margin improvement realized. And second, this was smaller in magnitude. We saw some timing-related favorability in operating expenses in both R&D and sales and marketing that are likely to reverse over the remaining quarters of the year.","Looking at the lower left quadrant, non-GAAP performance net income per share of $3.74 grew 12% versus the prior year. We\u2019ve already discussed two of the key drivers. First, revenue growth in promoted brands, which included contribution from 2017 Medical Asthmatics acquisitions; and two, lower operating expenses. The third driver was share count, where we realized about 2.7 percentage points of growth, or about $0.09 per share.","In a lower right quadrant, we look at operating cash flow generation, which has been steadily improving, because cash flow can isolate over narrow time windows, which makes comparisons difficult, it makes sense to look at cash flow on a last 12 months basis, which is what we\u2019re showing here. So the bars represent LTM operating cash flow for each ending period with no adjustments of any kind. These numbers are taken directly from our GAAP cash flow statement.","The $1.46 billion in Q1 operating cash flow drives our LTM operating cash flow to $6.6 billion, as of March 31. While this is a strong result, we do believe there\u2019s an element of timing-related favorability here as well. With that said, our first quarter performance has increased our confidence level in our prior guidance of $4.7 billion to $5 billion in operating cash flow for 2018, and we\u2019ll revisit this when we discuss our full-year guidance update in just a few moments.","As a footnote to this slide, we provided more detail on the movements in cash and marketable securities in the appendix. But having addressed the key financial highlights of the quarter, on Side 18, you can see a more complete look at our key P&L line item for the first quarter, as compared to the prior year. I won\u2019t cover this page in detail other than to note that important line item such as net-interest expense and our effective tax rate have come in at or favorable to our previous guidance.","Not otherwise mentioned on this slide, each quarter the company examines intangible assets for triggering events in order to identify impairments. And in the first quarter, we recorded an impairment charge of $522 million, or the termination of the ROR gamma T Phase 2 program or psoriasis indication that David discussed earlier.","Turning now to our first quarter performance by reporting segment on Slide 19. The U.S. specialized therapeutics revenue growth was strong at 6.5% and continues to be our highest contribution margin segment. Despite some downward pressure from product mix shift, as discussed earlier related to 2017 acquisitions, contribution margins were generally stable versus prior year at 68.5%.","U.S. General Medicine was the segment most impacted by LOEs, as reflected in its revenue decline of 9% versus prior year. However, contribution margin improved by 350 basis points due to lower sales and marketing spend resulting from restructuring initiatives.","International revenues continue to show robust growth, up 9%, excluding foreign exchange translation, or 17.2% on a reported basis. The contribution margin remaining stable at 53.9% as we continue to invest behind profitable growth that we\u2019re seeing in our international markets.","Turning to Slide 20, our debt leverage position continues to improve. We\u2019re well on our way to executing on our 2018 capital allocation commitments. We ended the quarter with total gross debt of $26.6 billion after retiring $3.75 billion in debt as it matured in the first quarter. We also paid down $372 million of our margin loan. This was all planned for the quarter and executed.","Given the price of our stock during the first quarter, we accelerated into Q1 and completed the $2 billion share buyback that was originally planned to execute later in the year. This opportunistic action required a small draw on the revolver of $500 million, which we plan to repay prior to the end of this fiscal year and potentially as soon as the second quarter.","In total, our activities in reducing debt brought our gross leverage ratio down to 3.2 times as of March 31, in line with our target for the year and the lowest since the Allergan transaction in 2015. We will continue to manage our overall level of debt and key debt ratios in accordance with our commitment to maintaining an investment-grade credit rating.","Moving now to Slide 21 on our updated guidance. Given the favorable developments in our business, which we\u2019ve just reviewed, first quarter results ahead of plan, the performance net income per share benefit of accelerating share buyback and no RESTASIS generic entry in the month of April, we are raising our full-year guidance for both revenues and non-GAAP performance net income per share, as well focusing our guidance and cash flow from operations.","So starting with net revenues, we\u2019re raising our full-year outlook and now expect 2018 net revenues to be between $15.15 billion to $15.35 billion, a $150 million increase at the bottom and $50 million increase at the top of the range, compared to our prior guidance. This increase reflects our assumption of RESTASIS generic entry between May and July of 2018 versus the previously assumed April to July of 2018.","Our updated revenue guidance also reflects the better than expected revenues we realized in the first quarter broadly across the business. Other than a month benefit of RESTASIS to our full-year guidance, the remaining LOE assumptions are unchanged.","We continue to expect non-GAAP gross margins for the full-year to be between 85.5% and 86% based on our product mix and LOE assumptions. As noted in the first quarter financial highlights, stronger than expected first quarter non-GAAP performance net income per share was driven in part by timing of operating expenses, which should reverse over the remainder of 2018.","So therefore, our full-year guidance for non-GAAP SG&A and R&D expenses remains unchanged. We expect our adjusted operating margins in 2018 to be in line with 2017 adjusted operating margins, as our operating expense rightsizing initiatives are mostly implemented, which gives us almost a full-year of impact.","Full-year non-GAAP net interest expense other of approximately $900 million and our full-year non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 14% also remain unchanged versus prior guidance. We now expect average full-year share count to be approximately 345 million shares versus the prior guidance of 350 million shares to reflect completion of the buyback. Because of the updated revenue and share count guidance we now expect full year 2018 non-GAAP performance net income per share to be in the range of $15.65 to $16.25 as compared to the prior guidance of $15.25 to $16.","As we think about scenarios where generic RESTASIS entrance are delayed, we estimate incremental RESTASIS revenues on the order of approximately $80 million per month. Should we foresee that delay being sustained over several months or perhaps even quarters into the future, we will be looking at opportunities to reinvest a portion of these proceeds back into the business and our R&D pipeline. That said, we continue to expect non-GAAP performance net income per share growth in FY 2019 over FY 2017, which will reinforce the statements that we\u2019ve made previous.","We also expect our reported cash flow from operations for 2018 to be approximately $5 billion, which is now focused on the high side of our prior guidance range of $4.7 billion to $5 billion, reflecting, number one, generic RESTASIS entrance between May and July of 2018; two, success based milestones from existing pipeline projects of approximately $600 million in 2018; and three, restructuring and other M&A integration payments in the range of approximately $225 million.","As mentioned last quarter, since this has been unusual year given the timing of generic entry for RESTASIS, we will continue to provide preliminary quarterly guidance on a temporary basis. At some point we will be returning to our standard practice of providing annual guidance which we update quarterly. That said, for the second quarter we expect total reported net revenue to be between $3.85 billion and $4 billion and non-GAAP performance net income per share between $4 and $4.20 per share.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Brent.","Brent Saunders","Great, thank Matt. So against this backdrop of strong business momentum, consistent execution and capital allocation, it is clear that there is a disconnect between our business performance and stock performance. We announced last month a review of strategic actions focused on unlocking shareholder value and frankly there is no better time to do a strategic review than when the underlying business is solid. As such, we are evaluating a range of strategic options in comparison to the business outlook and the inherent value of the company.","We are now well into that process and have multiple financial advisors helping us evaluate the different options. Everything is on the table, but we\u2019ve not reached the end of the assessment. The options we\u2019re looking at can be put into five broad categories. First, deploying capital to aggressively buyback shares; second, divestitures; third; splitting the company; fourth acquisitions or mergers; and fifth, continuing to operate the company more or less as currently configured.","The first option deploying capital to aggressively buyback shares. Since the divestiture of the generics business, Allergan has been an aggressive share repurchaser, we\u2019ve bought back $17 billion of Allergan stock. At the same time we have paid down our debt by approximately $13 billion and have maintained our investment grade credit rating. Despite the robust buyback, the stock disconnect remains, so we do not think that this will be a primary level for us following the strategic review, but it may be worth pursuing incrementally.","The second option is to pursue divestitures. While we like our business as it exists today, we do believe there are strategic and financial merits for a more focused Allergan and are currently evaluating options that would enable us to concentrate more on key therapeutic areas where we have the strongest competitive advantage. Therefore, if economically prodded, we would look to divest certain assets.","The third option, splitting the company is also part of our strategic review. If we pursue this option it will take the longest time to complete and be the most disruptive, but it is on the table for consideration. If our analysis does in fact indicate that such a long-term action would likely result in significant increase in shareholder value then we would certainly consider this option.","The fourth option is doing acquisitions, combinations or merger, the key here is the right strategic fit and financial rationale. Given the current environment, a large combination or merger is an unlikely outcome at this time. However, small full time transactions including product and pipeline acquisitions that could strengthen our key areas of therapeutic focus are on the table, but once again the mandate is right strategy, right asset, right price.","While the Board continues to evaluate the options my preliminary view is that a fundamental shift in the overall business strategy is not necessary, running the company in large part as it exist today is not only an option, but also the baseline against which all options need to be considered.","So in closing, we are continuing to explore the merits of all potential strategic actions and I want to assure you, reassure you that you\u2019re going \u2013 that we are not going to execute any activity that doesn\u2019t recognize the full inherent value of our assets at Allergan. Our number one priority continues to be to deliver value by focusing on executing on our business. We have very strong drivers or organic top line and bottom-line growth and there is a lot of unrealized value creation potential within our existing business.","With that, now let\u2019s open it up for questions. Tuniva?","Question-and-Answer Session","Our first question comes from the line of Ken Cacciatore with Cowen & Company.","Q - Ken Cacciatore","Hi, thanks Brent for the review of the options. Can you give us a sense, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve been talking to some of your shareholders, just a sense of the feedback that there -- that you\u2019re getting as you discuss those options with them? And then just secondly, I\u2019d love to hear from Bill talk about BOTOX migraine performance in the face of some of the CGRP competition that\u2019s coming up, our expectations going into that? Thank you.","Brent Saunders","Yes, thanks Ken. We have as always continued to listen to our shareholders and I would say there\u2019s a lot of different opinions from a variety of different shareholders. I think in the five options that I just outlined, I think that there is some shareholders at least that support each one of those. I think that that in fairness what most shareholders are commenting that I hear from most shareholders is just frustration with the stock performance in light of particularly the business performance and what we hear often is just do something.","And I think that that\u2019s a fair restriction to be vocalized, I think the flip side of it is, we needed to do it very carefully and considerably. We have a great business, we, I think, just proved again this quarter as we did in the fourth quarter, there\u2019s a lot of momentum in this business. We saw some very strong pipeline data readouts so far, we have a lot more to come. And so I think we needed to carefully and thoughtfully consider all options as we move forward. Again everything is on the table, I\u2019ll give you my preliminary view, but the Board is highly engaged, there is a sense of urgency and everybody is looking at everything.","William Meury","Yes, and Ken on CGRPs, listen I don\u2019t underestimate the impact that a new class of medications can have on the migraine space. In this situation I don\u2019t see people switching from BOTOX to CGRPs. To be fair they are not more effective, they are not necessary more convenient and they\u2019re not more economical. I\u2019ve said before I think the diagnosis and treatment rate is going to climb and there are roughly an estimated 2 million to 3 million people with chronic migraine, there is only a couple 100,000 on BOTOX. The launch of the CGRPs is going to increase the pool of patients being treated and remember only 50% of people are going to respond to a CGRP. And so I believe that BOTOX and the CGRPs can and will coexist.","And I think the fact that we also have Ubrogepant, which is not for chronic migraine, but is for acute migraine is going to give us an advantage in talking to both neurologists and primary care physicians about migraine are two products. So I think the outlook for the growth rate of BOTOX is positive. Even if there is a moderation in growth in the first several quarters on the migraine piece, there are two other parts of BOTOX that are large and also growing and that\u2019s of course we expect to see these orders in overactive bladder. And so I think the picture for the next several years looks very, very good.","Brent Saunders","Great, next question please.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of David Maris with Wells Fargo.","David Maris","Good morning. Two questions. First, on the filler business. Can you talk a little bit about what\u2019s driving the growth, but also what\u2019s the next-generation products are? Is that just to maintain growth, or does that expand the market? And then separately, David, on the ROR gamma product that was killed this quarter, that was the main purpose of the Vitae acquisition.","So what do you think went wrong in the initial assessment? And do you think that\u2019s reflective of the challenge of the open science approach, and what will you do differently going forward because of that? Thank you.","Brent Saunders","Yes. So thanks, David. I would just say a couple of quick things and I\u2019ll turn it over to Bill and David. I think on filler, we have the world\u2019s leading family of portfolio fillers under the JUV\u00c9DERM family branding. It\u2019s something that I think gets overlooked often. I think, Bill said in his prepared remarks in Europe that the filler \u2013 the JUV\u00c9DERM family now rivals BOTOX in size and frankly, a faster growth rate.","As we bring more product flow into the U.S., Bill and I were both at a Plastic Surgery Aesthetic meeting this weekend. What they\u2019re doing with our filler, the JUV\u00c9DERM family is nothing short of just spectacular. In fact, many of the plastic surgeons are telling me that it\u2019s really their first option versus a face weapon. And they said, something they\u2019d never thought they would say as, when a surgeon tells you, you don\u2019t need a facelift and we get affected with filler, then you really don\u2019t need a facelift, because surgeons generally first instinct is to cut.","So I think that that\u2019s something and, of course, we are going to continue to invest. In fact, we\u2019re looking at significant investment in our manufacturing footprint over time to meet the growing demand of volume. Quickly on ROR gamma T and David will provide more detail. I think, the challenge \u2013 I would just say broadly, it\u2019s not unique to open science.","I think, it\u2019s just a science challenge that sometimes whether it\u2019s an internally-derived program or an extremely-derived program, frankly, I think is irrelevant to whether or not it is going to be successful. I think, our success record is better than those that rely solely on internal. But David will provide some more color in a second. So fillers, Bill, you want to add some commentary?","William Meury","Yes. David, listen, we often talk about BOTOX being the gateway to our aesthetics business. I could tell you in the future at some point, JUV\u00c9DERM will become a gateway. The business is growing at a double-digit rate in the U.S. and it\u2019s near 20% internationally. I think it\u2019s at an inflection point with the rest of the market.","Growth is coming from three different areas. First, softening lines is being replaced with volumizing and shaping and skin quality. Third \u2013 second, there\u2019s more volume per procedure as injectors get more experience with fillers. And then as it relates to new fillers, I think, the next frontier for fillers will be the lower phase, which the jawline, the chin among other areas.","And so this is a great business. And we have, at least, three new fillers in development next-generation fillers, two of them are part of our Vycross collection. And then, of course, we announced the deal with Elastagen, where we\u2019re going to combine hyaluronic acid with elastin. And the way plastics and derms think about it is that it\u2019s equivalent to a paint brush for an artist. And some of these fillers are larger, some last longer, some are smoother. And so our job is just to continue to innovate and introduce new products, which is why this business has continued to grow at such a high rate over the past several years.","I think, some people forget that in 2017, we introduced three novel fillers in the United States and internationally. And so the outlook is very good.","Brent Saunders","David?","David Nicholson","Yes, thanks. Hey, just a quick comment on filler. From an R&D perspective, before I move on to ROR gamma T. We\u2019re really excited about the Elastagen acquisition. Over the last few years, of course, we\u2019ve been replacing hyaluronic acid in the subdermal compartment. And now we have the possibility to add back not only hyaluronic acid, but also elastin as a whole new filler line to increase, not only elasticity of the skin, but skin quality and there\u2019s a lot of very exciting science. So we\u2019ll be doing internally, but also with our external collaborators over the next few years.","Talking about ROR gamma T and \u2013 in relation perhaps the open science model, we moved the lead compound interface to be trials. What we saw was safety concerns at different doses of the compound. So we did the right thing. We killed early and we kill fast and we didn\u2019t try to flee forward with that compound.","Now ROR gamma T remains a very exciting target for drug discovery. We \u2013 several companies are also pursuing ROR gamma T. It sits at the confluence of the IL-17, IL-23 pathways, which is so important in autoimmune disorders. So I remain confident in ROR gamma T as a target for drug discovery and development and we are pursuing alternative formulations.","In addition, I remain confident in the quality of the R&D team here are Allergan and our ability to assess the quality of external opportunities. So, as you know, I remain a big fan of open science. I know that many companies are still in the pipeline through acquisitions. We all know that majority of blockbuster drugs are sold by companies that didn\u2019t do the original discovery. And I say, open science is the the way forward for the future. We need to build our business development deals accordingly.","Brent Saunders","Next question?","David Maris","Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Liav Abraham with Citi.","Liav Abraham","Good morning. A couple of questions. Firstly, Brent, what is the timeline for the strategic review to be completed? And when can we expect to receive your final thoughts on this?","And then secondly, regarding your BOTOX franchise. I\u2019d be interested in any color you can provide on additional talks and assets you have in your pipeline? And when we could get additional details on these, either additional indications for BOTOX that you alluded to in your prepared remarks on botulinum toxin formulations.? Thank you.","Brent Saunders","Sure. Thanks, Liav. So with regards to the strategic process, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we\u2019re deep into the process. We obviously provide an update in this call in terms of the range of options that we\u2019re considering and my initial preliminary view on each of those.","What I would say, this is our ongoing process. Our Board is deeply engaged. We have multiple strategic advisors working with us, and I\u2019m very committed to giving you an update as we continue to proceed. But I would point out that that since the beginning for me, when I started at Forest, we have always stayed focused with our Board working on strategic initiatives.","We have continuously looked for ways to not only simplify our business, whether that be selling our respiratory business; whether that be selling our contract manufacturing; and frankly, selling our generics business to stay more focused on innovation and the core therapeutic areas. And remember, our strategy has always been to be leaders in the therapeutic areas. We are committed to and that means leaders commercially, as well as in innovation.","And if we believe we can do that then we believe we\u2019re the right owners of that business. But I will update you as time goes, if there are any changes. David, you want to talk about BOTOX in the pipeline?","David Nicholson","Sure, happy to do that. Thanks for the question. As I hope everyone understands, we have probably what is the largest R&D effort in toxins. We have, Liav, later-stage projects three in therapeutics that \u2013 and that\u2019s our depression effort, our effort in allergic rhinitis under the atrial fibrillation. And two, in aesthetics, that\u2019s in in masseter and platysma. And we\u2019ve got several toxins to choose from as we enter Phase 3 with these indications.","We have different formulations in development. Obviously, we\u2019ve got a large R&D effort evaluating among other things, duration of action and we\u2019ve already demonstrated different durations effect with BOTOX in different indications. And we\u2019ll continue to update you as we identify our findings and the data in this area.","Brent Saunders","Thanks, Liav. Tuniva, next question.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse.","Vamil Divan","Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions. So I guess, two. Both of these, I think, are for Bill. Just one around, ESMYA, given some of the safety concerns, I know, we got the update on when we\u2019ll hear from the regulators. But how do you think about the commercial outlook for that product both in Europe and the U.S. just given some of these concerns that have been raised?","And then second, I think, I heard you say that Allergan will be the only company who will offer physicians and patients both in acute and preventive care therapy for migraine. And I was just curious, because Lilly also will have agents in both sides. I\u2019m just curious how you think about those assets or was there some reason you didn\u2019t include those in your comments, unless I misheard what you said? Thanks.","William Meury","Yes, thanks, Vamil. Obviously, David provided an update on ESMYA. But we do remain focused on trying to work with both PRAC and Gedeon Richter, as well as the U.S. FDA to bring this therapy to the women, who frankly really do deserve innovation around this condition.","David Nicholson","Yes, and just I would the only thing I\u2019d add to ESMYA as we have to wait and see what the label looks like, of course. It\u2019s impossible right now to speculate about how that may impact how we position the product and how it\u2019s used.","I will tell you that it\u2019s got an acceptable benefit risk ratio even if there is some guidance as it relates to safety. This is one of the most common conditions women diagnosed \u2013 OB\/GYNs rather diagnosed and treat. There are no proof therapies. You saw the efficacy rates in both our U.S. and international studies with amenorrhea between 16%, 80%, it\u2019s incredibly for some women debilitating condition. And so it\u2019s got significant potential assuming we have a reasonable benefit risk profile to share with physicians. I think we\u2019d have to wait and see how the FDA views it and we\u2019ll know in several months.","And then as it relates to CGRPs, I guess, I should have said, we\u2019re one of two companies that have both an acute and a prevention treatment. I\u2019m aware of lasmiditan from Lily and their CGRP, which is fine. I don\u2019t think about this as in terms of a battle between, to be fair, between Allergan and Biohaven on the acute side or between Allergan and other \u2013 any other company on the chronic side.","We\u2019ve been in this space for now six or seven years. We have \u2013 because of our buy-and-build product, we have incredible relationships with neurologists. We\u2019re an incumbent. I do think we have a competitive advantage, that\u2019s not to say that the other companies and the other products are not going to be important treatments, too, but we have a great opportunity as it relates to migraine. So I\u2019ll just, I\u2019ll change my wording to one off.","Vamil Divan","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Brent Saunders","Thanks Vamil.","Vamil Divan","Thanks.","Brent Saunders","Tuniva, next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Tsao with Barclays.","Douglas Tsao","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just, David, I think you referenced a number of different formulations for BOTOX. I was just curious when you feel like the company will be in better position to provide a little bit more color in terms of what those are in sort of the full sort of pipeline of opportunities in the toxin space?","Brent Saunders","Yes, Doug, it\u2019s Brent, I\u2019ll just answer the question. We\u2019re, as David said, we are the largest R&D shop when it comes to neurotoxins. We are absolutely committed to the space. We will lead the innovation in this category, and we\u2019re planning both an R&D Day and a Medical Aesthetics Day in the fall. And I suspect between the two, you\u2019ll get a very robust update so in this fall.","Douglas Tsao","Okay.","Brent Saunders","Yes.","Douglas Tsao","And then just maybe a follow-up and just maybe if you could give a little bit of a sort of your perspective, Brent, on the state of the Eye Care business, especially given the LOE of RESTASIS, LUMIGAN is a little bit more of a mature asset. I know, you\u2019ve got the SR product in development. But just how core do you see that right now for the business? And do you see a need for additional assets in the pipeline?","Brent Saunders","Yes. So the Eye Care business remains a very important and strategic business for us. Put RESTASIS completely out, we still have essentially a $2 billion Global Eye Care business. I think, what you saw is the growth drivers are coming from products like OZURDEX, which continues to do very well, up about 13% in the quarter and very strong globally as well.","When we look at what\u2019s coming, clearly, we have abicipar, which could be a game changer if successful. But we have a bimatoprost SR, we have bimatoprost ring. So, I know we think about glaucoma is a relatively stable franchise. But the reality is that paradigm should shift to drop us therapy. And we will have, not just an implant, we will have drops, we\u2019ll have an implant and we\u2019ll have a ring. And I think, we\u2019re going to be able to offer the ophthalmologist and glaucoma specialists. And maybe even the optometrists in the U.S., the best choice is to treat this disease for patients.","So we\u2019re strongly committed to it, and I think you\u2019ll see our R&D kind of move more towards. Right now, we have the Editas collaboration in gene therapy. We have our own gene therapy programs in early-stage development. So this is one of the strongest parts of Allergan. So absolutely committed.","Douglas Tsao","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Brent Saunders","Yes. Next question Tuniva?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Marc Goodman with UBS.","Marc Goodman","Good morning, Brent. I guess two questions here. First big picture strategy. Just to confirm, you mentioned no big deals are on the table and I was just wondering. Help us explain the noise with the Shire about a week ago and whether that falls into the no big deals or \u2013 the no big deal comment is really after that. We took a look, we\u2019re not interested and, in fact, we\u2019ve decided we\u2019re not going to do a big deal. Just curious how that all plays?","And then when you talked about the small bolt-ons, are you referring to bolt-ons to verticals that you\u2019re in already? Can you talk about some of the verticals that you\u2019re 100% committed to? And would you consider swapping out some of these verticals for other verticals? I was curious how you thought about that?","And then the second question is just about outside of the United States, can you give us a flavor some of the regions growth profiles what\u2019s going on? What are some of the new products that will be launching in some new regions, so we can expect instead of just modeling a byproduct that maybe also by region a little bit to know where a lot of the growth is coming from? Thanks.","Brent Saunders","Yes. Thanks, Marc. Excellent question. So with respect to large transformational M&A, I said it \u2013 I said in my prepared remarks that it\u2019s not a priority for me. But I don\u2019t think you can ever absolutely rule out any option, because where we \u2013 we work in a very dynamic healthcare environment. And I think, we always need to maintain flexibility, if we perceive that there is a strong strategic and financial rationale to do something.","So in the context of evaluating our full-range of options here, and as I mentioned, engaging in a transfer \u2013 transformational or large acquisition was never a top priority. But because Takeda put Shire in play, we felt we had an obligation to at least do a cursory review and look to see if there was a probability that we could create value for shareholders.","We did that. It was leaked, as you saw in the press, and we were forced within minutes to make a presets disclosure as required by the UK takeover panel. But to be clear, we work very quickly with the takeover panel in the UK to clarify that and we are not going to make an offer for Shire.","So that was something that was unfortunately got played out in the press. We don\u2019t like to have things play out in the press, but it happens from time to time. But to be clear, it was a cursory review. We didn\u2019t take a lot of time. Our business development teams are always active.","And I would just end with, it is SOP for us at Allergan to look at every company that\u2019s in play, whether or not we even think there\u2019s a remote possibility to do it. It\u2019s much like you guys look or your customers looking at stocks they don\u2019t buy. We have to look at other things to make us smarter about the things we want to buy and that\u2019s what happened here.","With respect to verticals, we are absolutely committed to the big four Medical Aesthetics, Eye Care, CNS and GI. We have a strong view of our \u2013 both our women\u2019s health and anti-infectives business, but they are less strategically important just given the innovation cycle and the U.S. focus of those predominantly U.S. focused and, of course, our pipeline in those businesses.","But they\u2019re good businesses. They are profitable business. They will have growth in those businesses. And so whatever we do with them, we have to make sure that we are serving the long-term shareholders in an economically strong and viable manner. And so we are there. I think, in terms of bolt-ons, I think, you\u2019ll see us generally focusing like we have in the past on the areas where we follow our strategy, which is to create market leadership positions in each of our therapeutic areas.","So we haven\u2019t done any bolt-ons in awhile. But where you have seen them recently is Medical Aesthetics. We\u2019re the clear global leader. LifeCell and ZELTIQ were both, I think, again, too early to bring to a conclusion this statement. But clearly, in the first year, we\u2019re feeling very good about those, both strategically and financially exceeding expectations. I think, if we could provide things in Eye Care that made both strategic and financial sense, that would be a hard area for us in GI and CNS equally so. So those are the four we tend to focus on. Outside the U.S., I\u2019ll turn it over to Bill.","William Meury","Yes, Marc, listen, as you know, it\u2019s about a $3.5 billion business growing at plus 10%. When you think about it regionally in the following order Asia Pacific plus 20% in the first quarter, Latin America, Canada plus 14% in the first quarter, and then Europe was just under 10%. Flagship products that are especially strong.","JUV\u00c9DERM, as I mentioned, especially in Asia Pacific, Middle East Africa, which are both investment regions for Allergan. I mean, this whole story is an investment story. We\u2019ve been adding commercial personnel virtually all over the world, but especially in emerging markets, OZURDEX and Eye Care, it\u2019s extremely strong. And as Brent mentioned, our glaucoma business unlike in the United States, which is off versus prior year, is up versus prior year internationally. And I think, Latin America, Canada and Asia Pacific, when we think about the next three to five years have pretty significant growth prospects.","Brent Saunders","Thanks, Marc. Tuniva, next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank.","Gregg Gilbert","Thanks. Good morning. Brent, first on the decision to conduct a strategic review. Is that tied solely to the stock performance disconnect, or are there some things operationally that contribute that you\u2019ve learned in the past couple of years? So in other words, are you doing this only because of the stock underperformance?","And then, David, two quick ones on rapastinel. Can you share your thoughts on how your product is similar and different to J&J\u2019s approach since we\u2019ll see their news first? And on abicipar, can you clarify what formulation you plan to file and when? Thanks.","Brent Saunders","Yes. So, Gregg, just to be clear on the strategic review, it was instigated almost completely because of the disconnect between our performance and our stock price. And I understand why the wall of worry has been built around our company. But I think we continue to show quarter-after-quarter that we have a strong robust and durable core business. And I think, that\u2019s what ultimately will prove it out is actual performance and there\u2019s no better way to do it.","That being said, we\u2019re always doing strategic review. It is something that is part of my mandate and clearly, part of the Board\u2019s mandate to always think strategically about our business and how to create value for shareholders. What\u2019s different here is just the intensity of the review. And the fact that we have multiple outside advisors actively engaged across a wide range of the options. That\u2019s what makes this review, I guess, in sense different than the normal course or continuous strategic review that we do.","And ultimately, as I said, I think our strategy is sound. I think focusing on weeding in our therapeutic areas with both commercial capabilities and innovation is a winning strategy for Allergan. But given the stock performance, I had to say am I right or am I wrong, right? I \u2013 you can\u2019t keep drinking your own Kool-Aid and expecting a different result. And so I think it\u2019s fair to have outsiders and a wider group of Board members engaged and seeing what I see every day and making their own assessment and having that give and take back and forth with them.","And so I\u2019m anxious to learn. I\u2019m always open to learning new ideas. And the good news here is, our shareholders have been very open with their thoughts. So we\u2019ve gotten a very broad and complete \u2013 almost complete perspective from a lot of different shareholders and that\u2019s being incorporated into the review as well. And at the end, hopefully, we\u2019ll come out of this a much stronger and better Allergan with a great strategy.","So I think we\u2019re there today. But look, we can always improve and we can always learn something new. I\u2019ll turn over to David to talk about rapastinel and abicipar, and then if there\u2019s anything else, I can add I will also. David?","David Nicholson","Yes, thanks. So first of all rapastinel comparison to J&J. Clearly, J&J is developing one of the enantiomers of ketamine. We now have convincing data that ketamine is a fast acting antidepressant albeit with many psychosomatic like side effects. Rapastinel share some of the pharmacology of ketamine. In that, it modulates the MNDA \u2013 the glutamates MNDA receptor, but it does it in a different manner.","Ketamine is a channel blocker. Rapastinel is a weak partial agonist. I\u2019ll spare the details of why we see the same \u2013 some of the same pharmacology with a partial agonist with the channel blocker. But we do have unifying pharmacological hypotheses of why rapastinel has rapid acting antidepressant activity like ketamine, which we saw with rapastinel in Phase 2 studies that lacks many of the side effects.","For instance, at least, in animal models, rapastinel will actually attenuate the negative effects of ketamine on cognition. So rapastinel, do we get readthroughs from ketamine and esketamine data partly? Because we anticipate they both have rapid acting antidepressant activity, but rapastinel clearly has a different side effect profile, a much more benign side effect profile in ketamine.","Brent Saunders","If I could, I would just add. I think, Gregg, it\u2019s important here given the focus on controlled substances and the like that if we prove it in the Phase 3 study, that side effect profile could be a considerable way to distinguish our program from the ketamine\u2019s.","Gregg Gilbert","All right.","David Nicholson","And we do have a large program. We\u2019re looking at rapastinel in treatment depression \u2013 treatment resistant depression, as well as a monotherapy and we\u2019ve got a suicidality study, which started recruiting in December last year.","Regarding abicipar, clearly, we\u2019ll get the \u2013 as we mentioned, the data from our Phase 3 studies in the second-half of this year and our expectation is to file with those data and with the existing formulation. As I believe many people are aware, we are working on new formulations of abicipar and we will initiate a clinical study in AMD with a new formulation, where we have removed all wholesale proteins that we can see based on the present purification and analytical techniques. We will start that additional clinical study in the first-half of this year. And when appropriate, we will file a subsequent licensing variation for that formulation.","Brent Saunders","And if I could, I would just add some context on abicipar, Gregg. As you remember, when we acquired Allergan, there was, I think, some controversy of whether or not we should move abicipar into Phase 3. Even though we like the duration and efficacy from the Phase 2 data, there was concern about inflammation rates seen in those Phase 2 studies.","And so we undertook, I think, I called it a free option at the time. But we undertook and David\u2019s team to really understand how to develop large proteins for the back of the eye. We\u2019ve looked at the competitive programs, as well as our own capabilities.","And what David essentially said to me was \u2013 I\u2019ll oversimplify it is that, look, what the others have done here is continue to refine their formulation to ultimately cleanse it of extraneous proteins and protein aggregation, we would need to develop analytic methods and then ultimately apply those to a new formulation. But I think our team, particular guys in Liverpool can do this work.","And so we made the decision to proceed with the Phase 3. I\u2019m glad we did it and we will get the data soon. And what I\u2019m looking for there is efficacy and duration of effect, because ultimately, we won\u2019t understand the information rates till David finishes that he will initiate within the next month or so with the superclean formulation.","I think that this is not too different from how both Eylea and I think was sent to certainly, were developed this way. If I could do it all over again, I\u2019d like to go back before I owned Allergan and began the purification of the formulation, year before we acquired it, but that was the hand we had.","And I think, to be fair, I\u2019m just incredibly proud of our R&D colleagues for playing catch up and getting us to a point, where I think we can see a convergence of these data to get potentially a win for patients and extend the duration of effect of these medicines And frankly, this is a very aggravating procedure for both the retina specialist and especially for the patients. So if we can ease that burden here by having an extra long duration with a nice risk benefit profile, that would be a homerun for Allergan for patients and for retina specialists.","Gregg Gilbert","Thanks.","Brent Saunders","So moving \u2013 oops, sorry for the longwinded answer, Gregg. Tuniva, you want to move on?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger","Thanks very much, I have two questions please. First, could you talk a little bit about ESMYA in Canada and specifically where a Canadian review stands on the drug safety, if they are conducting one, I haven\u2019t seen a label update, but I don\u2019t know where things stand in Canada.","And then second, David, could you speak to atogepant, specifically what your expectations are and the timing for the Phase 2b results? Thank you.","Brent Saunders","So David you want to talk about ESMYA in Canada and\u2026?","David Nicholson","Sure, yes, happy to do that. We\u2019re working closely with all regulatory authorities about Ulipristal ESMYA and that obviously includes Health Canada. The situation at the moment with Health Canada is that before starting patients on FIBRISTAL which is the ESMYA in Canada. There should be a discussion and evaluation of the benefits and risks associated with the medication and that patients shouldn\u2019t be treated with FIBRISTAL if there is a concomitant hepatic disease and that we advice is to monitor liver function at least once a month during treatment and in addition a couple of weeks after completion of treatment.","So I think that the post-marketing language in the Canadian label reads during post-marketing experience rare cases of liver injury including isolated cases of severe liver impairment requiring liver transplantation were reported, so that\u2019s basically the situation at the moment in Canada. The agent remains on the market with what we consider to be very appropriate information about liver safety.","William Meury","And David this is Bill Meury, I\u2019ve had a number of different conversations with physicians in the United States, but also namely in Canada where ESMYA as you know is available and their viewpoint is the level of the frequency with which testing may be required is important here. And as you know there are a number of different classes of medications where there is guidance to monitor a liver function, I think statins are a good example.","As long as the level of frequency of monitoring is manageable and it\u2019s important and want to minimize the importance of doing it, but as long as it\u2019s manageable my sense from most OB\/GYN\u2019s who I have spoken with is it\u2019s not going to dramatically change how they use the drug and we\u2019re just going have to wait and see what the results from the FDA review are and David and his team are working on that, and hard to speculate at this point, but there is certainly a path forward here if ultimately after review of the data, the regulators are reassured by the benefit risk profile of ESMYA.","Brent Saunders","Hey David, sorry could you just remind me your precise atogepant question?","David Risinger","Yes, well, actually just wanted to follow-up on those comments, so I should\u2019ve asked as well on ESMYA, so when did that label change occur that required monthly liver monitoring and is it correct that Europe or EMEA will make a decision in May. Then separately that question on atogepant, just wanted to get your updated commentary on that candidate and the timing for Phase 2 data.","Brent Saunders","Okay so for atogepant the Phase 2 data will be on schedule for the second half of this year, yes. Regarding the FIBRISTAL update on the labeling, that happened, we\u2019ve been interacting with the Canadian authorities like we\u2019ve been interacting with all health authorities over the last few months and the label change was in the early part of this year, late last year when we were talking to them. And regarding news in Europe, we expect the PRAC to come with a report in May as we\u2019ve mentioned previously I think remain on track, yeah.","David Risinger","Okay and then I\u2019m sorry one more, and thank you for your time. So on atogepant, I thought that the Phase 2b completed, I believe it was the end of March, March 28, so why won\u2019t we see a top line sooner than the second half?","David Nicholson","Yeah, so maybe I\u2019m giving myself a little bit more time then than we needed. We are absolutely on track and the data, the top line has always been forecast right in the middle of the year, and we did say the first half previously, it\u2019s right in the middle of the year absolutely, yeah.","Brent Saunders","To be right on the quarter.","David Nicholson","There is absolutely no delay in the top line, yeah. Sorry for that confusion.","David Risinger","Okay, thank you.","Brent Saunders","Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein.","Ronny Gal","Hello Good morning and congratulations on the nice start for the year. I have two questions, first one is around business buying patterns by the pharmacies. I think you\u2019ve mentioned that RESTASIS had a bit of a buying in the fourth quarter that will be stocked in the fourth. Is this a broad phenomena we\u2019ve seen with some other companies, pharmacies are now anticipating company\u2019s embracing prices and buying into the quarter and if so when does it happen?","And second to Matt, obviously welcome aboard. Sanofi noted on their quarterly call that they expect a 1% hit on revenue from their Medicare gap rule that that\u2019s raising the pharma industry responsibility to 70%. You also have a large kind of primary care business in United States, do you anticipate a similar hit in 2019 from the Medicare gap closing or is this not something worth of a commentary? Thank you.","Brent Saunders","So, Meury you want to take the first one?","William Meury","Yes, Ronny, on buying patterns I don\u2019t think I see anything significantly different this year than in previous years. We have a policy as it relates to our buying with wholesalers and we try to maintain inventory levels at three to four weeks. First quarter prescription fill rates of course can be impacted by our health plan coverage dynamics, but no dramatic change in terms of buying patterns, we have are pretty consistent stream from quarter to quarter.","I will say with RESTASIS, as you know, we\u2019re managing inventory levels in anticipation of an LOE and keeping demand, prescription demand and factory sales as tight as possible which is what we want to do to minimize any returns if and when a generic RESTASIS is introduced, that\u2019s largely the disconnect you saw this quarter given the demand versus factory sales gap.","Brent Saunders","And so Matt, you want to answer the second part?","Matt Walsh","Yes, Ronny thank you for your welcome to the company. No, we don\u2019t see a significant increase in our operating expenses because of Medicare Part D. Our operating expenses both for the first quarter and for the full year will really be characterized by the success of their restructuring efforts. And to the extent that pharmacies come in really it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re seeing lower pharma fees related to chirrups from last year as well as what our estimate is for this year.","Brent Saunders","Thanks Ronny. Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Christopher Schott","Great, thanks very much for the questions. The first one is for Brent on strategic options. If you were to more narrowly focus the company, just elaborate a little bit more on the pros and cons of divestitures versus split, is there a bias of one versus the other as you go through this process if in fact which direction you go?","And the second question maybe for Bill or for Brent, can you talk a little bit more about the incremental opportunity from VRAYLAR in bipolar and how you see that product positioning in that segment of the market? Thanks very much.","Brent Saunders","Sure, thanks Chris. So on the first one, look I think as I said earlier, everything is on the table, I gave you my preliminary and current view of our options, but we have more work to be done and we\u2019ll see how it plays out over the next few months. And I\u2019ll provide an update likely on our next call or if something happens earlier.","I think the key with divestitures is, it has to make strategic sense and it has to make financial sense. But one thing, we won\u2019t do is a garage sale of important assets. And look, in our industry, there are many companies out there paying big premiums for sales growth and earnings growth and right now selling any assets in the categories that are being discussed for sale are dilutive. And so we should just be clear about that.","I\u2019ve heard the argument about focus. I think our management team is focused. I think we\u2019ve proven that again, this quarter when you look at our key therapeutic areas and the growth rates in those areas and the growth around a lot of the new product launches. And I don\u2019t view anything that we have in our current portfolio as a distraction.","But that being said, if there\u2019s a way to create economic value for our shareholders and that value can be deployed in something that creates even more value then you do it. And we\u2019ve never been shy to do it in the past. If we believe in and have conviction around it and it makes again strategic and financial sense. But you don\u2019t do it just because the stock isn\u2019t working for a couple of quarters. And so we just have to \u2013 we have to do what\u2019s right economically for the company and that\u2019s something we\u2019re always committed to doing. It\u2019s not unique to this strategic review. Bill, you want to talk about \u2013 you got to \u2013 yes.","William Meury","In terms of bipolar depression, I think, the incremental sales from the indication could approach the current sales level of VRAYLAR today. There\u2019s only two agents on the market, Seroquel and Latuda, that have indications for bipolar depression.","If you take a look at our studies, VRAYLAR produced a 50% reduction on the MADRS. The placebo adjusted numbers are right in line with those two agents. The sales for Seroquel, which was the first product for \u2013 approved for bipolar at branded pricing for the indication are roughly $5 billion to $6 billion.","If you look at sales for Latuda, which was the second product approved for bipolar depression, it\u2019s probably in the range of $1 billion. It\u2019s a great indication for us to get if you talk to psychs. It\u2019s a tough condition to manage only two agents on the market. And so it\u2019s a sales multiplier for VRAYLAR. If we get it approved, then we successfully launch it.","Brent Saunders","Right. Thanks, Chris. Next question, Tuniva.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore.","Umer Raffat","Thank you so much for taking my questions. David, a couple for you and one for you \u2013 one follow-up for you Brent. David, the DARPin Phase 3 measures your primary endpoint four weeks after the last dose. So theoretically, both the every 8-arm and every 12-week arm should work, because the primary endpoints measured four weeks after the last dose. Am I thinking about it right or is there something you want to expand on there, one?","And the second one, David, what specifically triggered that $75 million milestone on the Chase\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s molecule? I know, you were going to enter Phase 3 in 2017. It was delayed, so curious what triggered that?","And then finally, Brent, thank you for the color on the strategic review. And you mentioned you did a cursory review as SOP, but didn\u2019t make any offer on Shire as you guys press released as well. But just there was so much investor speculation on this topic, I\u2019m curious did you guys ever approach Shire, or is that not something you\u2019re willing discuss? Thank you.","Brent Saunders","Yes. So maybe let me just make a couple of quick opening comments. On the Shire point, I don\u2019t want to get bogged down in a lot of detail. But as I mentioned, it was a cursory review. We did not do any diligence. We only did public company diligence and we had just our business development team more or less doing it as a matter protocol.","So I think, it was perhaps overstated in the media in terms of the amount of effort that was involved on our end and you should just know as a matter of SOP. We look at everything all the time. We have an active business development group, that\u2019s their job. That\u2019s what they do when they wake up and go to bed and at night. And so I wouldn\u2019t get too caught up on what everybody read. It wasn\u2019t a distracting initiative inside of the company.","Frankly, the only thing was distracting was the media and the shareholders\u2019 speculation around it. I think, with respect, I would just say to Chase and then I\u2019ll turn it over to David. As you know, every \u2013 almost every R&D deal we do, we try to use structure to mitigate risk and we try to have success-based payments instead of big upfronts. And that certainly is the case with Chase.","There was data that was required to be generated in order to make the next payment that data was completed successfully and that\u2019s what triggered the payment. Perhaps, David could talk about both the abicipar question, as well as anything else he wants to add on Chase.","David Nicholson","Sure. Thanks, Brent. Yes, Umer, so look, the DARPin Phase 2 studies looked at the efficacy four weeks after the last dose. You\u2019re absolutely correct. Regardless of what intervals the abicipar, the DARPin was actually administered. The Phase 3 design is different and we are looking at efficacy every eight weeks and every 12 weeks, as well a secondary endpoints such as things like what proportion of patients we see benefit when the drug is administered every 12 weeks.","Regarding Chase what has been mentioned huge efforts in the industry to look at these modifying agent beta amyloids in more recent tau data. Unfortunately, so far none of those approaches have been successful. Hopefully, they will be in the future.","Regardless of whether they\u2019re successful or not, we\u2019re still going to need symptomatic drugs, because the disease modifying agents unfortunately will probably only slow disease progression. So we need symptomatic treatment now. We\u2019ll need symptomatic treatment in the future.","As a leader in the field of symptomatic improvement, it\u2019s \u2013 we want to continue to work in the area. We have the deal with Sosei-Heptares looking at M1 agonist specifically to improve cognition, as well as M4 agonist to look at other symptoms associated with Alzheimer\u2019s, because obviously, Alzheimer\u2019s is not only a problem of learning and memory.","In addition, we\u2019ve got the donepezil-solifenacin deal with Chase, where as long as there is some presynaptic cholinergic innovation, we want to enhance that deteriorating inputs by slowing the breakdown of cholinesterase in a synaptic cleft.","And what we want to do is to take out the peripheral side effects with solifenacin to allow us to reduce peripheral side effects on normal doses of donepezil, while potentially also increasing the dose of donepezil to get even greater central effects. So symptomatic improvement is one of our core areas of R&D within Allergan.","Brent Saunders","Great. So we\u2019ll take one last question, Tuniva.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Jason Gerberry with Bank of America.","Jason Gerberry","Oh, great. Thanks for squeeze me in. Brent, just on the strategic review, just kind of curious, I realized the fluid process. But when you kind of came to your preliminary assessment that a more meaningful split wasn\u2019t the best option. I\u2019m just kind of curious how much meaningful this synergy is with the splits kind of factored into that?","As I look at it, Eye Care business seemingly has some synergy with the BOTOX business. And that seems like you guys like your CNS pipeline too much to part ways, and thus, it would be kind of hard to exit primary care that would be a challenge, I think, to kind of splitting some of the bigger units apart?","And then just second question for Bill. Can you elaborate on the ex-U.S. strategy for Coolsculpting. I know, the prior owner, I think, used the distribution model more heavily. So assuming you\u2019re fully resourced in the second-half, how should we think about ex-U.S. growth of Coolsculpting? Thanks.","Brent Saunders","Yes. So, Jason, thanks for the questions. With respect to splitting the company that that is not off the table. I just gave you my preliminary view. Our Board and advisors are still working and modeling and debating that type of option. I do think it is a option that requires the most time to execute, as well as probably the most difficult in terms of doing it.","That being said, no one should walk away from this that Allergan management wouldn\u2019t undertake and exercise that is either difficult or time-consuming if it were the right thing to do for shareholders. We\u2019ve done it in the past. I think, selling our generics business and breaking out the chassis of this business was frankly, probably more difficult operationally to execute than frankly, it would be to split the company.","Splitting the company comes with its own unique set of difficulties, including audit \u2013 the requirements for audited financial statements trying to understand how to position our bondholders would be a key criteria. We do have investment-grade ratings. I think, separating the companies is quite complex. There are complex tax consequences as well.","And you mentioned, Jason, the synergistic effect that we have from our current business model. And the fact that, just simply drugs like BOTOX cross over both from the therapeutic side and the cash pay side. And it would be, I think, a very big error to take a flagship brand like BOTOX and break it in part. That would \u2013 history has shown that when that happens, brand strength deteriorates. There are a lot of other issues that go into it, but I\u2019m not going to spend a lot more time listening through it.","That being said, if, ultimately, we believe there is a path to significant value creation. We would do the work. It would never intimidate us to do the work. Bill, you want to talk quickly about the second part of the question?","William Meury","Hey, Jason, in terms of our strategy for CoolSculpting internationally, we\u2019re in the process of restructuring the distribution model in most markets from third-party distributors to a direct model, which is, of course, how we manage it in the United States. We want CoolSculpting to be a gateway to the rest of the aesthetics business. And so we\u2019ll manage it differently than ZELTIQ has. That process will take a couple of more quarters and you should start to see fairly solid sales growth performance in the second-half of the year.","Brent Saunders","Yes. I would add, Bill and I have traveled extensively around the world over the last couple of quarters, and the markets are excited to get CoolSculpting from the distributors. But exiting from distributors and them starting up your own direct activity has to be done very carefully. If you break a lot of customer relationships or flood the market with inventory, that\u2019s a poor way to separate or divorce from your distributors.","So we\u2019re doing it in a thoughtful way. Marc Princen, who works for Bill, is doing a great job with his leadership team and getting ready to take those markets over and we\u2019re excited for the future.","Brent Saunders","So let me just close by saying, again, obviously, we\u2019ll continue to update you on any strategic outcome that we come from this review. But really, our priority is on continuing to drive sales and earnings growth and advancing our pipeline.","I think, we had a strong end to last year. We started this year off in a good place and we have a lot of work left to do. But our team is up for the challenge. We\u2019re energized and more focused. So we look forward to keeping updated and thank you for the time.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect."],"1221":["Allergan, Inc.

Following today\u2019s presentation there will be a formal question and answer session. (Operator Instructions) Until then all lines will remain on a listen-only mode. At the request of the company today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections please disconnect at this time. I would like to introduce today\u2019s host Ms. Joann Bradley, Senior Director Investor Relations.","Joanna Bradley ","With me for today\u2019s conference call is David Pyott, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Jim Hindman, Executive Vice President Finance and Business Development, Chief Financial Officer; and Dr. Scott Whitcup, Executive Vice President Research and Development, Chief Scientific Officer. Before we move ahead I would like to remind you that certain statements we will make in this presentation are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements reflect Allergan\u2019s judgment and analysis only as of today and actual results may differ materially from current expectations based on a number of factors affecting Allergan\u2019s businesses.","Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. For a more thorough discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the forward-looking statements to be made in this conference call and webcast, we refer you to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements that is included in our third quarter 2014 earnings release which was furnished to the SEC today on Form 8K as well as our filings with the SEC referenced in that disclaimer. ","We will follow up the question and answer session of this call with a short listen-only segment where we will provide additional miscellaneous information that relates to our business. Under Regulation FD in order to be able to discuss this information freely during the quarter we must be sure that it is in the public domain. This conference call and accompanying webcast are being simultaneously webcast over the Internet with replays available for one week. You can access the information on our website at www.Allergan.com. ","At this point I would like to turn the call over to David Pyott.","David E. I. Pyott ","In Q3, Allergan posted the strongest increase in absolute dollar sales in any quarter in our 64-year history with strong contributions from nearly all of our businesses and major products. Overall sales increased year-over-year 17.6% in local currencies and by 17.2% in dollars. After topping the prior record reported in Q2 2014, this is an outstanding achievement and a attribute to the ongoing focus of our employees around the world.","Over the summer, we used a leading third-party specialist to field a previously planned global engagement survey with our employees. The results showed a great increase in scores versus the same survey conducted in 2012 and placed Allergan high on many metrics and close to the ratings for global best employer. ","Returning to the strength and momentum in the business, we\u2019re benefitting from strong global markets in which we operate from many product launches post regulatory approvals in the US and internationally and strong returns from strategic investments to build and grow new products and new categories. ","In terms of earnings, the acceleration is even more notable than the growth in sales. In Q3, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share at $1.78 jumped 44.7% versus Q3 of 2013. EPS exceeded the top end of the outlook provided on the last earnings call by $0.31 driven by sales exceeding the top end of the outlook by approximately $40 million accompanied by disciplined spending. The benefits from the announced restructuring program are marginal in the third quarter. ","As we\u2019ve now announced, all employee reductions accepting some minor programs still subject to review by Works Councils in a few European countries. We\u2019re not ready to move onto our goal of creating an even stronger and more nimble company. The earnings impact from the cost reductions will be significant in Q4 and continuing into 2015. Jim Hindman will comment on the further upward revision to our outlook for non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the full year 2015 now in a range of $6.27 to $6.30 representing an increase of 31% to 32% over 2013. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP numbers to US GAAP, kindly consult our press release. ","As we drove an exceptionally strong growth in earnings in Q3, we continued to invest on a focused basis in our greatest long term growth opportunities. On a non-GAAP basis in Q3, we increased our SG&A investment by 6% versus Q3 of 2013 within which direct-to-consumer advertising investment increased by over 15%. DTC was directed to RESTASIS, BOTOX for chronic migraine, a new campaign for BOTOX for overactive bladder commenced in late July, and JUVEDERM and VOLUMA. Year-to-date, our DTC spend has reached almost $200 million, an increase of approximately 38% over the same period in 2013. ","Regarding R&D, investments in Q3 on a non-GAAP basis increased by 6.5%. For the full year 2014, R&D investment will exceed $1.1 billion even after we make adjustments as part of our restructuring program. Clearly, we remain committed to the long term health and strength of our R&D pipeline.","We\u2019re encouraged by the progress of our pipeline. In September, we received approval for OZURDEX for diabetic macular edema in Europe and are now receiving individual country licenses. In the US, the FDA removed the limitations for the DME label which had previously restricted use to aphakic patients or phakic patients scheduled for cataract surgery. As we believe that up to 40% of DME patients are not fully responsive to anti-VEGF therapy, this represents one of the most significant opportunities in our eye care portfolio. Abicipar, our anti-VEGF DARPin remains on schedule to start Phase III trials in Q2 2015. ","Regarding our dry eye pipeline, our Phase II study for RESTASIS X is progressing well. We have one NCE for dry eye that entered the clinic earlier this year and expect to have a second dry eye NCE in the clinic in 2015. We\u2019ll also have Phase II date in early 2015 for Androgen for ocular surface disease. Furthermore, our Phase II studies for BOTOX for osteoarthritis and BOTOX for depression are recruiting patients.","Regarding the individual businesses, I\u2019ll commence with ophthalmic pharmaceuticals. Q3 sales continued on their strong growth trend increasing 14.4% in local currencies and by 14.2% in dollars, marking an acceleration from the year-to-date growth of 13.4% in local currencies and 12.7% in dollars. RESTASIS is on track to exceed $1 billion in sales in 2014 and was again an outstanding contributor with local currency growth year-over-year of 14.4% in Q3 and 17.5% year-to-date. ","In the US, RESTASIS is enjoying double digit volume growth with continuing strong uptick by ophthalmologists and even stronger growth in optometry. Our glaucoma products grew in Q3 year-over-year by 11.1% in local currencies and in dollars as we gained market share worldwide with a new boost from the introduction of unit dose LUMIGAN and Ganfort products internationally. Regular Ganfort was launched in China in Q3. For in-market worldwide sales, IMS reported in Q2, LUMIGAN and Ganfort, the bimatoprost products, exceeding for the first time the sales of the travoprost family of Travatan and DuoTrav. ","In the US, we\u2019re managing to improve the trajectory of LUMIGAN prescriptions but are impacted by higher managed care rebates. In Q3, we were at least pleased to record positive net sales growth after many quarters of year-over-year declines. Internationally, LUMIGAN and Ganfort continued to grow double digits in Q3. For 2015 in the US, we\u2019re pleased that we have already secured preferred status for LUMIGAN in almost all of the important managed care plans. ","Since receiving the expanded DME label for OZURDEX in the US, there\u2019s been a marked increase in the number of injecting retina specialists. In Europe, the DME indication has already been launched in Germany, Austria, and Scandinavia. We also received approval for OZURDEX in Peru and in Malaysia for uveitis. With the important DME approvals in hand in the US and Europe we will report OZURDEX sales on a quarterly basis beginning in 2015.","Year-to-date we\u2019re pleased with our success recording $117 million in sales with over 30% growth year-over-year. Our recent launches of OPTIVE Advanced products, marketed as OPTIVE Plus in Europe, as well as OPTIVE FUSION in Europe, drove double digit sales growth in Q3 in the US and Europe. OPTIVE Advanced was also launched in Brazil and Mexico in Q3. ","In the US we continued to rapidly expand our PRED FORTE and FML business lines, both as brands as well as generics enjoying strong volume increases in addition to taking price increases. Regarding the global ophthalmic market per the IMS Q2 Report, the last period for which data was period, IMS again showed Allergan as the fastest growing full line branded company. In a market growing a robust 11%, Allergan grew 15% with Novartis including Alcon at 6% and Valeant including Bausch & Lomb at 7%. In the US year-to-date August per IMS data, Allergan has gained more market share than any other company in the branded ophthalmic market. ","Turning to BOTOX, Q3 sales increased year-over-year by 16.0% in local currencies with double digit growth in both the therapeutic and aesthetic categories and by 15.3% in dollars, marking an acceleration in trend as year-to-date growth stands at 13.8% growth in local currencies and at 12.7% in dollars. In the US all our key indications including chronic migraine, the two bladder conditions and upper limb spasticity continued on their strong upswing driven by a broad suite of training, practice support, and reimbursement programs.","Furthermore, we increased patient awareness through our direct-to-consumer advertising with commercials for chronic migraine and since the end of July, for overactive bladder. At the end of September, [Marc\u2019s] increased the list price for Xeomin therapeutic as well as cosmetic. A price increased for Dysport was posted earlier in the year. ","In Europe, despite tenders and mandated price increases, we grew the therapeutic category in Q2 in the double digits, driven by the new indications for chronic migraine, bladder, and the most recently approved indication of lower limb spasticity. The latter indication was recently launched in Germany and Scandinavia. Since the last earnings call over active bladder was approved in Brazil, Venezuela, Singapore, Jordan, and Kuwait. The remark to Europe about Q2 should have been Q3 in double digits, just for clarification. ","Moving onto the Aesthetics side of the franchise, we estimate, based on survey data that the US market in Q3 grew around 10% with BOTOX sales growth being further boosted by the 3% price increase posted in January. BOTOX share in August 2015 remained high at over 77% with a point of share loss versus August 2013 with more share gain by Dysport than Xeomin. Since taking over Dysport, Galderma seems to be stabilizing the brand as they gave away free Dysport to support the restylane fillers. ","In Europe we enjoyed particularly strong sales in Western Europe in Q3 as we leveraged our crow\u2019s feet lines approval. Growth was also supported by continuing strong sales in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Given lack of market data, it is not clear if the strong growth was due to market share gains or just the benefits of a strong market. ","In facial aesthetics Q3 sales continued on a torrid pace with a growth of 52.5% in local currencies and 51.3% in dollars, with major contributions delivered from every operating region i.e. North America, Europe, Africa, Middle East, Latin America, and Asia Pacific. The growth was propelled by VOLUMA in the US supplemented by the introduction of VOLBELLA and VOLIFT in international markets.","In almost all markets where the new Vycross collection of products have been launched, these products are incremental while sales of base JUVEDERM remain flat. This reflects the new products represent game changing market expanding technology. Worldwide, we estimate that the market in Q2, the last period for which market data is available, that the market grew 12% in value with Allergan driving all of the growth with some sales loss by the combined group of other players.","In the US we estimate the market in syringes grew mid-single digits in Q3 but grew substantially more in value due to the premium pricing of Allergan products. Based on our analytics earlier generation volumizing products such as Radiesse, Perlane and Sculptra have been most impacted by VOLUMA. In terms of market share, Allergan in Q3 had an estimated 45% of the market in unites, Galderma 32% and Merck 21% with Allergan gaining about nine market share points year-over-year, mostly at the expense of the restylane family of products.","After the major losses suffered under Valeant ownership, Galderma seems to have stabilized market share at the new lower base. In Europe, including Eastern Europe, syndicated data shows for Q2 a slow overall market growing at only 3.4%. However, all of the slowdown from the Q1 growth rate of over 20% is accounted for by Eastern Europe as Western Europe in both quarters grew 14% to 15% year-over-year. In Europe, Allergan in market grew in excess of 40% in Q2. VOLIFT was approved in Thailand and launched in Canada in September. ","Breast aesthetics sales in Q3 increased 6.3% in local currencies and by 6.1% in dollars. Sales of breast implants and tissue expanders were flat worldwide with the increase being accounted for by SERI Scaffold. Market conditions in the US for breast implants remained weak in a flat unit market. We were prepared to accept some unit share loss as we migrated our product mix to the higher priced 410 shaped gel implant and focused on the introduction of our SERI Scaffold product for tissue support in the hospital channel. In Europe, the market in Q2 based on syndicated data, grew 3% with Allergan gaining some marginal unit share year-over-year. The base breast implant business grew strongly in China, Japan, Canada, and Australia principally due to recent product introductions. ","Our skin care and other franchise grew to 11.2% in local currencies and 11.1% in dollars. Included in this line item is the SANCTURA XR product for urology which had close to zero sales in Q3 of 2014 versus $4 million in the prior year. This clearly impacted the overall growth rate. ","Commenting the skin care franchise, we recorded notable growth for several products namely ACZONE and TAZORAC in the US, both grew in excess of 20%. Given the renewed focus on TAZORAC and the genericization of many competitors retinoid products, we\u2019re proud that TAZORAC became the most prescribed single retinoid agent in Q3 in the US. ACZONE benefitting from DTC during 2014 continues to gain market share in the anti-inflammatory acne category.","Our skin medical line also grew double digits benefitting from the introduction of Lytera, our skin lightening product. As we reduce promotional support for LATISSE, we\u2019re expecting some degradation of sales which declined 8.1% in Q3 in dollars. In Japan, we\u2019re delighted that LATISSE marketed as GLASH VISTA has been launched through our aesthetics sales force in a co-promotion and partnership with Shionogi. ","I\u2019ll now pass it on to Jim Hindman who will comment our financial performance in further detail.","James H. Hindman ","During the third quarter of 2014 Allergan continued to showcase the strength of its sustainable business model by continuing to produce strong sales and earnings performance, being able to overachieve our sales and earnings per share guidance per quarter is a reflection of the depth and breadth of Allergan\u2019s business and our leading competitive positions within each of our specialty areas of focus and within each of our geographies. ","Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2014 were $1.78 with growth of 44.7% compared to the third quarter of 2013. A reconciliation of all the adjustments to GAAP earnings is set out in our earnings release. Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments, amortization of acquired intangibles and discontinued operations, Allergan\u2019s Q3 2014 record high gross margin of 88.5% increased 110 basis points when compared to Q3 of the prior year driven primarily by favorable pricing, positive royalty dynamics as well as regional and product mix. ","The non-GAAP selling, general, and administrative expenses to product net sales ratio from continuing operations for the third quarter 2014 was 34.5% totaling $618 million. This represents an increase in spend of approximately $35 million and a 360 basis point decline compared to the same quarter of 2013 and reflects our commitment to expense controls and targeted approach to investments into the areas of our business with the most promising financial returns. ","Non-GAAP research and development expenses were 14.9% of product net sales for the quarter totaling $267 million, an increase in spend of approximately $16 million over the $251 million or 16.4% of product net sales spent in the third quarter of 2013. Please note the benefits from Allergan\u2019s previously announced restructuring program will be reflected in the company\u2019s actual results beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014 and continuing through 2015.","With respect to our balance sheet, consolidated Allergan days sales outstanding was 49 days while consolidated Allergan inventory days on hand was 132 days. The decrease in DSO compared to the third quarter of 2013 is due to the broad based improvements across all of our operating regions in particular, in North America. Important to note with respect to the US wholesaler inventory levels, we have a policy to maintain an amount less than eight weeks of our net sales. As of September 30th we believe we are at the low end of our stated policy levels. ","Due to the continuing negative data regarding the current state of Venezuela\u2019s economy and exchange controls administered by the National Center for Foreign Commerce, we recorded a bad debt expense of approximately $37 million covering older receivables generated prior to October 2013. We\u2019re receiving payments on a regular basis for recent sales activity in 2014 which however, are lower than 2013 sales. ","In the third quarter operating cash flow after cap ex was approximately $519 million. On the year-to-date basis operating cash flow after cap ex was just over $1 billion. At the end of the third quarter Allergan\u2019s cash and equivalents in short term investments and cash and equivalents in short term investments net of debt positions totaled $4.2 billion and $2 billion respectively. ","With respect to our performance aspirations for the fourth quarter of 2014, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $1,845,000,000 to $1,920,000,000 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $1.80 to $1.83. Regarding full expectations for 2014, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $7,080,000,000 to $7,155,000,000 and our full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $6.27 to $6.30. I think David may have referred to that was 2015, just to clarify that is our 2014 guidance. ","Our product net sales expectations reflect the continued negative impact of the strengthening dollar in the fourth quarter of 2014. As a reminder, the earnings per share expectations assume that the US R&D tax credit will be renewed in the fourth quarter of 2014 with the full year retroactive benefit impacting Q4 results. This generated a higher effective tax rate in the first three quarters of 2014 and thus lower EPS results in those quarters while benefiting both the Q4 effective tax rate and reported Q4 EPS. Our current estimate of the full year earnings per share impact of this is between $0.05 and $0.06.","For your information, expectations for other lines of the income statement and specific product sales expectations are included in the current release. With that operator, I\u2019d like to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Larry Biegelsen \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC.","Larry Biegelsen \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC.","On the last call, you said you can complete a deal before the December 18th meeting. Do you still believe that to be the case? Second, some of your shareholders have requested that the company not do a deal without shareholder approval, I\u2019m sure you know under Delaware law, no shareholder approval is required for an acquisition, and New York Stock Exchange Rules only require shareholder approval if more than 20% of Allergan shares are being issued. What is your view of allowing shareholders to vote on an acquisition?","David E. I. Pyott ","Well, I think if we sort of step back from everything, you\u2019ll recollect that way back in May we talked about all the different levers that are available to us to increase stockholder value. I think the most important one is our internal organic ability to do such. I think beyond the really tremendous increase in earnings and also the outlook for earnings not just for 2014 but carrying over into \u201915, \u201916, and well beyond in our five year plan, I\u2019d point out that we\u2019ve been able to raise the top end of sales guidance for the full year in the range of about $200 million.","So it\u2019s very important to answer your question in the framework of internal value creation. Beyond that, of course, we\u2019ve always pointed to the options available for further increasing value by deploying our balance sheet. Of course, given the passage of time, you\u2019d appreciate that some conversations may have been initiated long ago, and so therefore from the outside it is very difficult for you to determine just where we are in the process, if indeed we are looking at making strategic acquisition that fulfills very stringent criteria for value creation.","I think you said it well in terms of what are the rules regarding shareholder votes. I would also point out that some stockholders have been vocal, but we of course, speak to all of our stockholders and very many of them in private have expressed very different views. In fact, being highly supportive of value creation moves by deploying our balance sheet.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gregg Gilbert \u2013 Deutsche Bank.","Gregg Gilbert \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Just a follow up on the M&A question. The street has been pretty focused on the concept that if you\u2019d been pursuing an acquisition, you\u2019d likely announce it by today so that shareholders of record would have an alternative to consider at the December 18 vote. That seems a little simplistic to me, but I\u2019m curious on your thoughts around that concept and what do you think the outlook is for a significant acquisition given that you know more than we do on the outside on that subject?","David E. I. Pyott ","Clearly, stockholders have an opportunity to vote through the purchase and sale of stock at any moment, and I think the rules around voting have been extremely well discussed by both sell-side analysts as well as in the media, and the majority of the reports have been accurate. So, beyond just repeating what I\u2019ve said before, I don\u2019t really know how I would add and give you any more color on the state of play. ","The only thing I would like to reiterate again is that we have very stringent criteria in terms of looking at specialty businesses that fit, that have long-term good growth prospects on the top line as well as ability to deliver bottom line results and therefore returns well in excess of the cost of capital. Those we\u2019ve expressed time and time again not just during this process since April 22, but indeed over the last couple of years. Really, in terms of our criteria, I\u2019ve often stressed nothing has changed at all. ","","Operator","","Your next question comes from Seamus Fernandez \u2013 Leerink Swann.","Seamus Fernandez \u2013 Leerink Swann","Can you just give us your general thoughts a little bit more on the timeframe within which you believe an all cash acquisition could be executed should you choose to find an asset that actually fits in that timeframe. As just a little clarification there, if we were to not see an announcement up to the early December timeframe, is an all cash acquisition at that point in time still a possibility without a shareholder vote?","David E. I. Pyott ","I think the way I\u2019d answer that is clearly if there were to be a transaction, it would have to be announced somewhere in the early part of December so that stockholders would have adequate time to assess how they gauge the value of that particular option. I think also as we\u2019ve stated in the past, I should add another point which is, should we not have announced a transaction, many stockholders have told us that they would then believe that we should go to, in their view, the second choice, the second preference which would be to consider a stock repurchase program. I just want to make sure in the full balance that all of those options are on the table and are in the public view of our stockholders.","Operator","","Your next question comes from David Maris \u2013 BMO Capital Markets.","David Maris \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","A couple of questions, first a couple of weeks ago Ackman said he found evidence that would come out in the next few days, so that was on the 16th, that showed that Allergan did some untoward things about Valeant\u2019s stock price. Ignoring the fact that a few days have come and gone and nothing has come out of this accusation, isn\u2019t that a direct violation of a protective order? Is that something you can comment on and what the ramifications might be? Separately, you have a glaucoma medication in development that\u2019s an implant for several months of delivery. We\u2019ve been doing some discussions with physicians about it, they\u2019re pretty excited about it. Can you just update us on the status of this and what the development plan might be? Then lastly, you just mentioned potential for a buyback, does that also include when you say buyback, also include sort of a special dividend as well under that same umbrella of returning cash to shareholders?","David E. I. Pyott ","I think we will sort of answer two of those questions, particularly as one is about the business which is kind of encouraging on a quarterly earnings call. So on the first one, in terms of the two and fro with [inaudible] and Valeant, I think to make it very clear, our goal in all of this is to make sure that stockholders and the public have accurate data available for making their assessment on true performance. Also, last week in an effort to show exactly that we\u2019ve been doing everything properly, we chose to release some emails which had to that moment been redacted.","I would now like to pass it over to Scott on the [bimatoprost].","Scott M. Whitcup, M.D. ","We\u2019ve been focusing a lot of our glaucoma pipeline efforts on sustained release as you know. Compliance is a big issue with patients, especially older patients who have difficulty taking drops. Our most advanced sustained release program is by [bimatoprost], the active ingredient in LUMIGAN in a micro implant that can be placed in the eye in an in office procedure. We believe that it will control IOP for at least four months.","The exciting news is we\u2019ve met with FDA and planned to start Phase III study for this bimatorpost sustained release implant by end of this year and we will present data on the Phase II program probably at a meeting next year once we figure out which meeting we\u2019ll let everybody know. But it\u2019s an exciting program with good data and FDA go ahead to get to Phase III which again, we plan to start this year. ","Operator","","Your next question comes from Aaron Gal \u2013 Bernstein Research.","Aaron Gal \u2013 Bernstein Research","The question is two-fold, first can you just give us an update on your efforts to separate BOTOX aesthetics from BOTOX therapeutics because as this is kind of like a major potential [inaudible]. Second, could you explain to us how the cost cuts you are putting now in place differ from the classic way from which Valeant approaches the business simply because we get into the argument that those cost cuts are essentially the same thing?","David E. I. Pyott ","In terms of formal separation of pricing in the US, really no major progress made there. The only thing I can comment is obviously we were able to take a price increase at the beginning of 2014 which was the first time, I believe, for about seven years. So some ability to raise price on both sides of the equation therapeutic and aesthetic. In terms of cost reduction, I think you should see it in the right context that our level of price cuts were in the 30% type of range \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, beg your pardon, and so really based no extremely detailed knowledge of our business we know very, very well things that are absolutely core to driving long term growth, which programs if you look in any portfolio, whether it\u2019s investments or stock investments for investment analysts of in terms of us investing in the long term growth of the business, we know just where to reduce. ","In fact, I knew my number was wrong. Our operational efficiencies were a 13% reduction across the board where going back to the Valeant offer, they were proposing at the outset a 70% decrease in our operating costs so very, very different. As I think is demonstrated by the trajectory of the sales, we\u2019ve been able to trim and cut in the right places and we believe reiterating the numbers in our five year strategic plan we can continue after these cuts to grow the top line annually in excess of 10% annually.","So we believe we\u2019ve been able to trim at the margin without impacting the ability to grow topline for the long term.","James H. Hindman ","I think the important thing in this is that we know our business and through rewiring and efficiencies we knew where to go to get those costs out without significantly affecting the topline. So that\u2019s really the key here.","Operator","","Your next question comes from David Buck \u2013 Buckingham Research Group.","David Buck \u2013 Buckingham Research Group","These will be non-fundamental to your business I guess, but I guess one line of questioning, for the potential to talk with Valeant, what level of compensation of shareholders would trigger you being more active and engaged in discussing their proposal? When do we get an answer on whether one of your shareholders may be precluded from voting their shares?","David E. I. Pyott ","I think behind your question really is the answer that all of our efforts are focused on how to increase value for our stockholders. Clearly, the board has in the past been clear that the offer substantially undervalued the company. I think today, all we saw really was an offer to negotiate, there was not a formal increase in the offer price. It was difficult to really discern exactly what was going on in there but I would assume that there was an assumed increase in the Valeant stock price to corroborate those numbers. Obviously, our board will think about what this letter meant and in due course we\u2019ll make a determination and respond.","Tomorrow we have a hearing at Federal Court in Santa Anna California and I don\u2019t know what will happen. We will await the results of that.","James H. Hindman ","We\u2019re not quite sure what those results will be or what the timing will be at this point.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Shibani Malhotra \u2013 Sterne Agee.","Shibani Malhotra \u2013 Sterne Agee","First, can you explain \u2013 I guess a lot of investors were worried that with all the news around the Allergan Valeant sort of merger takeover operations might suffer because your people might be kind of disturb, etc., but can you explain how performance has been so strong regardless of what\u2019s happening in the bigger picture? Then the second question obviously, we believe that Allergan has numerous options beyond Valeant alone and you talked about Allergan is a standalone and potentially being acquirer or use of your balance sheet, but can you also talk about the potential for deals with other companies, perhaps a friendly merger and how you would think about the different options that are available to you right now?","David E. I. Pyott ","I think to the credit of our management team and our employees worldwide, they\u2019ve remained extraordinarily focused on delivering results and therefore, in its essence further creation of stockholder value. Right from the beginning, I made it very clear to our team that a very small group of us would be involved in dealing with all the ramifications of the Valeant and Pershing Square offer. That number of people is certainly less than 10 at any one given time then the other 11,000 employees spend their time on delivering value whether it be through the R&D pipeline, whether it be through service to our physician customers and their patients. I think we can see that has worked extraordinarily well.","In terms of options, let me always repeat the same thing, we are open to whatever makes strategic sense to create further value for stockholders. That can be the whole myriad of different options in terms of deploying our balance sheet and equally of course, we\u2019re very much open to listening to other company\u2019s offers. If at the right time they would make greater sense, have greater value than Valeant\u2019s offer than that\u2019s something of course, our board would very fully consider.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Liav Abraham \u2013 Citi Research.","Liav Abraham \u2013 Citi Research","Another question on your fundamental revenue outlook, I guess my question is what\u2019s changed since the beginning of the year? You gave guidance around 10% product sales growth in February, now this is around 14% to 15% for the full year. Where were you wrong, what has surprised you and how sustainable is this longer term given that your longer term guidance is for revenue growth in the 10% range? Is there potential upside to that?","David E. I. Pyott ","I think where I would start is as I stated in my very early parts of my remarks, markets in which we operate have been very strong indeed. So there\u2019s a good general backdrop. I think within our product lines where we\u2019ve done extraordinarily well is that the dermal fillers have frankly exceeded our expectations. It would have been difficult the beginning of the year to say, \u201cOkay, in Q3 we will grow the business worldwide in excess of [50%],\u201d which is exactly what we\u2019ve done.","So really, this has been the value of the VYCROSS line, i.e. VOLUMA, VOLIFT and VOLBELLA. Beyond, I have my own instincts that they would be incremental to base JUVADERM. I\u2019m glad to say my instincts were good and hence why with base JUVADERM being somewhat \u2013 it\u2019s not really just flat, even growing just a little bit in terms of [ex-factory] sales, all of the new products came right on top of that. ","Then I think within eye care, RESTASIS continues to grow very strongly not only in value but more importantly in really I\u2019ll call it cases because when you look at prescriptions and trailing prescriptions it actually slightly understates the growth because people are filling larger and larger quantities per prescription. Then also overseas we\u2019ve done very well with glaucoma. You can see despite the challenges of the US market, I refer quarter-after-quarter to double digit growth for the bimatoprost franchise i.e. LUMIGAN and Ganfort. ","Then if we look at the US dermatology business now on the medical side, really great performance particularly by ACZONE but also TAZORAC. So pretty broad suites of products that are doing better than we had really planned and budgeted at the beginning of the year and thankfully our employees have really remained focused on driving this healthy growth which should last for long periods of time.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Marc Goodman \u2013 UBS Securities, LLC.","Marc Goodman \u2013 UBS Securities, LLC.","Can you talk about BOTOX specifically in migraine and overactive bladder and maybe help us get a sense of where the growth is coming from? Are these new patients coming in, are they patients that are staying on therapy longer, are you getting new doctors on board? Just help us understand where all the growth is coming from.","David E. I. Pyott ","Well, in addition to the two conditions that you mentioned, I would also like to stress that the base movement disorders business, thanks to the more recent approvals of both upper limb spasticity in the US and now most recently some country approvals for lower limb spasticity, they\u2019re also driving growth. So stepping back above all of that, I would say we\u2019re continuing to add new doctors or new injectors but really probably more important at this stage is how do we make each individual doctor that has been trained adequately on how to administer the product become more productive i.e. how do we improve patient flow through that practice, how do we get economies of scale for that doctor, and how do we make sure that the doctors have good reimbursement experiences? ","Clearly, any physicians that has to inject and particularly if they\u2019re buying and billing, they stay out-of-pocket for close to $1,000. If they don\u2019t get paid by the insurance carrier that is a true negative. So we\u2019re making sure those experiences are few and far between and the physician becomes good not only at injecting but the whole patient flow through the practice all the way through to reimbursement. Then of course, appropriately bringing that patient back into the practice for repeat injections.","Clearly, that\u2019s always what we always call in marketing the leaky bucket theory to the degree we can really avoid that drop off of people who just fail to show up again for the right treatment at the right time. We\u2019ll never make it perfect, but how do we optimize it increasingly?","James H. Hindman ","You can see it\u2019s a very complex model so all those pieces need to fit together so it\u2019s not just about adding more sales force, you have to have a deep knowledge of the business and then be able to work all those pieces together.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Ken Cacciatore \u2013 Cowen & Company.","Ken Cacciatore \u2013 Cowen & Company","I just wanted to ask specifically, did you receive an all cash offer from another party other than Valeant and what is the board\u2019s fiduciary duty if you are dealing with two offers, at what point does the board need to decide to listen or engage, even at a minimal level?","David E. I. Pyott ","Well of course, I can never really comment any particular market rumors so I think I need to put a stake in the ground there. After that, of course, as I answered in several of the questions earlier, the only thing that our board is focused on is discharge of our fiduciary duties and a deep analysis of what is the intrinsic value of our company where we\u2019re supported by two investment banks and we use all the normal valuation criteria to come up with ranges of value that we believe we represent.","Going back to what I\u2019ve stated earlier, as the year has progressed we have been constantly not only accelerating sales growth but steadily increasing our actual delivery of earnings per share but also our outlook for earnings per share. As you well know from us, when we state a number we absolutely mean it and if you think back over a very long period of time, we have never missed a number. So I\u2019d like to say that there\u2019s a very high degree of certainty when we give you numbers.","So, that\u2019s the intrinsic valuation and of course, to the degree there are offers from third-parties we have to evaluate them with the support of our advisors in the appropriate manner and of course, we will always be focused on how do we deliver value to our stockholders.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Annabel Samimy \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus. ","Annabel Samimy \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","I guess the first relates to your capital allocation, a lot of people have been focusing on possible M&A targets larger companies, but is there a possibility that you\u2019re considering a combination of smaller companies and various capital allocation plans with regard to shareholder stock buyback or a special dividend? Just if you could review possibly your priorities in terms of those very specific criteria that you look at for M&A, whether they need to be immediately accretive or not. The second thing is other OZURDEX is starting from a very nice base and I just want to get a sense of how much of that right now has been off label in DME and can you sort of quantify for us the 40% of patients who are not responsive to VEGF and how much of VEGF right now is used in DME.","David E. I. Pyott ","Clearly, in terms of our multiple options in theory of course, there could be a smaller type of acquisition. I think in the past I\u2019ve used very illustrative numbers of $10 billion for a larger acquisition, let\u2019s just call between one is between zero and 10 is $5 billion and then you could do that kind of acquisition topped by a stock buyback or a special dividend. So that\u2019s another way of creating value through deployment of our balance sheet.","I\u2019ll move on then rapidly to OZURDEX, as I stated, year-to-date sales for the first time we\u2019ve given you the number it\u2019s $117 million with growth over 30% year-over-year. I would think that the amount of off label use, particularly in the US was extremely limited because physicians appropriately are concerned about getting reimbursed by their insurance carriers. Most retina specialists are on the buy and bill model and therefore getting the label initially approved was really important and now thanks to Scott Whitcup\u2019s work with the FDA and his ability to remove the restrictions, that has been just a major point. Scott something to add?","Scott M. Whitcup, M.D. ","The question that you brought on responsiveness, there are several studies that show that although the anti-VEGF agents work well in a lot of patients with diabetic macular edema there is still a significant number of patients and depending on the study, up to 30% to 40% who don\u2019t get complete resolution of the fluid in the retina with the anti-VEGF\u2019s and we\u2019ve heard from multiple physicians that there is clearly an unmet need for additional therapy in diabetic macular edema and that our data shows that OZURDEX is a great alternative therapy to the anti-VEGF\u2019s and we think it\u2019ll be clearly the biggest indication that we\u2019ve had for OZURDEX to date.","David E. I. Pyott ","I should add on the acquisition side, clearly one of the criteria would be that an acquisition would be accretive ideally in its first year and then growing beyond that. ","Operator","","Your next question comes from Andrew Finkelstein \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group, LLP. ","Andrew Finkelstein \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group, LLP","I was hoping you could comment a little bit about how you evaluate what could be a fluctuating value of an offer from Valeant or another party if stock is a component and how that might influence the decision about what is greater shareholder value than an independent strategy? Then on the results from the quarter, whether there were any moving parts we should understand regarding stocking, promotions, growth-to-net adjustments? In particular, it seemed like the glaucoma products has the biggest upgrade to the full year outlook whereas RESTASIS was up quarter-on-quarter but implying a rather large step up into the fourth quarter, we\u2019ve seen strong RX trends there but what influences some of these quarter-to-quarter swings?","David E. I. Pyott ","Answering the first part on terms of how does the board supported by its advisors value an offer, well I suppose like all of us or you, we have to see what is the current implied value of a stock price. Beyond that, we are obviously looking at the intrinsic value of the company and certainly as of last week, because we have not yet made it as a board a decision on this latest letter, clearly as of last week the offer on the table substantially undervalued the company. So it is not a very long or difficult exercise. This current offer, as I said, which is really an offer to negotiate because it doesn\u2019t state is there an increase in the cash offer, is there a difference in the exchange offer, it is more just a statement of faith, we will respond to that. Now let\u2019s ask Jim to answer some questions in terms of the outlook we provided in our guidance. ","James H. Hindman ","If you take a look at the Q3 results there is really nothing out of the ordinary as we went through it. I think the one thing to remember is from a wholesaler inventory level, I think I had mentioned what our targets are and we\u2019re at the low end of our stated policy there so there was nothing related to inventory, wholesaler inventory, or increased rebates, or anything from that perspective. That would be out of the normal.","I think as you look into the fourth quarter everything again is pretty straightforward. The only thing I think I had mentioned overall from a tax basis is that you\u2019ll see we\u2019re assuming the R&D tax credit gets passed in the fourth quarter which would cause a catch up entry to be made in the fourth quarter for that. But other than that I think everything is pretty straightforward in what we\u2019ve disclosed.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Jami Rubin \u2013 Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin \u2013 Goldman Sachs","I think most of us on the call are surprised that three months have gone by since the last quarter call where a huge focus was on BD activity, nothing has happened. Clearly, there could still be something that happens, only you would know that not us but obviously, the clock is ticking towards the December 18th special meeting. Are you confident that Allergan will have a positive outcome on that date without significant business development, or a leveraged buyback, or a special dividend in light of your improving fundamentals? Or, should we anticipate further activity or a potential white knight activity?","David E. I. Pyott ","Well, I think if you go back to three months ago what our action demonstrates is that Allergan is extremely disciplined in terms of how we evaluate options and as I\u2019ve stated, there are multiple options and we plan to deliver greater value to our stockholders. So let me reiterate it\u2019s through organic action and delivery of value, it could be through strategic transactions, it could be through other forms of capital activity in the form of buyback and indeed, as I stated earlier, if another party or parties which to put in an increased offer on the table that is substantially superior to Valeant\u2019s that is something our board, of course, in its pursuit of value for stockholders should and would consider.","Operator","","Your final question comes from David Amsellem \u2013 Piper Jaffray & Company.","David Amsellem \u2013 Piper Jaffray & Company","Regarding cost cutting, what is the extent to which you can cut further, or I guess another way of asking, are the efficiencies that you announced earlier this year, should we think of that as sort of the beginning of longer term efficiency initiatives or is this essentially a one-time action?","David E. I. Pyott ","Let me reiterate what I stated in my prepared remarks that we have really defined all of the actions we wish to take. As we\u2019ve stated publically these numbers in terms of the value or the cuts they deliver are $475 million. Maybe on the inside we can do fractionally better than that but we\u2019ll comment this as time goes on. Basically, the announcements have been made. We\u2019ve completed this and I made the comment we\u2019re now ready to move onto the next stage which is focus on delivery of sales growth and deliver this plan. So this is not just the beginning, this is the end of our cost cuts and you can see that we have been able to drive enormous growth and are confident we will do so in future.","Joanna Bradley ","WE would like to thank you for your participation today. I will now take five minutes to give you market share data.

[Operator Instructions] At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would like to introduce your conference host, Mr. Jim Hindman, Senior Vice President, Treasury, Risk and Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","James M. Hindman","Thank you, Dori. Good morning. With me for today's conference call is David Pyott, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Edwards, Executive Vice President, Finance and Business Development, Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Scott Whitcup, Executive Vice President, Research and Development, Chief Scientific Officer; and Jim Barlow, Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller.","Before we move ahead, I would like to remind you that certain statements that we will make in this presentation are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements reflect Allergan's judgment and analysis only as of today, and actual results may differ materially from current expectations based on a number of factors affecting Allergan's businesses.","Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. For a more thorough discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the forward-looking statements to be made in this conference call and webcast, we refer you to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements that is included in our fourth quarter and year-end 2012 earnings release, which was furnished to the SEC today on Form 8-K, as well as our filings with the SEC referenced in that disclaimer.","We will follow up the question-and-answer session of this call with a short listen-only segment, where we will provide additional miscellaneous information that relates to our business. Under Regulation FD, in order to be able to discuss this information freely during the quarter, we must be sure that it is in the public domain. This conference call and accompanying webcast are being simultaneously broadcast over the Internet, with replays available for 1 week. You can access this information on our website at www.allergan.com.","At this point, I would like to turn the call over to David Pyott.","David E. I. Pyott","Great. Thanks, Jim. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. In the fourth quarter, Allergan sales grew versus the fourth quarter of 2011 by 8.1% in local currencies, and given some continuing U.S. dollar strength, by 7.4% in dollars.","For the full year, sales increased by 9.1% in local currencies versus 2011 and at 6.8% in U.S. dollars, given the value of the U.S. dollar relative to most of the world's currencies earlier in the year.","We are gratified that Q4 sales grew year-over-year double-digits in local currencies in all of our overseas operating regions namely: Europe, Africa, Middle East, Latin America and Asia-Pacific. We're also pleased that we continue to secure many new regulatory approvals around the world.","Our consumer-facing businesses performed strongly in all regions in the quarter. Regarding operating performance, we generated in Q4 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.15, excluding the benefit of the R&D tax credit of $0.06, which was signed into law a few days too late on January 2, 2013, for inclusion in the 2012 results.","Excluding this benefit, EPS increased 15.0%. For the full year of 2012, diluted non-GAAP EPS was $4.14, an increase of 13.4%. Adding in the $0.06 that really belong to 2012, the calculation of earnings performance 2012 versus 2011 would be 15.1%, fulfilling our long-term aspiration of mid-teens EPS growth on a non-GAAP basis. We achieved this result while we continue to invest in R&D and strengthen our pipeline.","For the full year, we spent $927 million on R&D, an increase of 8.1% over 2011, all on a non-GAAP basis. You will note from the expectations that we provided for 2013 that we expect to invest over $1 billion in R&D in 2013, marking a notable increase over 2012.","For a reconciliation to GAAP numbers, kindly consult our press release. From all of our announcements, it is evident that we are dynamically managing our portfolio of products and businesses. On February 1, our Board of Directors completed the previously advised review of strategic options for maximizing the value of Allergan's obesity intervention business and is formally committed to a sale of this unit. Accordingly, Allergan is expecting to report obesity intervention as a discontinued business, commencing with the first quarter of 2013. Further details are to be found in today's press release.","As previously stated, Allergan intends to fully offset any potential earnings dilution from this transaction. Using the sales results of 2012 as a guide, disposal of the obesity intervention business adds about 100 basis points to Allergan's worldwide growth rate in 2013.","A key long-term strategy to maintain the strength of Allergan as an enterprise is to regularly and dispassionately reevaluate the contribution of each business to our value creation goals. This was a decade ago, when we spun off the ophthalmic medical business to our stockholders in the form of Advanced Medical Optics.","The recent acquisition of SkinMedica and the recently announced transaction with MAP Pharmaceuticals should be good contributors to our long-term goals of achieving around 10% annual sales growth in local currency.","Following the positive opinion received from the Irish Medicines Board for the approval of BOTOX for a idiopathic overactive bladder, we were very pleased to receive the FDA approval for the same indication.","As we reviewed our urology R&D portfolio, we have determined which products to fund for late-stage development. Given positive Phase III data for SER-120 developed in cooperation with our partner, Serenity, Allergan has decided to fund a confirmatory Phase III trial.","With mixed efficacy data for BOTOX for benign prostatic hyperplasia, we have decided to terminate this program. Furthermore, as regards our partnership with Spectrum Pharmaceuticals for Apaziquone, we have returned the clinical development program and commercialization rights to them. In exchange, Allergan will receive a royalty on any future revenue after regulatory approval.","In Q1 of 2010, we out-licensed AGN-209323, a Phase II-ready, oral small molecule compound for neuropathic pain to Bristol-Myers Squibb. BMS recently advised us that they will not take this compound to the next stage of clinical development.","Now commenting the performance of the individual businesses, let me start with BOTOX. BOTOX sales in Q4 were the highest ever at $475 million, benefiting from the normal high holiday season in aesthetics and an accelerating trend in therapeutics. Sales grew versus the fourth quarter of 2011 by 14.7% in local currencies and 14.3% in dollars. For the full year, BOTOX sales increased 12.7% in local currencies and 10.7% in dollars.","The therapeutic indications grew approximately 13% in dollars and the aesthetic sales grew approximately 8% in dollars, with local currency growth for both franchises being greater in local currencies by approximately 200 basis points.","In 2012, therapeutic indications accounted for approximately 52% of the total businesses, which in future will increase in the mix, given the global approvals for chronic migraine, and now for urological indications.","In Q3, the last period for which we have global market data available, we estimate that the world market for neuromodulators grew 13%, and the global BOTOX market share was 77%, down 1 point with share gain in therapeutics being offset by some share loss in aesthetics. We are, however, encouraged that aesthetic shares have been flat across the last 4 quarters.","Since the last earnings call, we have received additional country approvals for chronic migraine in Russia and Austria, for neurogenic bladder in Russia, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Kuwait and Argentina.","BOTOX for overactive bladder was approved in Ireland, as a reference member state and also Germany, Austria and Finland and Estonia. Our partner, GlaxoSmithKline, secured the approval of hyperhidrosis in Japan.","The U.S. therapeutic business continued on a strong growth trajectory, driven by chronic migraine, neurogenic bladder and upper limb spasticity. Anticipating the rapidly increasing sales and workloads in the neurology and urology businesses, which at that time with an expected approval of BOTOX for OAB and the potential acquisition of MAP's LEVADEX, we created over the summer of 2012 a dedicated sales team for neuro rehabilitation, covering cervical dystonia and upper limb spasticity.","So all in all, we today deploy 4 focused sales teams: chronic migraine, neuro rehab, urology and finally, a hospital team covering all of the indications.","Regarding chronic migraine, commercial access is virtually complete and patients without access are in practice at a low level. Regarding training, we're investing resources and moving existing injectors from basic to advanced live training sessions. In addition, we're beginning to offer access to pain specialists and other top prescribers of migraine medications who are not board-certified neurologists.","Based on Medicare's permanent CPT injection code effective January 1, we expect that commercial plans will reimburse physicians at around $200. Both branded and unbranded direct-to-consumer advertising is successfully driving patients to our websites to inform themselves about the condition of chronic migraine and to finding a trained headache specialist. Regarding neurogenic bladder, or NDO, we also enjoy excellent insurance coverage with positive policy at all Medicare carriers and 88% of commercial plans. For this stage of the launch, levels of insurance denials are quite low and are on a declining trend. Since the launch of NDO, we have trained approximately 2,200 of the universe of approximately 5,000 urologists on the bladder injection procedure.","Now with the approval of OAB, it will be relatively easy for urologists to adjust their technique to injecting 100 units instead of 200 units. The Medicare CPT code is simple for bladder injection -- sorry, the Medicare CPT code is simply for a bladder injection independent of etiology.  In addition, there are varying facility fees depending on the site of care.","Outside the U.S. in Q4, we enjoyed double-digit growth in local currencies in many markets. Canada is driven by strong uptake of chronic migraine and NDO, particularly by private plans, as we are still establishing coverage by public provincial payers.","The Ontario Drug Benefit is covering NDO since the end of 2012. Furthermore, most principal markets in Latin America and Asia-Pacific are experiencing double-digit growth, driven by the core movement to other indications and initial sales of the new indications were approved and reimbursed.","Europe is the only challenging region, affected by government-mandated price cuts and tenders to squeeze prices, as well as long timelines from regulatory approvals for the new indications to actual reimbursement and therefore, patient access.","We are, however, encouraged that our business is in a turnaround since last summer, after we reorganized management, put in tougher disciplines and tender prices and started regaining market share, in part due to sales from the newly approved indications.","In Japan, our partner, GSK, recorded major growth in 2012 across a wide range of movement disorder indications. The benefit to Allergan was a significant increase in royalties received.","Turning to the aesthetic side of the BOTOX business, In Q4, we enjoyed double-digit growth in local currencies in all operating regions, mainly in the U.S., Europe, Africa, Middle East, Latin America and Asia-Pacific except Canada, where we were drawing down inventory after a 10-year anniversary promotion in Q3.","Based on our survey data, we believe that the U.S. aesthetic neuromodulator market is growing close to 10%, and the BOTOX share in November increased to 84%, with Dysport at 14% and still a 1% residual share for Xeomin.","Xeomin has been reintroduced to the U.S. market on Jan 10, and we're carefully monitoring the Merz activity for which we are excellently prepared.","We are pleased that the U.S. FDA in January conducted an advisory action regarding illegal imports and wrote a letter to 350 U.S. physicians who had purchased BOTOX through unauthorized channels or unlicensed distributors. These names are posted on an FDA website.","In Western Europe, it seems that the overall market is picking up in the last few months, and that furthermore, we have halted our market share losses as Azzalure and Bocouture entered new markets. We're monitoring the effects of VAT increases on cosmetic procedures in France and Spain.","Very strong growth continues in China and Japan, as we open up new customers in addition to expanding business in existing accounts. Other outstanding performance was in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Thailand.","Facial aesthetic sales increased 13.3% in local currencies versus Q4 of 2011 and by 12.7% in dollars, with double-digit sales increases in local currencies in all operating regions.","The last few months have been marked with a lot of innovation activity. VOLUMA was approved in Vietnam and the Philippines and was just launched in Russia. At the IMCAS conference in Paris in late January, we launched the first of our new fillers based on our proprietary Vycross technology: VOLBELLA with lidocaine indicated for the lips and the perioral area. Vycross is the same technology inside VOLUMA. VOLBELLA is formulated with an innovative low molecular weight technology, which improves the cross-linking efficiency of hyaluronic or HA chains. This more effective cross-linking allows for a lower concentration of HA to be used, which results in less swelling. VOLIFT, another product providing correction for volume loss in the lower face and nasolabial folds, will be introduced in Europe shortly.","Brazil launched both VOLBELLA and VOLIFT in January. VOLBELLA and VOLIFT were just approved in Australia. Additionally, VOLBELLA was approved in Korea, Turkey and Bulgaria. Now we're waiting the date for an FDA panel for VOLUMA and are hopeful that we'll have approval before year end.","In the U.S. facial aesthetics business, we enjoyed double-digit growth in Q4 year-over-year, and we estimate that the market grew mid-single digits. Given lack of promotional activity in Q4 of 2012, net selling prices released -- realized were higher. And in addition, we gained some market share since Q3.","We estimate the volume growth for the U.S. market for the full year was mid-single digits, but was lower in value, given the impact of promotions discounts and free goods from ourselves, as well as competitors.","In Europe, it is encouraging that we enjoyed year-over-year double-digit growth in Q4, with particularly strong growth in the economically challenged markets of Italy, Spain and France.","Market growth in the European Union was 10% in Q3, the last period for which data is available for syndicated market data. Almost 3\/4 of this market growth was attributable to Allergan, being driven by VOLUMA, and to a lesser extent, base JUV\u00c9DERM products. Regarding SkinMedica, we are proceeding to very rapidly integrate the company and to make the topical aesthetics products part of Allergan's broad product and service offering.","LATISSE in the U.S. has been transferred into SkinMedica to create a focused front office sales operation. The existing Allergan facial aesthetics teams are thus entirely focused on injectables and also preparing for upcoming product introductions.","In January, SkinMedica introduced Lytera, a non-hydroquinone skin lightening system that reduces the appearance of skin pigmentation such as sunspots. This is part of a 4 product system that is positioned as an alternative to the hydroquinone-based Obagi Nu-Derm System.","Breast aesthetics. Q4 sales increased 6.6% in local currencies and 5.8% in dollars. Full year 2012 sales increased by 10.5% in local currencies and by 8.0% in dollars. Q4 sales were marked by weak sales in the U.S. and very strong sales growth outside the United States.","In Q3, the last period for which data is available, we estimate that the world market grew 5% in value. In the U.S. in Q4, the continuing trend to higher value gel products in our sales mix and good growth in tissue expanders was insufficient to offset low market volume growth and limited share loss to Sientra, which was not on the market in Q4 2011.","Our share loss has been much lower than Mentor's, with Sientra's market share in November being around about 5% of the augmentation and tissue expander market. Leveraging our distribution and full range strength in Latin America, we enjoyed very strong growth in all of our principal markets.","Strong Asia-Pacific growth was driven by the recent introduction of 410 in Korea, our recent silicone approval in Japan and market share gains in Australia.","Europe, given the economic challenges, also posted good growth, although we experienced weakness in Spain, Italy and France in Q4. For Q3, we have syndicated market data showing continuing strong market growth across the European Union of 8% in units, with Allergan growing almost double this rate.","As clear market leader, we have enjoyed surgeons' confidence in high-quality products in the wake of the PIP scandal.","Ophthalmology. In Q4, ophthalmic pharmaceutical sales increased 8.2% in local currencies and by 7.1% in dollars. In Q4, we enjoyed strong double-digit growth in local currencies in Canada, Latin America, Europe, Africa, Middle East and our major markets in Asia. Korea was held back by the impact of government-mandated price reductions, but as an offset we have strong volume increases for Allergan products.","For the full year of 2012, sales grew by 9.7% in local currencies and by 6.8% in dollars. In the U.S., sales growth in Q4 was at a lower rate than for the full year, given the decision announced in August to discontinue the original LUMIGAN 0.03% formulation, thus reducing overall LUMIGAN trade inventory.","Regarding original LUMIGAN, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit just ruled that our use patent is valid. According to ANDAs filed by generic companies will not be approved until our patent expires in August of 2014.","In market, IMS VONA reports strong LUMIGAN acquisition dollar fourth quarter year-over-year growth at 13.7%. RESTASIS continues to grow robustly in volume at a steady double-digit rate, driven by growing prescriptions, not only in ophthalmology, but also optometry and patient awareness and education delivered through DTC.","RESTASIS growth in Canada is accelerating as access improves. In Europe, we are negatively affected by the de-reimbursement of artificial tears in Spain, where Allergan is the clear market leader, with us holding almost half the market.","Since September 1, the Spanish market declined about 50% in units. Fortunately, we've been able to register a new product, Optava, as a reimbursed pharmaceutical and have secured major price increases for our de-reimbursed artificial tears from February 1.","OZURDEX had major growth in Europe, far exceeding U.S. sales, which are also growing strongly. IMS Global reports for Q3, the last date period for which data is available, shows the world market growing a robust 10%, buoyed by retinal therapeutics and the glaucoma market on the other side, dampened by the impact of latanoprost generics.","For Allergan, IMS reported 12% global growth for Q3 and 11% for year-to-date Q3, with steady share gains in glaucoma, artificial tears, allergy and retina.","Regarding regulatory action, LUMIGAN preservative-free and unit dose was approved in the European Union, opening up the segment of the market that is being prepared by some competitors.","In addition, we received approval for OPTIVE Advanced in Canada and Malaysia, OPTIVE Sensitive in Hong Kong and OZURDEX in Russia, Malaysia, Taiwan, Kuwait, Sri Lanka and South Africa.","Finally, our skin care franchise grew 11.0% in Q4, both in local currencies and in dollars, rounding out to full year growth in 2012 of 14.9% in local currencies and 14.7% in dollars.","The largest contributor to the growth, both in the quarter and the year, was ACZONE, which is the fastest-growing product and #1 brand in the U.S. anti-inflammatory acne market.","TAZORAC has also started to pick up in growth since last summer, due to greater detail focus and less competitive activity. LATISSE growth in Q4 was only 1.2%, as this followed an introductory promotion for our new 5-milliliter package in Q3.","I'll now pass over to Jeff Edwards, who will comment our financial performance and outlook.","Jeffrey L. Edwards","Great, David. Thanks, and good morning to everyone on the call. During the fourth quarter of 2012, Allergan continued to generate solid operating results despite ongoing costs relating to U.S. health care reform and overseas pricing pressures. Allergan continues to successfully manage and perform through these types of pressures due to the design and diversification of our business, our strong product platform and our thoughtfully-directed approach to investing into the business.","Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2012 was $1.15 and for the full year, $4.14, despite $114 million in U.S. health care reform pretax equivalent cost and $36 million in overseas pricing pressures.","As a reminder, the 2011 pretax equivalent cost associated with U.S. health care reforms were approximately $90 million, and the costs associated with incremental overseas pricing pressures were approximately $40 million.","The fourth quarter of 2012 excludes the full year 2012 impact of the U.S. R&D tax credit, which was signed into law on January 2, 2013, and retroactively reinstated to January 1, 2012. The estimated impact of the U.S. R&D tax credit on net earnings attributable to Allergan for the full year 2012, which would be reported in Allergan's operating results in the first quarter of 2013 was approximately $0.06 diluted earnings per share.","Full year 2012 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share restated to include the $0.06 benefit of 2012 R&D tax credit would have been $4.20, with growth of 15.1% compared to 2011.","This full year result is $0.01 above the top end of the guidance range provided on our previous earnings call. Likewise, for the fourth quarter of 2012, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share restated to include the $0.06 full year benefit of R&D tax credit would've been $1.21, $0.01 greater than the top of the guidance range provided on our October 30 call. A reconciliation of all of the adjustments to GAAP earnings is set out in our earnings release.","Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments and amortization of acquired intangibles, Allergan's Q4 2012 gross margin of 87.3% increased 50 basis points when compared to Q4 2011. This positive gross margin trend has been driven primarily by our improved year-over-year standard costs, favorable variances, lower royalty expense and favorable product mix. Favorable margins were partially offset by the continuing pricing pressures we are experiencing around the world on reimbursed products.","It is worth noting that our royalty income receipts have grown to a point where they are now at a similar level as our royalty payments for the first time in the history of the company. This is largely a reflection of our interest in and willingness to maximize the value of our technology assets in markets where we believe partner companies are in a better position to succeed.","The non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses to product net sales ratio for the fourth quarter was 38%, totaling $565 million. The comparable ratio and expense value for the same period in 2011 were 39% and $540 million, respectively.","Regarding investment in DTC, we spent $162 million in 2012, compared to $177 million in 2011, with a significant increase in spend on BOTOX for chronic migraine, offset by leveraging our spend directed to other products, in particular LATISSE.","Throughout 2012, we continue to recognize the advantages of leveraging many of our businesses while having the flexibility to make meaningful investments on projects that we believe will yield the greatest financial returns.","Allergan will continue to pursue these thoughtful value-driving investments during 2013. However, our expectations are that we will continue to generate SG&A spending leverage for the full year 2013.","Non-GAAP research and development expenses were 16.1% of product net sales for the quarter, totaling $239 million, an increase in spend of approximately $13 million over fourth quarter 2011.","We continue to make substantial commitments to spending across both our medical device and pharmaceutical technology portfolios, while driving cost reductions through efficiency programs and R&D. With respect to our balance sheet, consolidated Allergan days sales outstanding was 47 days, while consolidated Allergan inventory days on hand was 136 days, including the acquisition of SkinMedica.","Excluding the acquisition of SkinMedica, consolidated Allergan inventory days on hand was 125 days. Allergan generated operating cash flow after CapEx of approximately $455 million in the quarter and a record $1,457,000,000 for the full year of 2012. This compares to $963 million generated for the full year of 2011.","At the end of the fourth quarter, Allergan's cash and equivalents and short-term investments and cash and equivalents and short-term investments net of debt positions total approximately $3 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively.","For the first quarter of 2013, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $1,375,000,000 to $1,450,000,000 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.94 to $0.96, which excludes the beneficial impact of the 2012 R&D tax credit that will be reported in Q1 2013 as a non-GAAP adjustment and any dilution impact related to the MAP Pharmaceutical transaction previously disclosed.","Regarding full year expectations for 2013, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of","$5,900,000,000 to $6,200,000,000 and our full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share between $4.75 and $4.83, which excludes both the beneficial impact of the 2012 R&D tax credit and the $0.07 estimated dilution impact related to the MAP Pharmaceuticals transaction. This full year EPS expectation represents growth of between 13% and 15% on a restated basis if the R&D tax credit were signed into law in 2012 as oppose to 2013 and the dilutive impact of the MAP Pharmaceutical transaction is excluded from the baseline calculation.","Our 2013 Q1 and full year expectations take into account several key factors and assumptions I would like to highlight and\/or repeat for you. EPS expectations exclude the favorable 2012 impact of the R&D tax credit that will be reported in Q1 2013 as a non-GAAP adjustment. It also excludes the $0.07 of earnings per share dilution related to the proposed acquisition of MAP Pharmaceuticals, as previously stated in the January 23, 2013 announcement.","The expectations provided exclude the obesity intervention business. As a reminder, we previously stated our intent to offset any earnings per share dilution relating to this transaction by performance in other businesses.","The expectations include both the pretax equivalent of U.S. health care reform estimated at $125 million and the pretax equivalent of U.S. medical device tax estimated at $10 million. They also include the incremental overseas pricing pressure estimated at $50 million.","As is very typical for Allergan in the SG&A category, you should anticipate both a greater percentage and absolute dollar investment in the first half of the year as compared to the second half of the year. It is important to highlight that we will be absorbing an additional $35 million of costs in 2013 versus 2012 relating to U.S. health care reform, U.S. medical device tax and incremental overseas pricing pressure.","For your information, expectations for other lines of the income statement and specific product sales expectations are included in our earnings release.","With respect to our 2013 capital expenditures, we project CapEx of approximately $250 million for the full year. Regarding 2013 cash flow, we again expect to generate operating cash flow after CapEx in excess of $1 billion.","We have assumed moderate levels of share repurchase activity of approximately 6 million shares in 2013 with our repurchase objectives limited to only match expected employee stock option-based compensation programs. Although not contemplated at this time, it is possible that some limited additional share repurchases above the 6 million shares just mentioned may be pursued to offset potential dilution resulting from the sale of the obesity intervention business.","So with that, operator, I'd now like to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Today's conference call is scheduled to conclude at 9 a.m. Pacific time. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Greg Gilbert with Bank of America.","Gregory B. Gilbert - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I have a question on DARPin. I was hoping you could tell us when you will get DARPin data in house. And if we hear from any of you that you've decided to move into Phase III before we see the final data at AAO, what can we assume that you specifically achieved in Phase II?","Scott M. Whitcup","Greg, it's Scott. So we have a fairly robust Phase II program. So what we'll know is safety of that compound and dosing frequency. And clearly, to make the decision to move to Phase III given the investment we would need to make, we need to see product differentiation versus LUCENTIS, which is the comparator. Our prediction based on PK work is that the dosing administration will be less frequent. We might be, in addition, lucky to see differences in efficacy. But those are the 2 things that we would be looking at. We'll have data roughly midyear. What we've said all along is that you'll likely see the data second half. Most likely, conference will be AAO, which is in the fall. I think we have stated that prior to you seeing the day-to-day AAO, we would announce if we've made the decision to move to Phase III, that you'd hear that on an earnings call.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shibani Malhotra with RBC Capital Markets.","Shibani Malhotra - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just a question for Scott and David, I guess, on the ophthalmology franchise. In particular, RESTASIS, what is your current thoughts on generics for the product and a potential follow-on for RESTASIS as well?","Scott M. Whitcup","So in terms of generics, Shibani, that -- what we've stated before is that, given FDA regulation, there would need to be a fairly large study showing non-inferiority of a generic to RESTASIS, but also beating a vehicle control. Because of the non-inferiority margin, this would be a very large study with a fairly big risk that you wouldn't actually achieve the goal. And to our knowledge, no one would go this route and no one has been going this route. We are looking at a follow-on to RESTASIS, the so-called RESTASIS X, we don't comment on it. Probably, the first thing you'll hear will be just watching clinicaltrials.gov to get an idea of what that might be.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","My question is for Scott as well. Scott, I was just hoping that you could frame your view on the efficacy and safety profile of LATISSE in hair loss based upon the data that you saw after the Phase IIb studies completed in September of last year. And also, provide an update on your new Phase IIb trials that you could commence in 2013 and when those might complete.","Scott M. Whitcup","So David, as we've stated before with the hair growth program, we had data rolling in, continuing through the end of the year and have stated that we would present those data at a conference in the second half. We haven't really commented on those data per our policy. What we've said is, if there were a dose that had great efficacy and differentiation from minoxidil, we'd go into Phase III. Should we not see that differentiation, but still see a positive signal that it was growing hair, we have the ability to increase the dose fairly substantially in a Phase IIb. So you'll get an indication of where we're at either when you see the data or if you see either a Phase III or a Phase IIb on clinicaltrials.gov, but we haven't announced anything further than that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gary Nachman with Susquehanna Financial Group.","Gary Nachman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","David, now that you have the approval of idiopathic OAB and a lot of the docs trained already, how quickly do you think the use of BOTOX in OAB will accelerate this year? And how long will it take to get to the remaining 4,000 urologists, you think? Could it be this year or will it be next year?","David E. I. Pyott","Well, I think, if we compare and contrast to chronic migraine, it was clear to us from the very beginning that urology would move much quicker. Urologists are really procedure-based physicians. They like doing things like this. Obviously, from my remarks, once we have trained urologists how to deploy a cystoscope and use the bladder injections, to go from 200 units for NDO to 100 for idiopathic overactive bladder is pretty simple. Coupled with that, the reimbursement codes is relatively complicated, but it depends on site of care. But I would say not only favorable in our point of view, but also the point of view of the urology practices. I think in terms of training, this will continue to pick up in terms of those that still not -- have not yet been trained. And certainly, we heard prior to the approval of the latest indication, a lot of doctors were already thinking about the patients. If you like, they had in the practice just waiting for approval. And of course, that meant really access to reimbursement. So I think adding all of those factors together, the overactive bladder launch, which by the way still has not formally occurred, this will be right around the corner. It should be pretty quick.","Operator","Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So David, recently, at an investor conference, you specified 10% top line growth aspiration. As far as I know, that was kind of the first time you've been that explicit. I guess my question is, what are the key underlying assumptions underlying this growth target? Why disclose this target now? And if I do the math, the organic growth rate for your guidance, suggesting [indiscernible], LAP-BAND and SkinMedica, it's about 5% to 11%. So maybe if you could comment on that and how that ties to with the 10% aspirational growth.","David E. I. Pyott","Well, I think, given the large number of approvals we had in 2010 and '11, plus, of course, a pretty busy year coming up in 2012 and, by the way, I would add OAB to that because that formerly falls into 2012 for the U.S. -- sorry, 2013. This is always the problem with a calendar year change. This year is 2013. And also, Europe was right before Christmas. That, I think, gave us a higher degree of confidence than is the norm that we can always see relatively well the next 2, 3, 4 years. After that, in any company, long-term projections start getting much murkier. So if you step back, clearly, BOTOX in its many forms, has lots of growth, both on the therapeutic side, these new approvals, aesthetic market looking healthy. And then, obviously, RESTASIS continues to grow very strongly indeed. Commenting then on the portfolio adjustments. Clearly, I stated it in my opening remarks, shedding LAP-BAND will boost overall growth of the order of magnitude by about 100 basis points. And then SkinMedica adds another little bit of the margin. And even assuming on-time approval of LEVADEX in mid-April, of course, the sales contribution this year, whilst interesting, is modest. Let's be clear about that. That, that is not quite as complicated, I don't think, as training BOTOX. Because there, you've got to train a procedure. This is a prescription. But nevertheless, the real contribution from LEVADEX starts kicking in, in 2014 and beyond. So I hope that kind of covers all the different bases. And I think it was important just to remind the investment community, an aspiration around about that 10% mark. You can see it reflected in this year's guidance. And of course, let me underline local currency because we certainly don't control the level of the dollar to any currencies around the world.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Cacciatore with Cowen and Company.","Ken Cacciatore - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","David, I wanted to ask about migraine reimbursement, not the covered lives. But we're hearing from many clinicians that in terms of the amount of paperwork and pre-authorization and commitment from some of these practices, in terms of the personnel that they have to employ to secure reimbursement, it's becoming more and more difficult and it sounds like a real issue. First, are you hearing the same? And second, what are you all doing to help simplify the practices or help them out as they try to secure reimbursement?","David E. I. Pyott","Yes, well, I think of the margin, first of all, what you're probably hearing is that some physicians were billing under miscellaneous codes, which actually achieved a higher reimbursement than the rough order of magnitude I gave you a few minutes ago of $200. So some were getting around about $300 in the past. I think the second thing I would say in terms of paperwork, this is all part of the learning experience for a physician and his or her practice. How do you get up to speed? How do you actually become highly efficient at getting basically prior authorizations because we would always recommend a physician to, unless there were some really very regionally specific issues, buy and bill, i.e., acquire the product and then bill both for the product as well as the procedure. And this has been the practice for at least 15 years, when I think of movement disorders. And we have a completely separate group, obviously, for Safe Harbor reasons, well away from the sales force that offer reimbursement services. And so there, we can train the physicians on what is appropriate for various carriers, if it's Medicare, or what's appropriate knowing the full degree of coverage at the commercial plans. So this is the same pattern as always. And if people are still new, beyond having learned how to use the product, you may get some of this feedback. And of course, our job is to make everything smooth and simple for these new practices.","Operator","Our next question comes from Corey Davis with Jefferies & Company.","Corey B. Davis - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I want to ask about LEVADEX and given that MAP's partner looks like recently terminated their manufacturing deal, are you comfortable that you're going to be able to make the product? And any more details on how that's going to happen and obviously, in the context of the upcoming PDUFA date, you must have been pretty comfortable and confident, given your purchase of it.","David E. I. Pyott","Well, of course, if we go back in history, given our cooperation with MAP, we've been kind of standing shoulder to shoulder with them on all of the regulatory matters and getting ready for well over 1 year. And so, given that I'm also a recovering lawyer, the only thing I can really say, given that we don't yet own MAP, is to refer you to the 8-K made by MAP, filed by MAP, and also their comments. And once we actually own the company, then I can say other things.","Operator","Our next question comes from Marc Goodman with UBS.","Marc Goodman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","David, just give us a little more color on how you're thinking about BOTOX growth in 2013. Obviously, we have the guidance. But I was thinking more of cosmetic versus therapeutic. Are we expecting kind of the same growth? Are you expecting therapeutic to be dramatically more? And if you could talk about geographies. What are your expectations for accelerating growth in '13 versus '12 or decelerating and how you're thinking about Europe? And just take us around maybe the globe and how you're thinking about this.","David E. I. Pyott","So looking at our guidance, the math that you have there is a range of growth. I'm just trying to find the right page here. Here we go. It's in a bracket of, rounding it to the nearest number, 8% to 13% in dollars. If you think back to my remarks on the split for 2012, you've got in dollars about 13% in therapeutic, 8% in aesthetics, and you can add roughly 2 points to that to get to local currency. So if you think local currency, round order of magnitude, you're really looking at kind of 15% and 10% for 2012. Now given the guidance we gave you, I think, clearly, the growth will be higher on the therapeutic side than the aesthetic. And then I think if you both reflect on what I said and maybe carefully pour over the transcript when you get all my comments, you'll see the market for neuromodulators worldwide is pretty healthy, in its entirety about 13%. If we look at the cosmetic side, we think the market in the U.S. is growing pretty close to 10%. The European market is also very healthy. I gave you some very specific numbers on fillers, where it's easier for us to get behind it. The issue we always have with BOTOX Europe is how do we split therapeutic and aesthetic even ourselves because of lots of transshipments that go around from one country to another. And then, of course, trying to do that for our competitors becomes like an even greater divining rod kind of process when we have our own data frailties. But stepping back from all of that, I think you can see pretty healthy consumer-facing market demand. And hence, why we feel pretty good about BOTOX in its entirety for 2013.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research.","Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company","Kind of continuing on that question a little bit, but more in the U.S. Just wondering if you could talk about how you see the U.S. market given a lot of moving pieces over the last couple of months with Valeant's acquisition of Medicis and now Xeomin coming back out in the market. Have you seen any changes? And how are you guys preparing for the changes that you're seeing from some of your competitors?","David E. I. Pyott","Yes, I think I'll focus my answer along the aesthetic side, because therapeutic, we are really the sole company that drives demand and creates market. So getting back to aesthetics, what we'll see in terms of push and pull, I think in the integration of Medicis into Valeant, there are some opportunities for us to maybe shake some business loose, i.e., pick up market share. On the other side, clearly, we wish to contain the market share gains of Xeomin as they come back. From my observations, when I've been out in the field, and of course, I've read other surveys, both internal, as well as some sell-side research, I think it's more difficult this time for Xeomin to come back. It's no longer brand-new. And I think also, physicians are quite aware of what's written in the label in terms of BOTOX Cosmetic being duration up to 4 months and the concomitant label for Xeomin being up to 3 months. And I think they've actually seen that in many cases in their own clinical practice. And so I think that will be really a key point. So in summary, ability to gain some share probably from Valeant. But then, inevitably, we have to lose some share to Xeomin. Our job is to minimize that. But we should be realistic and sanguine, and we are, and that's embedded in all of the numbers we have given you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Liav Abraham with Citi.","Liav Abraham - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","My question pertains to LUMIGAN. David, I'd be interested in your assumptions and thoughts on LUMIGAN sales progression in the medium term, so 2014 and beyond. My understanding from Novartis is that they're working assumption is that Travatan generics will actually enter the market at the end of '14, beginning of '15. What is your base case assumption regarding the longer-term outlook for LUMIGAN? And what strategies are you deploying in order to mitigate headwinds from incremental potential generic competition over the next couple of years?","David E. I. Pyott","Okay. I think I'll bifurcate the answer into 2 sections. First of all, the U.S. and then the rest of the word. Now clearly, the pattern of genericization of any product overseas is much slower just because of different government policies. And the real driver, of course, is there's no absolute pharmacy switch as there is in the United States. So I think, overseas, we can expect greater LUMIGAN growth in volume than in the United States for the next couple of years. And then we also have the booster of GANFORT, which is regarded as maximal medical therapy in the single drug for intraocular pressure lowering. And we'd love to have that product approved in the United States. But even Scott Whitcup can't make it happen that quickly. There's only been 2 fixed combinations ever approved in the last sort of 15-ish years, i.e., Cosopt for Merck and then COMBIGAN from ourselves. So now let's drill back into the United States, where I think is the real question. Now if one looks at volume growth, you can see LUMIGAN currently growing a couple of percent in volume, when you kind of look at weekly and monthly data. And in terms of our preparation, it's better for us to prepare for the worst case, that Travatan might go generic at the end of 2014. And we're in good position because we're already, in fact, kind of exploring long-range formulary contracts. And in addition to our contracting work, we're also doing some very good preparatory work in terms of health economic studies. Because clearly, for a health insurer, if patients are not only compliant, but have really good results in terms of protecting their visual fields, there'll be fewer physician visits, which of course is very expensive to the plan. And when you look at the differential between the cost of the brand and the cost of the generic, factoring in physician visits is a very important part of that economic story. Obviously, we track what Novartis and Alcon are doing. They, too, are working on, to our knowledge, new formulations to protect their franchise. And obviously, we hope that they'll be successful. We'd be quite happy to be not the sole player that's left as a brand in the sea of generics.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is for you Scott. Can you remind us of DARPin's preclinical profile with respect to half life and binding affinity relative to competitor drugs? And why does this give you confidence in the ongoing Phase II trial? And secondly, is the DARPin in your ongoing Phase II trial PEGylated? And what are the positives or negatives of this approach, specifically, does this create any hurdles to manufacturing?","Scott M. Whitcup","So I'll try to address a number of questions that you raised. I mean, clearly, duration of effect is based on a number of points: it's binding affinity, it's size of the molecule, it's whether when you give more it aggregates or doesn't aggregate in the eye, as well as half life. We presented some of the data at R&D Day. It's difficult to make comparators to other competitor products because those studies, a lot haven't been done head-to-head. But clearly, we have preclinical models have looked and based on those parameters, we have calculated that we think the duration could be somewhere in the 3- to 4-month range. We also do have some early, albeit, small numbers of patients showing that we are getting duration in that range. Obviously, we will make our decision based on a more robust Phase IIb trial. That's really what we need to focus on. The PK data gave us confidence to invest and to design the trials. But in the end, our dosing regimen will be based on these Phase IIb data. So that's where we'd look to go. We have not commented on whether the compound is PEGylated. But clearly, we are investing a fair bit on the manufacturing side. And to date, that's going well.","Operator","Our final question comes from David Buck with Buckingham Research.","David G. Buck - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","This one is for Jeff. If I look at 2013 guidance, you're guiding to roughly an 86.5% gross margin. Can you talk about the ability to sustain that beyond 2013? And what type of pricing actions or what type of benefit also from getting rid of the obesity control business, what are the impacts of those on the gross margin, the ability to sustain or grow that?","Jeffrey L. Edwards","Okay. So lots of answers for that question. Obviously, our manufacturing organization has been very successful in creating more efficient processes and taking cost out of the manufacturing process. Likewise, we have the benefit of higher margin products. So a better mix of newer products and greater pricing across some of those newer products. We're also seeing the benefit of volume. So as we increase volume, we have a very efficient plant network. I think that's important to recognize. We haven't commented beyond 2013, but we're reasonably comfortable that based upon our strategic plan assessment that we should be able to maintain and grow that number, albeit in moderation. Lastly, the LAP-BAND business, the health business produced gross margins which are below the corporate average. So with the elimination or the sale of that business, we will be the beneficiary both this year and the following years. I hope that's helpful.","James M.

Ladies and gentlemen, from this morning's press release, you'll have noted that we have raised the outlook for 2014 earnings per share growth over 2013 in a range of 18% at the bottom to 20% at the top end of the range whilst we continue to invest into the future of the business. These numbers are non-GAAP as laid out in our earnings releases and investor relations materials. The business is performing strongly, thanks to thoughtful investments made over a long period and thanks to disciplined execution.","Before commenting on our Q1 results, I wish to briefly address the unsolicited proposal to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Allergan for a combination of 0.83 of Valeant common shares and $48.30 in cash per share of common stock of the company.","As you know, on Tuesday, April 22, we received this unsolicited proposal from Valeant after we learned of this matter in the press on Monday, April 21. Prior to becoming aware of the public filings made by Valeant and Pershing Square, Allergan had no discussions with either Valeant or Pershing Square with respect to this matter.","As we previously communicated, our Board of Directors, in consultation with its financial and legal advisors, will carefully review and consider the proposal and pursue the course of action that it believes is in the best interest of the company's stockholders. At this time, stockholders do not need to take any action.","In the interest of time allotted for today's earnings call, I would refer you to the press releases we issued earlier on this subject. As today's call is focused on our Q1 results and operating highlights, we will not be taking any questions on the unsolicited Valeant proposal.","Now coming to the first quarter, sales increased 14.7% in local currencies and excluding the sales of LAP-BAND to Apollo Endosurgery, by 13.9% in local currencies and 12.2% in U.S. dollars, marking the fourth sequential quarter of year-over-year double-digit growth, driven by a large number of regulatory approvals since 2010, both in the U.S. and around the world. Furthermore, the growth of our cash pay markets around the world remained strong.","Regarding operating performance in Q1, we generated non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.18, an increase of 20.4% year-over-year, considerably above the top end of the outlook provided on the last earnings call of $1.09 to $1.12 and exceeding our historical aspiration of midteens earnings per share growth. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP numbers to U.S. GAAP, kindly consult our press release.","Year-over-year, we enjoyed a good increase in gross margins, which Jeff Edwards will comment in greater detail. The strong increase in earnings was achieved as we continued to invest into the growth of our markets in medical education and in R&D.","Regarding direct-to-consumer advertising, we increased year-over-year company-wide spend by over 50%, with major increases for BOTOX for Chronic Migraine, and for ACZONE and continuing strong support for RESTASIS. All of these campaigns have driven considerable growth in all of these franchises.","In Q2, we have already initiated a new campaign for VOLUMA in the U.S. in print, TV and digital to drive not only VOLUMA, but the entire volumizing category.","Regarding regulatory approvals, we continue to make strong progress. In Japan, we received 2 notable approvals for JUV\u00c9DERM for the first-generation non-lidocaine version, and for LATISSE labeled as GLASH VISTA.","Regarding BOTOX and building on the first European approval in the U.K. for lower limb spasticity associated with stroke, we now received a positive opinion in Ireland, which is the reference member state initiates the process of securing national licenses in 14 European countries.","Regarding VISTABEL, the name for the BOTOX aesthetic indications in most of Europe, we now have approvals for crow's feet lines in all of the European and European economic area countries, with the sole exceptions of Poland, Slovakia and Greece. Of course, we expect these shortly.","Regarding LEVADEX, we believe that we have fulfilled all the requirements identified in the FDA's complete response letter and are now awaiting approval in Q2.","Commencing on the performance of the businesses, I'll commence with ophthalmic pharmaceuticals, which once again posted double-digit performance, with first quarter year-over-year growth at 10.9% in local currencies and 9.2% in dollars. Encouragingly, both North American and x North America sales grew double digits in local currencies.","In the U.S., IMS reported Q1 in-market Allergan growth of 11.5%, driven by very strong growth of RESTASIS, OZURDEX, OPTIVE and also sales of both branded and generic PRED FORTE and FML.","In August 2013, Sandoz took a major price increase on prednisolone acetate due to supply constraints. In December 2013, we followed and increased our prices of generic to parity with Sandoz, as well as increasing price for branded PRED FORTE by 80%.","In addition, we took similar price increases with generic fluorometholone, as well as branded FML. Sales of the 2 products increased slightly over $20 million versus Q1 of 2013.","As we ramp up production and improve distribution of the 2 products, where, historically, we've been a small player, we believe that we could benefit from this kind of sales increase throughout the remainder of 2014.","Regarding U.S. RESTASIS, IMS reports in-market units in Q1 up by 9.5%, which is further boosted by 7% of price increases year-over-year. RESTASIS continues to grow very strongly in both Canada and Turkey, as we educate ophthalmologists on the use of the product.","LUMIGAN and GANFORT sales x U.S. increased 10% year-over-year, offset by a decline in U.S. LUMIGAN sales. We are, however, encouraged that year-to-date, [indiscernible] March in the U.S. increased by 4.6% as reported by IMS, offset by increased rebates, data [ph] managed care to secure favorable formulary [ph] positions.","In Europe, Africa and Middle East, ophthalmic pharmaceuticals are growing double digits, with sales driven by LUMIGAN and GANFORT, most recently further boosted by the launch of unit dose presentations, as well as OZURDEX, OPTIVE and RESTASIS. In the top 5 European markets, OZURDEX enjoys a 12% share of treated patients in the retina market, which augurs well for the expected approval for diabetic macular edema in Europe at the end of 2014.","OPTIVE Fusion, Allergan's first entry into the hyaluronic acid segment, which is about 20% of the European tears market, was launched in the quarter in the U.K., Germany, Austria, Poland and Scandinavia with strong initial sales. Regarding regulatory approvals, OPTIVE Advanced was approved in Australia and Brazil.","OZURDEX was launched in Brazil after receiving reimbursement. In addition, LASTACAFT was launched in Mexico and LUMIGAN preservative-free in unit dose form in Australia.","Regarding the global ophthalmic market per the Q4 IMS report, the last period for which data is available, IMS showed Allergan as the fastest-growing global full-line branded pharmaceutical company in both Q4 and for the full year of 2013. In Q4, in a market growing at the robust rate of 13%, Allergan also grew 13%; whilst Novartis, including Alcon, grew 4%; and Valeant, including Bausch & Lomb, 3%.","Whilst Allergan does not book ophthalmic sales in Japan, with royalty receipts captured in the other revenue line below sales, our partner Senju is rapidly growing ALPHAGAN sales and building a leadership position in the adjunctive glaucoma therapy segment.","For the Q4 IMS Global report, LUMIGAN and GANFORT became the worldwide leader in the glaucoma category, for the first time overtaking the sales of the Travatan and DuoTrav franchise.","Moving on to BOTOX. Q1 sales increased by 11.5% in local currencies and by 9.6% in dollars. Regarding the global market for neuromodulators, we estimate that the market in 2013 grew 12%, with Allergan also growing 12% and retaining share at 76%.","In 2013, the global aesthetic market grew 11% and the therapeutic uses, 13%, with Allergan gaining share in therapeutics, offset by small losses in aesthetics as competitors entered the North American market.","In the first quarter, sales growth of the margin was held back due to no sales being booked to Venezuela due to lack of foreign exchange being released by the Central Bank. We have orders for Q2 and expect to ship them.","We also booked virtually 0 sales of BOTOX Cosmetic in Colombia. In Colombia, the government mandated a price reduction for neuromodulators that initially applied also to aesthetic uses. After we were able to successfully appeal this, a new decree was issued on March 31. Hence, we could only start to invoice in Q2 the goods that we had shipped as consignments in the first quarter. So clearly, there will be a catch-up [ph] for sales in Colombia in Q2.","Regarding regulatory approvals, we're excited that the first new national approvals for lower limb spasticity in the U.K. and Ireland will enable us to expand the market, as well as strengthen our competitive position.","In addition, we received regulatory approval for BOTOX for Chronic Migraine in Colombia and public reimbursement in Australia, as well as for neurogenic bladder in South Africa and Turkey and idiopathic bladder in Italy. In South Africa, we received several new indications: cervical dystonia, post-stroke spasticity and neurogenic bladder.","Furthermore, VISTABEL was approved for crow's feet lines in Bulgaria, an additional country outside the European Union. The European approvals of the crow's feet lines indication gives us new opportunities for physician training.","In the U.S., the therapeutic business continues to grow strongly, both for Chronic Migraine and the 2 bladder indications, driven by good reimbursement coverage. Low levels of denials for prior authorizations, improved physician education regarding patient and practice management, as well as great traffic on our branded and unbranded websites for patients.","Regarding urology, we now have 100% coverage of Medicare managed care accounts and still have some commercial accounts left, where we expect to improve coverage during the remainder of 2014.","In the universe of 13,000 urologists and urogynecologists, within which about 8,000 treat incontinence, we have already established an injector base of about 4,500 physicians, though some training opportunities remain. We're also gratified with the growth in neuro rehabilitation, thanks to our spasticity indication.","In Europe, we are growing BOTOX Therapeutic in market over 10%, driven by good performance in the base movement disorders areas and in addition, also by the recent reimbursed launches of Chronic Migraine and bladder. In the quarter, BOTOX for bladder was launched in Spain and Italy as was Chronic Migraine in the private nonreimbursed market in Poland and Russia.","Turning to the aesthetic side of the business. We estimate, based on survey data, that the market in Q1 grew at about 10% in units. And our sales growth was further aided by the 3% price increase that we posted in January. Obviously, this refers to the U.S.","BOTOX Cosmetics here in the U.S. in Q1 remained high at over 78%. The reduction of 3 share points versus 2013 as Xeomin reentered the market with a 6.6% share, up 3 points. Dysport remains static at 15% share. Encouragingly, Xeomin share has remained stuck in the range of 6% to 7% since November 2013.","In Europe, we estimate that the market is -- in Q1 is growing around 10% and that BOTOX and VISTABEL is maintaining share in the face of strong price competition from Merz and Galderma.","In facial aesthetics, we enjoyed continuing very strong sales growth of 35.6% in local currencies and 33.1% in dollars, as we benefit from the launch of VOLUMA in the U.S. but also the introduction around the world of the other products in the Vycross collection, mainly VOLIFT and VOLBELLA.","In terms of regulatory approvals, VOLBELLA was approved in Russia, Georgia, Lebanon, Philippines, Vietnam and South Africa, with VOLIFT approved in Korea, Turkey and Costa Rica. VOLUMA and JUV\u00c9DERM XC were, in addition, approved in Bangladesh. In the quarter, we commenced direct operations in Indonesia and commenced selling JUV\u00c9DERM and BOTOX Cosmetic.","In the U.S. VOLUMA has attracted enormous interest, and we quickly conducted hands-on training for over 3,000 physicians. Based on market survey, we estimate that the U.S. dermal filler market in Q1 grew over 10% in syringes and even higher in value due to the introduction of our premium-priced product.","In terms of year-over-year market share changes, Allergan now enjoys over 44% market share in Q1, a year-over-year increase of almost 11 share points, with Valeant at 34%, down 7 share points; and Merz at 20%, down 4 share points.","VOLUMA in March enjoyed over 13% share of the total market, with low cannibalization of base JUV\u00c9DERM, with most of the source of business appearing to be from RADIESSE, Sculptra and to a lesser extent, Perlane and Restylane.","In the European Union, the market was growing mid to high teens in Q4, the last period for which data is available. And syndicated data shows Allergan growing roughly twice this rate, given the strong uptick of VOLUMA, VOLBELLA and VOLIFT and their premium pricing relative to earlier generations of products.","On a worldwide basis, we estimate that the dermal filler market in Q4 grew 21% year-over-year, in the main, driven by Allergan's innovation and market building activities.","Breast Aesthetics sales increased by 12.3% in local currencies, 11.0% in dollars, with strong performance being reported in the U.S., Latin America, with our first direct sales being shipped to Mexico and Asia, with initial sales of Natrelle in Japan.","In the U.S., our strategy to emphasize higher-priced gel products, and especially our differentiated Natrelle 410 shaped implant, has paid dividends. We've made the first sales of our new silk-derived biological scaffold, SERI, and have the product being trialed and taken up in hundreds of hospitals. An increased deployment since the end of 2013 in the hospital channel is also benefiting our sales of implants and tissue expanders for reconstruction.","In Europe, with the aftermath of the PIP scandal, the overall market declined in Q4 year-over-year 1.5% in units, with Allergan posting mid-single digit unit growth. Allergan Q1 European sales growth followed the trend from Q4.","Our skin care and other franchise grew in Q1 21.0% in local currencies and 20.7% in dollars. Commenting the important constituent parts, we enjoyed very strong growth in U.S. medical dermatology, with IMS showing Q1 acquisition dollar growth of ACZONE at 50% and TAZORAC at 12%. Our print and TV investments in ACZONE contributed to driving this growth, and we expect ACZONE to be shortly the #1 branded acne product.","Our topical physician dispense line, led by SkinMedica, is growing in excess of 20%, even including declining Allergan legacy products, and all this as we offer the benefits of Allergan's full line to our physician customers. Category market growth in 2013 was 5%. So clearly, we're gaining share, in particular from the market leader, Obagi.","I'll now pass over to Jeff Edwards, who will comment on our financial performance.","Jeffrey L. Edwards","Thank you, David, and good morning to all of you on the call. The first quarter of 2014 represented a very nice start to the year for Allergan as we experienced good performance across each of our product lines and geographic regions, as David commented.","Allergan was able to overachieve sales and EPS expectations due to our broad base of business and leading market share positions within each of our specialty areas. The company's favorable performance trends are a clear reflection of the productivity of our historic investment choices.","As an isolated example, in the first quarter of the year, almost 40% of the increased PSM spend over prior year related to DTC, which we believe contributed to our positive performance and yielded a stronger, short-term payback.","Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2014 was very strong at $1.18, coming in well above the top end of our range of expectations and marking a 20% increase over 2013 results for the same quarter.","A reconciliation of all of the adjustments to GAAP earnings is set out in our earnings release. Including the effects of non-GAAP adjustments, amortization of acquired intangibles and discontinued operations, Allergan's Q1 2014 gross margin of 87.4% increased 70 basis points when compared to Q1 2013, driven by improved standard costs, favorable pricing and favorable region and product line mix.","Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses to product mix sales ratios from continuing operations for the first quarter were 40.4%, totaling $654 million. The comparable ratio and expense value for the same period in 2013 were 41% and $587 million, respectively. Although there was an increase in spend as measured in dollars, consistent with our strategy, the related absolute year-over-year percentage increase of this spend trails the rate of growth of net sales over the same period.","We continue to implement targeted investments to further stimulate the positive growth trends observed within our product lines and geographic regions. As is typically the case, Allergan's non-GAAP SG&A expense to product mix sales ratio will be progressively leveraged in the remaining 3 quarters of this year.","Non-GAAP research and development expenses were 16.8% to product net sales for the quarter, totaling $272 million, an increase in spend of approximately $23 million over the $249 million or 17.4% of product net sales spent in the first quarter of 2013.","With respect to our balance sheet, consolidated Allergan days sales outstanding was 56 days, while consolidated Allergan inventory days on hand was 132 days. It is worth noting that the main driver for the modest increase in DSO for the year end 2013 is largely attributable to the challenges of our Venezuela distribution partner, Merck KGaA, has had them receiving Central Bank approval for dollar payments.","With respect to end of the quarter DOH levels, they are slightly higher than year end 2013 due primarily to the preparation of going direct for the breast aesthetics business in Mexico and the continuing challenges we face in Venezuela.","In the first quarter, operating cash flow after CapEx was approximately $119 million. This compares to approximately $96 million for the same period in 2013. As has been the case historically, operating cash flow after CapEx will accelerate over the remainder of the year.","At the end of the first quarter, Allergan's cash and equivalents and short-term investments net of debt positions totaled approximately $3.6 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. With respect to stock repurchase, the company's 10b5-1 plan that was in place in February 2014, was terminated in accordance with the terms of the plan documented April 2014, as a result of the Valeant's unsolicited proposal.","As previously mentioned by David Pyott, progressively strengthening business momentum combined with continued vigilant oversight of expenses will result in stronger than anticipated growth to earnings per share and net sales. We presently expect these positive trends to endure over the remainder of the year.","For the second quarter of 2014, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $1,725,000,000 to $1,800,000,000 and nondiluted GAAP -- and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $1.41 to $1.44.","Regarding full year expectation for 2014, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $6,775,000,000 to $7 billion and our full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $5.64 to $5.73.","As a remainder -- as a reminder, this EPS expectation assumes the U.S. R&D tax credit will be renewed in the fourth quarter of 2014 with full year retroactive benefit impacting Q4 results. This will generate a higher effective tax rate in the first 3 quarters of 2014 and thus lowers EPS results in those quarters while benefiting both Q4 effective tax rate and reported Q4 EPS.","Please note that the product net sales expectations excludes any future anticipated revenue from transition services agreements related to the sale of the obesity intervention business, the product net sales associated with the transition service agreement, primarily related to distribution services outside of the United States and contract manufacturing services. These transition services agreements are expected to have minimal impact to the bottom line for both 2014 and 2015.","For your information, expectations for other lines of the income statement and specific product sales expectations are included in our earnings release.","So with that, operator, we'd now like to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ken Cacciatore from Cowen and Company.","Ken Cacciatore - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Just had a question. David, I'm assuming, since you've been running your business the same way for quite a long time, that you clearly like your business model. But if you keep running it the way you've been running it, Valeant or maybe someone else may take it from you and you might be vulnerable. So I'm just trying to understand as we go forward, what is the solution here? Do you need to be more aggressive or do you just stay the course?","David E. I. Pyott","Well, obviously, we have a very long track record of success, not only on the R&D front, which, of course, has produced a stream of products over a very long period, which, in turn, has not only given us product approvals, but then the ability to create and shape markets. And we have many examples of that with, say, RESTASIS now the largest single eyedrop product in the U.S. If we take the therapeutic dry eye market, fillers, neuromodulators, creating one indication after the other. So clearly, we've performed. Obviously, we're relooking at our plans, given the situation we're in. And when we're ready, we will report back on how we wish to move forward in terms of our organic outlook for the business.","Operator","The next question comes from David Maris with BMO Capital Markets.","David W. Maris - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I have a few questions. First, I'd like to make an imaginary tee time for your imaginary golf course, but I'll leave that one alone. The first, you may have -- I may have missed it, but you're share in injectables this past year and in skin care, you're growing faster than the market. Could you talk a little bit about how much of this is due to the disorganization on the side of competitors undergoing consolidation, what you're hearing anecdotally? And then I have a follow-up.","David E. I. Pyott","Okay. So first of all, in terms of market, I think when you refer to injectables, you probably mean both fillers as well as, let's call it, neuromodulators for aesthetic use. So clearly, the market is accelerating, as I said in my remarks. We estimate the worldwide filler market in Q4 grew 21%. Of course, then look at the number we posted for Q1. So clearly, we're not only expanding the market, but we're gaining share rapidly in every major region and market of the world.","In terms of skin care, I think that comes back around to 2 areas. One is medical dermatology where, clearly, ACZONE is really leading the pack, I think, because it's a combined acne detail to the same practitioner. That's why TAZORAC, after years of relatively flat sales, has now also been accelerating in growth. And then your comment about Allergan versus competitors, this is a theme that I've addressed, I think, over the last 12 to 18 months, so nothing new. But let me reiterate it. And let me, first of all, go over to Novartis and Alcon. And please, there's no overly critical remarks here. It's a statement of fact. When you look at the growth rate of Alcon and pharmaceuticals, it is less than half the rate of Allergan. And that's due to just the state of where we are in terms of our ability to grow, and that's because when you have a flow of new products, typically, you get, in classical pharmaceuticals, a growth spurt for 4, 5, 6 years. And then there's exceptions. Just look at RESTASIS, which is still growing double digit, 10-plus years into the rollout, which means that we have consistently applied market-building exercises. But I think on a very broad scale, going closer to home, we can see virtually in every single business we're in, our competitors have gone through some form of reorganization or reownership. And that has actually led to some opportunities for Allergan to pick up share. And we certainly hear from customers that they really appreciate our strong focus on customer service, as well as on innovation.","David W. Maris - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","As my follow-up, and this is for either Jeff or David, the company has seen great operating margin expansion over the last few years and pretty much leverage on every operating line. Can you talk a little bit about the sustainability of -- we all appreciate the guidance for this year. But is there anything that should make us think that 1 year or 2 or 3 from now that, that leverage shouldn't continue if you continue with your discipline on the operating approach.","David E. I. Pyott","Well, I think Rome wasn't built in a day. And if you invest continuously and in the same themes, usually in my experience, whether it's consumer goods, whether it's OTC, whether it's classical pharmaceuticals, we'll -- there will be a benefit from that. And clearly in the past, we've spoken about our ability to leverage our SG&A ratios over time. And then obviously, given the circumstances, that's something we're thinking about very carefully. And once we finish that work, we, of course, will share it with all of the investment community.","James M. Hindman","[Operator Instructions]","Operator","And the next question comes from Marc Goodman with UBS.","Marc Harold Goodman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I guess, my question is the breast aesthetics business was extremely strong. Can you give us some underlying fundamentals of what was going on there? And then just one other question is just on the pipeline. When do you think we're going to have the next R&D day?","David E. I. Pyott","Okay. I'll try and deal with that one. It was sort of 1 question in 2 parts. So we got the abacus out here. So in terms of R&D day, that's something that, we've historically said, takes place every couple of years. So that's definitely premature to talk about that, although I'm sure, later on, someone's going to ask Scott about all the exciting things coming up over this year alone. In terms of breast aesthetics, at the margin, we have the first sales of SERI scaffold in the U.S. But also, we've had really great success in the U.S. with a focus on higher value-added products. And so units and mix are a completely different story, where you have relatively stagnant units but really great value, i.e. dollar pickup, because of putting our emphasis on the hospital channel, on reconstruction, on tissue expanders and on shaped gel implants. Then overseas, of course, we have some, what I call, really high activity phase. As a reminder, I've stated in my remarks, just literally started with the breast implant line, Natrelle, in Japan. Mexico, where we'd had to take a pause button a while because that's normal, where you're in a discussion with a distributor, a distributor who hadn't been doing a poor job, let me state that, but there's a change. And of course, then there's a lack of emphasis, a lack of focus and you go through a period of doldrums before you come back out again. So -- and then new places like Russia with tremendous growth, both the market, but also us entering the market under our own auspices.","Operator","Next question is from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","David, I wanted to ask about the EPS guidance and your long-term EPS goal. Is it still midteens? And in the past, you said that -- and this is way in the past, that year-over-year stock will get credit for EPS growth above 20%. Do you still believe that to be the case?","David E. I. Pyott","The last statement, I didn't understand, Larry. Could you repeat the last sentence?","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Sorry, but I think in the past that you felt that your stock wouldn't get credit for EPS growth above 20%. Do you still believe that to be the case?","David E. I. Pyott","Well, I think that when it comes to stock predictions, all of you on your side of the phone call are the experts in that. Our job is just to produce the results. In terms of outlook, clearly, we've moved up our range for the year. At this time, we are not making a change to our long-term aspirations, let me repeat those, double-digit sales growth in midteens earnings per share growth. But as you can imagine, given our circumstances, we are working through our strategic plan, taking a really good hard look at it. And once we've come to a conclusion, obviously, that has to be vetted by our board, and then it will be shared at the appropriate time with the investment community.","Operator","Next is from Seamus Fernandez with Leerink.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","So maybe just to follow-up a little bit on Ken's question, I just wanted to get a better sense of -- last year, the stock was relatively weak, but you guys had pretty good visibility on your business trajectory. And I just wanted to get a better sense of what were the limitations, whether or not you would have considered options to lever up, buy back stock. Inversions you've talked about as needing to be obviously strategic. So can you just give us a walk-through of what those -- what may have limited you, if there was anything, from doing that, or if it was just more a philosophical view? And if you could just provide us with your thoughts there.","David E. I. Pyott","Yes, okay. Well, obviously, just addressing the issues that certainly hampered us last year, I think the biggest single one was the uncertainty post August -- or really, post July of what would the potential pathway for generics of cyclosporin be. And that remains still a very open question. Although, a quick reminder, we did issue a very long statement to FDA on that, over 60 pages in length. I think we hear from the scientific and academic community that their view is that the science really is not well established for an assay-based approach. Of course, all of that was quickly eclipsed by the work that we've been doing in secret, in terms of pursuing new intellectual property. And now we have 5 patents issued in the Orange Book. So that -- I don't want to ever say took care something for good, but at least for now, puts us in a strong position. We'll remain vigilant, of course, to any other potential options showing up. And we also have the great news from the court in Texas on LUMIGAN. So that addressed, if you like, operating issues. of course, now, as I alluded to, Scott Whitcup and his team not only have several products to be delivered this year in terms of final product approval, but as in all the earlier earnings calls, we talked about other really important pipeline news coming up in the remainder of 2014. Going back to your second question, which was about potential for stock buybacks where you're addressing the question, \"Why didn't we buy back stock, maybe in, whatever, the '90s?\" Well, of course, one thing, you never know, because we act with great discretion, is what kind of strategic alternatives we were or might have been exploring at that time. And of course, that's a fine balancing act between retaining firepower to do acquisitions; and then if, for whatever reason, you end up with too much cash because that hasn't occurred, then, obviously, there is the other option of engaging in some form of return of cash to shareholders. So that's the way we think about it. And I think it's very strategic versus, \"I'm not a big philosopher, I'm a doer.\"","Operator","Our next question comes from Ronny Gal with Bernstein.","Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","David, I wonder if you can address a few -- couple of the criticisms that are related to the company. One of them is that the majority of the R&D dollars are spent on early-phase research that have not yielded returns, and that way too much money is being spent away from the sales force in SG&A and that amount can be easily cut without damaging the franchises.","David E. I. Pyott","Well, first of all, on R&D, we've stated historically that we spent maybe even less than 10% of the total on early-stage discovery. And of course, I'd like to point out that the lion's share of that relates to neuromodulators. So I think it would be unwise for a company thinking about the long term, not to think about when you can command the world's market of neurotoxins to ask yourself -- and not only ask yourself, but do something about next generation in improvements. So I think -- when you think back on the productivity of R&D, from every survey we've seen -- and this isn't us doing our own surveys. This is others doing surveys. We have always been at the very top quartile of R&D productivity in terms of success rates, as well as dollars spent on products produced. I think also -- moving on to the second point about sales force, this is a quick reminder. We actually have, in terms of salespeople, over 3,500 people on the road today. But when you reflect upon my remarks this morning, just classical share of voice detailing -- I think that's an era of the past. And of course, I don't want to talk about whatever excesses may have existed in the pharmaceutical industry 10 or 15 years ago, but those times are over. If you think about our model, it's so much more sophisticated in terms of reimbursement services, hands-on physician training, direct-to-consumer. In its essence, Allergan is an amalgam of pharmaceuticals, medical devices, as well as consumer goods. And just take BOTOX as an example, the world's most complicated biopharmaceutical in terms of molecular structure and complexity. Yet in terms of how it's used is really more akin to a medical device because we have to teach the physician, once they've learned about the pharmacology, how do they actually inject it to get the maximum benefit for their patient. And then finally, of course, if we stick to BOTOX, then we've not only conducted patient education campaigns for the aesthetic -- I'll then use the word customer because they're not really patients. But then also, for the patient, if you think about our work to build and establish the market for Chronic Migraine. So I would argue that we think very carefully about where we spend our money. And we believe we've had great returns. And I would then ask you just to think about the growth that we have. There are not so many companies that are growing currently. You just look at our numbers, 14% in the quarter based on a broad suite of products. Of course, there are other companies, I acknowledge their tremendous achievements, often driven by 1 or 2 products. Ours is driven by a very, very broad range, which gives you long-term stability and long-term prospects for sustainable growth.","Operator","The next question comes from Liav Abraham with Citi.","Liav Abraham - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just following up on the topic of SG&A spend and particularly DTC. You use DTC extensively and to great effect. And Jeff, in your remarks you did mention a positive return on this. Can you quantify this a little bit more for us? What is the historic return that you've seen from your investment in the use of DTC, and how much has this actually contributed to the growth of BOTOX, RESTASIS and ACZONE?","David E. I. Pyott","Yes. Well, of course, there's always a fair bit of art, as well as science. And of course, when you, for instance, invest heavily in BOTOX for Chronic Migraine, you have to be able to dissect your various elements of your marketing mix in terms of what was the value of DTC versus the value of training versus the value of making access possible through reimbursement. But from everything we can see on every single product, I would purport, on a spend last year, which was just under $200 million -- net of all the rebates because obviously, at list you'd have a different price. But we, too, given our scale, get rebates just like our customers, and managed care get rebates from us. So for that, just under $200 million, we would argue that we have less than a 1-year payback on our investments.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So it appears, David, that you plan to share or you've suggested that you plan to share a new organic growth outlook near term for investors. But when do you expect to comment on strategic considerations?","David E. I. Pyott","Well, that's kind of fairly difficult to answer today because, clearly, we are considering and evaluating the proposal from Valeant. Once we've completed that work, then I think we're in a better position to talk about, a, what decision have we arrived at, and secondly then, flowing from that decision, what kind of options are on the table. So I apologize, but I just can't give you any concrete answer today.","Operator","And our next question comes from Vamil Divan with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Vamil Divan - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just more on the guidance here, especially on the sales side. You've obviously bumped up your guidance for the full year. The individual line item guidance for most of your key products are really -- all of them really seem to be really unchanged. So can you just explain that, I guess, which products exactly, do you think, are doing much better than you thought they were 3 months ago? Or is it that many of them are doing a little bit better and that's why the overall guidance is going up with the individual key products, like BOTOX, RESTASIS and all those? Do you think it can just still be in the same line of what you expected last -- a quarter ago?","David E. I. Pyott","Yes. Well, if you look at the way we've historically dealt with this, this early in the year, normally, we don't change the top end of our guidance at all. Because as much as we're obviously really excited and happy about the performance of, say, dermal fillers or RESTASIS, if you change one line item, I could also say there may be other things that the margins are just fractionally lower than we may have thought 3 months ago. But I think the important thing is to see typically what we've done. We brought up the lower end of the guidance. You can all go and do the math for yourself, $125 million. And it's very rare that we do this early in the year, that we raise the top end of the sales guidance and we've done that by $50 million. And of course, we've made a clear signal about our ability to leverage. And some of it is driven by gross margin, which Jeff went through, which, frankly, is better than we had expected in our operating plan. And that's driven both by good manufacturing, but also by richer product mix, skewing us higher up in gross margin.","Operator","Your next question comes from Annabel Samimy with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Annabel Samimy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","I just wanted to ask you about RESTASIS. You did a great job protecting that franchise from the patents that you had issue. But there are some developments on the branded competitive side. Shire, I guess, is moving forward with the filing of their dry eye product and you've got 11 biotherapeutics that has their own Phase III programs. So can you give us any sense on the timing of some developments on RESTASIS X, when we might be seeing some data there and any other R&D that you might be having in this space, any developments on that side?","David E. I. Pyott","All right. Let me take the marketing question first, and then I'll pass the science question back to the expert sitting opposite me. On the marketing side, first of all, I never take the view -- as much as I like to be the one and only, which I suppose, in clearer terms, means the monopolist. It's kind of nice as long as that lasts but I think it's also unhealthy. Any healthy market, over the long term, should have multiple product offerings. And my experience over 30 years has been new products offer new solutions to different types of patients, i.e. expand the markets. So I always think market expansion, patient solution. And at some point, one of these other programs will make its way through Phase III to eventual product approval. And you can certainly rest assured that we know everything about the science from many of these products; some in the public domain, some that we have looked at historically, where we know a lot more probably than anybody on this call because we make it our job to do such. So now let me go over to Scott because he will talk about not only RESTASIS X, but also many other ideas we have about dry eye in the next several years.","Scott M. Whitcup","So I'd agree with David. There are clearly a number of other products in development, although I'd remind people that there have been many programs before that have gone through trials, and therapeutic dry eye is a tough area and very difficult to get the right trial design and then the results that support approval. You mentioned RESTASIS X. So we are actually in the process of training physicians for the trial and getting ready to kick that off. So you'll get more detail on that probably second half of the year as we roll that trial out. But what's exciting is that we have a couple of new chemical entities, 2 NCEs going into the clinic for dry eye. So one will hit the clinic this year, and then a second one is planned to go into the clinic next year. So we continue to invest a fair bit in an area that we've developed. And so in addition to RESTASIS X, you'll see a couple of NCEs for -- specifically for dry eye.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Buck with Buckingham Research Group.","David G. Buck - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","My question, I guess, for David is just in terms of R&D and SG&A spend. I'm curious, number one, whether before the past 3 weeks you've had any pushback from investors about your level of spending for both of those items? And secondly, you've seen in the -- particularly the specialty pharmaceutical group, companies that have decided to curtail or at least modify some of their priorities in spending and -- namely Shire and Forest Labs, and were able to deliver some savings. Has Allergan looked at that in the last 12 months in terms of either financial partners on R&D or more prioritization of spending? I know you've gone the opposite direction short term, but how do you sort of justify the spending levels? And again, had that been a controversy with investors before the last couple of 3 weeks?","David E. I. Pyott","Well, let me start with R&D. I think there's so many examples of how we have had such good turn rates in R&D relative to the rest of the industry. And that, frankly, is what's been driving the growth over the last -- particularly the last 12 months. We're in one of those cyclical upswings but not due to one product. That will be typical in normal biopharmaceutical companies, but on a very, very broad basis. Coming back to SG&A, this is a discussion that we've had not only with investors over a long time because you'll all remember asking us when will you get down into the mid 30s with SG&A, and we have probably been slow to go there because we continue to invest. So let me go to the internal discussion, which is not only at the top management level, but also with our Board of Directors. And we really started that discussion 9 -- well, about 9 months ago, when we reviewed our last strategic plan, where we asked ourselves, \"Our markets are so healthy. They're all growing very well and we're doing well within them.\" Going back to that comment about competition in general weakening around us, which is good for Allergan and Allergan stockholders, but could we do more? And we gave ourselves that challenge. And frankly, I gave that challenge to our new President of the company, Doug Ingram, to say, \"You're the new guy. You're relatively unencumbered by the past in this role. And think what more we could do.\" And we have been working on that and obviously, that's being fed into our deliberations in terms of looking at an updated strategic plan. And as I stated, at some point, that will be appropriate an opportunity to be shared what the output of that plan is with the overall investment community and especially Allergan stockholders.","Operator","The next question is from David Steinberg with Jefferies.","David Michael Steinberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Question on breast aesthetics. This has largely been a 2-player competition for several years. But in the last, say, 12 to 18 months, there's been a new entrant, Sientra, and it appears that they've gained fairly solid share, some surveys showing 10% or even more. Yet at the same time, you posted very strong growth, particularly in the U.S. As they build their business, are you concerned on the margin? Or do you just feel like you're playing in a completely different market segment at this point?","David E. I. Pyott","Right. First of all, I think we've been able to detach ourselves from, let's call it, the share conditions in units because of our focus on value and premium-priced products. And with respect to our competitors, both of them are doing a good job, no issue about that. And I think both Mentor and Sientra have concentrated more of their efforts on the augmentation market in private practice, and that is where most of the price competition is occurring. So we're not immune to that. We have lost some limited share in the augmentation market, but of course, that's normal when a third player comes in. It would be difficult to imagine that you would -- that the first 2 don't lose something. And despite that, as you very ably said, we've been able to have very good sales growth.","Operator","And our next question comes from Shibani Malhotra with Sterne Agee.","Shibani Malhotra - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","So a question for David. There's been a lot of consolidation in the industry. And without getting into the specifics of the Valeant bid for Allergan, can you just talk about the opportunities and risks -- or rather the benefits and risks of actually developing scale in -- by emerging with a company like Valeant in key areas like ophthalmology and aesthetics. I mean, how will you -- what are your considerations when you're looking to evaluate the proposal, I guess?","David E. I. Pyott","Yes. I really can't talk about how they should evaluate the proposal. That's their job. All I can state is who we are. And clearly, when you look at our share positions, we're #2 in ophthalmology, growing considerably faster now than the #1, which is Novartis Alcon. Clearly, we're the leader in aesthetics. And we're creating brand-new markets in neurology and urology and, of course, adding margin in new products such as LEVADEX around them. So we have scale. If somebody else thinks it benefits from even greater scale, that's their job to think about it, not mine.","Operator","And then we have another question from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","David E. I. Pyott","Next.","Operator","Next question is David Amsellem from Piper Jaffray.","David Amsellem - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","So in the neuromodulator space, one of your potential competitors recently had data on a potential long-acting injectable neuromodulator and they're also developing a topical. And I'm wondering, what are your thoughts on these potential next-generation neuromodulator products and the potential threat to your franchise?","Scott M. Whitcup","This is Scott. We spend -- as David said, the one area that do spend R&D dollars, early-stage and focus on is in the neuromodulators. So we look at not outside, but we have internal programs. I've stated before that we do have a BOTOX X program. And we will probably give some additional details on that program second half of the year. And our goal ourselves is to have a novel molecule with a potential for either higher dose and\/or longer duration. So we look internally and continue to look on the outside as well.","Operator","Andrew Finkelstein with Susquehanna.","Andrew Finkelstein - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Maybe you could just finish up with addressing -- you talked about all the product approvals around the world, but maybe sum it up in terms of where you stand in terms of rolling out the portfolio, particularly across the emerging markets. And what more can be done to accelerate that platform to contribute to your growth?","David E. I. Pyott","Well, obviously, when we look at the emerging markets, you look at the biggest ones first. And we know we have a very strong position in India. We're by far the largest ophthalmic pharmaceutical company there. And of course, that gives us a platform for layering in all the other businesses on top of that. China, the other very big market, rapidly growing ophthalmic business, rapidly growing BOTOX business. We're working to get our fillers in there. And then I mentioned, in terms of a huge country in terms of population, Indonesia. We've just set up direct operations there. And then Russia, we're doing extremely well, market's buoyant. And on the aesthetic side, we have a strong position in ophthalmology we kind of started from greenfield. But that's fine because people know the value of our products in terms of Russian ophthalmologists traveling to North America or Western Europe. They're well aware of all the data on our products, as well as the image and performance of the company.","James M. Hindman","We'd like to thank you for your participation today. If you have any further questions, Joann Bradley, David Nakasone and I will be available immediately following the call. Joann will now take 5 minutes to review market share data.","Joann Bradley","Thank you, Jim.

My name is LaShonda, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the third quarter earnings conference call. Thank you. I will now turn today's call over to Lisa DeFrancesco to begin. Please go ahead.","Lisa M. DeFrancesco - Allergan Plc","Thank you, LaShonda, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to the Allergan third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release reporting Allergan earnings from continuing operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. The press release and our slide deck, which we are presenting this morning, are available on our corporate website at www.allergan.com. We're conducting a live webcast of this call, a replay of which will be available on our website after the conclusion. Please note that today's call is copyrighted material of Allergan and cannot be rebroadcast without company's express written consent.","Turning to slide 2, I'd also like to remind you, during the course of this call, management will make projections or other forward-looking remarks regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. It's important to note that such statements and events are forward-looking statements and reflect our current perspective of the business trends and information as of today's date. Actual results may differ from current expectations and projections depending on a number of factors affecting the Allergan business. These factors are detailed in our periodic public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Allergan disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements except as expressly required by law.","Turning to slide 3 in our agenda this morning, with us on today's call are Brent Saunders, our Chairman, CEO, and President, who will provide an overview of our third quarter business highlights; Bill Meury, our Chief Commercial Officer, will provide an overview of our commercial performance in the quarter; David Nicholson, our Chief R&D Officer, will provide highlights from our pipeline achievements in 2016 and upcoming milestones; and Tessa Hilado, our Chief Financial Officer, will discuss the Allergan third quarter continuing operations results in more detail. Also on the call and available during the Q&A are Rob Stuart, our Chief Operating Officer, and Bob Bailey, our Chief Legal Officer.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Brent.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Great. Thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. At Allergan, we continue to take bold actions as we move forward with our Growth Pharma agenda. We continue to drive top-tier revenue growth and top-tier profitability. We are also making strategic Open Science investments to build even greater depth, breadth, and capabilities in our R&D pipeline. In the third quarter, we added shareholder-friendly capital allocation to our story, with a $5 billion share buyback that we completed ahead of schedule. And today we are announcing a new board-approved action to increase return for shareholders and take our capital allocation plans to a new level.","In addition to doing the things that make Allergan strong financially, we're also taking bold actions in these turbulent times, when the price of healthcare is in the spotlight. A good example is our Social Contract with Patients. We are leading the way with responsible pricing ideals for our branded therapeutic products, and we are leading the conversation to codify what our social contract means to us. It means balancing investment and innovation with pricing and access, as well as quality and education. The Social Contract is Allergan's commitment to the people who count on us to find new treatments for their most pressing medical needs, and it is good for Allergan. So why are we able to be so bold and adopt a Social Contract? Because it is the right thing to do, and because we have such strong confidence that our business and our R&D pipeline will sustain our future growth.","Turning to slide 6, the two major actions we announced today demonstrate our deep-seated conviction in the future revenue growth, as well as strong cash flows, from our business. Over the last quarter, we have spent a lot of time looking at various opportunities to deploy our reloaded balance sheet to increase shareholder return, and our board of directors has acted. The actions we are taking today illustrate that we are focused on increasing shareholder return. First, we are beefing up our share repurchase program to a total of $15 billion. Second, we are initiating a $0.70-per-share quarterly dividend for the very first time.","Let me start with the enhanced share repurchase program. Since the Teva close, we've been aggressively buying our stock in the open market and have already repurchased $5 billion of our own stock. While we believe that our stock should be trading significantly higher than it is today, the current market conditions create an opportunity to repurchase significantly more stock. There is no more accretive asset on our radar than our own stock. So our board of directors has authorized an additional $5 billion repurchase. This brings our total share repurchase authorization to $15 billion. Now we are moving quickly to purchase the remaining $10 billion through an accelerated share repurchase program, or ASR, which allows us for significant upfront share count reduction.","Next, the dividend. For the first time, our board has approved a cash dividend to return cash flow to shareholders on an ongoing basis. The initiation of a dividend is consistent with our Growth Pharma profile, the free cash flow that our business generates, and our desire to increase shareholder return. This dividend will be funded from our ongoing cash flow without dipping into the proceeds from our Teva transaction. And we expect it to grow annually while maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings. And we retain the vast majority of our firepower and flexibility to continue to invest in our business, acquire additional stepping-stone assets, and provide fuel for sustainable top line growth. Our capital allocation actions are intended to balance shareholder return with the investment for future growth.","Turning to our operating performance on slide 7 and our report card on how we did this quarter. Obviously, we are disappointed that our results this quarter did not meet our expectations, and therefore we are revising our 2016 full-year guidance. However, we believe that we are incredibly well-positioned for 2017 and beyond. So let's look at the health of our company. In my view, there are five key measures to gauge the health and growth prospects of any biopharmaceutical company. First, how are the promoted products doing? Second, how are the new product launches going? Third, how are the established products faring near the end of their patent lives when they're no longer being promoted? Fourth, how is the pipeline progressing? And, finally, how is the company performing against key profitability metrics?","Allergan continues to generate sales growth that is at the top end of our peer group. Sales were $3.6 billion, up more than 7%, excluding Namenda IR, divestitures, FX, and other adjustments. Our key promoted products are growing nicely, most of them double-digit. Our new product launches are performing exceptionally well. I'm absolutely thrilled with how we are doing with our key brands and future growth drivers. Our pipeline is on a roll, and our profitability metrics are in the top tier of our peer group. Where we missed the mark was among a few of our established brands and non-promoted products. All in all, the report card for growth looks good this quarter, setting us up for growth in 2017 and beyond.","Even with the weakness in our established and non-promoted products, we retain a top-tier profitability profile with a gross margin of 87.8% and an operating margin of 49.3%. These metrics were a little lighter this quarter, partly due to investments we are making in manufacturing to support continued strong growth of Botox and our Eye Care products and continued promotional investment behind our brands, and increased R&D investment versus last year. Our non-GAAP EPS was $3.32. I am confident that our team has made the right investments in our business and has laid a strong foundation for top-tier growth and profitability.","You can see on slide 8 that the majority of our top-level products are growing, and along with the new launches they represent 73% of our total revenue. Many of them are growing double-digit rates, including Botox, up 15%; Restasis, up 13%; Linzess up 42%, our filler line up 21%; Lo Loestrin up 16%; Ozurdex up 25%. I'm also proud to see new product launches contributing more than $90 million this quarter. This is a top-tier growth story.","On the established and non-promoted products, we had more erosion than expected on Namenda XR and our mesalamine-containing products, which are facing in-class competition from generic drugs and have had some formulary disruption. Our future is not driven by these established products. Our future is built on our growth products, which is why I am so confident in it. Overall, our business is very healthy, and it's a very good picture to have so many products growing so strongly.","Before handing off to Bill, I'd like to mention the progress we're making in R&D to build and deliver our pipeline. The team is doing an exceptional job. Our R&D productivity is strong. Already this year we've had 19 major pharma and device product approvals and 11 major submissions. We've also reached some key milestones, such as the approval of our multidose Restasis and a positive relamorelin Phase 2b results that were announced just last week. Relamorelin was one of our early Open Science deals. We used an option agreement to gain access to this promising treatment for gastroparesis. Now that relamorelin has demonstrated broad efficacy and tolerability in a Phase 2b trial, we have exercised our option to acquire Motus and plan to take relamorelin into Phase 3 trials within Allergan.","We have also completed six new stepping-stone deals this quarter, which are helping to build even greater pipeline depth and breadth in our therapeutic areas. In addition to pipeline-building acquisition, we are also very interested in accretive acquisitions. While we continue to look for these accretive acquisitions, the most accretive acquisition for us today is in our own stock.","Now let me turn the call over to Bill Meury, our Chief Commercial Officer.","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Thanks, Brent. Good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 11, our core business was strong in the third quarter. Sales in all seven therapeutic areas increased versus prior year. Five of the seven therapeutic areas grew at a high-single or double-digit rate. And, as Brent mentioned, the majority of our revenue is made up of top products and new launches that all together are growing at a double-digit rate. This is a high-quality business and the foundation for 2017.","Eye Care sales increased by 10%, powered by Restasis, which showed durability in the third quarter with a sales increase of 13% versus prior year, and Ozurdex, which was up 19% in the United States and 29% internationally. And we look forward to the launch of two new dry-eye products over the next six months.","In CNS, sales increased by 3%. Botox therapeutic sales increased 16% globally versus the prior year, coupled with continued strong performance by Vraylar. Offsetting the growth in these products was a reduction in Namenda XR sales, driven by lower demand and a higher discount rate to maintain broad formulary coverage. We're seeing an early and strong market response to the new indication for Namzaric.","In Aesthetics, sales increased by 14%, driven by Botox and fillers. Demand for Kybella is projected to increase significantly in the next two quarters as our DTC campaign reaches more and more consumers. Overall, demand for our Aesthetic product line in the United States and internationally, among dermatologists and plastic surgeons and across age demographics, is very strong. And we're as optimistic about this part of the business as we've ever been.","In GI, sales increased by 9%. Linzess, our flagship and fastest-growing product, continues to produce strong results, up 42% year over year. And Viberzi demand has been exceptional. Mesalamine's revenue declined overall due to lower promotion, loss of formulary coverage, and the loss of exclusivity for Asacol HD. And, finally, we continue to see strong growth in our Women's Health franchise, with sales up 15%, as well as nice performance from Urology.","Let's dig into some of our products. On slide 12, you see our flagship IBS products, Linzess and Viberzi. Demand for both products is very strong across the board and regardless of metric. Both products are attracting new users each week. Both products are being used in a broad range of patients. Both products are taking share from the OTC market. Both have excellent formulary coverage. And both are being supported by significant promotional programs. The outlook for Linzess and Viberzi is excellent. Sales for Linzess are up 42% versus prior year. And approximately 73% of new business for Linzess is coming from the OTC market, which is exactly what we want. And we're preparing to launch the Linzess 72 mcg product, which is designed to accelerate conversion of the OTC market. Based on sales, Viberzi is trending at approximately 90% of Linzess during the same time period post-launch. Demand for this product is robust, and with IMS prescription levels having reached an all-time high last week, we are very optimistic about the future.","Turning to slide 13. Our Medical Aesthetics business accounts for approximately 20% of total sales and includes three key products: Botox, fillers, and Kybella. This is a high-quality, double-digit growth cash business and an expanding market, both domestically and internationally. The fundamentals here are the following: Allergan has product line depth which no other company can match and which creates cross-selling opportunities. In other words, one product builds on the next. Botox is a gateway for the fillers, and Kybella is a gateway to Botox. Allergan has a steady stream of new, innovative product launches on the way. We invest more in education and training than any other company in the space, and we have market share leadership in a category that could double in size in the next five-plus years.","There are four major trends driving Aesthetics' market expansion. First, more physicians are moving into aesthetics worldwide. Next, we are training more injectors. Third, there's a youth movement; attitudes towards aesthetic procedures are changing across the world. That is especially true in the 20- to 30-year-old age segment. And, finally, there's a male movement. With the launch of Kybella, we are seeing more interest by men in aesthetic procedures, and we expect this trend to accelerate over time.","Now, I often get asked about the durability of Botox and future sales growth, which is an important topic. What you can see on slide 14 is this: As successful as we've been with Botox, as popular and widely used as Botox is, we've only scratched the surface of our three primary growth indications: aesthetics, migraine, and overactive bladder. Utilization by the eligible patient population in each area is still low, ranging from 3% to 7%. If these numbers were in the 15% to 20% range, one might anticipate growth moderation, but they're not. We believe we will sustain high growth rates for Botox for at least several more years, and that is why we continue to invest in sales and marketing, manufacturing, and research and development, and why we are confident in the future.","Turning to slide 15, with Vraylar, we're about 33 weeks into the launch, and prescription levels are increasing week over week at faster than the market. The product is clearly distinguished by its pharmacology, symptom relief, and metabolic profile for both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Vraylar's trajectory is strong, and the future of Vraylar is promising.","With Namzaric, we're relaunching on all fronts, with the sales force engaged in a DTC campaign ready to go in less than two weeks. We are already seeing a significant increase in sales in both the retail and long-term care settings. This is the first time we have an option for transitioning patients from monotherapy Aricept to Namzaric, and we're capitalizing on that opportunity with a starter kit that early on is getting a great deal of traction. So the differences here, as compared to several months ago, are the indication for Namzaric is complete, the availability of starter kits is plentiful, and formulary coverage is widespread. I think this franchise demonstrates the nimbleness and power of our commercial capabilities as we move from one innovation to the next.","Turning to slide 16. No company has more to offer in the Eye Care space than Allergan. Overall, the dry-eye market has expanded significantly since the launch of a second treatment option. At the same time, volume and sales for Restasis have been durable. Sales for Restasis were up 13% versus prior year. This growth was supported by strong unit demand in both ophthalmology and optometry. The growth in the overall market is being fueled primarily by new patients who are on OTC tear products or receiving no treatment at all. New investments and innovations for dry eye will continue to drive the market and our business. We recently received FDA approval for Restasis Multidose, which will launch in the fourth quarter. And then True Tear, which is a nasal neurostimulator that we are planning for a staged launch beginning in 2017. True Tear is a non-drop treatment for dry eye. I just returned from the AAO meeting, and this is getting a great deal of interest from the Eye Care community.","Turning to slide 17 and our international business. Sales in our international business totaled nearly $700 million in the third quarter. Every single region grew in the high-single or double-digit rate. Western Europe is our largest region, and we expect Asia-Pacific will be our leading international growth contributor, with China the fastest growing aesthetics market in the world. NESEE \u2013 North, East, and Southeast Europe \u2013 is our fastest growing region, up 26% this quarter, excluding FX. Medical Aesthetics and Eye Care anchor our business internationally. Sales for Botox Cosmetic and our filler line were up 18% and 25%, excluding FX respectively. We've launched Belkyra, Kybella in the United States, in Europe and plan to have it in 10 countries by the end of the year.","In terms of Eye Care, glaucoma is our largest product line, and retina is the fastest growing. In glaucoma, we're launching a multidose, preservative-free formulation of Ganfort. And we have our Xen gel stent, which is a minimally invasive procedure to lower IOP. Xen launched in 10 international markets already this year, and we look forward to its potential approval and launch in 2017 in the United States. In retina, Ozurdex has a very strong following in Western Europe, and in 2017, we will expand geographically with launches in Brazil and Australia.","GI product launches are also underway in our international markets, with Constella, Linzess in the United States, launched in key countries, and Truberzi, Viberzi in the United States, planned for 2017.","Beyond the results of the quarter, we're excited about the upcoming new product launches. in Eye Care, we're focused on the launch of Restasis Multidose, Xen, and True Tear. And in medical dermatology, oxymetazoline, now called Rofade. In the GI space, we're launching a lower dose of Linzess, or Linzess 72 mcg, as I mentioned. In cardiology, we've recently launched Byvalson, which is a combination of Bystolic and Valsartan. In infectious disease, we will see Avycaz return to full supply before year-end and with full indications for UTI and intra-abdominal infections.","We expect formulary coverage to continue to be strong in 2017. We will continue to invest in and leverage our platform of capabilities, which include physician and consumer e-commerce programs, DTC, and a well-trained and customized sales force. Allergan has share-of-voice leadership in nearly every market, is number two in the industry in direct-to-consumer spending, and has one of the most productive sales forces in the industry. And that is why I believe the fundamentals of our business are healthy and our growth outlook is excellent.","With that, I'll turn the call over to David.","C. David Nicholson - Allergan Plc","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 20. Before I discuss our R&D productivity, a few remarks on our Open Science model. Open Science is an R&D philosophy focused on two key elements. The first, building the pipeline, defines our approach to identifying, acquiring, and developing the best game-changing ideas and innovation. We are agnostic where innovation comes from: academic research centers, venture-backed startup companies, R&D-based public companies, or our own research centers. This maximizes our ability to deliver true innovation to the healthcare system, and most importantly, to the patients who need breakthrough medicine to treat their unmet needs.","The second and very important element of Open Science is our ability and success in delivering the pipeline. Once we complete an acquisition or in-license a product, our teams advance development, prepare for regulatory approval, and drive life-cycle innovation for innovative products that helps patients. We do this whilst remaining a true partner with our external collaborators. As Brent mentioned, we have achieved 19 total major pharma and device global approvals and 11 major regulatory submissions so far this year. These outstanding results have been delivered by a team of more than 2,000 dedicated scientists, R&D professionals who are delivering important new treatments for patients. This team will be the fuel that delivers more products from our pipeline of 70 mid- to late-stage programs.","Turning to slide 21, we are adding differentiated compounds and programs across our key therapeutic areas. We've added six stepping-stone acquisitions since the second quarter. These are channelrhodopsin-2, a novel, innovative gene therapy for the treatment of retinitis pigmentosa, a leading cause of blindness. Second, a periocular ring designed for extended drug delivery to the eye. The first product reduces elevated intraocular pressure in glaucoma patients. Third, ROR gamma t inhibitors and LXR beta agonists, highly differentiated compounds for the treatment of psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. Fourth and fifth, Cenicriviroc or CVC, Evogliptin, and our FXR agonist. These establish a portfolio of differentiated NASH compounds that could provide combination therapy for this multifactorial disease. Finally, a monoclonal antibody selectively targeting IL-23 for the treatment of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and potentially other autoimmune disorders.","Turning to slide 22. We have made significant progress in advancing major programs. In Eye Care, last week we announced FDA approval of the Restasis Multidose, a preservative-free multidose bottle of Restasis. Bill has already discussed the launch of this new product for patients suffering from dry-eye disease. In CNS, and as we previously promised, we have now initiated our Phase 3 program for ubrogepant for the acute treatment of migraine, and we have initiated our Phase 2b program for atogepant in migraine prophylaxis.","As we have also previously promised, we have started a Phase 3 study for rapastinel in major depressive disorder. We expect to have top line results for the short-term studies in early 2019. But, remember, we need to complete the maintenance study before we can file. As a reminder, we are also developing apimostinel and an earlier small-molecule compound as next-generation oral NMDA receptor modulators for the treatment of MDD. Internationally, we received a positive opinion from the EU for Truberzi in GI disorders, and we expect to launch that product in international markets in 2017. In Urology, the FDA's Bone, Reproductive and Urologic Drugs Advisory Committee voted recently in favor of approval for SER120 for the treatment of nocturia. We look forward to working with the agency on the approval of this product.","Looking ahead, we have a number of near-term pipeline deliverables. In CNS, many of you have asked me about our plans regarding cariprazine and the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. After discussions with the FDA, we plan to file an sNDA for cariprazine for this disorder in the first half of 2017. We also expect to announce Phase 2 top line results for Botox in depression in the second half of next year. Regarding Semprana, our inhalable dihydroergotamine treatment for acute migraine, we have resolved the issues raised by the FDA during their previous review and continue to work on scale-up in manufacturability, which may result in submission in the second half of 2017.","Turning to medical dermatology. We will shortly initiate later Phase 2 studies with our lead ROR gamma t inhibitor in psoriasis. Also, we will complete Phase 3 trials for sarecycline, a potential treatment for acne, in early 2017. We've recently received data from an early development study with our LXR beta agonist. In this study, target engagement was not satisfactorily achieved, so we need to re-evaluate the concentration used and formulation utilized.","Now, GI. First, some breaking news for CVC, Cenicriviroc. We plan to initiate Phase 3 trials mid-next year. At a recent end of Phase 2 meeting, the FDA agreed that the compound is Phase 3-ready and that the primary endpoint should be reduction in fibrosis by one stage without worsening of steatohepatitis. Remember, this is the endpoint that was achieved at year one in the ongoing CVC CENTAUR study. The one-year data will be presented as an oral late breaker at the forthcoming liver meeting in Boston. The CENTAUR study, meanwhile, continues, with two-year data available mid-next year. We also expect to have Phase 2a data for brazikumab, an oral IL-23 monoclonal antibody for the treatment of Crohn's disease, in the first half of 2017.","In Women's Health, we will have the second Phase 3 results for Esmya in uterine fibroids early next year, with filing plans later in the year. Turning to Eye Care, Bill has already discussed True Tear and Xen. As you know, we have an option agreement with Mimetogen for tavilermide in dry-eye disease. The first two Phase 3 trials have been completed, and the Mimetogen team are presently evaluating the data.","Turning to slide 23, we recently announced our decision to exercise our option for relamorelin. Data obtained from both the Phase 2a and Phase 2b trials are shown on this slide. I am showing here the efficacy of relamorelin in comparison to placebo on a four-point composite endpoint of nausea; post-prandial fullness, or early satiety; abdominal pain; and bloating. In both studies, relamorelin was significantly more effective than placebo. In the Phase 2a study on the left, I am showing the results in a subgroup of patients with a high incidence of vomiting at a dose of 10 mcg of relamorelin. In this subgroup, vomiting was also significantly decreased following relamorelin administration. For the Phase 2b trial, I am showing the average of efficacy of three doses of relamorelin, 10, 30, and 100 mcg, in comparison to placebo in all patients. In these patients, there was a substantial reduction in vomiting in relamorelin-treated patients in this trial. There was also a substantial placebo reduction in vomiting. This placebo effect was surprising to investigators, KOLs, and our internal team. We are working to understand this placebo effect, which as you all know can occur in clinical studies.","Recent draft FDA guidance on diabetic gastroparesis drug development specifies that the use of an endpoint that measures each of the core symptoms and signs of the disease separately or as a composite with a responder definition is recommended for the development of novel agents. So we believe that that the data shown on this slide will be suitable for progression of the compound into Phase 3. We are very excited about the prospect of bringing a new treatment to millions of patients who are suffering from this condition. No new drug has been approved since 1983.","As I have outlined, we continue to make great progress with our Open Science model, with tremendous results just in the third quarter. We have many more milestones ahead to deliver for the remainder of the year and into 2017. Our ability to identify and acquire the best science, matched with our strong results in advancing innovation, validates Open Science. As always, I thank our global R&D team for their outstanding work and dedication in driving innovations, delivering results, and for their commitment to the work ahead for the patients we serve.","I will now turn the call over to Tessa.","Maria Teresa Hilado - Allergan Plc","Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Please note that the discussion of continuing operations financial results excludes both global generics and Anda, following the completion of our global generics divestiture in Q3 and the sale of Anda in Q4.","Turning to slide 25, before I begin reviewing the results for the quarter, I wanted to first expand on some of Brent's earlier remarks on our capital allocation decisions announced this morning. Following the receipt of the Teva proceeds, we immediately took steps to strengthen our balance sheet through debt paydown. We started repurchasing our shares in late August, and we completed $5 billion in share repurchases in October, ahead of schedule. We purchased a total of 21 million shares at an average price of approximately $238 per share. We also continued to focus on evaluating options to further increase shareholder value. We therefore expanded our share repurchases by $5 billion to $15 billion in total and announced the initiation of a dividend to begin in 2017.","First, I want to expand on the share repurchase. We concluded that there is no better investment than in our own stock. As we announced this morning, we will be executing the remaining $10 billion, utilizing an accelerated share repurchase program, or ASR. As you may all know, an ASR program allows us to reduce a significant portion of shares up front. Since the last conference call, we continued to evaluate various methods to repurchase shares. In conjunction with our advisers, we have since developed an ASR structure that meets Irish legal requirements. Approximately $8 billion worth of shares will be retired during the month of November 2016. The remaining shares, if any, under the program will be received and retired by the third quarter of 2017 upon completion of the ASR. Completion of the ASR could occur sooner subject to market conditions. Up to 50% of the ASR program will be hedged based upon the stock price over a reference period through a collar transaction.","Second, we initiated a dividend starting in Q1 2017. Our company has transformed over the last 18 months to a pure-branded growth pharma company with a strong pipeline and strong growth prospects. Given our conviction in the future of our current business and our ability to generate strong cash flow, we decided to initiate the dividend. The dividend will be funded by our ongoing cash flow while allowing for further investment in growth. We are committed to growing this dividend annually for shareholders.","Turning to slide 26, we remain committed to our investment-grade ratings. We expect to continue to strengthen our balance sheet through debt repayment. We have already repaid close to $10 billion in debt this year, and we have an additional $6.5 billion in contractual maturities which we intend to pay over the next 18 months. In addition, we ended the quarter with $27.4 billion in cash and marketable securities.","Turning to our overall results for the third quarter of 2016 on slide 27. In Q3, we delivered strong year-over-year performance. Continuing operations net revenues, which now exclude Anda distribution, were $3.62 billion, a 4.5% increase versus prior year, primarily impacted by Asacol HD loss of exclusivity, divestitures, and lower-than-expected Namenda IR and XR. Excluding Namenda IR, divestitures and FX, and an out-of-period adjustment related to discontinued operations which impacted the third quarter of last year by $31.7 million, net revenues increased 7.4%. Gross margins for the third quarter remain strong at almost 88%. The decline versus prior year was driven primarily by higher production costs related to capacity expansion and manufacturing variances. These were costs that are accounted for within corporate and did not impact any of the segment margins, which remained very strong. Operating margins declined versus last year to 49.3%, impacted by higher sales and marketing investment to continue to support ongoing launches such as Vraylar, Viberzi, and Kybella, and other marketing spend for key products, as well as higher investments in R&D as a result of more projects versus the prior year.","Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.32 primarily reflect the loss of exclusivity of Namenda IR and Asacol HD and lower sales of Namenda XR, higher SG&A and R&D spend compared with the third quarter of 2015. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 8.2% in the quarter. Cash flow from operations for the third quarter was negative this quarter at approximately $1 billion, primarily as a result of cash tax payments of approximately $2.6 billion related to the gain from the sale of our generics business to Teva. Excluding this and the impact of R&D asset acquisition and restructuring payments, cash flow from operations remains very strong at positive $1.72 billion. The GAAP equivalents to our financial metrics can be found in our earnings release issued this morning and posted on our website.","Turning now to our U.S. Specialized Therapeutics results on slide 28. The business continued to deliver strong performance year over year. U.S. Specialized Therapeutics revenue was $1.45 billion for the quarter, up 12.1% versus the prior-year period, driven by strong growth across Medical Aesthetics of 14%, Eye Care of 13%, and strong growth in Botox Therapeutic of 17%. Key products performed well, with Botox, Restasis, fillers, and the launch of Kybella as key contributors to the strong performance. A sequential 2% revenue decline was driven by the typical seasonality of Medical Aesthetics and Eye Care in the summer. Gross margin continue to expand at 95.2%. SG&A increased versus prior year as a result of an increase in promotion efforts, including aesthetic sales force expansion and Kybella DTC.","Turning to slide 29. Our U.S. General Medicine business third quarter revenues were $1.49 billion, 4% lower than last year, primarily attributed to Asacol HD generic entry, lower Namenda IR and XR revenues, and lower established brands due to the Cervidil divestiture and Enablex generic entry. Adjusting for this impact, trends in our key products, including Linzess and Lo Loestrin, continued to grow at strong double-digit rates. Third quarter gross margins continued to be stable at 85%. Sequentially, SG&A increased versus the prior year, primarily related to higher sales and marketing to support launches of Viberzi and Vraylar. The decline in SG&A versus prior quarter is due primarily to timing of promotional spending.","Turning to slide 30 and our international results. Third quarter revenues were $698 million versus $661 million in the prior-year period. Excluding foreign exchange and an out-of-period adjustment of $31.7 million, international revenues in the third quarter grew 12% versus prior year, driven by continued strong growth of Botox Therapeutic, Botox Cosmetics, fillers, and Ozurdex. Sequential revenue decline was driven by seasonality of Medical Aesthetics and Eye Care, primarily in Europe. Gross margins were 86.4% in the third quarter. Segment SG&A was $216 million, up 14.3% versus prior year, driven by continued support of Medical Aesthetics and new product launches, including Belkyra or Kybella in the U.S., Xen, Earfold, and Constella. Contribution margins improved versus prior quarter from 53.4% to 55.4%, reflecting continued strong sales growth.","Turning to slide 31. Let me make a few comments on our 2016 full-year revised guidance. We are revising our guidance for full-year 2016. While we are clearly disappointed that we have to revise our guidance, the level of transformation our company has seen over the last 18 months has been unprecedented. We've carved out two major businesses, a very complex process. We have now completed that process this quarter with the close of Anda. We are looking forward to focusing on the future as a pure branded growth pharma company. We now expect full-year 2016 branded revenues to be between $14.45 billion to $14.65 billion, at or modestly below the low end of our previous range. Reflecting the impact of sales that we saw in the third quarter, and our assumption that those trends on our non-promoted, established products carry into the fourth quarter, we expect continued strong performance of our top-promoted products and new launches.","Our gross margins, which were slightly lower sequentially, are now expected to finish the year between 87% to 88%, consistent with our historical performance. Our non-GAAP SG&A of approximately $4 billion and our non-GAAP R&D spend of approximately $1.5 billion remain unchanged. Net interest expense and other is in the range of $1.25 billion. Our tax rate for the full year is anticipated to be between 8% and 9%. Our tax rate should between begin to trend upward toward normalized levels in early 2017.","Our revised average share count for 2016 of 408 million shares includes the impact of the completed $5 billion in share repurchases, as well as the impact of the $10 billion ASR we just announced. Year-end 2016 diluted share count is forecasted to be approximately $365 million, reflecting more fully the impact of the share repurchases. As mentioned earlier, there could be further adjustments in share count depending on Allergan's stock price during the settlement period. Approximately $8 billion worth of shares will be retired during the month of November 2016, and the remaining shares, if any, under the program, will be received and retired by the third quarter of 2017 upon completion of the ASR. As a result, we expect full-year non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $13.30 and $13.50. For the fourth quarter, we expect a forecast average share count of 383 million shares for the quarter.","Turning to slide 32. We have strong, long-duration assets and a sound strategy. We have leading top line growth and margins, driven by new, innovative products and excellent manufacturing capabilities. We have strong conviction in the earnings potential and cash generation of our company, and we remain focused on long-term shareholder value creation. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brent for closing remarks.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Thank you, Tessa. In closing, in 2016, we have been on a journey to transform our company. This work is largely behind us now, and we have multiple drivers, including top-tier revenue growth, top-tier profitability, a strong Open Science R&D model, and significant new actions to return cash to shareholders. And we have taken the actions to set the foundation for top-tier growth and profitability in 2017 and beyond.","We'd now like to open up the call to your questions. LaShonda, can we start the queue?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. And our first question comes from the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thanks very much, and congrats on the incremental share repurchase and dividend announcements. I have a couple questions. I don't want to take too long, but I guess first of all, Brent and Tessa, maybe you could just frame how you plan to balance your optimism about the business and your motivation to drive the sales force while also ensuring that consensus expectations can be achievable going forward? That's my first question. And tying into that, how will you guide next year in the face of Namenda XR early generic risk? And then the second question is on Vraylar in negative symptoms, you mentioned a first-half 2017 data submission. I'm assuming that incremental data could show up in the body of the label in early 2018. But when do you expect to be able to file for a formal indication for negative symptoms to be on the top of the label? Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah. So let me see if I can take those, David. Thank you for a full list of questions. I think with respect to motivating the sales force and balancing the need to meet or beat expectations or consensus \u2013 it's something obviously we take very seriously. I'm not sure the two are entirely connected. Our sales force around the world is, frankly, one of the prides of Allergan. We take a great amount of our time and effort to make sure that our front-line salespeople have all the tools and training and skills necessary to do the therapeutic line calls and promote our products in a compliant and risk-imbalanced way, but to build customer intimacy and relationships. And I think across a number of different dynamics, our sales force is the most productive, hardest-working sales force in the industry.","And we've been expanding it. So in Eye Care we've expanded it, and in key markets like Brazil and China we've been expanding it. I'd also say that we have had a relatively strong stability in our sales force despite the transformation of Allergan. Our sales reps and our sales leadership is almost entirely intact from the early days of the company's transformation. So it is a very important group of individuals and colleagues for us, and it's a highly motivated, highly productive function in the company.","I think the question with respect to consensus is something that Tessa and I and our entire management team take very seriously, but at the end of the day, we run the business to make the right decisions to propel growth and high profitability in the future. And so things that we did this quarter, like bringing on a second Botox manufacturing plant in Ireland, expanding our capacity in Waco to make many of our Eye Care products, investing behind our launches, pulling forward some promotional spend behind Namzaric are all the types of things that I think we need to do to continue to drive the growth and do the right thing for the business \u2013 in fairness, irrespective of consensus. And so that's kind of how it nets out. I don't know if, Tessa, you want to add anything?","Maria Teresa Hilado - Allergan Plc","Yeah. I'd also want to add that the revised guidance we provided really was reflective of just a couple of product lines where our expectations were not met, and specifically, as we pointed out earlier in the presentation, it was really Namenda IR\/XR largely, and Avycaz as well. So it doesn't really affect the bulk of the product portfolio, as Bill pointed out, which really for the most part is growing double digits.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Right. And then it also includes some of our mesalamine products like Asacol. Let me move over to your other question with respect to what happens if there's generic XR. Obviously, we believe in our intellectual property position. We are going to be in the appeals court likely next year, and we'll see how that settles. I'm not going to try to handicap how a judge is going to rule, particularly with respect to memantine. I've done that in the past, and that has not worked out well for me, so I'm going to stay away from that.","I think the better thing that we can focus on is what we can control on a day-to-day basis, which is our promotion of the better product for patients which is Namzaric. Reducing the pill burden from three pills twice a day to one pill once a day is something that we know that caregivers and patients suffering from Alzheimer's really do benefit from. And, look, the early data on Namzaric that Bill put up on the slide is encouraging, but we should keep in mind it's early. And our entire sales force and our entire promotional effort is focused on driving the better therapy Namzaric, but we have work to do. Bill, anything you'd add on that?","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","I would just say, David, it's only been several weeks since we've introduced the more complete indication. We haven't even started a consumer program, which will launch in a couple weeks, and the volume for Namzaric is up 25% in both retail and long-term care. So we have our work cut out for us, to be fair, but if we focus on that, by the time we get to the end of 2017 it may not matter if we have all our effort behind the better product.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah. Then quickly on your last question with respect to Vraylar and negative symptoms, David, I think you just want to clarify?","C. David Nicholson - Allergan Plc","Yeah, sure. Now, clearly we've been talking extensively to the agency about how to handle our negative symptoms data. We already have the indication for schizophrenia. Negative symptoms are part of schizophrenia and, as I mentioned, we're working with the agency how to handle this. We now plan to submit our sNDA for negative symptoms in schizophrenia late in the first half of next year. During the review with the agency, we'll be working with them to agree precisely how to position this in the label, and potentially we'll also be sorting this out with an advisory committee.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Thanks, David. Next question?","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentleman, as a reminder, please limit yourselves to one question to allot time for others to ask a question. Our next question comes from the line of David Maris with Wells Fargo.","David Maris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. On the earnings reset, is the business becoming less predictable, or are you managing it on a more fluid basis? And I get that investments are needed and you need a new Botox plan, you need it, but when you set guidance about a year ago, is there something that changed in the approach? Because the reset is the first in I think a few years. So maybe if you could just talk about whether or not it's a different change of approach or that something changed recently.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah. So great question, David. Thanks for asking it. I think in fairness it's something that, frankly, under my leadership we've never had. And it is disappointing for us that we have to do it. It's something that we take a lot of pride in not having to do. That being said, the business is not less predictable in any way, shape, or form. I think \u2013 I don't want to make excuses, but rather I accept full responsibility and accountability for the situation, but we did have a lot going on this year with the transformation of the company, almost a complete transformation of the company, and perhaps we didn't anticipate some of these older product erosion that happen. And, to be fair, I think this is true across the industry. I think competing in categories where there is strong generic alternatives is becoming increasingly more difficult, and then frankly with the mesalamine franchise, we were excluded by one major exclusion list with that particular product. And that does \u2013 was unanticipated, unlikely to happen to any of our other products in 2017, frankly, or maybe even 2018, but something that when it happens does have an impact on sales. I don't know, Bill, if you'd add anything.","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Two risks that we managed that would create unpredictability would relate to of course pricing or competitive activity, and there's really been nothing over the past 12 months or anything that I see 2017 or 2018 that would make this business more difficult to predict. If you look at almost three-quarters of our product line, it's at expectations or even exceeding expectations. You look at product launches, they're either at or exceeding expectations generally. Some of these established products, though, which is a smaller part of our business, can be at times a little difficult to predict. But, overall, I think we have a very good handle on what's going to happen in the future.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah. And, look, it's not something I enjoy saying, but if you had to have this situation, clearly the miss wasn't in our promoted products, it's not in our launches, it's not in the things that propel our growth next year or beyond. They're in some of the products that we don't promote or don't pay as much attention or in the gross margin, where we made the right investments for the long term given the demand for products like Botox and some of our Eye Care products. So it is what it is. It's not an excuse. Hopefully it won't happen again, but it is what it is at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Brent, how would you characterize the pricing environment now and the outlook for the next couple years? And maybe you could divide your comments between the stuff you missed on the older stuff where price might not be \u2013 as a lever, might not be as robustly available as in the past. And so comments on pricing environment now and going toward on sort of the growthy stuff and the non-growthy stuff. And, Tessa, can you put some context around the negative cash flow number in the quarter? Thanks.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah. Thanks, Gregg. So, look, I mean, I think for us our pricing outlook for 2017 and frankly our early look into 2018 is very stable. We don't see really any significant changes or surprise at this moment. I think, to be fair, for the industry, I think it's going to be a very different situation depending on the product mix of their portfolios. I think \u2013 looking at earnings for the companies that have reported before us, many of them have seen less-than-stellar growth in their key promoted products, but they've achieved their results by price increases in their established products. I'm not sure that is sustainable.","And so, while some may criticize our Social Contract and our pricing discipline, we would have not taken those price increases irregardless of the contact because it's not the right thing to do. And I think it does create additional risk or inappropriate risk for the company. And so I think what you're seeing from Allergan this quarter is the new reality that frankly you'll start to see from everybody else in the industry over time.","Maria Teresa Hilado - Allergan Plc","Yes, so on the cash flow, Gregg \u2013 that's actually relatively simple to explain. So we had negative cash flow of about $1 billion. If you add back the cash taxes that we paid attributable to the gain on the sale of our generics business to Teva of about $2.6 billion, and then you add back one-timers such as milestones and restructuring of about $240 million, cash flow would have been about $1.7 billion positive.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thanks so much for taking my question. So I'll just stick with one I guess on the business development side. And you mentioned all the stepping-stone deals you completed recently. Maybe, Brent, if you could just give a little sense of sort of how you view the future opportunities? Should we continue to look at things along these lines, stepping stones, maybe smaller things, maybe earlier-stage assets? Or your interest in maybe something later stage or larger in scale? Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah. So we do retain significant firepower to do stepping stones irregardless of our capital allocation decisions this morning. I think that we will continue to look for things that strategically fit our growth agenda, and that means that you'll see a nice balance over some longer period of time between buying intellectual property or R&D to support our pipeline and our therapeutic areas of expertise or short-term accretive deals that get us near-term or marketed products that expand our commercial capabilities in our therapeutic areas or our geographic footprint in our therapeutic areas. And so we're looking at lots of things.","I think in terms of size, we look at everything from $100 million to several billion dollars, and I think we still retain ample capacity to continue to looking at everything that we used to do. And so we're looking at accretive deals that are in our therapeutic areas or adjacent to our therapeutic areas, but for now we should just point out the most overwhelmingly accretive thing we can do is buy our stock. And so I think we've found a nice balance between making a statement on that specific point but retaining enough firepower to continue our strategy of stepping stone. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. A couple questions, Brent. I don't mean to beat a dead horse, but it's obviously very important, and it explains why the share price is where it is. Allergan is a new company. It's a new collection of assets. You've been through tremendous transition over the last many years, not just the divestitures. And so investors listen to what you say and take what you say at face value. And for the last 12 months I would characterize your guidance as having drip, drip, dripped, I mean, from double-digit top line to the $25 aspirational number that was pushed out, to gross margin guidance to revenue guidance.","And so my question is, obviously guidance is really important, market takes it very seriously. We're just trying to understand your company. What are you doing for your own internal controls so that you have better visibility to communicate with investors? This quarter, a lot of the shortfalls came from older products that I would have thought you would have foreseen. So I'm just wondering what you're doing about that going forward. And most importantly, will this be the last \u2013 I mean, I don't think you can \u2013 I don't know how definitive you can be, but to help us understand, will this be the last of the rebasing?","And then my second question is, if you could help us to understand how to think about the pushes and pulls in 2017. Obviously the buyback should be a positive to your bottom line, but at the same time investors are questioning your level of R&D spend to sustain top line growth, SG&A which is coming in above but obviously important to sustain new product launches. So if you could sort of give us a preliminary vision for what 2017 might look like. Thanks very much.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah. So thanks, Jami. That was a lot. I'm trying to think of where to start. Look, I think I have to just mention, we're not going to provide 2017 guidance today. We'll do that in the normal course in early next year, in just a few months. But that being said, look, we have a business that I think has some very important characteristics that even despite the miss today on some of the older products are the thing I hope investors focus on. We have top tier growth. We have a portfolio that's diverse with many growth drivers, not one big growth driver but many growth drivers. You can look at products like Botox up 15%, Restasis up 13%, Linzess up 42%. Even drugs like Lo Loestrin up 16%, Ozurdex up 25%.","And I think see the pattern of that the previous quarter, the previous quarter, and the previous quarter and get a feel for the growth trajectory of this business. You can look at the new launches, which I said contributed about $90 million in the quarter. Viberzi, Vraylar, Kybella all off to either at our expectations or exceeding expectation start. You heard David talking about filing for negative symptoms on Vraylar. Could be, if approved by the FDA, a certainly multiple changer in terms of the sales multiples for that drug.","But then I think most importantly, the question I take the most exception to, is this idea that the percentage of our R&D spend is too weak to propel innovation. I mean, I think that's ridiculous. I think, just to be straightforward, it's the quality of the spend against the programs and the productivity that you have. And I think when you look at our 70 late-stage programs and you think about some of the big ones that are coming over the next year or two, whether it be abicipar, rapastinel, ubrogepant, Esmya, relamorelin, just to name a few, let alone drugs like Rofade and others, or SER120, that are kind of forgotten about in the context. We have ample new product flow, and we have several shots on goal that could be blockbuster new drugs for unmet medical needs.","So would you rather have that or have us spend $8 billion or $9 billion on R&D to have no productivity and late-stage failures and all the other things that come with it. Not saying we won't have failures. Of course we'll have a few, but I think we spend our money more wisely, and it hopefully over time will prove in a more efficient way to get meaningful innovation out to market. And just as an aside, our R&D is up 29% year to date, so it's not that we're not increasing R&D. So hopefully that answers some of your questions. We can continue the debate next time I see you, but we feel very good about our position. We feel very good about our growth profile, and I think we feel very confident that we will be continuing top-tier growth and top-tier profitability in 2017 and beyond.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Marc Goodman with UBS.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Brent, can you talk about internationally some of the countries where you plan to expand infrastructure? I think you talked about some of the launches overseas, but where are the places where you need to expand the infrastructure? And then second question, Bill, can you talk about just the dynamics in the dry eye market right now? Obviously, Shire has been very aggressive or generous or whatever you want to call it giving away product. Just give us a sense of what's going on out there, what you're seeing, and what you're doing. We're seeing the IMS data, obviously. Thanks.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah. So I'll turn it over to Bill in a second, but I'm glad you raised international expansion. When we think of our levers for growth, we tend to talk about new product launches, R&D, late-stage success, expanding markets like Medical Aesthetics, but clearly another very important lever for Allergan that sometimes isn't discussed as much is international expansion. We saw that business up about 12% this quarter, after FX and one other adjustment. And so that team around the world is performing at very high levels, and there are a few countries that I think we really believe we would have a high return on investment, and we have already started making many of those investments. Bill, you want to talk about those?","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Yeah. I would say there's three regions of our international business that are getting a great deal of focus right now. That's Asia Pacific; North, East, Southeast Europe, essentially everything other than Western Europe; and Turkey, Middle East, Africa. The investments that we make right now relate to expansion of the field force, especially in Asia Pacific and namely in China. We've dramatically increased the scale and scope and intensity of our injector training program, not just in Asia Pacific but in the other two regions as well. And internationally there are opportunities to run consumer advertising campaigns, namely on our fillers line, which is growing at 25% year over year.","Not a major increase in sales force is required, but of the three things I mentioned, that is the largest one. And the business is really very, very well-resourced. The regional presidents and the country managers that run this business are very, very capable, and the trends just look very, very good. You know, a business that's up 12% versus prior year and has experienced price erosion of 1% to 2%, and so it's a very, very strong product line. The same can be said for the Eye Care business as well, where we're launching new products for glaucoma, and I like how it looks. The second question was about?","Lisa M. DeFrancesco - Allergan Plc","Dry eyes.","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Oh. Dry eye. I would make the following observations. The first is, as you know from the IMS data, and I think that this is a good development, the market for dry eye, if you look at total prescriptions, is up over 20%. If you look at new prescriptions, it's closer to 30%. Most of the expansion is coming from, as I mentioned earlier, patients who are on over-the-counter tear products or were receiving no treatment at all. The next observation is that the revenue stream for Restasis has been very durable. If you look at the six-week period, for example, before the launch of Xiidra and the six-week period after.","And then the next, final point I would make is we're focused right now on launching Restasis and BPF and True Tear at the end of 2016 and 2017. And I still believe that when the dust settles here \u2013 I'm sure the people at Shire feel the same way \u2013 this isn't going to be a fight to the death between the two companies and the two products, but this is going to be a larger market. There's a lot more attention being paid to ocular surface disease, and I think we're seeing it. A second treatment option appears to have created an expansion event in Eye Care, which is good. I believe that Allergan, because of our product line depth and capabilities, is going to maintain a majority share in a much larger market, and I think things look pretty good in that regard.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Great. Well, thank you. So let me just thank everyone for joining us today. I know we're going to see many of you a little bit later today, and we look forward to continuing answering questions and the dialogue. Again, we are very pleased about the foundation we have laid for growth in 2017 and beyond, and we look forward to continuing to update you as time goes by. Thank you so much.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

DeFrancesco - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, Holly, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to the Allergan second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning we issued a press release reporting Allergan's earnings for the second quarter ended June 30, 2015.

With that I will turn the call over to Brent.","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","Thanks, Lisa, and good morning everyone. It's great to be with you to review our results for the second quarter of 2015, which built on the terrific results we had last quarter. This was also our first full quarter of a combined operations following the close of the Allergan acquisition on March 17. And I'm very proud of what our team has accomplished, especially the momentum they have created to propel our future growth.","Turning to slide 5. Allergan's second quarter performance highlights our ability to execute on our four pillars of our long-term growth strategy. First, operational excellence is yielding exceptional financial performance and results in all key business segments, key products, and key geographies.","Second, therapeutic area leadership is leading to double-digit growth among many of our franchises.","Third, our productive and innovative R&D engine has produced more than 100 branded product approvals globally and 56 branded regulatory submissions year to date.","And fourth, we are executing on strategic business deals to support our growth in key therapy areas and charge up our pipelines for the future.","We also changed our name to Allergan in the quarter to symbolize our transformation into a leader in Growth Pharma, where brands now contribute more than two-thirds of our company's revenues. With our focus on Growth Pharma we are encouraging our employees around the world to be bold and smart in the way we think and act.","Turning to slide 6. The announcement of our plans to combine our Global Generics business with Teva in a $40.5 billion deal is the latest bold move by our company to continue our transformation towards being a leader in Branded Growth Pharma. For years we've been moving up the innovation curve towards specialty pharma products.","This agreement clearly accelerates our transformation. This deal allows us to dramatically simplify our operating structure, sharpen our focus on seven core therapy areas, and reload our capital structure to continue our transformation.","There is certainly more to come on this story. We are confident that we are creating the most dynamic company in Growth Pharma, while adding our impressive global generic commercial, generic R&D, and operating capabilities to Teva.","Now let's turn to slide 7 and talk about the business performance in the second quarter. Our second quarter revenue more than doubled on a year-over-year basis to $5.7 billion as a result of the acquisitions of Allergan and Forest. On a pro forma basis sales were up 12% excluding the impact of foreign currency, Namenda IR, and divestitures with double-digit growth in our Brand and Global Generics segments.","The strong sales increase introduced from the integration of Allergan and Forest were the primary drivers of the 29% increase in earnings per share to $4.41. Meanwhile non-GAAP EBITDA rose to $2.6 billion. And cash flow from operations was about $1.7 billion, excluding one-time cash payments for severance, acquisitions, and integration. Tessa will talk more about the financials shortly.","On slide 8 our Global Generics business is doing very well, and the units that comprise it are firing on all cylinders as we prepare for the combination with Teva. Generic sales are up 17% excluding the impact of foreign currency. Generic profitability is up. And our exceptional generic R&D capabilities are evident with 12 new first-to-file drugs this year. This brings the total number of ANDAs under review to approximately 220 with 76 confirmed first-to-files.","U.S. generic revenues were at $1.1 billion in the quarter and continue to benefit from new product introductions and contribution from high-barrier and semi-exclusive products like generic Concerta.","Meanwhile our international generics team continues to drive excellent performance in key markets, excluding the impact of foreign currency such as the U.K., which was up 85% including the effect of the Auden Mckenzie transaction that closed in May, and Russia, which was up 32%.","Turning to slide 9. Our Brand business continues to drive impressive performance where 12 of the top 15 global brands growing, many with double-digit pro forma year-over-year growth. Sales increased 11% excluding Namenda IR, the divestitures, and the impact of foreign exchange. And the success is broad-based. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, we drove double-digit growth in Eye Care, GI, and key Women Health products, and Cardiovascular.","Double-digit growth from our latest largest leading brands like Botox, Restasis, Namenda XR and our fillers including Juvederm. Double-digit growth from well-established brands like Bystolic, Lo Loestrin and Estrace; and double-digit growth from Linzess, Ozurdex and other launched brands, which puts us in excellent position to power growth well into the future. It is a terrific line-up of brands with long exclusivity and is backed by a great team on the ground and our leading pipeline with multiple shots on each of our seven priority therapeutic areas.","Turning to slide 10. We continue to drive conversion of patients to Namenda XR right up to the end of the Namenda IR exclusivity, reaching about 53% before generic entry. With continued promotion and the launch of Namzaric, we believe the penetration rate goes even higher towards our target of 60% to 65% as the year progresses.","And with once-a-day dosing, formulary access at every one of the top eight plans, and a focused sales team, we have maintained relatively stable volumes on Namenda XR, even as the Namenda IR prescriptions drop. We are now doing the blocking and tackling to build demand and access for Namzaric. With full promotion just getting under way, our DTC campaign beginning in September, and an anticipated seven out of the top 10 plans having coverage by the beginning of 2016, we think we are well prepared to drive market expansion in 2016.","Given the broad use of combination donepezil and memantine therapy, the efficacy of Namzaric and the patient, caregiver, and system benefits of one pill once a day, we think there's a great opportunity for the innovation of Namzaric to become the cornerstone of once-a-day branded market in Alzheimer's treatment.","Turning to slide 11. In a few moments David Nicholson will give an update on the pipeline. But I want to point out that our pipeline remains one of the best kept secrets of our company. With 70 projects in mid to late development we are in an enviable position of having multiple programs in each of our therapeutic areas to help us sustain leadership in the areas we choose to compete. And we have built this pipeline step by step, not by investing big dollars on discovery but by investing in smart development projects.","Even with the excellent breadth and depth of our current pipeline, we are always on the lookout for R&D assets that can extend our leadership by bringing novel approaches to existing therapy areas. In the last two months alone we've announced agreements for four planned acquisitions in Aesthetics, Eye Care, and CNS. Each will bring novelty to existing areas and will add to our ability to lead in these therapeutic areas. And each of these deals brings game-changer potential ideas to our pipelines.","Kybella is off to a strong start in Aesthetics with sales already surpassing $1 million and a recent approval in Canada. We are making great progress towards closing the transaction, now that we have cleared antitrust review in the U.S. And as we announced yesterday, we no longer intend to issue our shares to complete this acquisition.","The Oculeve acquisition has also cleared HSR in the U.S. And we'll look forward to extending our dry eye opportunities with their novel nasal neurostimulation device.","In CNS we are working to close deals to extend our migraine offering with Merck's first in oral \u2013 first-in-class oral CGRP antagonist and the Naurex novel approach to treating mood disorders, including severe depression, which remains a leading cause of suicide.","In closing our team continues to focus on execution. And the results indicate that we are exceptionally skilled at delivering strong operating results while also doing surprising things that make our company the most dynamic in all of healthcare. I'm so proud of our team for their performance, and I'm looking forward to what we can do with a strengthened focus on Branded Pharmaceuticals and a significantly reduced operating structure and reloaded capital structure.","With that I'll now turn the call over to Tessa.","Maria Teresa Hilado - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Brent. Good morning everyone. Turning to our overall results for the second quarter on slide 13. In Q2 we delivered strong performance both year-over-year and quarter-to-quarter. On a non-GAAP basis consolidated net revenue for the second quarter was $5.7 billion, an increase of 36% versus Q1 2015.","Non-GAAP R&D investment for the quarter was $406 million, compared to $185 million in the prior-year period. Non-GAAP SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 21.7%, an increase of 3 percentage points over the prior-year quarter as a result of the Forest-branded products and Allergan business, which we have higher SG&A spend.","Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $2.6 billion, an increase of 203% versus the prior year, driven by strong revenues and higher gross margins across our segments.","Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter increased 29% to $4.41, compared to $3.42 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2014.","Our non-GAAP tax rate improved from 17.1% in the year-ago period to 14.5% in the current-year quarter, mainly due to the geographic mix of our businesses. Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $1.4 billion, an increase of 198% versus the year-ago quarter. Excluding acquisition-related restructuring and integration payments, our second quarter free cash flow would be $1.7 billion.","Before turning to our business segment results I would like to take a moment to review our new segment reporting for the second quarter. In this quarter we are reporting results in five segment.","The U.S. Brands segment represents sales and expenses related to branded products within the United States, including Botox therapeutics. The U.S. Medical Aesthetic segment represents sales and expenses related to aesthetics and dermatology products within the United States, including Botox cosmetics.","The International Brands segment represents revenues and operating expenses in countries that have the majority of their businesses represented by branded sales and revenues and expenses related to product sales in Canada, Switzerland, and Austria. The Global Generics segment represents revenues and operating expenses in countries that have the majority of their business represented by generic product sales, our third-party Medis business, and revenues and expenses related to product sales in the U.S., Canada, Switzerland, and Austria. The Anda distribution segment results represent sales and expenses related to distribution of generic and brand pharmaceutical products manufactured by third parties.","Also as a result of Teva's acquisition of Allergan's generic business, Allergan will report a generics business as discontinued operations beginning in the third quarter of 2015. Since the divested business spans both Global Generics and International Brands segments, it will be difficult today to model the remaining Allergan business. We will provide some guidance in September.","Turning now to our U.S. Brand results on slide 15. The business delivered strong performance year over year and quarter over quarter. U.S. Brands revenue was $2.44 billion for the quarter, up 331% versus the prior year period and 35% in the prior quarter, driven by the addition of the Forest and Allergan businesses and strong growth across key products including Linzess and Namenda XR. Adjusted gross margin within U.S. Brands remained steady at 87.4%. SG&A as a percentage of revenue increased to 20.8% versus 17.8% in the year-ago quarter, driven by expenses related to the Forest and Allergan acquisitions.","Turning to slide 16 and our U.S. Medical Aesthetics business, second quarter revenues were $487 million, an increase of 510% versus first quarter 2015 results. Second quarter gross margin of 93% and segment margin of 70.6% were largely in line with expectations. SG&A in the quarter remained steady.","Turning to slide 17 and in our International Brands results, second quarter revenues were $717 million versus $169 million in the prior-year period, an increase of 324%. Gross margins increased 21.7 percentage points to 77.8% in the second quarter, due largely to the inclusion of higher margin legacy Allergan products. Segment SG&A improved 7.2 percentage points to 32% versus Q1 2015 due largely to synergy capture related to the Allergan acquisition.","On slide 18 Global Generics revenues in the quarter were $1.6 billion, up 10% versus the prior-year period. Growth was driven by strong sales in the base business, including generic Concerta, offset in part by additional competition on certain products including generic Lidoderm. Adjusted gross margins increased 1 percentage point compared to the year-ago quarter due to continued strong performance within our international business. Lower gross margin versus the prior quarter was mainly due to lower contribution of Guanfacine ER and Oxycodone in the second quarter versus the first quarter of 2015. SG&A as a percentage of adjusted net revenue decreased slightly to 15% from 15.8% in the year-ago quarter.","Turning to our Anda business on slide 19, revenues increased to $462 million, up from $427 million in the prior year, an increase of 8% driven by trends in our base business and a higher mix of chain drugstore sales.","Slide 20 details our debt capitalization following the completion of our first full quarter following the close of the Allergan acquisition. We ended the second quarter 2015 with total debt of approximately $42.9 billion and equity of $72.1 billion related to the Allergan acquisition and previous financing.","In the second quarter we paid down approximately $1.4 billion of our debt. Currently our leverage ratio stands at 3.9 times debt-to-pro-forma adjusted EBITDA versus 4.1 times in the prior quarter. We remain committed to using strong free cash flows from our business segments to accelerate debt repayment. And we continue to remain committed to investment grade ratings.","I'd now like to turn the call over to David Nicholson, who will provide an update on our Brands R&D progress in the quarter. David?","C. David Nicholson, PhD - Senior Vice President, Brand Research & Development","Thanks, Tessa, and good morning everyone. Let's go to slide 22. Our Brands R&D team continues to be tremendously productive. Year to date and worldwide our strong mid-stage pipeline has delivered more than 100 pharmaceutical and medical device approvals, and 56 regulatory submissions. I will highlight some of the most significant of these in my overview.","Following the first round of integration prioritization we now have more than 70 mid- to late-stage development projects with approximately 45 projects in either late-stage development or registration. The productivity of the legacy Allergen R&D organizations is demonstrated by the industry-leading figure of 14 NME approvals in the United States over the last 6.5 years. Going forward we'll continue to make data-driven prioritization decisions on all of our programs.","In addition to rationalizing and driving productivity from our existing pipeline we are committed to identifying and executing acquisitions and licensing agreements that further strengthen our long term leadership position in key therapeutic areas. This is exemplified by our pending acquisitions of Kythera, Oculeve, and Naurex, and our licensing of Merck's oral CGRP programs during the quarter.","The next two slides summarize some highlights and describe the progress in our late stage pipeline. Slide 23 shows late-stage game-changing opportunities across our therapeutic areas. In aesthetics we are adding Kybella from Kythera to our pipeline. Our Aesthetic pipeline already includes by Bimataprost for hair growth. Aczone and Sarecycline for acne, as well as many line extensions to our fillers.","In Eye Care we are adding the intranasal dry eye device from Oculeve to our dry eye franchise, further enhancing our leading position in this therapeutic area. My colleagues and I have reviewed our restated data and again find our efficacy and tolerability data very compelling in comparison to recently published data for other compounds in development and registration. In Phase III we are developing DARPin and have a sustained-release formulation of Bimataprost.","In CNS we are adding the Naurex NMDA modulators to our pipeline. These compounds have the first novel mechanism for mood disorders for more than two decades. We are also adding oral CGRP antagonists. These compounds in license from Merck are designed both for the acute treatment as well as for the prophylaxis of migraine. We also have Cariprazine in development and Namzaric, which combines two complementary therapeutic agents, Namenda and Aricept.","Recently much attention has turned to prevention of Alzheimer's. And like all of us I hope that effective preventative therapy will be discovered. Data on Namzaric was recently presented at the 2015 Alzheimer's Association International Conference. The efficacy of Namzaric in patients with Alzheimer's is at least a similar magnitude to that reported with the present, preventative agents in development.","In GI disorders, together with our partner Ironwood, we continue to develop dosage and formulations of our IBS-C agent, Linzess, to offer a very complete package to physicians and patients. Also we're completing the initial development of Eluxadoline, Viberzi, for IBS-D.","In Urology, together with our partner Serenity, we have intranasal desmopressin completing Phase III for Nocturia. In our Anti-Infective franchise we continue to develop Dalvance and Avycaz. In Biologics Phase III will be completed this year for Bevacizumab, a biosimilar of Avastin, which is part of our partnership with Amgen.","Last certainly not least is Botox. We continue to further develop and launch this agent across our respective CNS and Urology franchises.","Turning to slide 24, I'm going to update you on progress with regulatory authorities for key late-stage products.","In Aesthetics Natrelle Inspira, textured breast implants, received FDA approval for women undergoing breast reconstruction, augmentation, or revision surgery. And we're on track for FDA submission of our Volbella filler in the third quarter of 2015. Yesterday we received FDA approval to market 28 additional styles of Natrelle 410 breast implants. In Asia we received licensing rights for commercial sale of Juvederm in China and submitted an NDA for Botox for crow's feet lines in Japan.","In Eye Care Botox received approval in Japan for the treatment of strabismus. We're on track for the FDA submission of a multi-dose, preservative-free formulation of Restasis in September. We are currently enrolling patients in Phase III trials for Bimataprost in the U.S. And we've initiated pivotal Phase III trials of our lead DARPin in age-related macular degeneration on target and during this year.","In CNS we have a PDUFA date in September for Cariprazine as a treatment for schizophrenia and bipolar mania. And this quarter we launched Namzaric, and we'll be filing additional dose combinations of this agent later this year.","In GI our strong pipeline does continue to develop new opportunities. We expect to complete the Phase III study for a low dosage form of Linzess to treat chronic idiopathic constipation in the second half of the year. And we expect to submit an sNDA for this indication next year.","Meanwhile, Viberzi \u2013 Eluxadoline \u2013 has been approved by the FDA as a twice-daily oral treatment for IBS-D. We're awaiting DEA scheduling of Viberzi prior to launch of this product in the United States. And we've submitted the dossier of Eluxadoline in Europe in May.","In Women's Health enrollment in our Phase III trial of Esmya for the treatment of bleeding disorders caused by uterine fibroids is on track. We're committed to completing trial enrollment this year.","In Urology we've completed our Phase III trials of SER 120 in Nocturia. The data is under our review prior to submission to the agency.","In Anti-Infectives our development of a single dose formulation of Dalvance remains on track. We've made regulatory submissions for approval in both the United States and Europe. We're also anticipating approval for Teflaro in bacteremia during the course of this year.","On slide 25 we outline some of our most recent business development opportunities. Obviously these help us to further solidify our leadership position in our core therapeutic area. With Kythera we add a first-in-class agent, Kybella, for the treatment of submental fat, or double chin, to our product line. The product is launched the States and was recently approved in Canada. In addition Kythera has an interesting and genetically validated hair growth property in early development.","Oculeve will strengthen our leading position in dry eye with the OD-01 development program and intranasal neurostimulatory device that increases tear production in patients with dry eye.","Our licensing agreement with Merck builds on our commitment to the development of treatments for migraines. We're adding oral formulations of CGRP antagonists to our product line. The use of both small molecules, as well as antibodies, has clearly shown that CGRP antagonism is effective in treating migraines. There are four injectable antibodies in development, whilst we will have the only oral CGRP antagonist.","Finally, Naurex. The acquisition of Naurex adds innovative development programs in depression to our pipeline. Depression is an area of medicine that has seen minimal progress for the last 20 years. The Naurex compounds are NMDA modulators, a unique approach to the treatment in depression. These agents have the potential to be fast-onset antidepressants. And hence may be beneficial in the alleviation of suicidality, which is so often a terrible feature of this disorder. In early-stage development the Naurex team showed their compound indeed to be fast in onset and also to be effective in treating depression, which failed to respond to traditional antidepressants.","In closing the second quarter 2015 was another period of continued strong productivity for the Allergan R&D team. We look forward to continue to deliver on the promise of many of our development programs in our pipeline for the remainder of 2015 and beyond.","With that I'd like to turn it over to Brent for closing remarks. Brent?","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","Thank you, David. As you've heard we have a lot going on and look forward to giving you updates on our progress over the next few months. In mid to late September we will provide updated guidance for our continuing operations for the remainder of 2015. This will reflect our Global Generics business as discontinued operations, as we wait for the close of the transaction with Teva next year.","In conjunction with our third quarter earnings result, we also plan to host an R&D update meeting on November 4 in Irvine, California, at our campus. It will be our opportunity for the R&D team to shine a spotlight on the post-prioritization R&D portfolio.","With that I'd like to turn the call back to Lisa for Q&A.","Lisa M. DeFrancesco - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, Brent. We'll now take questions. If you could please limit yourself to one question only. We have only 30 minutes to get through all of your questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question will come from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Christopher Thomas Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","...question. One of the questions we've been getting post the Teva divestiture is as you guys are considering transformational acquisitions, it's obviously a very fluid market out there right now. Is it possible for Allergan to pursue a large transaction before the Teva deal closes if the right transaction were available? I guess both from an operational and financial standpoint?","And just a very quick second one on that guidance in September, is that just 2015? Or can we think about the preliminary view on either 2016 or an update on $25 [EPS] 2017 outlook at that time as well? Thanks so much.","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yeah. Thanks, Chris. So with respect to potential for transformational M&A, I think that the way to think about it is the most likely scenario would be after the close of Teva, if in fact we were to do transformational M&A. Certainly anything is possible prior to that. And we have always been bold in thinking about how to execute things if the timing was right.","But I think in fairness, given the commitment to our investment grade rating and our ability to deploy cash after the deal has closed versus prior, or perhaps our flexibility to deploy cash after the deal closes is better than prior. I think that's probably how you should think about it.","Now that doesn't mean we couldn't engage in analysis or discussions or other things like that with someone who was interested in doing a deal with us or we were interested in doing a deal with them. But I would say that it's most likely after the close of the Teva transaction.","With respect to the guidance, maybe I'll ask Tessa to talk about that for a second.","Maria Teresa Hilado - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. So in September what we will be providing you is what the remaining will \u2013 business will look like, since Teva will be discontinued operations. That's not exactly a very easy separation to do, and also just to manage expectations, as we provide that, given the accounting rules, it will be very difficult at this point in time for you to model what the remaining 2015 will look like.","As an example, for instance, debt will continue to remain with the Allergan Branded business and not go to discontinued operations. There is no such thing as non-GAAP discontinued operations. So we'll provide a little bit more clarity come September. But it's really largely focused on the remainder of 2015.","Christopher Thomas Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Just to follow up on that earlier question, Brent or Tessa. So when you give discontinued \u2013 or rather when you give pro forma earnings going forward, which presumably only includes the Branded business. Will that Branded business also include all the interest expense that you're carrying on your books? In other words, I would assume that some of that $40.5 billion is going to reduce debt. So how do we think about that when we think about the base business going forward?","And then secondly, just to follow up on that $25 number. That $25 obviously includes about $5 or $2.4 billion in EBIT from the Generic business. Brent, at what point can we expect you to update us on that guidance? And I think on the last call you didn't withdraw that $25. So any \u2013 again any color on how we should think about the company's ability to replace that $2.4 billion in EBIT. Thanks.","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","So, Tessa, want to take the first one?","Maria Teresa Hilado - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. So you definitely touched on some of the nuances related to discontinued operations as it pertains to debt as an example, for instance. So on a go-forward basis, in the September earnings what you will see is that debt will reside in the remaining company and not allocated to discontinued ops.","Obviously as you think about that on a go-forward basis, it would really largely depend on what we do with the capital on a go-forward basis. What we had indicated in our call related to Teva that we would use a portion of the proceeds to pay down debt. But again it's largely dependent on how much we use for capital deployment.","Having said that though, we are committed to our investment grade rating. So we will ensure that the appropriate amount of debt is paid down.","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yes. I think the net-net, Jami, on guidance \u2013 and I know this will drive your teams nuts and many on the phone nuts \u2013 that the rules are the rules. It's the accounting policy. So the next couple quarters till we actually close the transaction, it will be very difficult for you guys to run models and do clean comparisons. We are as always committed to as much transparency around product sales like we were in this press release. And we will do the best we can, given the rules that we have to all live with. But it will make for some tough modeling work on your guys' part over the next two or three quarters. And we apologize in advance for that. And we'll do everything we can to help facilitate that.","With respect to the $25 aspiration, what I said \u2013 I think you asked this question on the deal call if I recall correctly, Jami \u2013 was that we absolutely remain steadfast in our aspiration to increase our earnings per share to as high as possible, including the $25 target. What has changed obviously is, by selling the Generics business and the $2.4 billion of EBITDA to Teva, the timing of that aspiration. And so we need to continue to look at how we will deploy that capital and how the timing of the deployment of that capital will pull through to give a more precise view of it.","So again we're not withdrawing the $25, but we will come back and have to add some variables to it like capital deployment and timing of capital deployment to get there.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","Sure.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Liav Abraham with Citi.","Liav Abraham - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning. Brent, another question on the topic of business development. I wanted to get a better understanding of your appetite for earlier-stage research. You said that you're interested in a potentially transformational transaction and interested in moving up the value chain. You've also said that you're not necessarily in favor of early-stage research.","I'm trying to reconcile these comments. Can you engage in a larger pharma transaction and move up the value chain without a greater commitment to early-stage research going forward? And isn't this really necessary in \u2013 to at least \u2013 to a certain extent to secure longer-term organic growth?","And then very quickly for Bill, can you comment on how much you'll be giving away incrementally in terms of rebates in order to secure formulary status for Namzaric next year? Thanks.","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","Sure. So, Liav, I think the answer to the first part of your question is yes with an exclamation point on it. Look, I think we love research. And we have no issue with research. We just don't like to do it ourselves, unless of course it's unique research or something that isn't wildly \u2013 widely available in external research, like venture-backed companies or research- or academia-backed companies or smaller biotechs.","And so I think if you look at what David and his team did with Allergan, we kept the research capabilities where they had unique strength and proven track records, like in Aesthetics and Eye Care. And we have \u2013 and we will continue to fund that as appropriate.","What we won't do is waste our money on R&D that is widely available elsewhere. And so I think you have to really consider us as very tactical when it comes to research, basic research. But also a virtual-like company when it comes to research, as demonstrated by some of the deals we just did, like Naurex or even the licensing of the oral CGRPs from Merck. David, any other comments on research?","C. David Nicholson, PhD - Senior Vice President, Brand Research & Development","Look, one of the points that I always like to make is how impressed I am with the biotech industry these days. I think the biotech industry today with \u2013 founded by so many brilliant academic scientists, coupled with more and more people with pharmaceutical executive experience, are excellent in generating early stage molecules, which we can pick up and further develop through to the market. There are plenty of opportunities out there.","Also when you look at what's going on in the academic world, you increasingly see academic institutions setting themselves up to generate more spin-off opportunities. And we are very keen on interacting with the external world. We think that's where research should be performed.","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","And to be fair, and you've heard me say this before, Liav, I don't think what we do is any different than the great other innovators in our industry in really not doing discovery themselves but licensing in compounds. And there's some fantastic companies that have solved for huge unmet medical need without discovery labs. And I won't go through naming them, but they get the biotech moniker. But they really have no discovery, but rather smart business development and licensing. And that's essentially our approach. We just come at it with a very practical approach and a real bent for not wasting money.","Bill, you want to talk about Namzaric?","William J. Meury - Executive President-Branded Pharma","Yeah, Liav. Listen, on Namzaric working with Adamas we got a product to market that the Alzheimer's community has wanted for over 10 years, since we launched Namenda in 2004. We think it should be the standard of care for patients with moderate to severe disease. And we're at the very early stages of the exclusivity period. And so our primary aim is going to be market share and volume and giving access to physicians and caregivers.","As it relates to the discount rate it's going to be consistent with what we had for XR in 2015. And for XR I think it will be consistent in 2016. No dramatic changes. We manage the price\/volume relationship on that business very, very carefully. And we're at a price point that is attractive to health plans and acceptable to us.","Liav Abraham - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","That's great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sumant Kulkarni with Bank of America.","Sumant S. Kulkarni - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. On your dry eye programs after the purchase of Oculeve, do you see any gaps in the types of product offerings that you have in that portfolio? And very quickly how should we think about your cardiovascular franchise given that Bystolic is still a relatively significant contributor in terms of sales?","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yeah. So maybe, David, you want to talk about dry eye platform? Just if there are any gaps?","C. David Nicholson, PhD - Senior Vice President, Brand Research & Development","Sure. Look, dry eye is a underserved market at the moment. There's Restasis out there and a couple of other things in development, but there are not many product offerings for dry eye. And a relatively low proportion of patients suffering from dry eye actually receive treatment at the moment.","I think with Restasis obviously we have the leading product. Oculeve is a very interesting device. I used it myself recently. I can assure you it works. And it's really adding to our product line.","In addition to the anti-inflammatory agents like Restasis, there are some other opportunities in the biotech pipeline with different mechanisms of action. So I think in the future we are going to see other opportunities out there, which are going to be effective via other approaches in dry eye.","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","Bill, anything to add?","William J. Meury - Executive President-Branded Pharma","Yeah. I would just say right now we have the waterfront largely covered. We have an OTC, or artificial tear. Oculeve essentially is a natural tear option. And then RESTASIS is an anti-inflammatory. And so we offer a more complete product line for the Eye Care community than any company in the sector. And I agree with David that there are a few opportunities out there, but we have most of the market covered.","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yeah. And I think also people underestimate the importance of the multi-dose preservative-free, which we intend to file in September.","Having worked in this space before one of biggest issues with chronic eye drops, particularly Restasis because of its single-dose applicator, is dosage and compliance. Because it's very hard to get that little single dose in the eye.","And so for patient convenience and patient compliance in dosing, the multi-dose applicator is a huge innovation and something that we're very excited about bringing to market next year. And then keep in mind we also have four other development programs of both Restasis and novel mechanisms earlier in our pipeline.","On Bystolic in cardio I mean I think the way I think about it \u2013 and Bill can certainly chime in \u2013 is Bystolic, while certainly a cardio drug, is managed a bit more like a primary care drug, in about 80% of its volume comes from our primary care field force. We do have a partnership with Trevena for an earlier stage product. So we're not completely walking away from cardio. But it's not one of our core focus therapeutic areas.","Bill or David, anything you'd add?","William J. Meury - Executive President-Branded Pharma","Yeah. That's exactly right. The exclusivity period on Bystolic extends out for many years. It's a big primary care product. We're going to increase detailing in the second half of the year. We have great formulary coverage. And it's got a terrific following in cardiology and primary care.","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","And I always hear anecdotal, but I hear from doctors all the time about it being their favorite beta-blocker to prescribe, so long as they can get it through managed care.","Sumant S. Kulkarni - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Marc Goodman with UBS.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Yes. Morning. Brent or maybe Bill, can you talk about some of the key products in the portfolio and just the dynamics in the quarter? Restasis seemed to be very, very strong in the quarter, much bigger than what we thought. Breast Aesthetics was much weaker than we thought and Botox. Just some of the key products and just the dynamics, U.S. versus International, what's going on? Thanks.","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","Sure. Maybe I'll ask Bill to talk about his. And then Philippe maybe you could chime in on a few of the key aesthetic products.","Philippe Schaison - President, Allergan Medical","Sure.","William J. Meury - Executive President-Branded Pharma","Yeah. I'll start with Botox, Botox therapeutic. We're focused on two high-growth areas, which is migraine and overactive bladder. Our priorities right now are to increase injector productivity and expand our injector user base. And we have complete focus on that.","We think the trends in the second quarter look terrific. And I think the outlook for the rest of the year is the same. I don't see anything that would disrupt the reliability of that sale stream.","As it relates to Restasis we're focused on a large OTC artificial tear market. There are millions of patients overusing artificial tiers. We have an effort where we're \u2013 to increase the diagnosis rate through in-office screenings for dry eye, which have been linked to blurred vision, adverse post-op outcomes. And so there's an educational effort there. And then finally, we launched a primary care effort for Restasis. And the formulary coverage on the drug is rock solid.","And then I'd just probably add Linzess in there. We have our foot on the gas. The response to our second wave of direct-to-consumer advertising is exceeding industry norms. We just launched a effort into long-term care for the first time since Linzess was approved, and that's about 25% of the market. Our relationship with Ironwood is excellent. And we're waiting to launch a low-dose version of Linzess.","And so I feel very good about our top products. And as Brent mentioned in his opening remarks, 12 of our 15 products are increasing. If you look at the U.S. business 12 of the 15 products are increasing at a double-digit rate. And we've had virtually in my opinion no disruption due to the integration. And there's total focus on customers.","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","Great. Philippe, you have some thoughts?","Philippe Schaison - President, Allergan Medical","Sure. On facial business grew by 13.5% versus the prior year for the quarter. And year to date we grew by 13%. Very strong growth also in Botox, which grew by 12.5%.","Although the growth is mostly linked to our strong DTC campaign, and you might have seen our Botox ad and our Voluma ad. And on Voluma you can see that the brand awareness increased by 42% from 27% in Q1. So very strong business and linked to very strong advertising during the year, second quarter.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein.","Ronny Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And good morning to everybody and thank you for taking my questions. Just a quick housekeeping one. Would you be able to provide us the constant currency growth rate for the Aesthetic products? This is I guess the way we're tracking this, might be really useful to have those.","And then second regarding the article on the Mesalamine franchise, I noticed that you were excluded in both CVS and Express formularies starting in 2016. How should we think about this franchise? Is there another phase to this franchise? Or is this something that will generally \u2013 we should think about it as a flat to declining?","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yeah. So, Tessa, do you want to take the first part?","Maria Teresa Hilado - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. So on an overall basis ex currency we grew about 11%. Think about it this way. Most of our Aesthetics products are really mostly U.S. products. So there are products sold internationally, but it's not significant as it relates to the total portfolio. So a good amount of them does not have any currency impact, given they're U.S.-based.","William J. Meury - Executive President-Branded Pharma","Yeah. And as it relates to the Mesalamine product line, as you know, Ronny, you win some and you lose some. We got a big win with Linzess on that same formulary at the expense of Amitiza. But as it related to the Mesalamine product line, they excluded it.","We view it as a mature business. It is promoted behind Linzess. We have a core group of users. We're managing volume. And of course taking price increases when and where appropriate. And that's how I would think about it as an established business.","Ronny Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","Thanks, Ronny.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Elliot Wilbur with Raymond James.","Elliot Wilbur - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. In just running through the segment data it looks like the Generic business contributed about 23% of segment profitability inclusive of R&D allocation. And I guess going forward we're all sort of tasked with trying to figure out how much of the proceeds in the Generic business will be applied to immediate debt reduction versus potentially using internal cash flow generation to pay down debt and target external opportunities.","But is that sort of the right percentage to think about in kind of just of a ballpark number when thinking about your prior indications that the combined business would generate around $8 billion in free cash flow? Would the Generic business count for roughly 20%, 25% of that?","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","Well it's a \u2013 and Tessa can certainly add her $0.02. Elliot, I think it's not that simple. And that's the issue I think that we were trying to highlight with the earlier comments around it being very tough for you guys \u2013 and our apologies in advance for that \u2013 for the next couple quarters. Because what's in that business it's \u2013 as we report it today it isn't necessarily what's being sold to Teva down a straight line.","Also as you do GAAP reporting and reporting around discontinued operations, what gets assigned to what part of each business is also not intuitive and not necessarily straightforward to reality either?","So it's going to make for some difficult quarters ahead. Again we are committed to as much transparency as we can possibly provide around product sales. And perhaps cash flow may be a good way to look at the business. But it's not as straightforward or as intuitive as you would hope or want it to be, just in fairness. I don't know if, Tessa, you're...","Maria Teresa Hilado - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I mean if I may just add to that just to give a little bit of context. It's to remember that we were really managing the business on a consolidated basis. We weren't managing the business separately as solely a Generic business and a Branded business. We didn't have the holding company approach. We actually were managing the business on a consolidated basis.","And from a segment reporting basis even today in International Brands or Generic products in there and in Global Generics, there's also Branded products.","The other thing to note, which you also highlighted, is from a balance sheet perspective, it's really all intermingled as it relates to debt and the tax rate. Some of the things are not necessarily operationally related. So I just wanted to give context as to why it's not as difficult to start to like (54:58) strip out and do a percentage of cash flow and say that's what's attributable to Generics.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Randall Stanicky with RBC Capital.","Randall S. Stanicky - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks guys. Brent, just a question for you. A lot of people have been watching the legacy Allergan products, waiting for some moderation. That hasn't happened. In fact they were really strong.","And so the question that I have is just given the difference in spending support levels on sales and marketing between the legacy Allergan and where you're at today, and I'm just looking at slide 15. Number one, do you feel like that infrastructure is right-sized? And then secondly, just your confidence level in some of the key products and being able to continue to sustain that growth? I mean Botox and Restasis were very strong.","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yeah. I think, Randall, it's a great question. So I think we are \u2013 we have rationalized our sale force for our acquisitions and for the market as we see it over the next few years. And so we don't anticipate any additional cuts in the field.","And in fact we would selectively add if we thought the opportunity paid back. So as an example with the acquisition of Kythera, we will increase our facial Aesthetic sales force by roughly 75 positions, making us the strongest field force in Aesthetics by a large margin.","And so I think you'll see us continue to look for ways, so long as we're increasing our line call type strategy of product flow, either through our R&D engine or through licensing and acquisition, of building and making sure we maintain leadership, strong leadership positions commercially in each of our therapeutic areas.","With respect to spending on DTC and otherwise we always look at the return on investment. And so the extent we think we can add more money to a Botox or a Restasis or a Linzess or even Namzaric, which will kick off in the fall DTC. We're always monitoring the situation, looking at both response and return on those investments. And have no issue making them so long as we see a strong ROI.","Randall S. Stanicky - RBC Capital Markets LLC","The other thing that we'd heard legacy Allergan talk a lot about was the international emerging market in Asian geographies as a big opportunity. Is that something that we should still think about for you guys that is in front of you?","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yeah. I think it is. It's a slower build but bigger \u2013 but big opportunity over time. I mean look at the approvals for example of Juvederm in China this quarter. That gives us a great opportunity to build on Botox in that market. I'll be down in Brazil next week with our team, looking at how we can continue to leverage our infrastructure in Latin America and grow.","So clearly the divestiture of the Teva business has some drawbacks in mid-markets like Eastern Europe and Russia in that we were going to leverage the old legacy Actavis infrastructure in those markets. But I think we can compensate for those and continue to grow and build in emerging markets.","Randall S. Stanicky - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks, Brent.","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","Sure.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI.","Umer Raffat - Evercore ISI","Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe the first one for David. David, what's the status on the DARPin Japanese trial that's ongoing? Should we be expecting an update soon? And what would that look like?","And then second one for Brent, if I may. On transformational M&A the question we all keep getting from investors, so how do you think about companies with growth profiles that might be lower than with your 10%? Or companies with potential biosimilar headwinds? Or even ex U.S. companies for that matter? Just wanted to understand how you think about this.","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","Sure. David, you want to take DARPin? And I'll come back to the transformational M&A question.","C. David Nicholson, PhD - Senior Vice President, Brand Research & Development","Yeah. So sure. Yeah. So for DARPin in Japan, we actually want Japan to join in our global Phase III program. In order to do that, we needed to complete a small study in Japan and compare it to an additional small study in the United States. We're in the process of finalizing those studies prior to including Japanese sites in the Phase III trials sometime next year. So yeah. There will be some updates on that going forward.","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","And I think to your second point, Umer, around transformational M&A with companies with lower growth profiles or the like. Look, I think in that in fairness it would be very difficult for us to do a transformational deal with a company with a higher growth rate, because I think based on at least today's measure, the only one with a higher growth rate is Celgene. So that would really limit the universe.","That being said, I think that the issue for us is, look, we want to be in Growth Pharma. Would we be willing to go from, let's say, roughly 10% to a 9% top-line growth rate to do a highly accretive bottom-line deal? The answer is absolutely. Would we be willing to go from 10% to 3% or 4% top-line growth to do a highly accretive deal? I would say highly unlikely.","And so we want to go out and make sure that we can acquire something that we believe has a growth orientation to it. That has longer-duration assets. And I think you should also keep in mind we're pretty \u2013 as I use the word \u2013 bold in our thinking.","So I think a lot of people look at the universe of transformational deals and say, well you can't touch this because it's got this particular product drag or this particular issue. We've been known to be very creative in solving for those things in the past. And albeit a very small deal, I would point to Furiex as just an illustration, where they had two assets. They had the NDA for Eluxadoline, and they had a royalty stream from Takeda. We divested the royalty stream of Takeda to Royalty Pharma at the time we announced the deal. We had that pre-wired.","And so we kept what we wanted, and we sold something that was valuable to somebody else to help pay for the deal. And so to the extent we look at companies or opportunities that have things we like and some things perhaps we don't like, there are always potential solutions for solving for those issues.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Brent, if another party were to boldly approach you as an inversion target, other than doing what's best for shareholders, which I think you have a reputation of doing, along with Paul and the Board, are there certain elements of the model and its specialness and growth profile that you'd be concerned about that might play into your thinking about longer-term shareholder value creation? Thanks.","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yeah. So, Gregg, I think you're right. It would have to be a bold offer. Second, I think Paul and I always would debate and talk to our board about the best long-term interests of our shareholders. And I think as you step back and look at what I think is so special about this company, a lot of it goes to the depth and quality of our management team. And so to the extent someone would be open to thinking about cultural change and change and balance to leadership and talent and management, I think that would be more helpful for us.","I think clearly our commitment to R&D and the way we think about R&D is also very special. And I think our ability to be nimble and move quickly and do what we believe is always in the shareholders' best interest is also a bit unique. And so those are the types of discussions that we would have. It's not limited to that. But that would be, I think, at least top of mind for debate. And I see Paul shaking his head, so I know he's in agreement.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of David Maris with BMO Capital.","David W. Maris - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning. On the Naurex, this looks to be like a potential $1 billion-plus drug. And I know we'll cover more of it during the R&D day. But if maybe you can talk a little bit about what has attracted you to this? How it's differentiated in the market? But also most importantly, what's the \u2013 what are the next steps toward the path to approval?","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yeah. So I'll ask David to comment. I'll just give you my quick take of why I was so excited to do the deal with Naurex. Is that this is an area, a huge market with huge white space for unmet need. You can debate the numbers. But very few patients \u2013 in fact the minority of patients \u2013 are adequately served by SSRI or SNRI. And then they have to live with, in some cases, very difficult side effects from those medicines, as well as a long onset of action for those with acute issues that need to be dealt with more quickly.","And I think, David, you mentioned this in your earlier remarks. There has been no real novel breakthrough in depression in about 20 years. And so for us to be able to be at the forefront of potentially revolutionizing the treatment of this very large and horrific disease is something that I think is very exciting for us, given our commitment to leading in CNS and in particular psychiatry.","David, your $0.02?","C. David Nicholson, PhD - Senior Vice President, Brand Research & Development","Yeah. I've only got time for $0.02 apparently, so I'll have to be quick. So I've been working in psychiatry for 20 years. I've taken compounds through to the market. Bill and his team have commercialized some of the biggest-selling antidepressants.","So I think the team that we've got here knows depression in the area over the last 20 decades (sic) [20 years] (1:05:20). So when an opportunity like Naurex comes along with a novel mechanism of action \u2013 over the last two decades. Yeah. I've been corrected by my colleagues.","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","It's pretty odd if you're here for 20 decades.","C.

David Nicholson, PhD - Senior Vice President, Brand Research & Development","So when a new opportunity comes along with a new mechanism of action, I think the team here can recognize it and seize it pretty quickly.","These things are exciting. Completely novel mechanism of action. And showing a fast-on set of action in depression. And not only in depression, but in depression where the patients fail to respond to SSRIs. So that's an exciting opportunity.","And the next steps for us are to get into Phase III as quickly as possible with GLYX-13, the lead molecule. And to get into Phase IIb with the second compound, NRX-1074. And we aim to do that as early as possible next year.","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","Certainly, we'd like to close the deal. But then we'll move pretty aggressively to doing it.","David W. Maris - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","And our final question for the day will come from the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","Lisa M. DeFrancesco - Vice President, Investor Relations","David, are you there?","Operator","You might be on mute sir.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Sorry about that. Thanks for your patience. I apologize. Yeah. So thanks for my taking my question as well. I appreciate it. I guess I have a couple of questions here.","The first is with respect to the Generics business that you're selling to Teva, there were some slight differences between the press release and the slides. Could you just tell us what the organic growth was in the second quarter of the Generics business that you're selling? And then I have a follow-up.","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yeah. Dave, if I understand the question I think the differences are between what we have and what Teva had on their slide deck. And it would be very difficult for us to comment on the differences between what we have and what another company has.","Maria Teresa Hilado - Chief Financial Officer","So if I recall we provided the Generics business EBITDA for 2015. And they provided a number for 2016. That was the difference.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Oh sorry.","Maria Teresa Hilado - Chief Financial Officer","And obviously we can't comment on their...","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","And just to be fair, it's their number for 2016, not our number for 2016. Just to be clear.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. I'm sorry. I meant the difference between Allergan's press release today and Allergan's slides today, there were some slight differences in the revenue reported on your PF slide (1:08:11)...","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","Got it.","Maria Teresa Hilado - Chief Financial Officer","We can address that.","Lisa M. DeFrancesco - Vice President, Investor Relations","Yeah. Hi, David. It's Lisa. So in the top Global Branded product highlight slide, the ex U.S. Branded products from Forest, Warner Chilcott, and Actavis are not counted as Generic products. They're counted in the Brand total.","When you look at our Global Generics segment, our Global Generics segment still counts those as per accounting rules as part of the Global Generics business. That's the difference.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And in terms of the organic growth of the Generics business, what was that in the second quarter?","Lisa M. DeFrancesco - Vice President, Investor Relations","That's what we gave you as \u2013 well the Global Generics segment itself grew 17% on a constant currency basis quarter over quarter.","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","And that's not a clean...","Lisa M. DeFrancesco - Vice President, Investor Relations","Right.","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","What \u2013 that's the point I was trying to make earlier about why it's so difficult to model. That's not apples to apples of what's being sold and what's staying. They're puts-and-takes in from the segments versus what was actually being sold. And that's what makes this so complicated.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Got it. Okay. Yeah. I can follow up on that. And then separately with respect to the Namenda switch here, obviously it's taking you longer than expected to get to your target of 60% to 65%. But you're leaving that unchanged. I guess I'm a little bit surprised if you're leaving that unchanged, when you talk about 60% to 65% is that a percentage of the total prescriptions including the Generics? Or is that just the Branded Allergen franchise that you're now forecasting?","William J. Meury - Executive President-Branded Pharma","That would be the total Namenda business including Brands and Generics. And the way we think about it is we launched Namzaric only 2.5 weeks ago. Our DTC campaign starts in September. We expect exceptional formulary coverage by January 1. And the incremental sales from Namzaric by essentially taking advantage of an untapped combination market, especially in moderate Alzheimer's disease, effectively is going to get us to our target conversion rate.","As I said earlier if the formulary coverage had not developed like it has, we might have a different situation right here. But as it relates to 2016 Namzaric is going to be highly economical. [Namenda] XR already is. And I think the majority of patients are going to have an opportunity to get it.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you very much.","William J. Meury - Executive President-Branded Pharma","Sure.","Lisa M. DeFrancesco - Vice President, Investor Relations","Okay. Thanks everybody. Brent, would you like to make some closing remarks?","Brenton L. Saunders - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yes. I would just like to thank everyone for joining the call today. And in closing just to summarize I think we had a very strong and well-executed quarter. I think our plans are in motion to continue to focus on operational excellence and driving our growth agenda and our focus on our key therapeutic categories and establishing long-duration leadership in those categories.","I think our leading pipeline, our reloaded capital structure, and our now focus on Branded Pharmaceuticals and willingness to take bold and decisive actions make us the most dynamic company in Growth Pharma. I thank you for your time and look forward to updating you later again in September.","Lisa M. DeFrancesco - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thanks everyone. And I know we didn't get to quite a few people in the Q&A, so we'll follow up with you shortly.

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. During the fourth quarter, Allergan sales grew versus the fourth quarter of 2010 by 7.2% and due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most world currencies by a higher 8.2% in local currencies. We enjoyed double-digit growth in many operating regions. That is, in the U.S., pharmaceutical business, thanks to the acceleration of the Botox therapeutic franchise, in Latin America and in Asia Pacific, while business and economic conditions in Europe were more challenging than earlier in the year. ","For the full year of 2011, Allergan grew year-over-year by 10.9% in dollars and 9.2% in local currencies with double digit growth in all of our overseas operating regions: Europe, Africa, Middle East, Latin America and Asia Pacific. ","Regarding operating performance, we continued on a strong trajectory, with fourth quarter non-GAAP diluted earnings per share at $1 even, marking an increase of 13.6% over the fourth quarter of 2010 and above the range provided on the last earnings call. ","Gross margin in the quarter was a direct core tie of 86.8% of sales, which Jeff Edwards will comment shortly. For the full year of 2011, Allergan generated on the same basis, earnings per share of $3.65, an increase of 15.5% over 2010. For reconciliation to GAAP numbers kindly consult our press release. ","With this strong result, we are pleased that we delivered on our midterm aspiration of mid-teens earnings per share growth. The strong earnings were achieved after we absorbed estimated total cost of U.S. healthcare reform and overseas price cuts of just over $130 million on a pre-tax equivalent basis. The split is just over $90 million for U.S. healthcare reform and approximately $40 million for overseas price reductions. ","At the start of the year, we have estimated the cost of $100 million for the year. These costs increased as the year progressed as we were hit with waves of mandated price reductions in Europe as well as in South Korea, and in Q4, by an increase in our accrual for the so-called doughnut toll for Medicare Part D by an additional amount in excess of $10 million. "," ","Of the $130 million-plus, approximately $100 million was reflected as a reduction to net sales. We continue to invest vigorously into our future, increasing our investment into R&D by 12.6% to $858 million on a non-GAAP basis. ","For 2012, we plan to execute off the large number of regulatory approvals that we secured from agencies around the world in 2010 and 2011. It is to be noted that in the guidance given for 2012, that R&D is substantially higher than the models of many sell-side analysts. ","During 2011, we maintained a high level of investment in SG&A at just over 40.3% of sales in line with 2010. Regarding the investment in DTC, we spent $177 million in 2011, just over the $171 million expensed in 2010. As we added a new branded, unbranded campaign for chronic migraine, it is evident that spend in other brands was leveraged, as we transition from the creation of brand awareness to maintaining consumer awareness. ","Now turning to the performance of the individual businesses. Regarding ophthalmic pharmaceuticals. After an outlier quarter of weak growth in Q3, fourth quarter growth returned to double-digit in local currencies of 10.7% and 9.2% in dollars. This is very much in line with full year 2011 growth over 2010 at 9.9% in local currencies and 11.4% in dollars and matching up with the year-to-date September growth numbers of 10% reported by IMS Global. ","Of course, you'll note, we're always one quarter in arrears given market research. In the U.S., we're picking up in growth, as we have worked our way past the genericization of ACULAR and ELESTAT and have stabilized the base ALPHAGAN product, after licensing remonidine 0.15% to Alcon. ","Even after the genericization of Zylotan, LUMIGAN continues to grow strongly and is poised to overtake Travatan in terms of prescriptions in the coming weeks. Given the lower rates of hyperemia for LUMIGAN 0.01% and physician perception of the efficacy of LUMIGAN, the percentage of new prescriptions written for LUMIGAN 0.01%, as a proportion of all LUMIGAN prescriptions, has passed the 50% mark. ","In 2012, LUMIGAN enjoys the best formulary position ever. COMBIGAN and RESTASIS also continued to grow strongly in the United States. All of our overseas regions enjoy double-digit growth in the fourth quarter. In Europe, strong performance is being driven by LUMIGAN, GANFORT, OPTIVE and OZURDEX. In Latin America, we are the fastest-growing multinational ophthalmic company, with a wide range of countries enjoying strong advances, driven by LUMIGAN 0.01%, GANFORT, our tears products, as well as RELESTAT and Zypred. ","In Asia, we are growing very strongly across Southeast Asia, as well as in China, although off a small base. In addition, we are growing share in our large businesses in India and Korea. LUMIGAN 0.01% was recently launched in India. ","For 2012, we are pleased that we have just launched in the U.S. a new OPTIVE product, OPTIVE Advanced, a triple-action formula that works on all layers of the tear film. In Europe, the same product has just been launched as OPTIVE Plus. ","Regarding of ALPHAGAN, our partner in Japan, Senju, just secured approval and will mark the product -- will market the product as AIPHAGAN. In Russia, we commenced selling ALPHAGAN P and GANFORT in January and will launch other products shortly. OZURDEX, since the last earnings call, has been approved either for retinal vein occlusion or retinal vein occlusion and uveitis in several countries, namely Canada, Israel, Switzerland, Singapore, Mexico, Chile and Sri Lanka. ","Regarding BOTOX, sales increased versus the fourth quarter of 2010 by 8.3% in local currencies and by 7.5% in dollars. The full year 2011, sales grew by 10.4% in local currencies and 12.4% in dollars. ","Concerning the full year of 2011, we estimate that sales of BOTOX for therapeutic indications, and separately, cosmetic use, both grew 12% versus prior year. ","Commenting for fourth quarter performance. Sales in the U.S. therapeutic business continued to grow at a mid-teens rate. This is driven, not only by chronic migraine, which is increasing steadily well in excess of this rate, but also by our movement disorders franchise, boosted by the upper limb spasticity indication. With the U.S. neurogenic bladder launch in November, sales in Q4 from this indication were only limited. ","The U.S. chronic migraine launch is progressing very well and better than planned. We have now trained about 4,600 individual physicians, either via the Web or live injector training sessions, with most of the trainings in the last quarter being in the more productive live format. In total, almost 5,600 trainings have been conducted since approval. ","Reimbursement access continues to improve, with 88% of all commercial lives having policy coverage at year end. The volume of insurance verifications continues to increase and the number of denials to prior authorizations falls. As physicians become convinced that there is reimbursement available, the average number of units injected moves closer to the FDA indicated dose of 155 units. ","Monitoring the effectiveness of our unbranded DTC campaign, which commenced at the end of September, we have clear number -- metrics of number of website hits and visits to the find-a-doctor page. From this month onwards, we are placing branded advertisements in women's magazines. Our surveys indicate high levels of patient satisfaction. ","Regarding competition, therapeutic market share for movement disorders for Dysport and Xeomin combined is stagnating around 5%. BOTOX therapeutic sales in Europe suffered from government austerity measures, as well as the impact of mandated price reductions. Sales in our Asia Pacific markets and largest countries in Latin America continue to grow double-digit. Sales from our partner, GlaxoSmithKline in Japan, were also on a strong growth trend. ","Please note that we book royalty income for Japan, not sales. Since the last earnings call, we received additional country approvals for chronic migraine in a host of countries: Canada, Sweden, Spain, Vietnam, Bangladesh and Peru; for neurogenic detrusor overactivity approvals in Canada, Spain, Austria, the Czech Republic, Portugal, Estonia and Peru. We've also received a positive opinion from France for the cell-based BOTOX release assay and an approval in the Czech Republic. In Japan, our partner, GlaxoSmithKline, filed BOTOX for the treatment of axillary hyperhidrosis. ","I'll now move on to give further color regarding aesthetics category sales. First of all, U.S. market conditions remain good and appeared to have strengthened since the summer. We estimate that in the fourth quarter, the markets grew year-over-year as follows. Consumer demand for aesthetic neuromodulators in the low-double digits, fillers in the upper teens and breast procedures in the high-single digit. Given the impact of our consumer promotions, there may be short timing differences between consumer demand and x factory shipments. ","Regarding market share in the U.S., aesthetic neuromodulator category, it seems that Dysport share is stagnating in the high teens. The most recent survey for December shows Dysport at 17% and Xeomin with 8%, the latter driven by very heavy sampling with roughly a quarter of Xeomin's gain stemming from Dysport. ","Sales in Europe were challenging, given economic conditions and some market share loss, as Bocouture and Azzalure enter new markets. Sales in the quarter continued to grow in the double digits in Asia Pacific and our main markets in Latin America. We are pleased that we commenced our direct sales operations for Allergan Medical in Russia this week. ","Regarding worldwide market share for all users of neuromodulators in Q3 2011, the last periods for which we have data available, we estimate that BOTOX enjoyed about 78.5% market share, actually gaining about 180 basis points from the year earlier, as we regained some share in the aesthetic space, despite the entry of new competition. ","From the sales expectations contained in our press release, you will note that we had foresee double-digit BOTOX sales growth in 2011 (sic) [2012], led by the newly approved therapeutic indications. Commencing facial aesthetics, meaning thermal fillers, sales in the fourth quarter increased by 13.5% in local currencies and 12.4% in dollars. The full year sales grew by 24.9% in local currencies and by 27.8% in dollars. ","Regarding the fourth quarter, sales growth was more moderate relative to earlier quarters in the year, principally due to the timing of our promotion in the U.S. called Duet Dividends, that provided incentives to physicians to place combination orders for BOTOX and JUV\u00c9DERM. ","The sell-in of this promotion, which was highly successful, ended in the 3rd week of September. Analyzing the data, this clearly boosted sales in Q3, as was commented on the last call, and then tempered x factory sales in Q4, especially in October. ","As stated earlier, we estimate that consumer demand in the U.S. filler market is growing in the upper teens, and JUV\u00c9DERM actually gained some share year-over-year in Q4. In all the other operating regions, including Europe and Canada, we continue to enjoy volume growth. ","In Brazil, we have successfully supported JUV\u00c9DERM with DTC advertising. ","Coming back to the U.S. This week, we started taking orders for JUV\u00c9DERM presentation, which contains 25% more clinically relevant hyaluronic acid in a new 1 mL syringe. Sold at the same price as the 0.8 mL syringe, this is yet another way that Allergan is providing value for our customers. ","Breast aesthetics. Breast aesthetic sales increased in the fourth quarter by 2.5% in local currencies and 2.0% in dollars. For the full year, sales grew 7.2% in local currencies and 9.5% in dollars. As commented earlier, we estimate the U.S. market in the fourth quarter grew in procedures in the high-single digit, better than we'd expected at the time of the last earnings call. ","Given steady long-term share gains, as Allergan can offer a full line of market leading products, Mentor has responded with price reductions in certain selected accounts. We maintained price discipline and we're willing to walk away from certain low-priced accounts. As a result, we may have lost some marginal share at year end. ","Throughout the year, U.S. sales have benefited from market preference for higher-priced silicone implants and new tissue expander products. In the fourth quarter, from some initial sales of our Vectra XT imaging system. ","In Europe, sales continued to grow modestly, even in most southern European markets. Given the scandal around the French PIP company, implant company, since mid-December, and media attention, we're monitoring the situation carefully, especially in France, the U.K., Germany and Italy, where most of the PIP implants result. So far, we have not suffered any noticeable impact on our sales, although it is quite possible that surgeons may be moving away from lower-priced competitors to our higher-priced quality products. ","Sales growth in Latin America and Asia was lower than in prior quarters due to differences in timing of shipments to distributors in Q4 of 2011 versus Q4 of 2010. Our skin care franchise grew in the fourth quarter year-over-year by a strong 19.8% in dollars and virtually the same at 19.9% to local currencies, given that this is mostly U.S. business. ","Full year sales growth was just over 13% in dollars and local currencies. The fourth quarter result was driven by a jump of 41% in LATISSE sales, as we sold in a special offer to physicians in dispensing states in Q4 2011, coupled with an aggressive sampling campaign in Q4 2010, i.e. the prior year, which dampened the prior year sales. ","Since the repositioning of the product as part of a woman's 8 anti-aging portfolio of products, we have seen an improvement in product perception in our consumer and attitude surveys. In addition to the U.S., contributions to sales growth came from Canada, Mexico, where we can support the product with DTC advertising, Brazil, Hong Kong and other markets in Southeast and East Asia. ","ACZONE sales benefiting from a dedicated medical dermatology sales force and increased deployment, jumped more than 50%, with TAZORAC x factory sales declining modestly, although we see in-market acquisition dollars growing 8% year-over-year in Q4. More detailed attention is being devoted to TAZORAC since Q3.","Regarding the obesity intervention line, sales in the fourth quarter continued on a disappointing trend, declining 23.0% in dollars and 22.7% in local currencies. Year-to-date sales declined 16.5% in dollars and 18.1% local currencies. ","On a positive note, we're able to increase our sales of ORBERA Balloon, driven by a strong performance in Latin America. LAP-BAND sales in the U.S. are being impacted both by high unemployment rates, as well as reimbursement barriers and increasing co-pays, as employers shift cost to their employees. Sales in Australia also declined for similar reasons. In the overall, U.S. bariatric market, which we estimate declined 6% year-to-date in November, bands declined in procedure share to 40% in November from 52% a year earlier, whilst bypass held steady at 34% and sleeve gastrectomy doubled from 11% to 22%. ","Based on overseas experience, we believe that sleeve will reach a plateau. The only bright share data point is that LAP-BAND increased its share of the band market to 83%. In light of these market dynamics, we have made a major change in our resource allocation, to access to reimbursement, expanding both the teams dedicated to LAP-BAND, as well as harnessing the full strength of our full managed markets team. This is the same team that has produced great results for BOTOX and our ophthalmic products. ","We do have convincing health economics data to influence policy changes, both with managed care organizations, as well as large corporate and government employers. Regarding LAP-BAND for use in adolescents, we are conducting a study at the suggestion of the FDA who wish to receive clinical data. We will, however, not be pursuing a label extension to adolescents. And I'll now pass over to Jeff Edwards, who will comment on our financials.","Jeffrey L. Edwards","Thanks, David, and good morning to all of you on the call. During the fourth quarter of 2011, Allergan generated high-quality operating results despite increasing headwinds relating to U.S. Health Care Reform and Europe pricing pressures. Allergan continues to successfully manage and perform through this type of pressure due to our diversified base of business, strong product platform and thoughtfully directed approach to investing into the businesses. This portfolio-based approach has once again enabled the company to deliver non-GAAP diluted earnings per share results above the top end of our earnings per share guidance for the quarter.","Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $1, marking a 13.6% increase over 2010 results for the same quarter. Excluding the effects of the fourth quarter 2010 R&D tax catch-up, non-GAAP diluted EPS growth for the fourth quarter was approximately 19%. As a reminder, the fourth quarter earnings per share for 2010 was positively impacted by approximately $0.04 due to the retroactive benefit caused by the renewal of the U.S. R&D tax credit in 2010. A reconciliation of all of the adjustments to GAAP earnings is set out in our earnings release. ","For the full year of 2011, Allergan delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.65, despite the increasing cost related to U.S. Health Care Reform and Europe pricing and economic pressures mentioned by David. The strong full year EPS result was above the high end of our range of expectations provided in February 2011 of $3.54 to $3.60. ","Our commitment to the long-term future of our company and to our shareholders is evident in this result as we were able to both invest strongly into our growth drivers of the business and pass stronger earnings performance onto our shareholders in the form of greater EPS performance. ","Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments, Allergan's Q4 2011 gross margin of 86.8% increased 100 basis points when compared to Q4 2010. And Allergan once again saw sequential quarterly improvement in both its pharmaceutical and medical device margins. This continuing positive gross margin trend has been driven primarily by improved year-over-year standard costs, positive manufacturing variances, lower year-over-year inventory provisions, lower royalty expenses and in the fourth quarter, favorable geographic and product mix. Favorable margins were partially offset by the continuing pricing pressures we are experiencing around the world on reimbursed products. The non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses to product net sales ratio for the fourth quarter was 39%, totaling 550 -- I'm sorry, $540 million. ","The comparable ratio and expense value for the same period in 2010 were 40% and $517 million, respectively. We continue to recognize the benefits of leveraging many of our businesses while continuing to have the flexibility to make meaningful, focused investments on projects that we believe will yield the greatest financial returns. ","Allergan will continue to seek out these thoughtful value-driving investments during 2012. However, expectations are that there will be -- that we will be in the position to produce some SG&A spending leverage versus 2011 non-GAAP full year results. ","Non-GAAP research and development expenses were 16.4% of product net sales for the quarter, totaling $226 million, an increase in spend of approximately $26 million over the fourth quarter of 2010, when the ratio of R&D spend to product net sales was 15.5%. ","It is worth noting that the R&D spend during the fourth quarter was sequentially above the level of spend for the third quarter of 2011, and represented the third consecutive quarter of sequential quarterly R&D spend increase, excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments, as we continue to fund new projects and increase funding of projects, which we're advancing through the pipeline. We will address the R&D pipeline in more detail at our upcoming R&D day, in late March of this year. ","Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments, Allergan's fourth quarter operating income ratio increased by 110 basis points when compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Solid top line growth, as well as continuing strengthening of the gross margins and enhanced leverage within the SG&A category are the primary drivers of this improvement. ","With respect to our balance sheet, consolidated Allergan days sales outstanding was 48 days, while consolidated Allergan inventory days on hand was 125 days. Allergan generated operating cash flow after CapEx of approximately $339 million in the quarter and $965 million for the full year of 2010. This compares to $955 million generated for the full year of 2010 after excluding the impact of the fourth quarter 2010 payments to the Department of Justice of approximately $594 million. ","At the end of the fourth quarter, Allergan's cash and short-term investments -- and cash and short-term investments net of debt positions totaled approximately $2.6 billion and $987 million respectively. For the first quarter of 2010, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $1,340,000,000 to $1,390,000,000 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.84 to $0.86. Regarding full year expectations for 2012, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $5,650,000,000 to $5,850,000,000. Our 2012 expectations, assumes incremental pricing pressures outside of the U.S. of approximately $40 million and a negative currency impact of between 2% and 3% on sales growth. ","Allergan estimates full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share between $4.13 and $4.19, which represents growth of between 13% and 15%. This expectation assumes that the R&D -- the U.S. R&D tax credit will be renewed in the fourth quarter of 2012 with the full year retroactive benefit impacting Q4 results. This would generate a higher effective tax rate in the first 3 quarters of 2012, thus, a lower EPS result, while benefiting both the Q4 effective tax rate reported Q4 EPS. ","For your information, expectations for other lines of the income statement and specific product sales expectations are included in our earnings release. ","With respect to 2012 capital expenditures, we project a CapEx of approximately $200 million for the full year. Regarding 2012 cash flow, we expect to generate operating cash flow, after CapEx, in excess of $1 billion. We have assumed moderate levels of share repurchase activity of approximately 6 million shares in 2012, with our repurchase objectives limited to only match expected employee stock option-based compensation programs. ","Despite some of the challenges I\u2019ve made reference to earlier in my text, 2011 was a very successful year and a good year. We are a company with very sound, balanced and positioning and more importantly, are in a good place with respect to our future. We will make every effort to further build on our momentum and strengths while effectively executing against our strategies. Further strengthening Allergan's position as a leader within each of our selected specialty markets is an important success factor that we continuously aim to build upon. We look forward to the new opportunities emerging for Allergan in 2012. So with that, operator, I'd now like to open the call up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Corey Davis of Jefferies.","Corey B. Davis - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I want to ask about operating margin. And if my numbers, historically, are correct, I had a 24.2% in '07, and using your guidance, I'm up at 32.2% in 2012. So the question is, what are the chances that in another 5 years your operating margin is up another 8 percentage points? Or do you get to a point where expansion just hits a ceiling?","David E.I. Pyott","Yes, well. This is David here. I think, clearly, one area of leverage that we have is SG&A, where we're still pretty high. And so I think the real difficulty or the challenge for you on the sell side is trying to forecast what is the rates of our sales growth to then match up with our aspiration of meeting mid-teens EPS growth. And I think another, to the background comment I'd make is very clear intent here to continue driving productivity and efficiency. Because clearly, we live in an industry that is more under price pressure than it's ever been before. And if you just reflect on all the numbers I read for last year, it's pretty clear we did pretty well even after we've absorbed $130 million of costs in terms of U.S. healthcare reform and overseas price cuts. So that's the way I think about it. One other thing I should just quickly correct from my opening remarks, when I talked about outlook for BOTOX growth in 2012, I talked about double-digit and I misread it as 2011. I think it was clearly, a non sequitur, but I just wanted to straighten that out. Maybe the next question then.","Operator","Our next question is from Steve Willoughby of Cleveland Research.","Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company","I was wondering if you can just comment on your expectations for the aesthetic business in Europe in 2012, as compared to 2011?","David E.I. Pyott","Well, Europe, as you can sort of gather from all my remarks has done astoundingly well. When I read the press and the economic reports particularly in Southern Europe, one would think life would only be bad. However, we even have a double-digit growth in some of the categories in those markets. So I look at it the other way around, and say if things improve, how good could life be? Clearly, lots of opportunity. I think having lived, particularly in Spain, and knowing those cultures a little bit, of course, it's also a market or markets where there are people with money and then, unfortunately, people with not much money. And we probably are more skewed to the people who have economic purchasing power. And that in turn to me explains why our performance has held up. That being said, I think, when I push all the papers away and say, what do I have to pay attention to in 2012? Clearly, it's monitoring Europe carefully.","Operator","Our next question is from David Risinger, Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","My question relates to global migraine. It appears that the therapeutic portion is growing at about the same rate as the cosmetic portion of the business. And I believe that they're both about 50% of the BOTOX franchise sales. I guess my question is, beyond European price cuts, why isn't the therapeutic side growing faster? And how should we think about migraine? Obviously, your comments have been optimistic, but at least relative to our model, BOTOX sales were a little bit below what we were looking for, and it seems to be on the therapeutic side. So just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on whether we should be expecting therapeutic to accelerate as advertising drives more U.S. sales and\/or as x U.S. sales grow as the rollout continues?","David E.I. Pyott","Yes, okay. First of all, confirming your facts. Absolutely. If you look at 2011 growth versus 2010, cosmetic and therapeutic grew roughly the same. And roughly, it's 50-50. Now, for 2012, based on my comments on our operating plan, clearly, therapeutic will start lifting away from cosmetic, not because we're forecasting poor cosmetic sales, it's just we're going to start really seeing the ramp setting in. Because one of the great things with BOTOX is, once the muscle groups, and the doctors are sometimes different, in theory, it's the same -- it's just another sport that is similar. It's another racket sport, so to speak. Because we know that all the therapeutic launches are very long ramp. I\u2019ve often used the analogy, this isn't a fighter jet taking off, this is a 747 headed for the other side of the world. A long, long climb. And you'll start really seeing this climb setting in 2012 and indeed beyond that. So -- and then I spoke the other side, on the cosmetic, I have to say, well, caution with economy. And secondly, of course, we do have some new competition that we plan to deal with vigorously. But we're logical about the way we do our numbers. You have to lose some share when new people show up.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shibani Malhotra of RBC Capital.","Shibani Malhotra - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just back to Corey's question I guess on operating margins. You've talked about bringing your SG&A down to 35% over the last couple of years. But understand why you are spending as much as you did in terms of SG&A, but are you still thinking of taking the SG&A amount down to 35%? And what do you mean by medium-term and near-term because it's been 4 years now you've been saying that. How should we be thinking about it?","David E.I. Pyott","Well, clearly, we\u2019ve stated over the years that gradually, the SG&A rates will come down into the mid-30s. And this isn't because we'll be actually reducing SG&A. SG&A in raw dollars will increase. It's just at a much lower rate than sales. And I think people who have watched us over the years know that a gradual decline in that percent probably is a good thing. Although you've also seen the beginning of 2009 when the world was getting into a very rocky place, we were able to shut down spending very quickly because we, as appropriately at the time for everybody running a company, were acting with caution.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gregg Gilbert of Bank of America.","Gregory B. Gilbert - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I have a question for Jeff on gross margin. It looks like it hit an all-time high in the quarter. Correct me if I'm wrong on that. You mentioned regional mix and product mix. Are there any other positive factors that might be durable that helped the margin versus prior periods?","Jeffrey L. Edwards","Yes. There's a few things. So in the fourth quarter, if you look at last year 2010 and then the fourth quarter of 2011, you'll note that there is a bit of a blip in a favorable sense to gross margin in both years. Some of that or a lot of that is attributable to geographic mix. So a stronger U.S. component. And then if you look at the product mix, stronger both ophthalmology and BOTOX components within that. So that always drives some very nice performance for us. And some of that is attributable to the timing of the year and reimbursement. So if you look at sustainability, we've seen royalty expense decline. And our expectations are, as a percent, that should continue being the case. So that is sustainable. If you look at plant performance, our standard costs continued to improve. We had some very favorable variances this year. You could see that if we continue to perform above our expectations, you'll see positive variances as well. So the offset, of course, got to mention it, is there's ongoing pricing pressure in certain parts of the world. So we got to keep that in mind and we look at it in a basket. So I would say, generally strong manufacturing performance, strong standard cost performance, strong plant efficiencies, lower royalty expense, all very, very sustainable.","Operator","Our next question is from Ronny Gal of Sanford Bernstein.","Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Guys, would you mind breaking for us the share of revenue coming from emerging market, Europe and the United States? And as you look in 2012 and 2013, what percentage of growth will come from each one of the 3 geographies?","David E.I. Pyott","We've never broken that out. I think I would give you a lot of pieces of the puzzle. And I know you read my transcripts very carefully, and I think that enables you to tease out a lot of the information you're looking for.","Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So let me try something else. Around Japan, you're obviously launching now your 2 largest glaucoma products. Can you size for us or give us an idea about the size of the market that is -- you can target with your new product launches?","David E.I. Pyott","Well, first of all, we book no sales, we just book royalties and those show up on the other income line, which you've seen is growing rapidly. I'll talk about that line and then answer your question. And the other day, when I was sort of reflecting upon that, it's very interesting that when I came here, over a decade ago, we were a major spender of royalties, net. Whereas, gradually that balance is changing, where we still pay royalties to third parties, but we now have a rapidly growing royalty income line. And that's just what it takes, decades, for really, the results of a dramatically expanded R&D effort, which has converted into products. So going back to Japan, we're very pleased that our partner, Senju, is the second largest Japanese-owned company, great relationships, and they're making really good progress in terms of LUMIGAN which is on a very similar launch trajectory to what it was when we, Allergan, launched the product a decade ago in the United States. So a first-class job done by them. We also note from ALPHAGAN that it's a product with great popularity in East Asia. And I think it's the view of use of adjunctive therapy and also both Japanese and Chinese populations are very conscious about side effects. And ALPHAGAN has done very, very well indeed.","Operator","Our next question is from Marc Goodman of UBS.","Marc Goodman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Can you talk about new product launches for 2012 and 2013, please?","David E.I. Pyott","Well, I think in terms of the major ones I think about -- and, of course, there's lots of continuations of the approvals that have emanated in the U.S. or Europe, continuing on around the world, clearly, in terms of the big ones, it's -- the more regular, the larger overactive bladder indication for 2013. Also, another one I'm very excited about, which will be later this year, might be just tailing into the beginning of next, is the launch of VOLUMA, which is a really fantastic product, as we've known from its performance in Europe, Canada, Australia, other places. And then, of course, we have LATISSE. We should get approved some time later this year in the European Union. So those will be kind of my short-term ones and there's lots of sub-details.","Operator","Our next question is from Catherine Arnold of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Catherine J. Arnold - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I wanted to go get some elaboration, if you could, on your comment about migraine being better than planned. If you could give us some granularity given the poor visibility from our end in terms of your primary research. Maybe just sequentially what you're seeing in the quarter as far as prescribing base or patient penetration? Any kind of statistics that you might have from your primary research that could help or support what you just said?","David E.I. Pyott","Yes, well, obviously, I have a whole databank which I don't get to share with you. The way I monitor it is, first of all, through the number of physicians trained. And the reason that we sometimes have different numbers regarding trainings and physicians is some people choose to be trained more than once. Clearly, insurance access is the other one, and that process is pretty much coming to an end. Once you're in the 90s, in terms of commercial lives, where the product has policy availability, we're in good shape. So then it comes down to vials out of the door, and that's one of the beauties of our model that we ship virtually everything direct. And of course, we then know, with great specificity, what is deep in use by individual doctors. When it gets to hospitals, fractionally more complicated because there we're shipping to hospital pharmacy, and then, of course, we have to try and allocate. Is that going into movement disorders because we have a long-term historical base there, or is it the new injectors for, say, migraine or now it's just starting up for neurogenic overactive bladder. So you can go to the pharmacy and ask. And people understand why we're doing that. Of course, the other thing I look at is, not only surveys but anecdotes of patient satisfaction and we do consumer use and attitude surveys and to us, it's very apparent that the level of satisfaction with this product is very high relative to other pharmaceutical products that have been launched for, I'll use the broader term, headaches, in the last decade.","Operator","Our next question is from Ken Cacciatore of Cowen and Company.","Ken Cacciatore - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Just following up on that question, maybe more specific on DTC for migraine. As you choose to move to print now, am I going to assume that you can get more specific about actually talking about BOTOX as opposed to being a bit vague on the TV commercials? So can you give us a sense of what your internal work tells you about patient awareness for this treatment, so we can try to understand how much the DTC program will help drive utilization?","David E.I. Pyott","Well, clearly, and first of all, the unbranded campaign has worked because we know how many people have gone to our website. And the fact that they then click through to look for a doctor is -- we know the click through rates, all very positive. That being said, when we do surveys on what is patient awareness for the use of BOTOX, still very low. And I think that will change now that we will actually have our brand in the advertisement versus just educating consumers, patients, about the availability of the new treatments, which not all people will link up that actually it's BOTOX, as we\u2019d have expected. So now we're entering a new phase. And clearly, given the skewing, unfortunately, of chronic migraines to female population, the use of magazines, women's magazines, is a particularly good vehicle and cost efficient.","Operator","Our next question is from Annabel Samimy of Stifel, Nicolaus.","Annabel Samimy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to go back on the aesthetics issue for a minute. From your comments, it seems like things are going quite well in terms of the growth that you're seeing. But maybe consensus estimates were a bit too high but it seems they fell short on various factors. So I'm just curious to know if the things that affected aesthetics this quarter will be probably more in currencies or potentially in international growth, given the European pressures, given that your estimate seems to be holding up and what could we think about the 2012 guidance going forward. From your comments before, is Europe still going to be a stressed area or do you assume there's going to be gradual improvement over there?","David E.I. Pyott","Yes. Well, first of all, clearly, currency was a factor of the margin. For most of the year, at the beginning, that was the tailwind, now it's turned into a headwind. If one looks at the U.S., good conditions. One of the things that sometimes, I don't wish to be subtle, I'm trying to be very forthright. When I sat back and looked at all our numbers, clearly, that was the comment about our promotions. If you look at U.S. dividends, we sold that in, and physicians, clearly, were motivated to buy, and we can check that because we ship everything direct. So what I was saying is, that probably Q3, in terms of what was consumed, i.e. what was injected into patients, was slightly overstated and Q4, understated. Because, clearly, the physicians\u2019 stock\u2019s up, buying on the offer, if you like, and then for not a very long period, but a couple of weeks, that inventory has to be run down before they reorder. And so that's where I was really trying to put a spotlight on that. And when I look at all our numbers, I can see that in the U.S. medical business, at the margin for BOTOX and even more dramatically for fillers, which explains a lot of why the filler growth, Q3 year-over-year, is much higher than Q4 year-over-year. And otherwise, going back to Europe, fillers doing great. BOTOX, a little bit less, but there's also new competition. And if there's one thing I keep on reiterating, that we're watching very carefully is what's going on with the European economy. I'm not afraid of it. We're just watching it and making sure that we continue to deliver the results that we've laid out for ourselves and for you, our stockholders and analysts.","Operator","Our next question is from Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to focus on the Xeomin launch in the U.S. David, the 17% for Dysport and the 8% for Xeomin, that was procedure share, I assume. I was a little surprised at the 8%, given when Xeomin launched the 8% share, what's the trend and what's your expectation for that product? And that's it for me.","David E.I. Pyott","Sure. Well, first of all, there's always the risk of small numbers, where I, too, look at things. And I think the first data point was 1% or something. So at that moment, I was kind of feeling really good. And then 8%, you kind of go, wow, that's a bit higher than I'd expected, maybe. But, of course, one thing we've got to be very sanguine about is giving things away is much easier than actually selling product. And there's a massive amount of sampling going on. And if I were a physician, a, I would have intellectual curiosity. I\u2019d want to try it. And then secondly, if it's all free, I'm even more motivated to try it because, of course, I'm sure I'd be charging my patients, i.e., I've done something great for my personal bank account, right? So I think the next phase where Merz has stated that they will have national availability in March, which to me says they'll actually start selling versus giving away, that will become much more interesting. And we have a very robust series of measures to welcome them to our nice friendly market.","Operator","Our next question is from Seamus Fernandez of Leerink Swann.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","So maybe, David, can you talk us through how we should think about the neurogenic OAB injectors, the training, timing of rolling that forward? And since, I believe the injections are actually quite similar, how strong of a base of trained injectors would you expect just to establish, should the FDA ultimately approve the idiopathic indication?","David E.I. Pyott","Yes, well. First of all, as I've stated, it follows the normal launch pattern, where the first goal is getting injectors trained. The second one is getting reimbursements in place. And right now, there's only temporary injection codes being utilized so that's always more challenging. We won't get a permanent code until 2013 because it takes a year until the system catches up. So everything is going well. There's a lot of enthusiasm. But of course, I have to kind of temper everybody's enthusiasm by saying, the numbers are interesting, but in 2012, still modest. You'll see a much bigger pickup in 2013, once reimbursement is permanent. And secondly, once we get into the bigger category of idiopathic, and I think where you are going is to say, if you\u2019ve started as a neurologist with neurogenic, it will not be a massive learning process to then go to the next indication once it's on label because it's the same principle.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Buck of Buckingham Research Group.","David G. Buck - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","David, the question is really on Europe and the outlook. Jeff had given the, I believe, $40 million in additional cost cuts for 2012. Can you talk about how you see Europe either quantitatively or qualitatively for, especially pharma business versus aesthetics in terms of growth? And what can you do to protect profitability in that region?","David E.I. Pyott","Yes, well, unfortunately, if one looks deep back into history, there's always price cuts. It\u2019s just since, naturally, it's logical since the recession has got much worse because it's very easy for politicians to go and basically extract money out of the pharmaceutical industry, it's tougher to extract it out of hospitals or physician salaries. And then of course, in Europe most doctors are employees of the government versus being independent owner-operators, so to speak, as in the United States. So we're just being sanguine about it, but we don't know where these price cuts will be, but they will probably come. And it's always safer to be -- it's better to be safe than sorry. I think given that background, I can certainly assure you that the profitability of our European, meaning, greater European operations continues to increase well. So we're not just sitting there saying we have a laggard region. The reason that my European colleagues can do this is they, too, have had a huge number of new approvals. And of course, approvals, innovation drive growth. And in between that, of course, just like we've done in North America, there is some leveraging of our SG&A structures. So despite these headwinds, Europe actually had, for the full year last year, across-the-board, double-digit local currency growth. And also, managed a very nice, even in excess of the sales number bottom line growth, as measured on a management basis. So good job done. And I think it goes to a bit to the quality of everybody of this company and all the way from the cost of goods that are -- that the products that are manufactured, where we brought down the cost of goods all the way through to good performance in the field.","Operator","Our next question is from John Boris of Citi.","John T. Boris - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I think, historically, David, you've given us some commentary around the number of physicians that have been trained, somewhere around 3,800 to 5,000 docs that you were targeting. And I think you've also mentioned that once they've been trained, creating the habit of injecting was a very important part of the process of getting uptake with BOTOX in the treatment of chronic migraine. Can you possibly give an update on number of physicians trained? And how you're monitoring whether that habit is leading to a lot of prescribing from the physician base after they're trained?","David E.I. Pyott","Yes, well, the latest number I gave you probably 45 minutes ago was we're now up to 4,600 individual physicians. The trainings are higher than that because some people choose to be trained more than once. And frankly, we're happy to keep training them until we make it, this part of their product armamentarium that they use. We also know from 20 years\u2019 experience, the best injectors are ones that will finally have a clinic, typically, as a minimum, a full morning or a full afternoon. And as I've been out and about in the field, of course, there's already physicians that have multiple mornings and afternoons dedicated to BOTOX. And then I know the habit has really taken root. Now how do we monitor this? Well, all the trainings, I have a monthly dashboard, and what is also great is because of our direct shipments, we know whether Doctor X really is using the product. And if they're not, then that's the job of our representative to say, what other support would you need? Do you want to go on a proctorship? Do you want your colleagues to come and visit you? Do you want to go and visit your colleague? Whatever works, we\u2019ll make it happen so that this treatment is then readily available to needy patients.","Operator","Our next question is from Douglas Tsao of Barclays Capital.","Douglas D. Tsao - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I was just hoping, David, you could provide some perspective in terms of the growth in migraine. Is it from the addition of new doctors using this? Or is it a function of the trained docs or the existing user base is using it more frequently? And then also if you have any perspective on the repeat treatment rates that you're seeing right now.","David E.I. Pyott","Right. Well, first of all, there was the -- pre-launch, there was a small existing user base. And clearly, with reimbursement available and then awareness through the DTCs that I commented, we've seen growth there. Then the next vector of growth is the next cohorts arriving brand-new. Let's call them the newly trained injectors. And as I've often pointed out, there is probably somewhere between 6 and 12 months\u2019 lag between people saying, okay, I've trained and now I\u2019m starting and then really injecting patients in volume. So we have all these different curves of growth. And then, the final one you addressed was repeat. And what I both heard verbatim when I've interviewed doctors, as well as the surveys I've read, I think the vast majority of neurologists will inject patients for as long as 3 injection cycles, even if they may be skeptical about the efficacy of the drug in that individual patient. Also, from everything I can see, it would suggest very high levels of both physician, as well as patient satisfaction. And I think it's in excess of 80%, where people believe that BOTOX is providing incremental benefit to that individual patient and relative to other drugs, that is a very, very high rate of satisfaction. And of course, we monitor it really carefully so that we understand how the product is really coming through all these phases of adoption. And everything is very positive.","James M. Hindman","Mary Ann, we'll take one more question.","Operator","Our final question comes from Gary Nachman of Susquehanna Financial Group.","Gary Nachman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","David, the Lat-Am guidance is pretty conservative and we know this market's been a struggle. Seems like you're still very committed to this business and investing even more behind it. Is it something you think you can turn around by 2013? Or will it take even longer than that to return it to growth?","David E.I. Pyott","Well, I'm glad that you asked the question of time because clearly, the biggest thing we've got to change and correct and improve is reimbursement. And that means changing insurance policies and typically, they get rewritten once a year. It\u2019s the kind of the formulary process for all products. So from where I sit, I'll be looking for, what I call, vital signs or if we were driving a supertanker, I want to see the bow starting to swing, even though it's marginal. I'll be able to spot that and, of course, once the tanker starts swinging, you know that thing\u2019s going to swing real hard. So I'm glad that you tempered expectation because I think this will take probably up to 18 months before you\u2019ll be able to see that really material progress has been made. In the meantime, investment, a lot of it is fixed already. If I look at our managed care team, this is the same group, 100-plus people that have done a great job in LUMIGAN, Access, great job on BOTOX. And now their #1 task is getting LAP-BAND sorted out. And I'm very clear about what I want. And I know that they've heard the message loud and clear and it's in their MBO's. And I hope they make good bonuses in 2012.","Jeffrey L.

[Operator Instructions] At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I would like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Jim Hindman, Senior Vice President, Treasury, Risk and Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","James M. Hindman","Thank you, Mary Ann. Good morning. With me for today's conference call is David Pyott, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Edwards, Executive Vice President, Finance and Business Development, Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Scott Whitcup, Executive Vice President, Research and Development, Chief Scientific Officer; and Jim Barlow, Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller.","Before we move ahead, I would like to remind you that certain statements that we will make in this presentation are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements reflect Allergan's judgment and analysis only as of today, and actual results may differ materially from current expectations based on a number of factors affecting Allergan's businesses. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. For a more thorough discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the forward-looking statements to be made in this conference call and webcast, we refer you to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements that is included in our third quarter 2012 earnings release, which was furnished to the SEC today on Form 8-K, as well as our filings with the SEC referenced in that disclaimer.","We will follow up the question-and-answer session of this call with a short listen-only segment, where we will provide additional miscellaneous information that relates to our business. Under Regulation FD, in order to be able to discuss this information freely during the quarter, we must be sure that it is in the public domain. This conference call and the accompanying webcast are being simultaneously broadcast over the Internet, with replays available for one week. You can access this information on our website at www.allergan.com.","At this point, I would like to turn the call over to David Pyott.","David E. I. Pyott","All right, good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Before we start, we wish to express our concerns and also our regrets for all of you in the eastern states who have been suffering through the superstorm Sandy. We're so sorry that millions of people have lost their power, and we sincerely hope that conditions will normalize as soon as possible.","After careful deliberation, we decided to go ahead with this call as scheduled to avoid the pile-up of earnings that will almost certainly occur later this week after the market reopens.","So getting down to the business. In the third quarter, Allergan sales grew versus the third quarter of 2011 by 9.4% to local currencies, and due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most of the world's currencies, by 6.1% in dollars. With current foreign exchange rates, the difference between local currency and dollar sales growth rates should be less in Q4. Year-to-date, Allergan's total sales have grown by 9.5% in local currencies and by 6.6% in dollars in spite of the challenges in the global economy. In the European region, we're very pleased that our consumer-facing businesses performed strongly in the quarter.","In our press release, we commented that we are exploring strategic options for the obesity intervention business as the sales dynamics do not fit the profile of a high-growth company like Allergan. Rigorous management of our portfolio of businesses has always been integral to our strategy.","Regarding operating performance. We generated in Q3 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.06, marking an increase of 15.2%, even with strong currency pressure, and $0.02 over the top end of the range of expectations provided at the time of our last earnings call. Year-to-date, non-GAAP diluted EPS has increased 13.3%.","During the year, we pursued our long-term strategy of strengthening our R&D pipeline, an example of which is the broadening of our licensing agreement with Molecular Partners in Z\u00fcrich for a potential dual anti-VEGF\/PDGF-B DARPin. Year-to-date, we have invested $688 million in R&D on a non-GAAP basis, marking an increase of 8.9%.","For a reconciliation to GAAP numbers, please consult our press release.","We plan to invest over $1 billion in R&D in 2013. And we opened a new R&D center for clinical development and biostatistics in Bridgewater, New Jersey.","Now commenting the performance of the individual businesses. BOTOX sales in Q3 increased 11.5% in local currencies and 8.8% in dollars, with year-to-date growth of 11.9% in local currencies and 9.5% in dollars. Both the aesthetic and therapeutic businesses grew double digit in Q3 in local currencies.","In Q2, the last quarter for which we have global market data available, we estimate that the world market for neuromodulators grew 12% year-over-year and the global BOTOX share was stable, with share gains in the therapeutic segment being offset by share losses in aesthetics.","The U.S. therapeutic business continued on a strong growth trajectory, driven by chronic migraine, neurogenic bladder and upper limb spasticity. BOTOX sales in Europe have been affected by a broad array of government measures to reduce health care expenses, such as mandated price reductions, tenders to squeeze prices as well as measures to restrict patient access. In fact, the therapeutic side has been a greater challenge in Europe than the issues we have with consumer spending on medical aesthetics procedures.","Since the last earnings call, we have additional country approvals for chronic migraine in Serbia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Egypt and Oman; and for neurogenic overactive bladder in the U.K., the Netherlands, Malta, Turkey, Poland, Korea, Vietnam, Qatar and New Zealand. BOTOX therapeutic growth was particularly strong in the United States, Latin America and Asia Pacific. In the U.S., the REMS for chronic migraine, upper limb spasticity and neurogenic bladder continue on strong trajectories. All the metrics for long-term establishment to the chronic migraine franchise are positive. Access is virtually complete, with 93% of all commercial lines enjoying policy coverage.","Patients without access are at a very low level and on the -- on a declining trend. Since the last earnings report, we have trained 200 more individual physicians. Focus is now on deepening the level of training in local live sessions and preceptorships rather than just training de novo injectors, as well as the goal of increasing injector productivity. Our investments in both branded and non-branded DTC campaigns for BOTOX for chronic migraine are driving patients to our websites for information about the condition and also where to find a headache specialist. In terms of patient satisfaction, only 19% of treated patients feel that their headaches are very severe or extremely severe after BOTOX treatment. We are pleased that, in the recent physician survey, Allergan is now perceived as the #1 company in migraine management by physicians.","Overall, BOTOX U.S. therapeutic market share continues to rise, given the strong growth in the new indications where BOTOX is the sole approved product. In July, U.S. share was close to 95%, with the remaining 5% being shared by Dysport, Xeomin and Myobloc, in descending order. In the cervical dystonia submarket where we have 2 licensed competitors, BOTOX has also been gaining share in the course of the last 12 months, and we estimate that BOTOX in July held 86% of this market.","Regarding the neurogenic overactive bladder launch, we're also making excellent progress. Regarding access, we're at -- now at a very favorable level. Some level of policy coverage exists in 88% of commercial lines and for 100% of all Medicare carriers and almost 100% of Medicaid lives.","Agent profile of spinal cord patients and multiple sclerosis patients are quite different. The number of patients without access is on a declining trend. Since launch, we have trained over 2,000 individual physicians. At the October meeting of the American Urogynecological Society, there was positive data presented on a study conducted by NIH on the use of BOTOX and anticholinergics and neurogenic bladder. Results of this study were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Both for chronic migraine and injection into the bladder, we're awaiting action by CMS for their 2013 payment schedules for specific treatment codes.","On the aesthetics side of the business, we enjoyed strong growth in all operating regions of the world. In the U.S., we estimate that the market in Q3 grew double digits in volume. Based on our survey data, we estimate that BOTOX in Q3 increased its share to 82% at the expense of both Dysport and Xeomin, the latter of which still have the residual 2% share. In fact, BOTOX have the same share as in Q3 2011 before Xeomin came onto the market.","As commented in our press release, the injunction prohibiting Merz from commercializing Xeomin remains in place for aesthetics until Jan 9, 2013.","In Europe, we estimate that the aesthetic neuromodulator market was flat in Western Europe and that we have halted our market share losses as a result of launches of Bocouture and Azzalure in new markets. Overall, double-digit growth in the Europe, Africa, Middle East region was driven by Eastern Europe and emerging markets.","From the fourth quarter, we are monitoring the effect of new taxes. In France, the government has imposed a 20% VAT on medical aesthetics procedures, and in Spain, the rate was increased from 8% to 21%. In Asia Pacific, we're recording strong growth across virtually all markets, with exceptional performance in China and Japan. In Australia, we're dealing with the launch of Azzalure by Galderma, which is heavily discounting their product, and in Korea with several local competitive neuromodulators.","Facial aesthetics sales grew 5.0% in local currencies versus Q3 of 2011 and 0.8% in dollars. This was caused by a double-digit decline in U.S x factory sales, offset by massive growth in Europe, Asia Pacific and Canada. The U.S. decline is due to the timing of a Duet Dividend promotion in Q3 2011 as well as the benefits of the ongoing transition at that time to JUV\u00c9DERM with lidocaine. In fact, the U.S. in Q3 2011 had over a 40% growth versus Q3 of 2010, hence the comps that I mentioned. x U.S., we're benefiting from the launch of the VOLUMA, which has stimulated growth in the overall market, and, additionally from good growth from base JUV\u00c9DERM. In the U.S., we estimate that the market in Q3 grew low single digits in volume.","In terms of market share, we estimate that JUV\u00c9DERM, as market leader, enjoyed 36% share in Q3, down 1 share point from Q3 2011, due to the launch of Belotero by Merz, which has garnered 8% share in Q3. Most of Belotero's gain came at the expense of the Restylane franchise, which we gauge to be at 31%. From October, VOLUMA in a new 1-mL package is now available in Brazil and Colombia.","Year-to-date, facial aesthetics sales have increased 8.7% in local currencies. We estimate that the world market in Q2, the last period for which we have data available, increased about 6% year-over-year. The market in the European Union also grew about 6%, which is positive, given the economic situation. Almost all of this growth in the EU was driven by JUV\u00c9DERM and VOLUMA, even with a very large number of competitive products being available.","Breast aesthetics sales increased 7.1% in local currencies and 3.4% in dollars. Growth was strong in the U.S. and Latin America. The Q3 growth rate was slightly lower than in the first 2 quarters, due to the attenuation of growth in Europe as the market share benefits off the aftermath of the PIP scandal wear-off.","Q3 x factory growth was dampened by the timing of sales to certain distributors in Latin America and Asia. In Europe, based on industry data, Q2 growth in implant procedures in the top 5 markets was over 7%, with substantial share gains for Allergan. For Q2, the last data for which -- the last period for which data is available, we estimate worldwide market growth in value at about 4%, which points to our share gains. The shaped anatomical 410 line was approved in Korea and was recently launched with good acceptance by surgeons.","Our Natrelle round silicone gel implants and tissue expanders were approved in Japan and will be launched in early 2013. We are the sole manufacturer with the Japanese Ministry approval. In the U.S., we've been able to hold unit market share, in spite of unit -- the entry of Sientra into the markets and price discounting by Mentor, and have been able to migrate products to higher-value silicone gel and tissue expanders.","Ophthalmic pharmaceutical sales in Q3 were strong, increasing 12.5% in local currencies versus Q3 of 2011 and 8.4% in dollars. Year-to-date, sales x factory increased year-over-year 10.2% in local currencies, with both U.S. and international growth at just over 10%. This growth rate correlates with the end market growth reported by IMS Global for the 6 months up to June, also at 10%. The IMS Q2 report, the last period for which data was -- is available, lays out the world market growing by 7%, boosted by retinal therapeutics and dampened by latanoprost generics. In this data of Q2, Allergan grows by 10%.","Allergan is gaining share with RESTASIS in glaucoma, retina and artificial tears. RESTASIS is now the #2 ophthalmic product worldwide by value after LUCENTIS. In the U.S., we are pleased to report RESTASIS growing in Q3, year-over-year, 19.7% in local currencies.","Since the end of Q2, there's been an acceleration in the growth trend line, with volume growth being reported by IMS at over 10%. We ascribe this to the effectiveness of our TV campaign, growing medical awareness that dry eyes is a progressive disease, deepening patient education that chronic dry eye is a disease and enthusiasm for the product by optometrists.","RESTASIS is also the fastest-growing ophthalmic product in Canada. The LUMIGAN franchise rebounded with 8.2% growth in Q3 in local currency after the weak x factory sales in Q2. In the U.S., acquisition dollar growth for LUMIGAN in Q3 year-over-year, as reported by IMS, was 18%, with most of this attributable to price with only a small gain in volume. LUMIGAN is holding up better than competitive products from the impact of latanoprost generics due to its differentiated profile and perception as the most potent of the broad class. However, the impact of latanoprost generics is greater than we had originally anticipated.","After our August announcement that we will discontinue the manufacture of LUMIGAN 0.03% for the U.S. market by the end of 2012, we are pleased that already over 70% of new prescriptions are being written for the improved 0.01% product. Obviously, this decision reduced sales, x factory, in 2013 (sic)","as we are now reducing overall trade inventory of LUMIGAN before year end.","Regarding 2013 formulary coverage where almost all contract negotiations have been concluded, LUMIGAN will enjoy similar status to the 2012 contracts, with losses being broadly offset by gains.","In Europe, LUMIGAN is widening its share leadership versus the Travatan franchise. In the U.K., Allergan is, for the first time, the #1 company in glaucoma. In Spain, we have launched Optava as a reimbursed pharmaceutical tear, which will mitigate the impact that all other reimbursed tears have been de-reimbursed by the Spanish government.","In France, OZURDEX received a positive reimbursement assessment for uveitis. In Asia, we're enjoying strong growth in India and China, both due to overall market growth as well as the introduction of both international as well as local Allergan products.","Our skin care franchise grew 11.7% in local currencies and 11.4% in dollars versus Q3 of 2011. ACZONE sales continue to grow rapidly, with acquisition dollar sales per IMS VONA increasing year-over-year in the quarter at 57% and year-to-date at 52%. In September, ACZONE enjoy 31.7% share in the dermatology channel and a widening absolute leadership position in the anti-inflammatory acne category. TAZORAC sales per IMS VONA declined by 4% year-over-year in the quarter and were flat year-to-date.","LATISSE sales in the quarter grew 7.9% in local currencies and 7.2% in dollars, with good performance in the U.S., thanks to favorable physician and patient response to our new 5 mL packaging presentation and pricing.","Our press release comments the status of unfair competition action against Athena and its product, RevitaLash Advanced Eyelash Conditioner. We have information that Athena may be resuming shipments of RevitaLash to all states, with the exception of California and Tennessee. We're evaluating our options for further legal action against Athena and a few other companies who are marketing unapproved eyelash growth products.","In Europe, we withdrew our LATISSE Marketing Authorization Application from a decentralized procedure. We plan to submit the application in individual EU countries to optimize the product label.","I'll now pass over to Jeff Edwards, who will comment on our financial performance and outlook.","Jeffrey L. Edwards","Thanks, David, and good morning to all of you on the call. We appreciate that you guys have made the effort to join us and hope all is well.","During the third quarter of 2012, Allergan generated solid operating results despite the increasing costs related to U.S. healthcare reform, ongoing overseas pricing pressure and uncertain European economic environment and the challenges that accompany a stronger U.S. dollar environment. As in the past, we benefited from our natural hedges with overseas manufacturing and also foreign exchange option contracts. Despite these challenges, the company achieved non-GAAP diluted earnings per share $0.02 above the top end of our EPS guidance for the quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the third quarter was $1.06, marking a 15.2% increase over 2011 results for the same quarter. A reconciliation of all of the adjustments to GAAP earnings is set out in our earnings release.","Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments and amortization of acquired intangibles, Allergan's Q3 2012 gross margin of 86.4% increased 70 basis points when compared to Q3 2011. This increase in gross margin was driven primarily by favorable product and geographic mix despite continuing pricing pressures we're experiencing around the world.","The non-GAAP selling, general and administration expenses-to-product net sales ratio for the third quarter was 38.6%, totaling $537 million. The comparable ratio and expense value for the same period in 2011 were 39.4% and $517 million, respectively.","As we continue to diligently work to offset the increasing costs of the U.S. healthcare reform and overseas pricing pressures, consistent with our planning comments to the investment community, we are recognizing the benefit of leverage and scale in many of our markets. Our ongoing focus to direct our investments to high-yielding projects, which have been appropriately risk adjusted for economic risks, and traditional market and execution risks. Consistent with our historic trends, you should anticipate a further reduction in non-GAAP SG&A expense-to-net sales ratio in the fourth quarter of 2012.","Non-GAAP research and development expenses were 16.6% of product net sales for the quarter, totaling $231 million, an increasing spend of approximately $10 million over the third quarter of 2011.","With respect to our balance sheet, consolidated Allergan days sales outstanding was 57 days while consolidated Allergan inventory days on hand was 128 days. End-of-quarter DSO levels were slightly higher than our Q2 2012 levels, due primarily to the timing of the quarter end and our efforts to accommodate specific distributor requests.","End-of-quarter DOH levels were slightly higher than prior quarter, primarily due to preparation for various product launches around the world as well as a shift in shipping methods from air to ocean in -- for certain emerging markets.","In the third quarter, operating cash flow after CapEx was approximately $421 million. On a year-to-date basis, operating cash flow after CapEx was approximately $1 billion. At the end of the third quarter, Allergan's cash and equivalents and short-term investments in cash and equivalents in short term investments net of debt positions totaled $2.9 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively.","We currently project capital expenditures of between $150 million and $200 million for the full year of 2012.","For the fourth quarter of 2012, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $1,470,000,000 to $1,545,000,000 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.18 to $1.20.","Regarding full year expectations for 2012. Allergan estimates product net sales ranges of $5,695,000,000 and $5,770,000,000 and our full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of between $4.17 and $4.19, which represents growth of between 14% and 15%.","Our product net sales expectations reflects a reduction of $30 million from the top end of this range provided with our previous expectations. This is primarily attributable to the external events such as increasing U.S. healthcare reform, overseas pricing pressure and fourth quarter generic impact of SANCTURA XR. We currently estimate an increase in U.S. healthcare reform of approximately $10 million, primarily due to an increase in our coverage gap or donut hole exposure. Increasing European austerity measures are expected to lead to an addition of approximately $5 million in overseas pricing pressure. And the genericization of SANCTURA XR in the fourth quarter is expected to have an approximate $10 million impact. As a reminder, SANCTURA XR profitability is negligible.","As previously communicated, our 2012 expectations assume that U.S. R&D tax credit will be renewed in the fourth quarter of 2012, with the full year retroactive benefit impacting Q4 results. Our current estimate of the full year earnings per share impact is between $0.05 and $0.06.","One of our key drivers of Allergan's long-term success has been the continuous evaluation of our portfolio of businesses to ensure that they are delivering high growth. During the past few years, the entire obesity intervention market has faced challenges as the result of economic conditions and reimbursement limitations. Earlier in the year, we committed to improving the reimbursement conditions for LAP-BAND. We've been able to reduce the wait time for surgery by reducing time patients must undergo medically managed weight loss. Now 63% of commercial lives or 120 million patients have this benefit in their policies, an increase of 22 million lives just this year.","While we are confident in the long-term prospects of the business, we also must consider the best potential for future development and clinical advancement may exist outside of the company. Moreover, Allergan's business model strategy emphasizes the importance of leverage and scalability. It is clear to us today that Allergan will have the same ability to achieve this strategic business -- it is not clear today that Allergan will have the same ability to achieve this strategic objective with this business. Therefore, we're exploring strategic options, including, among other things, a potential sale of the business unit.","For your information, expectation for other lines of the income statement and specific product sales expectations are included in our earnings release. So with that, operator, I'd now like now to open the call to questions.","David E. I. Pyott","One comment I'll just make, David, here is I misspoke when I was remarking about the reduction of inventory for LUMIGAN in the United States following our decision to discontinue 0.03%. Clearly, that's occurring this year 2012 and not 2013, as I stated. So I just wanted to get that straight.","And now I'll pass over to the operator for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Today's conference call is scheduled to conclude at 9:00 a.m. Pacific time. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Seamus Fernandez of Leerink Swann.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","So just very quickly. This question will be for Scott. Can you just update us on the -- what we should be anticipating in the first half of next year with regard to bimatoprost for hair growth?","Scott M. Whitcup","Sure. So as we stated before, the -- we have 2 Phase II trials, both with comparing doses of bimatoprost to minoxidil. We'll finish -- we believe we'll finish all of our analyses of the data as they come in by sort of early next year, and then we would submit that to a major medical meeting for a presentation. So a little bit of when the data will be public will depend on which meeting timing allows and the group feels is the best place to present the data. So it may not be first half of the year.  It might be late first half of the year, early second half of the year.  Depends on which conference that's presented at.","Operator","Our next question is from Annabel Samimy of Stifel, Nicolaus.","Annabel Samimy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just to carry on the particular catalysts for remainder of the first half -- I mean, for the first half, we've got ninapris [ph]. I believe that you've got some DARPin coming up. Can you just give us a better sense of what we should expect in the first half in terms of the catalysts for the R&D division?","Scott M. Whitcup","So in terms of major approvals, probably the biggest one from the commercial side would be approval of BOTOX for idiopathic overactive bladder. So we announced that we have filed both in the U.S. and in Europe at R&D Day, and that's probably the biggest opportunity for us as a company. And we expect approval, at least in the U.S., by FDA early 2013. Another major catalyst will be VOLUMA, so that's under review. We expect that, that will go to panel, although that decision is clearly up to FDA. So that would be a catalyst. Once -- if there's a panel, then clearly, there'll be data presented there. And then a number of people have followed the DARPin. So that's in Phase IIb. Those data, we expect some time next year. And again, similar to bimatoprost, once we get those data, we would get that submitted to a major meeting, which I would expect would be not first half of the year but probably second half, just based on the timing to submit. And usually that occurs at least half a year before the actual meeting. So hopefully, that helps.","Operator","Our next question is from Marc Goodman of UBS.","Marc Goodman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Given the changes going on over with Medicis, and they're in transition, I was wondering if you've seen any major changes out there in marketing promotion by them and any market share movements.","David E. I. Pyott","Okay, I'll take that one, Marc. I would actually say that we saw a more gradual change before the announcement of the acquisition by Valeant. We could very much feel, in the second half of 2011, Medicis probably moving more of their promotional focus to the medical derm side of their business.  I think, then, in the second move, reallocating resources where they have share comparable to us, i.e. Restylane is only so many share points behind JUV\u00c9DERM. And I think where we really felt the difference was the pullback in spend and effort on Dysport. And I think that was a realization that the share was beginning to crest. We always felt that they wouldn't really get much beyond 20%. And based on all the numbers I gave you today, it seems to be settling down in the kind of the mid-teens kind of range. And we'll see, of course, what occurs when Merz comes back onto the market in 2013 and whether -- Medicis\/Valeant, what they choose to do in terms of defending the share that they have.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Waterman of Goldman Sachs.","Gregory Waterman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","On BOTOX therapeutics, it sounds like new pressures are at least partially offsetting the gains in new indications. I was just wondering if you could in any way help us to better quantify these offsetting pressures?","David E. I. Pyott","Well, I think, when I prepare my remarks, I try to give you the frame. And clearly, you know that both sides of the house, both aesthetics as well as therapeutics, both did very well. Clearly, the U.S. is growing very, very strongly indeed. And when you go around the clock and say, \"Well, where is the pressure,\" you are quite right to put your finger on the fact that it's Europe, and it's more on the therapeutic side than the aesthetics side, which seems initially surprising. If you you'd asked me that question 2 years ago, I'd have got it the wrong way around. You think the consumer would be the problem; I don't think that's the case. I was just looking at my numbers for the consumer-facing businesses again, and wow.  Southern Europe, fantastic. If we can only get rid of this recession one day, we're going to be having a wonderful time in Southern Europe when they really have money to spend. So really, it's the pressures on the therapeutic side. And I think you can see that in other companies across the medical device industry, anything that's hospital based is really tough in Europe. Governments are literally turning off the lights in the operating rooms earlier in the day when the money is running tight. Luckily, of course, we're not really exposed that much to the hospital. But we are exposed to both national and regional tenders issued in several different countries. So I hope that gives you more color. And I do attempt to try and address it through my remarks.","Operator","Our next question is from Ken Cacciatore of Cowen and Company.","Ken Cacciatore - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I just had a question on some of the commentary around the BOTOX, I believe, migraine in the U.S. And I maybe took this down wrong, but you talked about a goal of increasing injector productivity and deepening the training. So I just wanted to know if you can give me a little bit even more nuance into -- is there anything that you're seeing that's surprising you about this launch as you go into the next stage? Are we on track with your original plan? And kind of any more nuance around what you're seeing in the migraine market?","David E. I. Pyott","Yes, no, we're very much on track with our plan. And in terms of the way we really move people through the gears of standards of training, I think this is pretty much what we've seen in the last 20 years where people go from the first injections they do all the way through to becoming real expert injectors themselves, where they can then become preceptors to their younger and less well-trained colleagues. And so that's that flywheel we're working on. I think the second part, though, that partially is new for us is we hear from some portion of neurologists that this greatest results and satisfaction they have from using BOTOX is -- they say, \"I don't want to be doing\" -- I'll exaggerate to make my point -- \"BOTOX 5 days a week. And I do other things as a neurologist.\" And that's where we want to improve the procedures in the office so that they can just move the patients through, in a good way, with quality but faster. And of course, that then applies the learnings we've made in the aesthetics business over the years where you can still have a quality outcome and feeling about the procedure, but you can really move up the number of patients per day. Also what we're seeing is some neurologists, when they reach the limit that they decide that that's the number they want to do, some of them are -- refer to other colleagues in the community. They're the frequently pain specialists that are very procedure-oriented and are willing to take up the slack. So where that kind of partnership opportunity exists, we're very happy to put these 2 physicians because it's always 2 individuals or 2 group practices together.","Operator","Our next question is from Steve Willoughby of Cleveland Research.","Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company","I was wondering if you can just provide a little bit more color regarding the LAP-BAND and your comment on the lack of leverage and scalability. What has changed in your thinking now versus the past couple of years?","David E. I. Pyott","Well, if I cast the clock back a couple of years, we have lots of years of really good growth, and this was in the time frame 2006, '07 and '08. And at the time, if I restrict my comment to the U.S., first of all, we didn't realize that a lot of that was not only cash paid, but actually it was credit cards paid. And so of course, with hindsight, that market, which at the peak was about 1\/3 of our U.S. sales, has really shriveled down to a very negligible part. So I think the next part of the thinking, then, came -- and that was my commitment over 1 year ago to you on the sell side as well as the investment community on the buy side -- that our job is to improve reimbursement conditions. And as you heard from Jeff's remarks, we have made progress. But then comes the real kind of what I'd call the tough call. Clearly, as a company, we are very committed to high growth and we've been able to do that. So a business like this, which is going the wrong direction, is a drag on that overall growth rate. Now I come to the point about leverageability and scalability. If you think of all of the business areas we're in, ophthalmology and medical aesthetics being very clear, we have a very broad range of products. So we often have multiple scale -- sales forces presenting multiple products, and of course, that gives you the benefits of scale. If we look at the general surgery market where we're present with LAP-BAND, it's basically a one-product entry. And as we've looked at alternatives, that would take us deeper into general surgery, which would be fine.  But usually those products are associated with lower gross margin than the ones we have. So really ending the whole stream of thought: It may make better sense, either for another company that one would call a strategic to add LAP-BAND and ORBERA overseas, which is the intragastric balloon, to their portfolio. Or it could make sense for a private equity firm to acquire this business because, of course, it's profitable; it's cash generative; it has a great brand name; it has very good intellectual property. And finally, of course, just to make it clear, we are assessing the sale because everything comes down to numbers at the end of the day. And so as you know, we could always -- if we don't get the numbers we like, choose just to keep this business and run it in a different way.","Operator","Our next question is from Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","David, year-to-date, I think you guys have grown about 9.5% constant currency, and the implied Q4 guidance is about that. So when we think about 2013, you have a lot of new product launches, but Xeomin goes back on the market in the U.S. and you have a full year of generic SANCTURA. So recognizing that you're not providing 2013 guidance today, could you talk about the headwinds and the tailwinds to revenue growth in 2013 and how similar or different it may have looked from 2012, if you're willing to say that?","David E. I. Pyott","Yes, okay, Larry. Well, you're quite right because you're pointing to some of the elements in terms of things that will be boosters of growth. I think you can very clearly feel that the migraine launch and the neurogenic bladder launch and upper limb spasticity in U.S. are doing very well. We want to really repeat that experience, particularly in Europe. One quick remark about Europe: Although I'm very dutiful reporting when we get product approvals, the delay between approval date and reimbursement date in many countries can be well over 1 year. And then due to further access impediments governments throw out, it can even spread out maybe another 0.5 year. So Europe, we're looking for some good growth in these new indications in 2013 and '14. Scott Whitcup really talked about the bigger opportunity in neurology which is idiopathic bladder. He talks about VOLUMA. He -- those are probably the big ones in terms of what I'd call short-term horizon approvals. Then on the negative side, clearly, we factored in, when Xeomin comes back on the aesthetics side, we have to lose some share. That's clear. We're sanguine. Obviously, we don't plan to lose much. And then I would say, when you look at SANCTURA, it's a pretty small product and, more importantly, as Jeff remarked, really due to royalty obligations really didn't produce any bottom line worth talking about. One other item, which is -- although your questions were really more directed to sales, just as a reminder, we have to pick up the device tax in 2013. For us as a company, it's not that big. We -- obviously, we're not just a med device company. But that's something we will just suck up, and hopefully, you won't really feel that at all when we come out with our guidance or our outlook, which will be in early February, shortly, at the time of our next earnings call. So I think that takes you through all the parts and pieces. And obviously, when we put out the numbers, we'll walk you through all the bits for -- in whatever great detail you like.","Operator","Our next question is from Gary Nachman of Susquehanna Financial Group.","Gary Nachman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","David, RESTASIS continues to exceed our expectations. Can you just give a little more on what is contributing to that improved volume growth? Are you expanding the types of patients that use it?  Increase compliance with existing patients? And then Scott, just an update on the time line for RESTASIS X.","David E. I. Pyott","Okay, yes. RESTASIS is really exciting. In the last 6 months, we can see a real uptick in trend lines, and it's multifactorial. Optometry, clearly, has really come on board with this product. And it's obvious but let me restate it: There are many more optometrists than there are ophthalmologists, so that gives us a really very large prescriber pool. We've seen the same thing, by the way, in Canada. Then in terms of patients and consumption, more and more patients coming on board. It seems that our advertising has worked really well. And we are fine tuning that and improving it. And finally, we see an ever greater quantity of -- I'll call it vials, i.e., number of units in the package being written per script. And of course, for you as an analyst on the outside, that's very difficult to track. But we have that really nailed down. So lots of good things going on. RESTASIS, doing very well. And we plan to really keep this going right through 2013.","Scott M. Whitcup","So Gary, this is Scott. Just to comment on your question. First, as we've discussed before, there's quite a challenge to try to get an AB-rated product to RESTASIS because of the FDA requirement that you need to not only be non-inferior to RESTASIS in your trial but also to beat a placebo to a similar degree that RESTASIS be a vehicle [ph] in its trial. So this requires a fairly robust difficult clinical trial. We know that dry eye is a tough area. In terms of RESTASIS X, we haven't said much and aren't going to give exact timing, but the thought is really to try to have a product that's -- improves upon RESTASIS and is differentiated. My advice would be just to follow clintrials.gov (sic) [clinicaltrials.gov], and at an appropriate time, you'll start seeing some trials there. But because of the strong competitive area the dry eye is, you won't hear us comment a lot on specifics.","Operator","The next question is from Ronny Gal of Sanford Bernstein.","Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","One comment -- one product you've not commented on is LEVADEX. I understand there are some contractual issues there, but could you comment on either your expectation for approval in 2013 and the market potential for this product?","Scott M. Whitcup","So Ronny, this is Scott. Again, since we have a partner here, we don't really give a lot of specifics, other than, clearly, we have interacted on the R&D side, our manufacturing CMC side very closely. We have a very good working relationship and worked hand-in-hand to get the refiling to FDA done. We don't really comment on approvability or what we think you'll have to talk to MAP. In terms of the commercial opportunity, this fits extremely well with BOTOX for chronic migraine where it handles a different patient population. It handles more of the acute episodes, so it partners very well from a commercial standpoint with BOTOX for chronic migraine. Physician feedback has been very positive. The class of drugs has a well-known history of efficacy. But side effects have been limiting and the inhaled delivery really helps address those side effects. And so feedback has been quite good from the data and we're very excited to launch it once FDA approves the product.","Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","But in your mind, it's not of the same size as VOLUMA or the idiopathic or any other opportunities?","Scott M. Whitcup","Yes, we're not going to comment on the exact size, but we feel -- and some of the analysts out there have looked at the market opportunity. We feel this is a fairly big market opportunity down the line but haven't gone to specific dollar amount.","Operator","Our next question is from David Risinger of Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Scott, I was hoping to ask you about the bimatoprost new opportunities and specifically was just hoping to get more clarity on the LATISSE for eyelash withdrawal in the EU and the application challenges there. And then with respect to LATISSE for the scalp, my current assumption is that you need to run another Phase IIb in order to optimize the efficacy versus Rogaine. But with respect to your decision for running another Phase IIb or starting Phase III, since you have all the data or you'll have it very soon, should we expect you to make that decision in January of next year? Or how long will it take for you to decide whether to run another Phase IIb or run Phase III with the current formulations? And how do you expect to communicate that?","Scott M. Whitcup","And so let me see if I can take those one at a time. In terms of LATISSE in Europe, as an aesthetics product, the label is critical to our commercial success. And by trying to gain consensus of multiple countries, it's more difficult to optimize the label. And so the current plan is to consider refiling with specific countries, with or without some additional data that we have, to make sure we get a label that gives our commercial sales forces the best chance to make it a commercially successful opportunity. In terms of bimatoprost for scalp hair growth, we'll finish all the analyses hopefully early next year. We've said consistently that we -- to be commercially successful with an Rx product -- need to be better than minoxidil, which is now generic. So we'll look at those data. If we're substantially better, we would consider going to Phase III. If we are not, what I've said is that we can potentially go higher on the dose and we would then consider doing a Phase IIb with a higher dose.  Because I think, to be commercially successful, we need to be differentiated from minoxidil. Again, I don't think we would communicate those, other than you'll see the data at a medical meeting. My guess is that will be your first view, as opposed to potentially seeing a Phase IIb in clinicaltrials.gov. I'm not sure which would occur first. But our decision will be fairly data driven based on those -- the Phase II data.","Operator","Our next question is from Shibani Malhotra of RBC Capital.","Shibani Malhotra - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just a couple, actually. One very straightforward.  David, are you still standing by your 15% earnings growth rate for the next 3 to 5 years? And then on the BOTOX market in the U.S. following the reintroduction of Merz, can you talk about how you expect the dynamics to play out there? We know they took 8% the first time they came in, but they were giving product away free. Given that you have a year of experience without them, I mean, how do -- what do you expect them to take in? And how are you preparing for this?","David E. I. Pyott","Okay. Let me take those -- really, there's 2 parts to that question, I think. First of all, we remain very committed to our aspiration of mid-teens earnings growth. I think you could tell from my opening remarks, we are also very committed to continuing to plow money into R&D. I think that is the real way for the long term that we can field the growth of this company, and I mean the sales growth. And of course, Scott Whitcup and his team have had a very successful track record in terms of bringing through products through the clinical development pipeline. Regarding Xeomin, of course, that's something we're getting really prepared for. And I'm not going to go into any details because, clearly, we like to keep that to ourselves. Hopefully, there will be some good surprises for investors and some bad surprises for our competitor. And that's the way it should be. And of course, we are very much committed to keeping this market growing and that's the real important part here, that we don't get lost in the weeds. It's all about growth, finally, and bringing in patients to the marketplace, and because they're satisfied with their experience, that they repeat and repeat and hopefully use other products from, hopefully, Allergan's portfolio of medical aesthetics products.","Operator","Our next question is from Douglas Tsao of Barclays.","Douglas D. Tsao - Barclays Capital, Research Division","David, you've made the comment that you -- the impact from generic Xalatan was below, greater than you expected. I was just curious, from your perspective, on potential impact of Travatan Z on having a generic available next year and how that could affect the LUMIGAN franchise.","David E. I. Pyott","As I understood the question, it was really the longer-term outlook for the glaucoma market. And clearly, we go through scenarios on what could occur. And I think, particularly, it was regarding what might happen to Travatan Z. First of all, we, of course, hope that Alcon and Novartis are successful in upholding their patent estate, so there is no travoprost generic. That would be a good outcome for the market. However, we're also thinking about the other scenario where, if travoprost were to go generic, what kind of data we need to drive the successful growth long term of our franchise? And so we're doing a lot of health economics work right now. I think we're developing good data. And clearly, this is data that is, first and foremost, directed to the peer [ph] community, why they -- it may -- would make sense for them to invest in the best product for their patients.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Schott of JPMorgan.","Jessica Fye - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It's Jessica Fye, on for Chris Schott. I just wanted to follow up on some of the comments you made earlier about the obesity business. And I guess, specifically, can you comment at all on the operating margins for that franchise, just to give us a little bit of a sense of what the dilution might be? And then I know you talked about maybe offsetting that. Would that be more likely to come from share repo or more likely from an acquisition?","Jeffrey L. Edwards","Well, we don't comment specifically on the operating margins for any of our businesses, so we're not going to do so here. This is a profitable business. And to the extent we do something that is external in nature with this business, it's our objective to try to address the dilution. And that's a commitment we're going to do our level best with achieving. And that's really all we can say at this juncture in time because we continue with a very in-depth internal assessment process as to how we're going to address that business on a going-forward basis.","David E. I. Pyott","But clearly, when we look at all the levers that we can use, part of it is just operating income growth in the rest of our portfolio and some of it could be share repurchase. But when we get closer to knowing what the numbers might be, then we'll assess that and make all the right trade-offs. So when Shibani asked the question about long-term aspiration, let me repeat again that our aspiration is to generate mid-teens earnings growth.","Operator","Our next question is from Louise Chen of Guggenheim Securities.","Louise Alesandra Chen - Guggenheim Partners, LLC","My question is with respect to your capital allocation strategies. Wondering if you could provide an update now especially given your large cash balance and also your decision to potentially divest your obesity franchise.","David E. I. Pyott","Well, I think, as we've said over the years, first and foremost, our goal is to add to the depth and breadth of our portfolio and whether that be through licensing, the Molecular Partners transactions were like that. Although being -- all that being said, of course, in terms of use of capital, with the upfronts aren't enormous relative to our cash flow generation. The second, of course, is we continually look at other products we could buy or even companies that we could buy. And I think you as investors would prefer that we find good-return assets like that versus the very modest levels of return we can get by investing in the capital markets where, obviously, right now, the returns are very, very low indeed. So we remain confident that we know the spaces in which we operate very, very well. We've seen over the years that technology owners tend to come to us. It's not altruism because, of course, in theory we can afford to pay more than others because we have the best worldwide footprint in these businesses.","Operator","Our final question comes from Tim Lugo of William Blair.","Tim Lugo - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just one more pipeline question. Regarding your expansion of Molecular Partners, is it safe to say that you're happy with the DARPin VEGF safety to date? And also, when -- how far along is MP260 in the clinic? And will any data from an MP260 influence the initiation of Phase III for DARPin VEGF?","Scott M. Whitcup","So, so far, the collaboration has gone very well. As David commented on his opening remarks, we've actually expanded that collaboration. So the one DARPin in the clinic is an anti-VEGF; that's in a Phase IIb. That clinical trial is going well. It's recruited well. And again, our plan is to have data from that trial first half of next year. And then our aspiration would be, assuming those data are positive, to move into Phase III end of next year, potentially early '14. But our stretch goal is really to get it into Phase III next year. We expanded the collaboration both to get a DARPin that blocks both VEGF and PDGF, and that's clearly still in the preclinical stage. And we also have a research agreement where we can identify novel targets with which we can generate DARPins to fuel our retina pipeline for years to come. So that collaboration is going well. And the lead compound and the anti-VEGF in clinical trials, those trials are going both well. And again, hopefully, we'll get our data first half of next year and then try to get that presented as soon as we can after that. Thank you.","James M. Hindman","We would like to thank you for your participation today. If you have any further questions, Joann Bradley, Dave Nakasone and I will be available immediately following the call.

Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone.","Beginning on slide five, Allergan remains the most dynamic and exciting company in our industry. And in my mind, that makes us the best pharmaceutical company in the world. You can see it in our results this quarter. You can see it in the way our team has pivoted to focus on our future as a standalone leader in Growth Pharma. You can see it in the operational excellence on display in teams across our company. You can see it in the way we focus on building therapeutic area leadership in the categories where we choose to compete. You can see it in the way we are using open science to build an industry-leading R&D pipeline to sustain our leadership in those therapeutic areas. And you can ask our customers about our highly responsive service-oriented approach to customer intimacy. Those are just a few reasons why we are especially excited about our future.","As we considered our options for deploying cash following Teva's planned $40.5 billion acquisition of our Global Generics business in the second quarter, we realized that there was no better investment than owning our fast-growing company. So our board has authorized the company's first share repurchase program at a value of up to $10 billion. We'll start with $4 billion to $5 billion during the rest of 2016, buying as much as prudently possible (3:58) in the open market. If favorable market conditions persist, we will have additional capacity to consider buying more after satisfying the first part of the program.","In addition to the stock repurchase program, we will have the ability to pay down debt to maintain our investment-grade credit ratings and preserve significant capacity to invest for growth.","Given the strength of our current business and the opportunities we see ahead, we remain focused on running one of the finest companies in our industry. Tessa will talk more about the share repurchase program in just a few minutes.","Turning to slide six, Allergan's first quarter performance reflects our continuing execution on each element of our Growth Pharma strategy. First, top line growth. In the first quarter we powered another fine quarter, with total revenue up 48% and branded growth up 71% versus prior year. On a pro forma basis, branded revenue was up double digits again this quarter.","Second, we maintained leadership positions in our seven core therapeutic areas. And with the recent launches of new drugs like Viberzi, Vraylar, and Kybella, we have added significant muscle and growth potential to our GI, CNS, and aesthetic therapeutic areas.","Third, our R&D engine continues to produce at record pace. We delivered two new branded FDA approvals and four FDA submissions just in the first quarter. In Europe, we also received a positive opinion for Zenpep ex-U.S., n\u00e9e Enzepi, to enhance our cystic fibrosis and pancreatic insufficiency offering. Our open science model is helping us build a sustainable R&D pipeline by bringing us novel assets like Xaf5 for under-eye bags, and from Heptares, a portfolio of selective agents for major neurological disorders like Alzheimer's disease, where we are the market leader. Our best-in-class generics R&D engine continues to perform well, and Rob Stewart will highlight this later.","Fourth, our focus on operational excellence helped us simplify the operating structure, streamline our IT systems, and drive more than a 500 basis point improvement in our operating margins versus prior year. Our operational excellence also has been on display with the launch of our generic Crestor in the U.S. Our generics team together with Anda executed flawlessly to get product onto pharmacy shelves fast in order to take advantage of this first-to-market opportunity.","Now let me turn to continuing operations business performance in the first quarter on slide seven. Our first-quarter net revenue grew 48% on a year-over-year basis to $3.8 billion as a result of the Allergan acquisition and strong global growth within all of our key therapeutic categories. Branded revenue was the key driver, up 71%. Strong sales in key products and operating margin expansion across our business drove a 15% increase in non-GAAP earnings per share to $3.04.","Meanwhile, non-GAAP operating income rose to $1.8 billion, an increase of 68% versus prior year. And cash flow from operations was $1.45 billion excluding R&D asset acquisitions, restructuring, and integration payments. These results illustrate the strong long-term growth profile of Allergan.","Turning to slide eight, our strategy is based on utilizing all of our Growth Pharma assets together, including our best-in-class commercial engine, to bring life-changing medicines to patients around the world. As we look at our product portfolio, our branded business continues to thrive in the first quarter, with 10% pro forma revenue growth excluding the impact of currency and the Namenda IR and divestitures. Our top global growth (8:15) products, which represent more than 75% of total branded revenue, grew 13% excluding the impact of currency and Namenda IR, with over half those products growing at double-digit rates. This quarter performance is a true testament to the hard work of our team and the success of our Growth Pharma strategy and mindset.","Moving to slide nine, as we near the conclusion of the Generics divestiture, I have been carefully considering how to streamline our management structure to better align our resources as a focused branded Growth Pharma business with many leading global brands. We have announced a streamlined executive team to lead Allergan going forward.","In this new leadership structure, all of our commercial businesses will be combined under Bill Meury, who has been appointed our Chief Commercial Officer. There will be three major business segments under Bill. The first segment is U.S. Specialized Therapeutics, which includes eye care, medical aesthetics, medical dermatology, and Botox Therapeutic. The second segment is U.S. General Medicine, which includes CNS, CV, GI, women's health, AI, and urology. The third segment is International, which includes all of our businesses outside the U.S., organized in multiple regions. Anda, our fourth segment, will continue to report to Rob Stewart.","We remain focused on driving growth by building therapeutic area leadership in our seven core therapeutic areas: eye care, aesthetics and medical dermatology, CNS, GI, women's health, Botox Therapeutic, and anti-infectives. We will continue to be a drug development powerhouse and utilize our open science model to invest in innovation and propel future growth in these therapeutic areas. I believe this new commercial structure will further enhance our global focus, speed decision-making, and align resources and priorities with our R&D priorities.","We are also appointing Rob Stewart to the position of Chief Operating Officer. In this role, Rob will make sure our manufacturing operations run smoothly to meet our sales goals, oversee harmonization of our IT systems and processes, and finish previous integrations.","With that, I will turn the call over to Bill Meury, our new Chief Commercial Officer.","William J. Meury - Chief Commercial Officer","Thanks, Brent, and good morning, everyone.","Two hallmarks of Growth Pharma are category leadership and customer intimacy.

I'm looking forward to leading the Allergan commercial organization, which has a great portfolio of products, as you know, and an industry-leading team with deep knowledge and expertise of key therapy areas.","All the talent we needed for the future organization was here within our four walls. And with this new integrated structure, we can begin to leverage resources globally and across product lines in lockstep with our R&D organization. We're squarely focused on leadership in each of our therapeutic areas and on having a unique connection with our customers, both of which are competitive advantages.","Turning to slide 11, the fundamentals of our business are strong. Overall basic demand, market share growth, and sales performance were robust in the first quarter. And we're well positioned to sustain the growth for these franchises for the remainder of 2016 and beyond. In all seven of our therapeutic areas, our teams delivered high single or double-digit sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange versus the prior year.","In eye care, sales increased by 11%, powered by continued strength from Restasis, Combigan, and Ozurdex. U.S. sales for Restasis, our flagship product, increased by 22%. We're preparing for the launch of Restasis MDPF, Multi-Dose Preservative Free, in the second half of the year, and looking forward to the approval of Oculeve, our nasal neurostimulator, in early 2017, which will significantly strengthen our product offering for ocular surface disease. Behind these two products, we have a cortisol analog and a mucin secretagogue. We are, as you know, an eye care company, and we look forward to building the deepest and broadest portfolio for ocular surface disease.","In CNS, we delivered 21% growth, with Botox Migraine, Namenda XR, and Vraylar. These were the key growth products in the quarter and are expected to continue driving growth in 2016 and beyond.","In aesthetics, sales increased by 7% with Botox, fillers, and Kybella. All three businesses are in an excellent position, and we expect to sustain high growth rates in 2016 and beyond too. Sales in aesthetics increased at an impressive rate of 16% excluding medical dermatology. Medical derm revenue, however, was impacted by a one-time harmonization for allowances in the quarter. However, prescription trends were relatively stable, and we expect growth in the back half of the year.","In GI, Linzess, our flagship, continues to exceed expectations and post exceptional growth, and the launch of Viberzi is off to a very strong start. We expect sales for this franchise to increase at a double-digit rate in 2016 and beyond despite a decline in the Asacol\/Delzicol product line. We also see strong growth and continue to be excited about our future in women's health, urology, and anti-infectives.","On slide 12, we have eight products in launch phase across each of our leading therapeutic areas. This is important as it provides new products for our sales forces, new products to deliver to our customers, and new innovation to solve unmet medical need for patients. Let me talk a little bit about three of our newest launches, Vraylar, Viberzi, and Kybella, all of which have blockbuster potential.","Turning to slide 13, we launched Viberzi, our treatment for IBS-D, right at the end of 2015, and we're off to a strong start. Based on sales, Viberzi is trending at approximately 80% of Linzess IBS-C during the same time period post-launch, which is in line with our expectations. More than 8,000 physicians have prescribed Viberzi to date, and about 65% of the physician base are repeat prescribers. And we're seeing a nice boost to scripts following the start of our DTC campaign in April.","Linzess, our treatment for IBS-C, continues to experience strong growth four years post-launch. We've seen incremental growth following the launch of our long-term care focused detailing program and DTC advertising campaigns. We now have two products that can cover a range of IBS needs to treat these patients.","Turning to slide 14 and Vraylar, Vraylar was launched in mid-March in the United States and is tracking strongly with competitive products, including Rexulti and Latuda at the time of their launches, exceeding our internal expectations. Vraylar has higher script trends versus Latuda at launch, and Vraylar's volume is similar to Rexulti without a current indication in MDD. The future of this product is very promising. Vraylar could potentially be the only approved treatment with five different indications or claims. That would be a significant advantage for the product and would make it a potential blockbuster in the marketplace.","Now turning to slide 15, Kybella, our product for submental fat reduction, or double chin, is off to a strong start. Since we acquired the product from Kythera in October of 2015, we've accelerated the training of targeted accounts. So far we have trained over 4,000 injectors, or almost 50% of the potential user base. And importantly, 3,000 of those trained have already begun ordering.","In the back half of the year, we plan to launch a DTC campaign for Kybella. The campaign will greatly enhance the current promotional effort, which are really laying the groundwork in the creation and development of this new market for injectables. We continue to believe this product has a very strong future potential, and our R&D team is exploring a number of new indications. We're also continuing to develop and prepare for the launch of the product ex-U.S. in various markets, including the recent launch in Canada and other international markets later this year and in 2017.","In summary, our Commercial business continues to perform well, and we plan to continue to focus on our core therapy area leadership and in leading the industry with launches and ultimately in double-digit top line growth.","With that, I'll turn the call over to David.","[06GLXP-E David Nicholson]","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone.","Let's move to slide 17. This presents our late-stage development pipeline. In Q1, we continued to make very significant progress, 2016 being another extremely busy year for our R&D team. We expect more than a dozen approvals and regulatory submissions, and we are on track to achieving these milestones.","I'm not going to talk about everything on this slide, but I would like to talk about a few of the key highlights, first, approvals. We received U.S. approval of Aczone Gel 7.5% for the treatment of acne, providing a new concentration of dapsone for once-a-day application. And we received FDA approval of Dalvance single-dose as an antibiotic for skin and skin structure infections. The single dose allows for delivery of this IV antibiotic in 30 minutes in the emergency department and infusion centers, and will provide selected patients the benefit of receiving a complete course of parenteral treatment, which may avoid hospital admissions.","Regarding submissions to regulatory authorities, we submitted an NDA for oxymetazoline as a treatment for rosacea. Also, we submitted an sNDA for Linzess low-dose 72mcg for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation, or CIC, which provides another important dosing option for physicians and patients, and could accelerate the conversion to the OTC market. We also filed an sNDA for a single-handed inserter with optimized packaging for Liletta, our intrauterine device.","Our partner, Serenity Pharmaceuticals, submitted and the FDA has accepted an NDA for Ser 120, a potential new treatment for nocturia.","Turning to development programs, earlier this week we announced positive top line results from VENUS I, one of two Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of ulipristal acetate for the treatment of uterine fibroids. In the trial, both 10mg and 5mg treatment arms met all co-primary and secondary endpoints over placebo, and there were no treatment-related serious adverse events.","This is important progress for our Esmya program and for patients. It is estimated that uterine fibroids contribute to more than 200,000 hysterectomies annually in the U.S. It's about one-third of all hysterectomies performed in the United States. Esmya has the potential to offer the first and only non-surgical oral treatment option for women suffering from uterine fibroids in the United States. The results are very exciting, and we continue to anticipate a 2017 submission for this product.","In addition, in Q1, together with Gedeon Richter, we initiated a Phase 3 trial for cariprazine in bipolar depression. Two parallel studies will be conducted at approximately 85 sites in the U.S. and Europe. Bipolar depression is one of the most difficult mental illnesses to treat, and response rates vary greatly from one patient to another. So it's important to continue to explore new therapies and increase the number of options which are available to help patients manage their symptoms.","Turning to slide 18, as Brent mentioned, Allergan's R&D pipeline continues to be innovative and productive, and it is continuing to grow through our open science model. In 2015, we acquired, in-licensed, or entered into collaborations, providing more than 10 new pipeline opportunities across our key therapeutic areas. We achieved registration for four NMEs in the United States.","In 2016, we have already added two additional development programs through open science. First, our development and commercialization partnership with Heptares adds a broad clinical and pre-clinical portfolio of muscarinic M1, M4, and dual M1\/M4 agonists, including HDL9936 and HDL18318 for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. These muscarinic agonists have the potential to improve symptoms of this disorder such as cognition and psychosis. Muscarinic agonists have previously been demonstrated to improve cognition in Alzheimer's. The development has been hindered due to off-target side effects. We believe that the Heptares compounds have selectivity advantages, which should result in maintenance of the beneficial effect without the deleterious side effects.","Our acquisition of Topokine adds Xaf5, a potential first-in-class treatment for steatoblepharon, or more easily known as undereye bags.","We've had a great start to 2016 in R&D. We have many more milestones ahead for the remainder of the year. Our pipeline continues to validate our approach to R&D innovation through our open science model. I thank our more than 2,000 Allergan R&D colleagues around the world for their tremendous work and dedication in deriving innovation, in achieving these results, and for their commitment to the work ahead.","I will now turn the call over to Rob Stewart to briefly discuss a few highlights of the Global Generics business. Rob?","[0D2HLP-E Rob Stewart]","Thanks, David, and good morning.","Turning to slide 20, our generics business remains a best-in-class asset, and I could not be more proud of the accomplishments of our entire organization. The R&D team continues to achieve an incredible number of filings both in the United States as well as in key international markets. More impressive than the numbers are the quality of the assets filed, including first-to-file applications for generic Abraxane as well as generic Xifaxan. Out of all of the first-to-files published by FDA in 2016, our generic team holds 50% of those accepted. They've done this year after year, and now have amassed over 90 first-to-file applications pending at the agency. Outside of the United States, we have filed over 1,000 marketing authorizations, so the performance remains strong not only in the U.S. but across the globe.","Price erosion is always a headwind in the generic industry, and 2016 is no different. Companies that invested in developing high-quality assets and invested in their supply chain capability are able to counter price erosion more effectively with new product launches, strong quality, and reliable customer service. This year we've launched 13 new products in the United States, including generic Crestor last week. Internationally we launched 62 products, including pemetrexed. We continue to see erosion within expectations, around mid-single digits, different from the more commoditized generic models out there.","Moving to slide 21, our entire organization remains focused on closing the transaction with Teva in June. We are operationally ready to close once we receive the antitrust clearance. We have regulatory approvals in all countries with the exception of the U.S., but both teams are working diligently to complete that process.","In closing, our performance remains strong. Our team continues to execute, and most of our leadership team at Allergan Generics is continuing on with Teva, so we expect to see continued strong performance post-close.","I'll now turn the call to Tessa to review our first quarter financial results. Tessa?","Maria Teresa Hilado - EVP & Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Please note this discussion of results reflects continuing operations, which we have been reporting since Q3 2015 following the announcement of the divestiture of our Global Generics business to Teva.","Turning to our overall results for the first quarter of 2016 on slide 23, in the first quarter we delivered strong year-over-year performance. On a non-GAAP basis, consolidated net revenue for the first quarter of 2016 was $3.8 billion, an increase of 48% versus the first quarter of 2015, with branded net revenues increasing 71% to $3.4 billion, primarily driven by the Allergan acquisition. Sequentially, results were impacted by lower Anda revenues and the impact of anticipated seasonality on top promoted branded products.","Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 80.1%, an increase of 8.9 percentage points versus first quarter 2015, which reflects our revenue mix following the acquisition of Allergan and the impact from Anda. While Anda's revenue has declined versus prior year, the lost revenue was at a very low margin.","Non-GAAP R&D investment for the quarter was $277 million compared to $172 million in the prior-year period. Non-GAAP SG&A was relatively flat compared to last quarter at $1.01 billion as a result of continued spending behind our new product launches, including Kybella, Viberzi, and Vraylar. SG&A increased from the previous-year period as a result of the acquisition of Allergan.","Non-GAAP operating income for the quarter was $1.75 billion, an increase of 68% versus the prior year, driven by higher revenues and higher gross margins across our business segments, mainly as a result of the Allergan acquisition. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter increased 15% to $3.04 compared to $2.65 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2015.","Our non-GAAP tax rate was 9.7% in the quarter. This rate was driven in part by the entire interest expense being included in our continuing operations earnings.","Cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $1.2 billion, impacted by recent R&D asset acquisitions and integration expenses. Excluding these items, cash flow from operations was $1.45 billion.","Turning now to our U.S. brands results on slide 24, the business continued to deliver strong performance year over year. U.S. brands revenue was $2.3 billion for the quarter, up 27% versus the prior-year period, driven by the addition of the Allergan business and strong growth across other key branded products, offset by a decline in Namenda IR with the loss of exclusivity for that product and lower revenue of the Asacol\/Delzicol franchise. Adjusted gross margin within U.S. brands continued to show improvement with margins of approximately 89%, up 0.8 percentage points versus the prior-year quarter.","SG&A as a percentage of revenue decreased to 21.7% versus 23.8% in the year-ago quarter, driven by our continued ability to maximize our commercial infrastructure post the Allergan acquisition.","And now turning to slide 25, our U.S. medical business, first quarter revenues were $450 million. There's no significant prior-year comparison for U.S. medical, as it was acquired as part of the Allergan acquisition in March of 2015. On a pro forma basis, U.S. Medical business revenue grew two percentage versus prior year and 14% excluding medical dermatology. Growth was driven by key products, including Botox at 12%, fillers at 14%, and Kybella. Sequentially, revenue was impacted by typical seasonality. Our med-derm business net revenue declined versus the prior year on a pro forma basis, attributed to a one-time harmonization of allowances versus Q1 2015. Prescription trends for the products were stable, and we expect strong full-year performance from this business, driven by Aczone.","First quarter gross margins continued to be stable at 93.1%. Sequentially, SG&A increased slightly as a result of continued Kybella promotional spend and sales force expansion related to the launch of this product.","Turning to slide 26 and our international brand results, first quarter revenues were $673 million versus $119 million in the prior-year period, largely due to the Allergan acquisition. Excluding FX on a pro forma basis, international revenues in the first quarter grew 16%, driven by continued strong growth of Botox Cosmetic, fillers, and Ozurdex. Gross margins were 85.3% in the quarter, and segment SG&A increased two percentage points to 31.9% versus fourth quarter 2015, due largely to new product launches, including earFold and Constella in various markets.","Turning to our Anda business on slide 27, revenues decreased 34% to $365 million versus $554 million in the prior-year period, driven by anticipated lower retail business, primarily from the CVS acquisition of Target in-store pharmacies. Gross margins increased 2.3 percentage points to 16.9% due to product mix. Results in all periods include third-party revenues and related expenses of generic products manufactured by the company and distributed through Anda.","Slide 28 details our debt capitalization. We ended the first quarter 2016 with total debt of approximately $42.6 billion and equity of $77.5 billion. At quarter end, our leverage ratio was 4.43 times debt to adjusted EBITDA versus 4.07 times in the prior-year quarter. In April, we made approximately $1.2 billion in debt payments, bringing our adjusted leverage ratio to 4.3 times debt to adjusted EBITDA. We remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade ratings. Following the close of the divestiture of our Generics business to Teva, we anticipate paying the remaining term loan balance of approximately $8 billion, which has no prepayment penalties.","Turning to slide 29, let me make a few comments on our 2016 guidance, which we are reiterating today. We continue to expect full-year net revenues to be approximately $17 billion, including branded business revenues of approximately $15 billion, reflecting double-digit growth, driven by strong sales of key products and new launches in 2016. Note that revenues will be back-half weighted as a result of contribution from launches being greater in the second half and typical pharma seasonality. Our revenue forecast reflects lower year-over-year revenue expectations for Anda of approximately $500 million due to the CVS acquisition of Target in-store pharmacy.","We continue to expect our gross margins to remain strong, with no material change from current levels in each segment. We continue to anticipate SG&A as a percentage of non-GAAP revenue to be approximately 25% of total net revenue. And we expect the SG&A as a percentage of revenue to trend downwards throughout the year naturally as revenue is increased and as we continue to see the impact of our anticipated business simplification activities following the divestiture of our Global Generics business to Teva.","As part of the business simplification plan, we announced a new streamlined senior leadership structure. This new structure will allow us to leverage resources across therapeutic areas and product categories and focus on the key attributes of Growth Pharma, including strong top line revenue growth and operational excellence, which will result in industry-leading operating margins.","R&D spend is expected to be approximately $1.5 billion as a result of the many important late-stage programs advancing in our pipeline, including the commencement of Phase 3 programs of Rapastinel and Ubrogepant in the back half of this year.","Our tax rate should begin to trend gradually toward normalized levels, in the range of 14%, following the close of Teva. We will provide an updated forecast for 2016, including our expectations for earnings per share following the close of the Teva transaction, most likely on our second quarter earnings call in August.","And now starting on slide 30, I would like to spend a few minutes on our capital deployment expectations following the close of the Teva transaction. To echo Brent's comments during his introduction, we have great conviction in our Growth Pharma strategy and in the strong future prospects of our company. Our strategy for capital deployment will involve a three-pronged approach with options that are not mutually exclusive, with a goal of providing the best value and return to our shareholders.","On slide 31, the divestiture of our Global Generics business provides us with significant liquidity. As mentioned by Rob previously, Teva has done a great job working through a very intricate process. Working together with our colleagues at Allergan, Teva is ready for a successful day one following the close, which is on track for June.","Moving to slide 32, as you saw this morning, we announced our board's authorization to repurchase up to $10 billion of our own stock following the close of the Teva transaction. We realized that there was no better investment than in our own fast-growing company. We expect to execute $4 billion to $5 billion over a four to six-month period, buying as much as prudently possible in open-market purchases subject to favorable market conditions. If favorable market conditions persist, we will have more liquidity to consider buying more after satisfying the first part of the program.","In addition to the stock repurchase program, we are also committed to maintaining our investment-grade ratings and will pay down approximately $8 billion of debt following the close of the Teva transaction. This leaves us with significant capacity to invest strategically in the growth of our company.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Brent for closing remarks.","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Tessa.","Now to finish, let me provide some comments on the overall environment. Over the past six months, we have seen a particularly tough environment for companies relying on a strategy of high leverage and buying low-quality non-core assets, significantly raising prices, and drastically cutting lifeblood investments in R&D and commercial infrastructure. When the strategy is flawed, the outcome will be bad, even if it takes time.","What is left will be high-quality companies that continue to invest in R&D and those that come up with new ways to speed introduction of medical innovations. The best of those high-quality companies will not rely only on what their teams discover in-house but will also have an open mind and use open science to attract innovations from across the entire ecosystem. They will have excellent R&D capabilities to bring those innovations through the rigors of clinical trials and regulatory review around the world. And the most dynamic of those companies will have commercial engines that are resilient, persistent, and effective at driving growth.","Allergan is one of those high-quality, dynamic, growing pharmaceutical companies. That is how we are running this company. I am proud of our team doing this great work at every level and honored to be their CEO.","What that, let's open it up for questions. Lisa?","Lisa M. DeFrancesco - Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, we'll start taking questions. I would like to ask everyone to ask one question only so we can get to everyone on the call this time. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes, thanks very much. Congrats on the news today. I wanted to ask a number of questions, but I'll just keep it to one to start and then I'll circle back into the queue.","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you for setting a good tone.","Lisa M. DeFrancesco - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, David.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","With respect to capital allocation, obviously investors are focused on how you're going to use the proceeds once the Teva transaction closes, and so I was hoping that you could talk a little bit more about capital allocation. Specifically, slide 32 says tuck-in deals, so I think that's what investors are looking for. They're not looking for large deals, but if you could provide a little bit more color on the M&A that you're focused on. And also, if you could comment on any thoughts on a potential dividend. Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure, I'll take the question, David, and maybe Tessa will jump in as well. So look, I think you're exactly right. As you look at the slide 32 that Tessa had up, we are currently looking at three areas for capital allocation: one, the share repurchase that we announced today, up to $10 billion; paying down debt and maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings, and we'll pay down about $8 billion without penalties immediately upon receipt of the proceeds from Teva; and then continuing to look at advancing our Growth Pharma strategy.","And we believe today that the best way to advance our Growth Pharma strategy is to bolster our therapeutic area leadership both with tuck-in product acquisitions and with intellectual property R&D asset acquisitions. And I think we have, as David pointed out, we did about 10 of those last year. We've done two in the first quarter, and they've been I think highly productive and potentially very successful for us.","So we're going to stick to the knitting of what's created Growth Pharma. If there was a transformational deal like Allergan where there's a \u2013 which was a bit of a one-in-a-million type of opportunity to be a white knight to buy a once-in-a-lifetime kind of asset like Allergan, certainly we're going to stay open-minded to that. But our core focus is on running the best pharmaceutical company in the world and supporting that growth through this three-pronged capital deployment strategy.","Maria Teresa Hilado - EVP & Chief Financial Officer","On dividends, our long-term, our capital deployment philosophy actually really centers on what is in the long-term good for our shareholders from a value perspective, and we do believe longer term that dividends presumably could be part of that strategy.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, David.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Brent, on the back of the $10 billion authorized share buyback program, obviously it's very good news from my perspective and I'm sure many investors. But why not announce a buyback through an ASR or a Dutch auction rather than waiting over a six-month period to buy back $4 billion to $5 billion through the open market? Is there a limitation because of the structure of your business? Why not accelerate that process? And also, can you speak to market conditions that would prevent you from doing the entire $10 billion buyback? Thanks very much.","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure, I'll start and maybe Tessa then can jump in. Look, I think in fairness, Jami, we would have loved to have bought in an ASR at the current prices. But to be fair, restrictions in Irish law make an open market structure our best course of action. And if you look at Irish companies, there is no Irish company that has ever done an ASR. And there are certain reasons for that, which would probably take the rest of our time on the call to walk through. But, Tessa, do you want to jump in there?","Maria Teresa Hilado - EVP & Chief Financial Officer","Yes, we also obviously evaluate the various structures that could satisfy and would look like an ASR, but currently there are really no structures that could provide us the benefits of a traditional ASR without legal or accounting complications. As Brent pointed out, there has been no Irish company that has actually executed an ASR, really largely due to the limitations in Irish law.","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'm sorry. Go ahead, Jami, did you have something...","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes, the second question was can you speak to the market conditions that would prevent you from doing the entire $10 billion buyback?","Maria Teresa Hilado - EVP & Chief Financial Officer","At the end of the day, it really depends on volume on a regular basis because we obviously want to buy prudently. And then secondly, as we look going forward in terms of other capital deployment options and how the stock performs, that could potentially affect our thinking. In reality, the reason why we announced a $4 billion to $5 billion share buyback program is because really that's the only thing we can buy in the next four to six months. That doesn't mean that we won't go up to the $10 billion. Before we actually end the $5 billion program, we will then assess putting in additional 10b5 grids to execute up to the $10 billion.","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And so just to be clear, Jami, because I think that this question could be out there, to reiterate what Tessa said, doing the $4 billion to $5 billion over the next several months, in our view, is about the maximum we can buy given the volumes of what our stock has historically traded at. If we could buy more, we will, and we'll update you at that time. We would like to execute the full $10 billion, but we can only commit to what we can commit to at this time, and we will keep all of you updated, probably on our quarterly calls, as we go forward. Our board was very committed to the buyback, and that's why it was $10 billion. And right now, we can execute what we can execute for the foreseeable future, and we'll continue to update you as we go.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Just a quick follow-up, obviously, your desire is to do tuck-in deals to help grow the pipeline, but there may not be tuck-in opportunities or tuck-in opportunities present themselves throughout year, throughout the course of the year. Are you limiting yourself to $10 billion because based on my numbers you could go even higher than a $10 billion buyback? Is this something that you're constantly balancing and assessing, or is $10 billion as far as you'll go on a buyback?","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","To be fair, we're constantly evaluating all of the opportunities, including debt repayment, and maintaining our investment-grade rating is incredibly strategic to us. So that is at the top of our list as well.","That being said, if we execute the full $10 billion and market conditions continue to look very favorably, I would certainly bring to our board with a lot of advocacy to continue and authorize more. But at this point, $10 billion holds us over for the next several months or perhaps more, so we're in good shape. We will be in the open market buying our stock for the foreseeable future, and we'll keep everybody updated. And to be fair, if we could have done it through an ASR if it were available to Irish companies, we would have done it. It's just not.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Right, thank you very much and congratulations.","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. So I guess there are some drawbacks to being Irish.","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Not many. They have good beer too, though.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So, Brent, you could spend years bolstering your positions in those seven therapeutic areas. Assuming they're all core, is that your intention, or what would it take for you to stray from that? And within that, are you globally or geographically where you want to be within those seven? Thanks.","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So I think you're right, Gregg. We could spend years bolstering our position in those seven therapeutic areas. And in fact, at R&D Day last November we showed a lot of the whitespace opportunity in each of those therapeutic areas. And those that want to go look at it, I think that presentation is still up on our website.","And you know what? That's the foundation of our strategy, Gregg, is that there is so much opportunity for years to continue to bolster our position, and so we will. We like every one of the seven therapeutic areas that we're in. We think there's huge unmet medical need, huge opportunities to help patients with cures and treatments, and tremendous scientific advance. So we're going to continue to deploy open science and opportunities to bring in selected marketed products to bolster our position and become number one globally in every one of those therapeutic areas.","With respect to a new therapeutic area, I think the bar would be high for us to consider de novo a new therapeutic area. It would have to be an area with strong growth potential, lots of whitespace, and limited competition for assets in that category. There are a few that we evaluate that meet those goals, but we're not focused on doing that at this time.","I think in terms of global expansion, I think that was a huge opportunity for us in the Pfizer transaction. We talked about that as probably our most compelling revenue synergy. And as a standalone Allergan, it remains a compelling opportunity for us. I think as you look at the growth that Paul Navarre and the international team put up this quarter and in previous quarters, it's a strong proof point in our interest in growing appropriately ex-U.S. We're going to focus on eye care. We're going to focus on aesthetics and dermatology, and we're going to focus on GI and women's health. And those are the areas that we're going to stay focused and looking at going into new markets.","I think, Paul, we've expanded and taken back some distributor rights. Perhaps you just want to comment on one or two of those markets.","Paul Navarre - Executive VP & President-International Brands","Yes, so we have expanded in Eastern Europe. We went direct into 10 new markets, including Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary. And we also went direct in Greece and Israel. And we are now entering \u2013 or this summer we're going to enter Iran, which is a significant opportunity for us for the medical aesthetics business. So we are continuing our expansion internationally.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks, Brent.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Randall Stanicky with RBC Capital Markets.","Randall S. Stanicky - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great, thanks. Brent, Allergan is a very big company now. What do you define as a tuck-in?","And then a quick one for Tessa, just thinking about SG&A and that 25% of revenue, after the restructuring post-Teva, as you leave 2016, what percent of revenue do you think you're going to be at? Thanks.","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's hard to define tuck-in by size, Randall. I think it's more the characteristics of tuck-in. So think about a tuck-in being limited to the seven therapeutic areas we're in. That would be a criterion. It would have to be a growth asset to support the seven areas. We'd only need to add limited additional capabilities to support the product or the R&D asset. And so that's how I think about tuck-ins. I think within size, obviously it's going to be anywhere from $50 million to something \u2013 a few billion dollars, but there are exceptions to each one of those rules as well.","Randall S. Stanicky - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Tessa?","Maria Teresa Hilado - EVP & Chief Financial Officer","Basically for SG&A as a percentage of revenue, as we indicated, we'd be roughly at 25%. And as we previously discussed, the first quarter is really the low revenue quarter for us because of typical seasonality. So we would expect coming out of 2016 in the fourth quarter for SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be lower than that.","Having said that, I think what we need to take into consideration as well is the important launches we have for 2016. And actually the other metric that I would guide you to is probably looking at operating margins as well, which as you know, we're at the top of the industry. Just looking at SG&A as a percentage of revenue would be a little deceiving because it would fluctuate through the quarters because of seasonality. But we would trend lower as revenues grow for 2016.","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, Randall, maybe just to come back to the first part of your question, if I could for a second, maybe the better way to think about it instead of tuck-ins is really stepping stones to growth. There would have to be a path from our existing position in a therapeutic area, and a stepping stone would be to drive growth or leadership in that therapeutic area.","Randall S. Stanicky - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And that includes pipeline as well?","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That includes pipeline, absolutely, because our growth has to be sustainable. And I've always said innovation is our lifeblood, and R&D is a critical element to that.","Randall S. Stanicky - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, that's great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Marc Goodman with UBS.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Yes, good morning. Just to continue on the expenses conversation, what amount of expenses do we need to take out for next year, just as a starting point? And I guess the context of the question is there has been a lot of consolidation into this company. There was a lot of cost-cutting and synergies that was promised (53:47) previously. And a lot of that went away when you were going to be acquired by Pfizer, but now we're back, so we're curious. How much on an absolute basis are we definitely taking out? And then how much will expenses just trend up but revenues trend up higher such that you get some benefit on the margin?","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Let me just start. So, Marc, just to kid you a bit, the synergies we've committed to with respect to our previous integrations never went away. They may have from people who follow us. But internally, we have maintained an incredibly rigorous and disciplined process of tracking and executing against those. There were some that we put on the shelf related to both Actavis-Allergan integration and some related to the Teva divestiture, and we did that appropriately so. But they didn't go away. We have taken them off the shelf and have started to focus on achieving those throughout the remaining part of this year and into next year. But all of the work that we have committed to we will deliver.","Maria Teresa Hilado - EVP & Chief Financial Officer","Right. And I think just to remind everyone, we will provide more clarity post the Teva transaction in terms of EPS and more granular details for the back half of 2016. And then in 2017, as we plan to look at 2017, we will provide guidance in the normal course, which would be in early 2017.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","I guess if you don't want to answer that, maybe we could ask one other question, which is Botox was extremely strong in the quarter in constant currency. Can you just give us a little more color on what's going on there?","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Bill, do you want to take that?","William J. Meury - Chief Commercial Officer","Yes, there are two sides to that business. There's the therapeutic side and then there's the aesthetics side. And then of course, you can look at it through both a U.S. and an international lens. On the therapeutic side, the main drivers continue to be chronic migraine and overactive bladder. We also got a new indication for a neuro rehab condition, lower limb spasticity. Just yesterday at the National Urology meeting in San Diego, there was a head-to-head study published that was actually conducted by the NIH comparing Botox for overactive bladder to InterStim, Medtronic's product, which I think the urology community found very, very instructive. And so that side of the business is very strong.","When you turn to the aesthetics side, as you know, it's the leading brand in the world. It has a world-class e-commerce and customer loyalty program which continues to sustain sales levels. If you think about it geographically, the international business sales for Botox were up almost 20%. And so this is just a rock-solid product. It's got 11 different indications. It's got a unique injection pattern that users understand. It's highly economical. And of course, we have a whole series of new indications in development on both the therapeutic and the aesthetics side. This is a pure demand story.","Lisa M. DeFrancesco - Vice President-Investor Relations","Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Amsellem with Piper Jaffray.","David A. Amsellem - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Thanks. So I just wanted to ask about the memantine franchise and just focus on that business. I guess the question here is, are you disappointed with how Namzaric is tracking? And then secondly, what are your thoughts long term in terms of the portion of the memantine market that you think you'll be able to retain? Thanks.","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's a good question. I wouldn't say disappointed with Namzaric. I just think it's a timing matter. The original indication for Namzaric included patients who were on essentially the non-fixed combination, but it didn't include patients who were only receiving Aricept. And I think for physicians, that's an important indication, which we expect to get in the second half of 2016. It's clear among neurologists and primary care physicians that Namzaric is superior to anything on the market, whether it's Namenda XR or Aricept. Once we get that indication, we will essentially launch it, and I think you'll see a very different trajectory.","Overall though, whether it's Namenda XR or Namzaric, this is a very stable business, and we have a heavy promotional effort. We're the only one in the category that is active. Neurologists and primary care physicians know that. Our formulary coverage in 2016 and in 2017 is very, very strong. And I believe that we're going to at least maintain the business that we have today in the launch of the new indication for Namzaric for new patients; that is, patients only on Aricept, could restore growth to this business. And so I'm very confident about the next 12 to 24 months.","David A. Amsellem - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Cacciatore with Cowen.","Ken Cacciatore - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you. Bill, congratulations on your new role. Maybe ask about the payer environment in general, if there have been any meaningful changes or actions in general, so if you could, just discuss that. And maybe with some specificity to Viberzi first vis-\u00e0-vis Xifaxan, can you talk about coverage there, and Vraylar as well, the coverage as you're pursuing that launch or continuing that launch? Thank you.","William J. Meury - Chief Commercial Officer","Good question. Naturally, the formulary coverage for Viberzi is developing, but the majority of the claims for Viberzi during the first several weeks of launch have been approved, and so I'm very encouraged by it. ESI [Express Scripts] and CVS Caremark placed Viberzi on formulary in an unrestricted position, which I thought was a terrific development this early in the launch. I expect that over the next nine to 12 months, the formulary coverage for Viberzi is going to look just like the formulary coverage for Linzess.","Speaking about Linzess, it was added to CVS Caremark formulary; and then in the Part D space, WellCare and Aetna. And those are very significant formulary wins for the product and really shore up 2016 and I think into 2017.","There's nothing really in my view at least as it relates to our product line that is going to surprise us. We already have a line of sight to 2017. The products that our most important to our growth are first, economical. Most of their growth is coming from volume and single-digit price appreciation. And so I think as long as we continue to communicate with payers and we're predictable and transparent about our future pricing decisions, I think we're going to be able to maintain access across this entire product line.","As then as it relates to Vraylar, the product is off to a terrific start, and we know psychiatry very, very well. The feedback that we're getting is exceeding our expectations in terms of the actual experience with the drug. Formulary coverage is developing as expected. This is a category where, while there are a lot of products, there's a great deal of trial and error. And so health plans are inclined to place the product on formulary, even if it's behind the use of a Seroquel or a Risperdal or a Zyprexa.","And I think that essentially what's going to happen in this category is there will be a changing of the guard between the older atypicals, the ones I just mentioned, to newer atypicals like Vraylar or even the two others, Latuda and Rexulti. Because when you look at the benefit\/risk ratio of the newer ones, including Vraylar, it's clearly better than what you see with the older antipsychotics. And we're very encouraged by what's going on with Vraylar in the first eight weeks.","Ken Cacciatore - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thanks very much. I just had a question just coming back to price, given all the focus these days. Can you just comment at all just across the entire business, when we think about the mix of price versus volumes maybe relative to new launches, we think about your 1Q sales and particularly your 1Q pharma growth? And how much of this is price versus volume?","And then just a quick second one, coming back to business development, given the focus, which seems to be more on tuck-ins at this point, is it still fair to assume that you're going to deploy the majority of the cash that you're going to receive from the Teva deal over the next 12 to 18 months, or could that take a longer period of time to redeploy into your business? Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So let me quickly touch on price and then ask Bill to comment more specifically because I think this holds true, since you asked, Chris, across the entire portfolio. I think both in the branded and in the generic business, there has been a lot of debate and concern I think amongst the community around pricing. I think the reality is when you have innovative products that meet unmet need that can distinguish themselves from older products, pricing really isn't the central issue. It's the ability to commercialize and support your drug with data.","On the generic side, it's a very similar story. When you invest in R&D, as Bob Stewart pointed out, when you have a team that has 90 first-to-files waiting at the FDA, when they go after complex generics and higher-barrier products, you get a better pricing environment. And so I think the net-net is there are others that have reported weakness in price, but that's because their portfolio lacks innovation. It lacks differentiation. And even in highly innovative areas on the branded side, where there are multiple entries into the same market with very similar mechanisms of action, it drives price down. When you stand alone with your drug like we do with Viberzi, as an example, you tend to have better pricing dynamics in the environment. It's really that straightforward. Bill, do you want to comment specifically on our portfolio?","William J. Meury - Chief Commercial Officer","Yes, I would just first comment that our pricing strategy stems from the intellectual property surrounding these products. And we have exclusivity periods that extend well into the 2020s, and so we price for the long term. If you want to look at the business overall in the United States, the split was roughly 50:50, with the price appreciation of course being in the mid-single digits. If you want to look at those products that are responsible for the majority of our growth and sales, our top almost dozen products, the growth is coming 70% from volume and 30% from price.","So it's just a solid business. And again, it goes back to the fact that we're playing for the long term here. These are categories in which we have deep product offerings and strong customer relationships. And it's not \u2013 we don't have a short-term outlook as it relates to price, and we haven't built in anything to 2016 estimates or even beyond that's unrealistic given the current market dynamics.","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think with respect to business development, to the second part of your question, perhaps tuck-ins isn't the right way to think about it. I like the analogy that came up earlier of stepping stones because we're really looking at supporting the path to growth. We're not just looking at random tuck-ins to support non-core areas or the like. So it's a very focused strategy, more on a pathway. That's why I think a stepping stone approach is probably the right way to think about it.","And look, we have enough shots on goal. There are enough opportunities out there that we believe that the current capital allocation as described is the right way to think about it for the moment. But we will update you quarterly of our thoughts. If we think that the opportunities either don't work because we don't like the science, we don't like the product profile, or it's too expensive, then that could free up more money for additional share repurchase or additional debt repayment. But right now, we think we've got the right balance based on our view of the world as we sit here today.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein.","Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning, congratulations on the quarter and thank you for taking the question. If I could start with Bill for just a quick clarification, first, this harmonization of allowances that you mentioned for a couple of products, what exactly is it? It sounds a little bit like \u2013 I just want to make sure it's not essentially a reversal of overstocking the channel or something like this.","Maria Teresa Hilado - EVP & Chief Financial Officer","I'll address that, Ronny. So basically it's really just harmonizing all of our accounting policies, and this relates specifically to Aczone. The number in terms of an increase in allowance, not a decrease in allowance, is less than $20 million.","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And just to be fair, Ronny, it's one time, and on the overall business it's really not significant, as Tessa pointed out. The reason we call it out specifically, one is our commitment to transparency. But two, it is meaningful to the growth rate for the U.S. medical segment, and people do follow medical aesthetics very closely. So we wanted to bifurcate and show that that business is incredibly strong at 16% growth, and that the dampening of the overall segment was really a one-time event.","Maria Teresa Hilado - EVP & Chief Financial Officer","And just to clarify, it had nothing to do with inventory or channel-stuffing at all. Prescriptions specifically for that product is very stable.","Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay, and then one for David. David, you put out the results on Esmya a couple of days ago. Can you put the quality of life measures in context for us? It was very, very strong in terms of statistical significance. But can you describe essentially what is the benefit that patients have experienced in terms of how the scale is constructed? And essentially, how much relief are the patients getting on that?","C. David Nicholson - EVP-Global Brand Research & Development","Yes. So we do have a patient-recorded outcomes scale [PROS] as part of the Phase 3 trials. And we have discussed with the agency to what extent we're going be able to use the data from the PROS in our label. In terms of activities of daily living, we got a very positive result in the first Phase 3 trial, where the patients saw significant benefit in their daily activities. So we're also very happy about those results, not just \u2013 the trial wasn't only positive because of changes in the bleeding profile.","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And maybe, Bill, commercially, you want to just touch on Esmya for a second related to its position vis-\u00e0-vis Adebo (1:09:35) as an oral and as substantially ahead?","William J. Meury - Chief Commercial Officer","Yes, listen, pharmacologically it's different than a GnRH modulator, and I think that's going to flow right through to the benefit\/risk profile of Esmya relative to another option. This is the first study in the United States where an oral compound has shown excellent efficacy for the treatment of uterine fibroids. The impact on tumor size and bleeding is going to be really, really important. This is a large category. Over 10 million women suffer from uterine fibroids. This will be the flagship of our women's health business in a few years. Outside the United States, where it's been launched in Canada and in the EU, once you adjust for price and population, year three sales is near $400 million. And so this first trial was significant not only in terms of important for the community of OB\/GYNs and women's health in general, but also important to us in terms of a big pipeline development.","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So Tessa and I are writing down the $400 million.","Maria Teresa Hilado - EVP & Chief Financial Officer","That's right, duly noted, Bill.","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Ronny.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Liav Abraham with Citigroup.","Liav Abraham - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning. Brent, can you comment on your commitment to double-digit underlying revenue growth over the medium term with your current asset base given some of the potential pressures over the near term \u2013 near to medium-term situation for lifitegrast to Restasis, and to what extent will this commitment inform your business development strategy? So in other words, do you have a preference for assets that are on the market or close to the market versus pipeline assets in early to mid-stage development, or are you agnostic? Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Our commitment to double-digit revenue growth is sincere. It's strong. We look at our ability to execute on that over the next few years. And we think given our current assets and current pipeline, on a risk-adjusted basis we think we can get there. Obviously, there are always puts and takes that come to that. We have a high degree of confidence that we could do no other deals and deliver that growth over the next few years.","I think as we think about tuck-in or stepping-stone deals, as I've been calling them, the intellectual property type of deals, the R&D deals are designed to get us into the 2020s or well into the 2020s with double-digit growth because that's the name of our business. It's about new product launches, it's about innovation and looking for medicines that support treatment or cures for unmet need. And so we're going to continue to do that, but we're really thinking about well into the 2020s where we have to support the deal \u2013 our business to get \u2013 to maintain the double-digit growth.","I think with respect to our stepping-stone approach to the marketed product, we're really looking for innovative products that we think really do provide a meaningful differentiation in terms of unmet need and that fit neatly into our current therapeutic area so that we can get more leverage out of our infrastructure, whether that be G&A or selling and marketing. And so that's really how we see it. We have this great commercial engine both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. that we want to continue to leverage and make more of. And frankly, it makes our representatives, it makes our medical affairs teams, it makes our managed care teams more relevant when we talk about those therapeutic areas.","So there are multiple reasons why we like our therapeutic area leadership approach with multiple products across the entire broad spectrum. So I think we're in pretty good position to continue to deliver double-digit or about 10% top line growth. I don't know, Bill, anything you'd add?","William J. Meury - Chief Commercial Officer","Liav, we're focused on it if you think about 2016 and how does that happen. In addition to Vraylar, Viberzi, and Kybella, which are true new product launches, we have new indications or combinations or line extensions which also can support particularly healthy businesses. And so for example, Byvalson will launch in 2016. Then of course, we have the new indication for Namzaric. We'll launch the multi-dose preservative-free form of Restasis. And in early 2017, we will launch low-dose or 72mcg of Linzess. Each of those product improvements is against a fairly significant and important part of our sales stream, and that's how we think about the next 12 to 24 months.","Liav Abraham - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great, thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Liav.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Louise Chen with Guggenheim","Louise Chen - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I just have two quick questions here. First, we often get asked with respect to Allergan what your strategic vision is for the company longer term. Do you want to be a specialty pharma or growth pharma company? Do you want to be a large-cap pharma or biotech? I was wondering if you could give us more color here.","And then secondly just on SG&A leverage, I was just curious if you plan to improve that over time. And if so, what gives you confidence that you can achieve this objective? Thanks.","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, great question. It's interesting. The spec pharma label, which is how I think most people describe us, is purely a creation of many of you in that you're spec pharma analysts, not all of you but many, and so that's a Wall Street designation. We have a few years ago designated ourselves as Growth Pharma, and that's strategically what we want to be known as. We want to be focused on top line growth, therapeutic area leadership, and a sustained R&D investment through our open science approach.","And so that's our strategy. We articulated it now for a few years. I think post-Teva, it becomes even clearer that we are a focused, research-based, growth-oriented company with strong therapeutic area leadership in the seven areas that we compete in, with strong pipelines to support each of those areas, and a commitment to being open-minded around opportunities to enhance our leadership and enhance our growth through a stepping-stone approach to M&A. Do you want to talk about SG&A?","Maria Teresa Hilado - EVP & Chief Financial Officer","On SG&A, as I mentioned earlier, we have a very efficient operating structure, as we noted in one of the charts. We think we'll be at roughly 25% exiting the year in the fourth quarter, with higher revenues at a lower rate than that. And as I also mentioned, I think a good measure to look at as well is operating margins, given the fact that we have a good number of launches this year. And on operating margins, we continue to improve that sequentially quarter over quarter, and we believe we are in the top of the industry.","Louise Chen - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI.","Umer Raffat - Evercore ISI","Hi, thank you for taking my question, first perhaps for Bill. Bill, there has been a bunch of feedback online about sales force disruption in Botox urology, so I thought it was good to see you report Botox overactive bladder as a key driver in urology growth. Could you just please clarify where things stand in that division?","Then also a second one on Generics division. So I saw the 10-Q just hit. It was about $1.3 billion in generic sales versus about $1.7 billion in 1Q last year. I understand there must be choppiness from product launches and stuff. I just wanted to understand that trend as well. Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Look, I think our Botox Therapeutic franchise, I think the proof point is in the numbers that were delivered and the team is focused. Obviously, there were some issues in our urology area that were related to following company policy. We take that very seriously. We have a very strong compliance and internal audit process inside our company. Internal controls are at the forefront of what we do. And when people violate that, we deal with it very strictly and severely. And so that's what happened there. I wouldn't get too caught up on online chatter. You could drive yourself crazy looking at some of those message boards and think the world was coming to an end, not just at Allergan but across the entire world if you believe most of the stuff you see on those things. But suffice it to say the business is incredibly stable, resilient, and growing.","William J. Meury - Chief Commercial Officer","I would just add. I was at a recent sales awards trip that the management team that's in place and the majority of that field force was focused on our customers and naturally increasing the use of Botox in OAB, which is one of the fastest growing segments of that product. And so it's in our rearview mirror at this point.","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","On the generic side, Bob, or?","Robert A. Stewart - Chief Operating Officer","So what I would say on the generic side, this business continues to perform in line with our expectations. You can't necessarily go look at historical year-over-year comparisons in this business as we're preparing for this business to merge with Teva. There's also a number of cyclical things within the business with product launches and timing of things like that. But the underlying business is performing incredibly strong. We continue to see price erosion, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, as mid-single digit, and overall it continues to fire on all cylinders with respect to R&D as well as commercial execution of launches.","Paul M. Bisaro - Executive Chairman","Umer, this is Paul. Just remember, revenue is never a good view of the generics business performance because I can assure you in the second quarter with the launch of generic Crestor we're going to have blowout numbers on the revenue side. And I agree with Rob that our business is performing very, very well. And I think the Teva folks are going to be very happy to close the transaction and continue that strength.","Umer Raffat - Evercore ISI","Got it. But, Paul, just to be clear, versus 4Q, the $300 million drop in revenue, is there like a known launch that faded away?","Paul M. Bisaro - Executive Chairman","No, there are also cyclical issues in the generic business as well. The first quarter is always the toughest quarter. We've seen it year over year. That continues to be the same trend that we've always had.","Umer Raffat - Evercore ISI","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gerberry with Leerink Partners.","Jason M. Gerberry - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking my questions, and congrats to Bill for the change in role. So my question for Brent actually, just thinking about the change in tone regarding a transformational M&A deal from July when you announced the Teva deal to the present where it seems like maybe there's a little bit of a de-emphasis but still keeping an open mind to transformational deals, I guess what I'm wondering is what's changed in that period of time given that valuations have pulled back?","And then secondly, with the change in the Treasury notice and the look-back rules, if you can, just walk us through the restrictions in terms of using equity until say the Warner and Forest deals and even Allergan deals hit their three-year anniversaries. Thanks.","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So I think that perhaps if you picked up a slight change in tone, it's because as we've gotten more comfortable with the current business that we have and operate, as we've gotten more comfortable with our pipeline, it goes to how I opened the call. We have the best pharmaceutical business in the world. It's growing at pro forma 10% branded sales. It has a deep pipeline of plus 70 mid to late-stage pipeline opportunities. We have a strong capital deployment opportunity, both with share buybacks, debt repayment, and stepping-stone deals, and we have an investment-grade rated balance sheet.","So we are in I think the pole position, and our focus is going to be on operating and running our company and continuing to put up quarter after quarter performance. If we can support that or turbo-boost that with opportunistic deals that may come along, like Allergan came along in a very unique situation, then I think this is a bold management team that's going to look at what's in the best interest of our shareholders to drive shareholder value creation, and we'll do it. But the reality is, and I've been saying this for a long time, 99% of our focus, the management team sitting around the phone right now is running our business. And we're going to continue to put up executional excellence as our top goal. And we're going to continue to support the business with growth-oriented stepping-stone deals, but really our focus is on running the business.","Maria Teresa Hilado - EVP & Chief Financial Officer","With regards to the...","Jason M. Gerberry - Leerink Partners LLC","I'm sorry, Tessa.","Maria Teresa Hilado - EVP & Chief Financial Officer","Yes, so with regards to the Treasury rules, which you can imagine we analyzed that extensively, and based on our analysis two things have come out. One is we don't expect any material change in our tax rate. And then two, the new Treasury rules actually also affirm our status as an Irish domiciled company.","With regards to a transformational deal, we believe we can continue to maintain our Irish domicile. As you know, the new rules provide for a three-year look-back in terms of determining what we call good shares for purposes of calculating inversion. October 2016 is the three-year anniversary date for the Warner Chilcott acquisition, which then gives us more capacity to issue shares to a target company. The one thing that you have to note, though, that we always have the flexibility to issue shares for cash without actually affecting our status as a foreign company. So there's really nothing in the Treasury...","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Or sell in the open market.","Maria Teresa Hilado - EVP & Chief Financial Officer","Or sell in the open market, right. And so there's really nothing in the current Treasury rules today that preclude us from executing on our strategy, whether that's tuck-in in or transformational deals.","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And just to be clear, Jason, I would say two things. One, the Treasury rules had no impact on this small shift in thinking. As Tessa just outlined, with perhaps just some minor maneuvering, we could execute any transformational deal we wanted to do. I'm not worried about that. The reality is, why would we issue our stock at this price considering we just announced up to $10 billion of buyback? We think our stock or that currency is too inexpensive to issue to a target at this point anyway.","Maria Teresa Hilado - EVP & Chief Financial Officer","Plus, even if you look at it from a liquidity perspective, even with a $10 billion share repurchase authorization and if we execute up to that amount and the payment of debt, net-net we still have sufficient liquidity to pursue deals.","Jason M. Gerberry - Leerink Partners LLC","Got it. Okay, thank you.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of David Maris with Wells Fargo.","David Maris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Brent and David, on the pipeline, I see the one biosimilar for Avastin on the pipeline chart that you state will file in the second half of 2016. Can you update us on the status of the others?","And, Brent, what role do biosimilars play in the branded Pharma model? Is this another asset that you could trade or that you'd consider trading, or is it core to the Growth Pharma model?","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So let me answer the back part, and David then can talk about the status of the programs. Look, I think the way I think about biosimilars, at least over the next few years, is that for us, for Allergan, we've made most of the investment already, and we've seen good success with most of the programs in collaboration with Amgen. So for us at this point, we've made the investment and we should participate in the commercialization and\/or sales of those products through our partnership with Amgen.","Long term, I don't think biosimilars will necessarily be a core part of our strategy. We may decide to continue to invest in the partnership with Amgen because it's been a good collaboration and a successful partnership. We may look at selective opportunities to participate on a one-off basis. And we do have capabilities in our own organization in Liverpool, where we will look to do some unique things. But I think in fairness, we are focused on supporting our seven therapeutic areas with the vast majority of our R&D dollars, with the vast majority of our investment to make sure that we can continue to innovate around unmet need and to support our Growth Pharma agenda.","David, do you want to touch on the science?","C. David Nicholson - EVP-Global Brand Research & Development","Sure, yes. Just briefly, so the other biosimilars that we're working on together with Amgen, as I'm sure you're all aware, are biosimilars for Herceptin, Rituxan, and Erbitux. We anticipate getting the Phase 3 data for Herceptin later in the year. Obviously, Rituxan and Erbitux are earlier in the pipeline. Erbitux is still in pre-clinical development and Rituxan is moving into the early stages of development this year if the cell line development proceeds according to expectations.","David Maris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great, thank you very much.","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, David.","Lisa M. DeFrancesco - Vice President-Investor Relations","Brent, would you like to make any closing remarks?","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, I just want to thank everyone. I know it was a little bit of a longer call than normal, but I think it was worth our time. Obviously, we remain very focused on executional excellence, on continuing to deliver our goals and agenda with respect to Growth Pharma. We do look forward to probably our next call with respect to second quarter earnings in August to update you both on earnings for the remainder of the year and our life post-close of the Teva transaction. So thank you again for your time and look forward to catching up again.","Lisa M. DeFrancesco - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, everyone.","Operator","That concludes today's conference call.

After the presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","It is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Daphne Karydas. Please go ahead.","Daphne Karydas - Allergan Plc","Thank you, Arrow, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to the Allergan Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Earlier this morning we issued a press release reporting Allergan earnings for the quarter ended June 30, 2018. The press release and our slide deck which we are presenting this morning are available on our corporate website at www.allergan.com.","We are conducting a live webcast of this call. A replay of which will be available on our website after its conclusion.","Please note that today's call is copyrighted material of Allergan and cannot be rebroadcast without the company's express written consent.","Turning to slide two, I'd also like to remind you that during the course of this call management will make projections or other forward-looking remarks regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. It's important to note that such statements and events are forward-looking statements and reflect our current perspective of the business trends and information as of today's date. Actual results may differ materially from current expectations and projections depending on a number of factors affecting the Allergan business. These factors are detailed in our periodic public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Allergan disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements except as expressly required by law. All figures discussed during the call refer to non-GAAP. Our GAAP financial metrics and reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP metrics can be found in our earnings release issued this morning and posted on our website. In addition, all global and international growth rates referenced this morning are on an ex-FX basis.","Turning to slide three and our agenda this morning. With us on today's call are Brent Saunders, our Chairman and CEO; Bill Meury, our Chief Commercial Officer; David Nicholson, our Chief R&D Officer; and Matt Walsh, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available during the Q&A is Bob Bailey, our Chief Legal Officer.","With that, I will turn to call over to Brent.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Thanks, Daphne, and thank you everyone for joining our second quarter earnings call this morning.","Turning to slide five. We are now past the halfway point of 2018 and I am very proud of what our team has accomplished. Our strong performance gives us the confidence to raise our outlook for the year and reinforces the solid execution of our strategy to create a global biopharma leader focused in four key therapeutic areas. In Medical Aesthetics, CNS, Eye Care and GI, we have leading products growing double digits, real competitive advantages in drug development, commercial capabilities and operations and deep, long-standing customer relationships.","We continue to see strong underlying business momentum in each of these core Therapeutic areas, underscoring the hard work and focus of our Allergan colleagues across the globe. Year-to-date, we have also achieved very impressive results from our R&D pipeline with positive studies with five of our key late-stage programs. So we are strengthening our key Therapeutic areas through execution on our growth strategies, thereby extending our leadership position well into the future.","In fact, our late-stage pipeline is primed to deliver several important new product launches over the next couple years across our key Therapeutic areas. These strategic initiatives remain matched with our ongoing commitment to generate robust cash flows and maintain a strong balance sheet while supporting growth investments and capital return to shareholders. Overall, we have tremendous franchises and industry-leading pipeline programs in our Therapeutic areas which gives us confidence in our ability to drive sustainable long-term growth and shareholder value creation.","Turning to slide six. Let me review some of the highlights. We had another good quarter with double-digit growth from 10 different key products driving strong operational results even as products like Namenda XR and ESTRACE faced loss of exclusivity. Revenues were up 2% year-over-year including approximately a $250 million negative impact from the LOEs. Non-GAAP performance net income per share increased 10% and we generated strong operating cash flows again this quarter.","We also achieved major R&D milestones for mid to late stage products in development to support our future growth. Key drug trials we delivered during the quarter included atogepant positive top line results for the Phase 2b\/3 episodic migraine prevention study, Bimatoprost SR positive top line results from the first Phase 3 study in glaucoma, and just last week we reported positive results from our two abicipar Phase 3 studies in wet AMD. These successes build upon the positive top line results we delivered last quarter with our third positive Phase 3 cariprazine bipolar depression study and the positive Phase 3 studies for ubrogepant in acute migraine.","While there still is more work to be done to get these drugs to market, the steady cadence of positive Phase 3 readouts underpins our confidence in our long-term outlook. David will review these successes in more detail, but I wanted to extend my congratulations to our R&D colleagues. Transforming patients' lives who suffer from these and other debilitating disease through internal and external innovation is the core of our strategy. I'm very proud of what we have accomplished in a relatively short period of time.","We have also been very disciplined in our capital deployment and expense management activities. Given another strong quarter of cash flow generation, and the confidence we have in our outlook, we announced today that our Board of Directors has approved a new $2 billion share repurchase program. In addition, we completed a significant restructuring program in anticipation of the LOEs we are facing in 2018 and 2019.","Finally, based on the strength of our top and bottom line results, which were ahead of expectations, and retaining Restasis longer than originally expected, we are increasing our full year 2018 guidance for revenue and non-GAAP performance net income per share.","Turning to our performance drivers on slide seven illustrates the strength of our core business which now represents nearly 90% of our total revenues. Our promoted brands with ongoing exclusivity and other established products from the core of our business. If you exclude the impact of M&A and foreign exchange, the core business grew an impressive 9% this quarter versus prior year. This helped offset the impact of several anticipated LOEs and the outlook remains very bright. We have one of the most durable product portfolios in the industry and our pipeline successes have the potential to provide several major new product launches over the next couple of years.","In total, we delivered 2.3% growth in Q2, or 1.8% when excluding the favorable impact of foreign exchange. Performance net income per share grew 10% driven by lower operating expenses, lower net interest expenses and lower share count.","The results from this quarter demonstrate again that we are delivering on our strategy of Therapeutic area leadership and reinforce our confidence in 2018 and our long-term revenue outlook from our current portfolio of businesses. Overall, we are very pleased with the performance and remain excited about our future.","Now let me turn the call over to Bill.","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Thanks, Brent, and good morning. Slide nine (08:26-08:31) terms of sales growth versus prior year. We had a very solid quarter with double digit sales growth for most of our major products in our four main businesses. As Brent mentioned, sales for our 10 key products increased 10% or more versus prior year. Botox, Vraylar, CoolSculpting, Juvederm and Linzess are at the top of the list and were standouts in the quarter.","The core business is in a strong position as we enter the second half of 2018. As expected, this quarter total sales growth was impacted by generic competition for several products as you can see at the bottom of the graph.","Turning to slide 10, we had a very strong quarter in all three areas of Medical Aesthetics, including facial, body contouring and plastics and regenerative medicine. As anticipated, sales levels and growth rates for Botox Cosmetic and Juvederm accelerated from the first quarter. The growth rate for Botox was 13% and for Juvederm was 11%. Both products have been on a solid growth trajectory and the outlook for the second half of the year, domestically and internationally, is excellent. We'll talk in more detail about our plans for both products at our Medical Aesthetics Analyst Meeting in September.","In terms of CoolSculpting, sales were up 36% versus prior year or up 11% on a pro forma basis. The year-over-year comparison here is being impacted by higher sales associated with the 2017 launch of a new applicator. U.S. consumable sales, which is the best measure of the health of this business grew 19% and U.S. system sales excluding applicators grew 21%, both on a pro forma basis. U.S. system placements for the third consecutive quarter were strong and reached an all-time high of 349, laying the foundation for sustained consumable growth. Our investments in an expanded field force and national and local advertising initiatives are producing solid returns.","International growth was impacted by ongoing restructuring activities. We expect growth to accelerate in the second half of the year. Overall the prospects for this business are very positive.","In plastics and regenerative medicine, Alloderm, our tissue matrix for breast reconstruction, continues to exceed expectations. Alloderm sales were up 26%. This product is becoming par the standard of care in reconstructive surgeries.","Sales for our breast implants were up 12% despite the reentry of a competitive product in the market. The strength in this business is a function of our new Inspira implant launch, synergies with our Alloderm business and high-quality, reliable supply.","Turning to slide 11, the prospects for our CNS franchise are excellent. Today this business is led by the strength of Botox Therapeutics on the neurology side and Vraylar on the psychiatry side. Let's take a look at Vraylar.","It continues to exceed expectations and is the fastest growing brand of atypical antipsychotic on the market. Vraylar's prescription volume grew almost 20% versus the prior quarter and 72% versus the prior year. Since we initiated DTC advertising in February, new patient starts were up 60% which is above expectations and constitutes one of the most successful DTC campaigns we've launched at Allergan.","We're preparing for the launch of the bipolar depress indication which is just about one year away. With Botox Therapeutic, we continue to see solid and consistent growth across all indications, migraine specificity NOAB across all channels, office and hospital, and all specialties including neurologists, physiatrists and urologists. At this time Aimovig has had no visible impact on Botox demand. In the quarter, global Botox Therapeutic sales grew 15% versus prior year driven mainly by volume. U.S. sales were up 17% in the quarter, one of our strongest quarters to date and ahead of expectations.","The second half of the year we expect the growth rate for Botox to moderate, but remain at or near double digit level. As we think about the future here, we expect Botox and the CGRPs will coexist in a much larger chronic migraine market. As successful as we've been in this space only 6% of chronic migrainers receive Botox. We project a diagnose and treatment rate for chronic migraine will increase. We expect that the approach to migraine management will evolve to include adjunctive treatment for some patients. This will require research and data and we expect the off label use of medication, such as beta blockers and TCAs and antiepileptics will decrease to the benefit of FDA approved ones such as Botox. Migraine eventually will become one of our largest businesses at Allergan with Botox and our oral CGRPs, ubrogepant and atogepant.","Turning to slide 12. Sales for our Eye Care business were stable in the second quarter. Our glaucoma business had solid international growth which was partially offset by a moderate decline in the United States. Ozurdex for diabetic macular edema posted strong 22% growth in the second quarter. In dry eye, the overall business declined 3% versus prior year with 2% demand growth for Restasis in the United States being more than offset by lower net pricing. Multi-dose preservative-free accounts for 25% of the total brand and is still growing with a targeted field force effort behind it.","In GI, Linzess is the flagship product and it's on its way to $1 billion in sales. The key source of Linzess' growth continues to be dissatisfied OTC patients. We initiated a new DTC campaign which has increased our new patient acquisition rates to an all-time high. Our partnership with Ironwood remains very strong and productive. In addition, both Zenpep and Viberzi contributed positively to the franchise in the quarter.","Turning to slide 13. In international, sales were up 8% excluding foreign currency exchange. Approximately 90% of the growth in our international business comes from five products. Botox Cosmetic and Juvederm were up 14% and 11% respectively. CoolSculpting growth on a pro forma basis was 11% in the quarter, reflecting the efforts we've undertaken to reorganize this business. Sales for Ozurdex continues to grow at a high rate, 28% for the quarter. And Botox Therapeutic sales were up 8%.","Finally, all three regions: Latin America, Canada; Europe; and Asia-Pacific, Middle East, Africa posted strong sales growth. Asia-Pacific, Middle East, Africa is our fastest growing region led by China with growth of 80% this quarter compared to last year. China is on pace to be our largest market internationally. The outlook for our international business continues to be very positive.","Now let me turn the call over to David.","C. David Nicholson - Allergan Plc","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 15, 2018 has been a very productive year-to-date for the Allergan R&D team. The momentum generated in the first quarter continued into the second. As a reminder, earlier in the year we released positive Phase 3 data for cariprazine in bipolar depression and two positive clinical trials with ubrogepant for the treatment of acute migraine. During the second quarter, we announced positive late-stage data on three important clinical programs. We have positive Phase 2b\/3 data for atogepant in the prevention of episodic migraine. Positive data from our first Phase 3 trial for bimatoprost SR, or bim SR for glaucoma, and finally two positive Phase 3 trials for abicipar in AMD for which we presented top-line data last week. We look forward to even more catalysts during the remainder of this year and into 2019 for these programs.","Some of the upcoming highlights include filing cariprazine for bipolar depression with the FDA in the second half of 2018. For ubrogepant we expect to receive safety data from two studies later this year and we expect to file the NDA in the first half of 2019.","Regarding atogepant, we intend to initiate our second Phase 3 study in episodic migraine prevention during the first half of next year and to follow that with a Phase 3 study for atogepant in chronic migraine prevention. For bim SR, we plan to release results from a second Phase 3 trial in the first half of 2019 and we plan to file the NDA in the second half of the year. For, abicipar we plan to file our BLA in the first half of 2019.","Finally, for our NMDA modulators we expect data from our three acute adjunctive MDD studies with rapastinel in the first half of 2019. We announced earlier this week that we received fast track designation from the FDA for our oral NMDA modulator, AGN-241751. We have recently initiated one Phase 2 study and we plan to initiate an additional trial with this compound in the second half of 2018. All in all, it has been a very exciting first half of the year with many more catalysts to look forward to in the second half and into 2019.","Turning to slide 16, we recently announced positive results from the atogepant MD-01 Phase 2b\/3 study in the prevention of episodic migraine. In this trial, atogepant met the primary efficacy endpoint with a statistically significant reduction in monthly migraine or probable migraine days during the three-month treatment regimen across all doses and dose regimens compared with placebo over 12 weeks.","Importantly, atogepant was very well tolerated with no signal of hepatotoxicity as the liver safety profile was similar to placebo. Migraine is underdiagnosed and undertreated with a significant need for new treatment option. These data are an important milestone towards progressing a new oral treatment option for the prevention of this disease and we look forward to continuing our Phase 3 studies in the prevention of chronic and episodic migraine.","Turning to slide 17, and the efficacy data that we recently announced from our first Phase 3 study for bimatoprost SR. Bim SR is our first-in-class, sustained release, biodegradable implant for the reduction of intraocular pressure, IOP, in patients with open-angle glaucoma. Bimatoprost SR is designed to lower IOP for at least four months, freeing patients from daily eye drop regimens. This slide shows that in this first Phase 3 study, bim SR reduced IOP by approximately 30% over the 12-week primary efficacy period, meeting the predefined criteria for non-inferiority to the study comparator timolol. While we cannot claim superiority at four out of six endpoints, both doses of bim SR showed better IOP reduction than the beta blocker.","Importantly, the initial data showed the potential for the vast majority of patients to remain treatment free for one year after their last implant was inserted.","Turning to slide 18, last week we held a conference call to discuss the results of our two positive pivotal Phase 3 trials for abicipar. The results of these trials demonstrated that both the eight-week and the 12-week treatment regimens met the prespecified primary endpoint of non-inferiority to ranibizumab in the proportionate treated patients with stable vision at week 52. In the two trials, over 91% of patients had stable vision on the fixed Q12 dosing regimen that utilized 50% fewer injections than the ranibizumab regimen studied.","While we've not completed our full analysis of the secondary endpoints, evaluations thus far provide further support for the efficacy and duration of effect of abicipar. We look forward to presenting the full data set at an upcoming medical conference.","We plan to meet with the FDA as soon as possible and we plan to file the BLA in the first half of 2019. To be clear, the two completed Phase 3 studies will be the basis for the BLA filing. In the CMC section, we will include the manufacturing process for the formulation used in Phase 3 as well as the process for the further optimized formulation being utilized in our open label safety study, MAPLE. We do not plan to include clinical data from MAPLE in the BLA.","We continue to expect data from MAPLE in the first half of 2019 as we continue to focus on reducing the inflammation rate. We continue to believe that abicipar has a positive benefit\/risk profile and that it has the potential to be the first and only true long-acting VEGF inhibitor to allow all patients to come to a physician's office every 12 weeks following the initial loading doses.","Slide 19 is an overview of the timeline for our key programs through 2020. As you can see on this slide, we have a full late-stage pipeline with many important catalysts over the next few years. All of the programs depicted in this slide remain on track and we are looking forward to additional data readouts from several of these programs later this year.","As Brent mentioned, this late-stage pipeline has the potential to provide several major new product launches over the next couple of years and we look forward to moving these programs forward. As always, I thank my colleagues in R&D for their work and I especially want to thank the patients participated in our clinical trials.","Now I will turn the call over to Matt.","Matthew M. Walsh - Allergan Plc","Thank you, David. Turning to the key highlights of the second quarter results on slide 21, as you heard from Brent and Bill during their remarks, Q2 continued to demonstrate solid year-over-year financial performance across all of our commitments and continues to improve upon the good performance we realized in the first quarter. So here at the halfway point of 2018 we're well positioned to achieve the goals we've set for the year which enables us to reset those goals higher as we'll see when we discuss our revised guidance.","Starting with the upper left quadrant, you can see net revenues in the quarter were $4.1 billion, a 2.3% increase versus prior year and a 1.8% increase excluding the benefit from foreign exchange translation. Consistent with our first quarter, strong performance of the promoted brands with ongoing exclusivity together with other revenues drove 9% core business growth. This figure represents true organic growth, conservatively presented in that it excludes benefit from foreign exchange and the CoolSculpting acquisition which was completed during the second quarter of 2017.","As anticipated, the quarter was impacted by revenue declines in LOE products which, as a group, declined 34% versus prior year, mainly attributed to Namenda XR and Estrace generic entries. In aggregate, LOE revenue performance excluding Restasis was aligned with our expectations and we'll continue to see these period-over-period declines during the remainder of this year, all of which is already incorporated into our guidance.","I believe the most important takeaway from the top left quadrant is that the company overcame a $255 million year-on-year or 6.4% revenue decline in total revenues due to the anticipated LOEs to show net growth even under the most conservative growth measure which is excluding M&A and at constant currency.","In the upper right quadrant, you can see non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 85.4%, a decline of 190 basis points. This decline was due largely to product mix as products such as CoolSculpting, Alloderm, Linzess and Vraylar, which carry lower gross margins, continue to comprise an increasing share of our total revenues. Despite the gross margin declined, adjusted operating margin improved 110 basis points to 48.2% versus 47.1% last year, mainly as a result of lower operating expenses from successful execution of the restructuring program.","As a reminder, we targeted cost reductions of $400 million on an annualized basis as we prepare for the Restasis and other LOEs, and the underlying activities to achieve those savings are now complete and being realized within our reported results.","Looking at the lower left quadrant, second quarter non-GAAP performance net income per share of $4.42 grew 10% versus prior year. In addition to revenue growth and lower operating expenses, net income per share growth was also driven by our activities to return capital to stakeholders which we realized both in the form of lower net interest expense as well as lower share count due to buybacks.","In the lower right quadrant, we look at operating cash flow generation on a last 12-month basis for each ending period which continues to be strong. I want to highlight as I did last quarter that these operating cash flows have no adjustments of any kind. They're taken directly from our GAAP cash flow statement. In the second quarter, operating cash flow was $1.24 billion, which drives our last 12 months operating cash flow to $6.2 billion as of June 30.","As mentioned during our first quarter call, we expected Q2 operating cash flow to be lower than Q1 due to phasing of milestone payments and cash tax payments which impacted this quarter. That said, given our cash flow performance through midyear 2018, we're comfortable increasing our prior guidance of approximately $5 billion in operating cash flow to approximately $5.2 billion. As a footnote to this slide, we've provided more detail on the movements in cash and marketable securities in the appendix as well as our anticipated R&D milestone payments.","On slide 22 you can see a more complete look at our key P&L line items for the second quarter as compared to the prior year. I won't go through every line item in detail as we've already covered the highlights, but a couple of things I'd like to touch on. Net interest expense continues to improve as expected due to savings from debt pay-down more than offsetting lower other income which in the prior year period was principally the dividends on the Teva share position.","Our effective tax rate continues to come in slightly higher than our guidance mainly due to delay of Restasis generic entrants. As such, we're updating our non-GAAP effective tax rate guidance which I'll go through in a moment. Not otherwise mentioned on this slide, this quarter the company recognized a GAAP impairment charge of $536 million primarily related to in-process R&D assets and a nonstrategic dermatology asset that is being held for sale.","Turning now to our second quarter performance versus prior year by reporting segment on slide 23, U.S. Specialized Therapeutics revenue growth was strong at 6.5% and continues to be our highest contribution margin segment. Despite downward pressure from lower gross margins mainly from CoolSculpting, contribution margin increased 160 basis points due to cost savings from our restructuring program.","U.S. General Medicine was the segment most impacted by LOEs as reflected by the revenue decline of 7.5%. However, contribution margin remained stable as savings from restructuring initiatives partially offset the impact from lower volumes and product mix shift.","International revenues continued to show robust growth, up 8.1% excluding foreign exchange translation, 10.5% on a reported basis. Contribution margin increased 150 basis points to 55.8%, mainly due to operating leverage on the relatively strong growth in revenues.","Turning to slide 24, you can see on the left side of the slide our capitalization table which continues to show improvement in our debt and gross leverage position and on the right-hand side you can see our disciplined actions taken towards capital deployment and return of capital to stakeholders.","This quarter we completed the sale of Teva shares and redirected these proceeds to debt reduction. We ended the quarter with total debt of $25.4 billion after paying down $1.04 billion raising our total debt reduction this year to $4.7 billion.","Our gross and net leverage ratios are down to 3.1 times and 2.9 times, respectively, as of June 30, in line with our target for the year, which takes into account the pending loss of EBITDA contribution from the anticipated Restasis loss of exclusivity. We'll continue to align our overall level of debt and key debt ratios with our business model and in accordance with our commitment to maintaining an investment grade credit rating.","On share buybacks, we started the year with a $2 billion authorization, which we originally planned to execute ratably throughout 2018. Given where the stock was trading earlier in the year we accelerated substantial completion of the buyback into the first quarter and our board has just recently authorized a new $2 billion share buyback program which we expect to deploy over the next 12 months.","Our capital allocation priorities continue as stated previously. First, reinvestment in our business for growth in our four key therapeutic areas where we have competitive advantages and scale; second, debt reduction to maintain our investment grade credit rate and offset the otherwise leverage increasing impact of the anticipated Restasis loss of exclusivity. Third, funding the current dividend and prudently growing that dividend annually. And fourth, share buybacks to manage dilution created by long-term equity-based incentive plans as well as potential earnings dilution from asset divestitures that we may complete.","Moving now to slide 25 on our updated guidance. Given the favorable performance in our business which we've just reviewed, second quarter results ahead of our expectations and no Restasis generic entries so far in the month of July, we're raising our full year guidance for both revenues and non-GAAP performance net income per share as well as for cash flow from operations. So starting with net revenues, we're raising our full year outlook, and now expect 2018 net revenues to be between $15.45 billion to $15.6 billion, a $300 million increase at the bottom and a $250 million increase at the top of the range compared to prior guidance.","This increase reflects our assumption of Restasis generic entry between August 1 and October 1 of 2018.","Our updated revenue guidance also reflects the better than expected revenues we realized in the second quarter broadly across the business. We continue to expect non-GAAP gross margins for the full year to be between 85.5% and 86%, based on our product mix and LOE assumptions.","As noted in the first quarter financial highlights, for any sustained benefit of incremental Restasis revenues from delayed generic entrants versus our prior expectations, we would look at opportunities to reinvest a portion of these proceeds back into the business and our R&D pipeline. Therefore, we're increasing our SG&A guidance by approximately $100 million to now approximately $4.35 billion, and our R&D spend by approximately $50 million to now an approximate $1.55 billion.","That said, we continue to expect non-GAAP performance net income per share growth in FY 2019 over FY 2017, which reinforces statements we've made previously. In addition, with the continued benefit of Restasis we have experienced and the potential for any incremental benefit that we've guided for, we now expect our full year non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 14.5%.","We now expect full year 2018 non-GAAP performance net income per share to be in the range of $16 to $16.50 as compared to prior guidance. We also expect our reported cash flow from operations for 2018 to now be approximately $5.2 billion reflecting the following: generic Restasis entrants between August 1 and October 1 of 2018, success-based milestones from existing pipeline projects of approximately $550 million in 2018, and restructuring in other M&A integration payments in the range of approximately $225 million.","As mentioned last quarter, since this is an unusual year given the timing of generic entry for Restasis we will continue to provide preliminary quarterly guidance on a temporary basis. We will, however, return to our standard practice of providing annual guidance. That said, for the third quarter we expect total reported net revenue to be between $3.75 billion and $3.9 billion and non-GAAP performance net income per share between $3.80 and $4.10.","With that, I'll turn the call back to Brent.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yes. Thanks, Matt. In closing, it has been a busy first half in 2018 for Allergan and our list of accomplishments is long. We have driven strong growth of our core business, exceeded our top and bottom-line performance expectations, achieved important milestones for five key R&D programs, reduced our cost base, paid down debt, completed our share repurchase program, and continued to raise our 2018 guidance. Our strategy is working and we are executing well. Our future is bright.","Now we'll take questions, and please limit yourself to one question. Arrow?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. . Our first question comes from the line of Ronny Gal from Bernstein. Your line is open.","Aharon Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning, everybody, and congratulations on the nice quarter. Just want to ask a couple of questions on rapastinel, so one topic, couple of small questions. First, I noticed you started a trial in MDD as a single agent. Can you comment on this and what drove you to do it before you see the results of the short-term trials? You got an injectable, injection to the vein here for a trial. Does that actually make sense as a single agent MDD? And so far, are you seeing any psychotomimetic effects on this drug or do you have still the potential in your minds to see this as a product without scheduling? Thank you.","C. David Nicholson - Allergan Plc","Yeah, thanks, Ronny. Great questions. So as you know, we're studying rapastinel in three short-term studies as adjunctive therapy to existing antidepressants in patients who have responded insufficiently to the standard treatment. In addition to those studies, we also wanted to look at this NMDA modulator as monotherapy in all comers in MDD in patients who may well respond to existing anti-depressant therapy, but who have the need for a fast acting antidepressant. So we wanted to look at it also as a monotherapy agent because of course, there's a big need for fast acting antidepressants in addition to agents who can reduce suicidality, because we're also looking at rapastinel in a suicidality study.","Regarding psychotomimetic effects, neither in animals nor so far in clinical trials have we seen ketamine-like psychosis or hallucinations. The animal studies we performed looked clean, so at the moment we have no reason to expect scheduling.","Aharon Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Next question, Arrow?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Maris from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","David Maris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. During the quarter, a couple shareholders suggested that the role of the CEO and Chairman be separated and I'm sure that company then went out to other shareholders to get feedback and then also spoke to the board about it. Can you give us some insight into what the feedback is and what the positives and negatives are from your standpoint? And again, mostly what you're hearing from investors about the separation of the roles as well as a board refresh. Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah, so thanks for the question, David. Let me start by just saying that board leadership is a decision for the Board of Directors. Our board is committed to strong corporate governance and has determined that the current structure, which is a combined Chairman, CEO role with Chris Coughlin as the strong independent director with significant duties and responsibilities, provides the right independence, oversight and leadership for our board.","That being said, our board is also highly engaged. Our board is very active in the refreshment process and in fact, as I think you know, we've added four directors in the past 16 months, most recently Tom Freyman who is the recently retired CFO from Abbott joining our board. So I think this is a board that's focused on the right things, on governance, on strategy, on oversight, and they're working hard. So I think we're in a good spot for today but we never rest on our laurels and we're going to continue to work to improve and get stronger over time.","Next question, Arrow?","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you very much for the question, and nice execution this quarter. Brent, on the other issue related to the activist letter about a month or two ago, they were pressing for greater changes than what you announced. You announced that you planned to sell Women's Health and Infectious Diseases, and they claimed that that did not go far enough. What other options do you see on the table that's realistic, or do you believe that those two businesses are the two businesses that make the most sense with respect to disposals right now? Thanks.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah, so our board went through an exhaustive review in that strategic process and we concluded it with the outcome of looking to and beginning the process to divest both Women's Health and Infectious Disease and focus on the four key therapeutic areas that we talked about through the earnings call today.","I think that is our strategy. We believe it's a strong and solid strategy. We are excited about that strategy. And to be fair, I think if you look at the first half of the year, or the two quarters, or the last three quarters, you can see that those four therapeutic areas are performing. They're overcoming and growing through LOEs. They each have strong pipelines sitting behind them to ensure that we have a strong future and launch new products. We have capabilities that go from commercial operation and R&D in each of those four that I think are best-in-class. And most importantly, our customer relationships in those four therapeutic areas, I do think really sets us apart from our competitors.","So we believe in the strategy we have and we look forward to executing against it.","Next question, Arrow?","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Ken Cacciatore from Cowen. Your line is open.","Ken Cacciatore - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks. Just want to ask a question back on abicipar. Clearly a lot of confidence to want to file it ahead of disclosing the secondary endpoints and also disclosing the MAPLE study of the new products. Can you give us a sense of how many patients you've enrolled in MAPLE with the new refined formulation? That'd be great. And then also just to what extent you do know at this point the secondary endpoints. I think you said you're still going through them. But can you give us a sense of what you know that maybe we don't know at this point? Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Sure. David?","C. David Nicholson - Allergan Plc","Yes. Thanks for the question. Look, MAPLE is recruiting well and we absolutely expect to have the data from the MAPLE study in the first half of next year. So we're very confident that we're going to complete it according to the timelines that we've mentioned.","What was your second question?","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","The secondary endpoints.","C. David Nicholson - Allergan Plc","The secondary endpoints, yeah, thanks. Look, the secondary endpoints, we're working our way through them and there's many inter-dependencies between the secondary endpoints. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the secondary endpoints that we're looking at at the moment fully support the primary endpoints, and clearly the primary endpoint that we have is the one that the FDA is looking for to approve a drug like abicipar, so we're very happy with that. Nobody likes presenting data more than me. So as soon as we've got all the secondary efficacy endpoints, we will be explaining them fully at a medical conference. But the data today fully support the primary.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Thanks, Ken. Next question, Arrow?","Operator","Next question from the line of Liav Abraham from Citi. Your line is open.","Liav Abraham - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning. Brent, in your social contract you've talked about limiting the price increases that you take to low to mid-single digits net of rebates on an annual basis going forward. Any change or update to this commitment given the political rhetoric on pricing at the moment? And more broadly, interested in your thoughts on any potential changes that we could see to the current list price and rebating dynamics over the medium term? Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah, so I'll start. Maybe Bill can add some color as well too, Liav. Look, I think we were out front leading the way in terms of pricing discipline with our social contract. And to be clear, our social contract with respect to pricing, because it also talked about access and education and other things like that are important to patients, talked about the cap on a net basis, or I mean on a gross basis being single digit price increases but on a gross basis, really aspiring to be at or around medical inflation. And I think we're doing a very nice job of staying in that 2% plus or minus range on a net basis.","And so, I think we've been a little out front. I don't expect us to see any changes. We've taken our price increases at the beginning of the year. I don't expect we would do any other as per the social contract and the last few years of pricing policy at Allergan are consistent with that.","I think overall I would just mention that my opinion is the days of driving growth through large price increases are coming to an end in our industry. And as I've said for a few years now, the way to drive growth is to have strong product portfolios and new innovations and launch new product and product flow. And so that's the kind of company we've been striving to be for a few years and I think we're growing our way into it. So, I think that is the future for our industry and have thought that for a few years.","Bill, you want to talk about any other pricing pressures or thoughts?","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Yeah, I would just add that, at least as it relates to Allergan, roughly or only 25% of our total business is subject to any government price changes. We are not, whether you look at the second half of 2018 or even into 2019, we're not overly dependent on price appreciation. I mean, for the quarter, it was under 1%. And as I look at formulary coverage levels or formulary coverage rates for our products for 2018 and I already have a line of sight to 2019, I don't expect any adverse events or changes relative to where we are today. And so as it relates to pricing and our product line, it's being well managed this year and I expect the same for 2019.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Great. Arrow, next question?","Operator","Next question from the line of Umer Raffat from Evercore. Your line is open.","Umer Raffat - Evercore ISI","Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question. I wanted to focus a bit on commercial because I haven't heard Bill talk very much yet outside of the last question.","Bill, you mentioned you expect Botox growth to moderate. Can you be a bit more specific? Are you thinking low-single digit or mid-single digits, just so we have a rough ballpark of what you're anticipating on the CGRP dynamic? And again I'm talking Botox Therapeutic in particular.","And then also, there's some anecdotal feedback that some migraine practices, especially the independent ones, don't have good economics on the way Botox economics are structured for them, which is unlike the way it plays out on the aesthetics side. Can you speak to that? And is there anything you guys are doing on that? Thank you.","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Yeah, I think from a 10,000-foot level what you're going to see happen in chronic migraine and in episodic migraine is an increase in the diagnosis and treatment rate. I think you'll see the use of adjunctive treatment more than you've ever seen in migraine because they only had, up until now, really one option. And remember, efficacy rates in this category are roughly 50%. And so if you ask any leading specialist what they think about that, they wonder what about the other 50%? So the concept of combination therapy I think is real.","And the third thing you're going to see is a reduction in the use of off-label medications. And so there's roughly 16 million to 17 million prescriptions written every year in the United States for TCAs, beta blockers and antiepileptics. And with the availability of, of course, a Botox for chronic migraine and now the CGRP's for episodic and chronic, I think that's going to change. This is just going to be a larger market.","As it relates to Botox, we have a very core group of 4,000, 5,000 injectors and a very satisfied group of patients. I don't expect well-treated patients are going to be switched from Botox to a CGRP. If anything, to the extent that health plans permit it, a CGRP could be potentially added but there's really more research and data needed on that front.","In terms of the growth rate, I think on the therapeutic side given the strength of our spasticity business as well as our OAB business, this should be a mid- to high-single digit CAGR story for the next several years. And I think we're going to finish plus 10% for 2018 and we'll have to see how the next several quarters look before we predict what's going to happen 2019. But listen, it's a durable business and as it relates to the economics and the practice, they receive a fee for the product and they receive a procedure fee. And I would say that the economics for specialists that use a great deal of Botox are very acceptable.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Great. Thank you, Umer. Next question, Arrow?","Operator","From the line of Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. For Brent and Matt, can you comment on the progress you're making on the divestiture plans? And as it relates to the prices you would expect to get, can you express any confidence that you will at least get prices or that you hope to get price that are at a minimum accretive to your leverage ratio? Or in some cases would you accept less to simplify the company? Thanks.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah, so let me start, Gregg, and then maybe Matt can add some color as well. First, I think it's really important to note that both Women's Health and Infectious Disease are Allergan businesses today and so we need to operate them as they are our businesses. They're both great businesses. They drive strong revenue, cash flow and earnings as you just mentioned, and we want to ensure that through this process they remain that way. As we mentioned at the conclusion of the strategic review, we have begun a process to divest both of those businesses. Infectious Disease is ahead of Women's Health.","I think that to be fair, there's more activity at this moment with Infectious Disease than Women's Health, largely because there's a larger universe of potential buyers for Infectious Disease than Women's Health and I also believe that it is hard to put a valuation on Women's Health until we know the outcome of the Esmya PDUFA with the FDA, which is just several weeks away at this point. And so I think people are smartly and rightly waiting to see that outcome.","Ultimately, as I said when we announced the sale, it's important that we get the right value for these businesses. There's no fire sale. We're not looking to dump these businesses. As I said, they're strong, good cash flow generating and earnings generating businesses. And so we need to ensure that we get the right price and I think getting a deal that is not dilutive would be difficult but not necessarily an impossible hurdle for us. We'll have to look at how we mitigate that. But that's why price here is so important and getting to the right price for us is critical.","I don't know, Matt, if you want to add any other comments.","Matthew M. Walsh - Allergan Plc","Thanks, Brent. I think in answer to your question, Gregg, I think it's pretty clear in terms of anticipated proceeds that this would be accretive from a leverage ratio position. And then I think Brent said it very well in that can we mitigate the total impact of the earnings dilution from those business units when they go away? And it seems pretty clear at that point that price will be a really key determinant there because it's more likely than not that these become earnings dilutive.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Next question, Arrow?","Operator","Next question from the line of Douglas Tsao from Barclays. Your line is open.","Douglas D. Tsao - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Just, Brent, obviously in the course of the strategic review a lot of the focus was on sort of the businesses that you wanted to stay on. I was just curious if you have engaged in any process to sort of just think about the business performance, which has certainly been quite good on the commercial side and you certainly had your successes from an R&D standpoint, but certainly when we talk to investors, there's some sort of hope for improvements in R&D productivity. And just curious if you've sort of engaged in the process to think about how that might be changed or sort of improved upon. Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah, interesting, Doug. We are always looking at how to improve our R&D productivity. It's in our DNA. It's how we think about the world. And I think that's part of our entire R&D model is to improve on productivity. In fact, as we measure ourselves against some of the external KPIs that exist, we trend very positively in terms of productivity at Allergan. I think, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we just went in the first half of this year seven for seven on late stage readouts, exactly what we had anticipated. So I think that while there's clearly more work to be done on all those programs and no one's declaring victory on them, I think that's a really compelling sign that the R&D organization is working well and being incredibly productive.","Now will all of our R&D programs work? No. And is that true for the industry? Absolutely. But we're always going to continue to push ourselves to get better, to get stronger, to recruit better talent, to improve our processes. David's team is using new and sophisticated ways to recruit patients into trials. And so we're always pushing ourselves to think about productivity and productivity improvements. Next question, Arrow?","Operator","Next question from the line of Randall Stanicky from RBC Capital. Your line is open.","Randall S. Stanicky - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks. Brent, international growth continues to be a strong point for Allergan. Is there an opportunity to further invest behind that strength in terms of either geographic expansion or bolstering current infrastructure in a balance sheet friendly way? And then the add-on to that is the stock continues to recover further and represent a more attractive currency. Does that change the way that you're thinking about M&A and specifically the size of deals that you'll look at? Thanks.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah, on the international front, let me just make a quick comment, and then we'll talk about M&A. And then, Bill, maybe you could add some color. Look, we, I think, have done an amazing job through our international colleagues at growing our business around the world and you see very impressive results like China that Bill mentioned up 80%. We have upgraded talent around the world. We've really worked to invest in our talent around the world. And we've been making investments like buying distributors out for CoolSculpting so we can go direct in several key markets.","What you have seen at Allergan at least since we acquired it, legacy Allergan has been a steady investment in the international business in a balance sheet or P&L friendly way. We have been doing that very quietly and the results I think speak for themselves. But Bill, you want to talk (55:33)?","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Yeah, I would just say, first, we have the infrastructure and the footprint, and I don't think there's an expansion needed on that front. There is a great deal of investment that has been made in the international business over the past two years despite some of the cost cutting initiatives that we've taken in other parts of the business.","In Aesthetics, I would say the biggest change that we'll make over the next 12 months is that the consumer activities for our Aesthetics business internationally will be taken to a new level. And I think that's going to have a very positive impact, especially on our filler business, which I believe at some point in the future is going to be as big as Botox, both domestically and internationally. And then when we look at our pipeline, commercializing our CNS and GI products internationally is going to be a big step forward. But I think the good thing here is we have the infrastructure and footprint. It's just a matter of making certain investments that are specific to those opportunities.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah, so let me quickly touch on the M&A comment. I have always said there's several very important screens as we think about M&A. We are very committed to the stepping stone strategy that we've outlined previously in the past, and we think about those types of deals really along four dimensions. Strategic fit and now with the strategic review complete, we know what four therapeutic areas we want to bolster, either with commercial product, accretive deals and\/or investment in science and R&D. Financial fit, so we always make sure that the metrics make sense after we found something strategically compelling.","We have a commitment to investment grade credit ratings, so we can only take an appropriate amount of leverage that is acceptable with the rating agencies to maintain our investment grade ratings.","And at these levels we would never use stock as a currency. So I think that gives you a sense of the parameters or bookends in which we would do deals, I think, which is fairly consistent with how we've been thinking about deals for the last couple years, and actually executing on deals over the last couple years, whether it be LifeCell, Zeltiq, Elastagen or some of the other technology deals that we've done like Editas or the like. So, next question, operator?","Operator","From the line of Jason Gerberry from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Jason M. Gerberry - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Just one on the bimatoprost SR. Just curious, if you replicate in the second Phase 3 what you saw in the first, do you think that those data are fileable for a one-year benefit? Or would you just envision maybe the market maybe using the product less frequently much like you see with VEGF in the wet AMD market. I guess I'm ultimately wondering how you think about pricing a product like that to capture the full year benefit if in fact it's more anecdotal use and longer durations.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah, so David, you want to take the first part? Maybe Bill can talk about price.","C. David Nicholson - Allergan Plc","Sure. Yeah. So look, the primary endpoint of the U.S. studies was four months after the last implant. And so that's going to be the primary labeling. Clearly we will be discussing with the FDA the longer-term data and hopefully we'll discuss with them what we can get in the overall label. And we will be performing additional clinical trials.","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","And then, Jason, as it relates to pricing, we're going to have to think carefully about what we actually get in terms of an approval from the FDA. The current branded glaucoma eye drops are roughly $5 a day or $150 a month. It's obviously a highly generic market. I think it's a high-class problem to solve if we have a one-year duration of effect. As you know, it solves the number one problem in glaucoma management which is simply compliance with these eye drops which most people don't take and even when they do take it, they don't take them properly and it can chew up the surface of the eye. And so I think if we get past the approval, we'll figure out the pricing strategy moving forward.","But it does have the potential to, in many ways, transform the treatment of glaucoma. Given the results from the study and the drops in IOP, this is a pretty exciting opportunity. We just got to get it approved.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Great. Next question?","Operator","Next question from the line of Louise Chen from Cantor. Your line is open.","Louise Chen - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to get your perspective on your upcoming medical and aesthetics day. Is there anything new or disruptive that we should expect as a takeaway from the event? And what are your main objectives for hosting the event? Thanks.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah, so good question, Louise. Since we want everyone to attend the event we'll leave you with the cliff hanger that yes, we believe it will be an exciting event and we hope that you participate and join us. I think it's September 14, September 14 in New York City. The invitations have gone out.","Look, I think our goal there is to really explain the Allergan portfolio and positioning in medical aesthetics, to talk about the market and marketplace development, the durability of our positioning and franchises, and of course our pipeline and our new approach to interacting with customers and consumer campaigns.","I think at the end of the day we hope that people would walk away from the Medical Aesthetics Day not just reassured but excited about the market and our position within the market because we are excited about those things.","Next question?","Operator","Next question from the line of Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just one very specific question on the financials. There was an in-process R&D impairment of $276 million in the quarter and it was mentioned in the release that it was due to decreased market opportunity for an Eye Care product. Can you just comment on that? Is that abicipar where your expectation has changed? Or is it some other product that has driven that impairment?","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","That was our Pilo\/Oxy program and the impairment was related to the size of the market opportunity that we think is available. We were originally anticipating that to be a global program. We now think it's pretty much a U.S. program. So we've reduced the scope of that project and the impairment followed.","Next question, Arrow?","Operator","From the line of Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks so much for the question. On the oral NMDA, when we can expect data from these Phase 2 programs that you're starting? And how should we think about that development program and the settings that you're going to study the product relative to rapastinel? Thank you very much.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah, thanks, Chris. David?","C. David Nicholson - Allergan Plc","Yeah, so we started the first Phase 2 trial just a few weeks ago. It's recruiting well and so as with any clinical trial, it's a little bit crystal ball when results will be available but obviously we will make them available as soon as possible. It is a relatively short-term MDD study. Yeah, so ...","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Go ahead, Bill.","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","As it relates to rapastinel, I'd think about it this way: An oral form assuming the same benefit\/risk profile is going to appeal to an even larger group of psychiatrists and potentially primary care physicians and patients than an IV will. And I think when we think about the oral, David and I have ideas about additional indications that extend beyond major depressive disorder and I think it could turn into a truly mainstream antidepressant. And it makes a great concept in rapastinel even better. That's how I'd think about it, Chris.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Operator, next question?","Operator","Next question from the line of David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes, thanks very much. So my question is about formulary management prospects. Could you comment on whether there's an opportunity for Botox migraine to be positioned ahead of CGRPs on the formularies in the near term from a prior authorization standpoint? And also, if you could just offer up any framework for how we should think about opportunities and headwinds for January 2019 formulary changes, if there are going to be any for any key Allergan therapeutic franchises in the U.S.? Thank you.","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Yeah, David, I think technically today Botox is probably positioned before the CGRPs, or at least Aimovig, which doesn't have coverage right now and is I think in large part being marketed based on free samples. My view on this is health plans should open up this entire area of migraine. I think that it was a good signal that the system still works to see that Aimovig secured coverage to be fair at ESI. I think that Botox and the CGRPs should co-exist. They work differently. As I mentioned earlier, efficacy rates in migraine are 50%. They're not 100%. And some plans may determine that Botox is more economical and could put it in front of the CGRPs.","I'd rather see this class just be maintained in a more open \u2013 in an open way, even if there are some restrictions related to generic first or even some specialty certification. And I think that'll be better for all the companies and Botox can thrive even with the availability of products for chronic migraine. And as it relates to headwinds on formulary coverage for our products, I don't see anything in 2019 on our flagship products, you could start with Linzess and Vraylar, Lo Loestrin among others, that is going to change over the next 12 months. I think it looks very, very good. We have a good handle on where we are, and we have a good handle on where our discount rates are going too.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Great. Arrow, next question?","Operator","Next question from the line of David Amsellem from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","David A. Amsellem - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thanks. Just wanted to come back to abisipar and just get your thoughts on the commercial strategy here in light of the inflammation that you saw and in light of potential market changes such as biosimilars on Lucentis down the road. I'm just trying to get an understanding, a better understanding from you as to why you remain so bullish on the product, given that there seems to be an issue with inflammation and given that the market dynamics may evolve over the next several years as it relates to biosimilars. Thanks.","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Okay. Good. I'd make first two points. First, abisipar with 90% vision maintenance and 15% inflammation is a marketable product. This is a switch category, 25% to 30% of people either don't respond or switch from one anti-VEGF to another anti-VEGF and you see that with Eylea and Lucentis. Abisipar with 90% vision maintenance and an inflammation rate that's 1% or 2% or 3%, is not just marketable, but it could become a blockbuster of the standard of care. That's really what we're dealing with right now.","I think over the next several years you'll see the market bifurcate and there are going to be true 12-week anti-VEGF type options on one side and on the other side you're going to have biosimilars or a product like Avastin, which is essentially a biosimilar today, and then the other products are going to be caught in the middle. And if we can get abicipar in the current form approved or get abicipar approved with the new formulation, I think it's going to make a big difference in the hands of retina specialists who are managing the condition.","Think about what Eylea did with a four-week advantage over Lucentis and Avastin. Avastin is $50 a dose and Eylea is roughly $2,000. With a four-week advantage, it's become a pretty significant treatment option for retina specialists and does, I think, north of $3 billion in sales. And so we have some work to do here. We'd much rather have the inflammation rate trading in the 1%, 2% or 3% range. It's not right now. If we go out with the 15%, we'll characterize it as best we can so retina specialists can predict it and manage it and it's going to have a role in the management of AMD and I think most retina specialists would agree with that.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Next question, Arrow?","Operator","From the line of Annabel Samimy from Stifel. Your line is open.","Annabel Eva Samimy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. We haven't heard much about gastroenterology and it's a core franchise that essentially has really only one clear growth driver. So the question is, what are some of the plans you have to make this a premier franchise if it's core given the riskier pipeline or longer runway to the IBD product, which essentially would enter an active commercial and development market? Thanks.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah, so good question. Bill certainly can add some color on here. Obviously we have Linzess. We saw in the quarter Zenpep and Viberzi also contributing to the growth. And you know, as I think about the pipeline, it's not just brazikumab, it's also relamorelin. And so those two products I think really allow GI to become a significant factor or focus for us in a couple years. And so as the late-stage pipeline today is focused primarily in CNS and Eye Care and Medical Aesthetics, tomorrow the late-stage pipeline will be focused a bit more on GI.","And so we have a nice laddering or cadence to the pipeline and I think the opportunities, which is how you want to see growth from an overall portfolio. So I'm excited about GI. I think we have a great portfolio of products with long patent lives today and growth and then we'll be adding in two really important programs that are both in \u2013 one in Phase 3 and one going into Phase 3.","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Yeah, I would just add that, listen, one thing to remember about Linzess, Zenpep and Viberzi, they're both on solid footing. There's a great deal of durability in those businesses. We're going to have them for a while and I think what Brent said about the pipeline is right. That's where the future is. It's not that far away. And I think relamorelin, given the lack of pro-motility agents in gastroenterology is probably one of the more underappreciated assets that we have, assuming approval. And then as it relates to brazikumab, it only makes sense that if we're going to be in gastroenterology we'd be in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. There's a lot of work to do there. Has a great deal of potential, and then, of course, you have cenicriviroc in NASH. And so, it's really a two-part strategy. We have marketed products in pipeline and we just have to be successful in executing the pipeline.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Great. Last question, Arrow?","Operator","Our last question from the line of John Boris from SunTrust. Your line is open.","John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks for taking the question, and congratulations on the results. Just has to do with Botox in particular and the operating plan and the investment that has been made. Significant direct-to-consumer advertising, most notably in males, females in the quarter. Bill, can you just comment on patient capture rate in each of those? Also did the DTC result in an increase in the growth of the overall aesthetic market? Same thing with therapeutic, because I think you were doing some advertisement on the migraine side also. And then just on migraine in particular with Botox, how much poly therapy is co-prescribed with Botox? And can you give some comment as to what's currently used or being co-prescribed with Botox in chronic migraine? Thanks.","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","I'll answer the second question quickly and then double back on the aesthetics question. As relates to Botox, most often it's a triptan which is really for \u2013 I believe it's for \u2013 in the range of 20% or 30%. And it's really for breakthrough. Botox is very effective but no chronic migraine, or prevention agent is going to achieve remission as relates to migraine attacks.","As it relates to the aesthetics side, listen, we are always updating, expanding and investing in sales and marketing in aesthetics, whether it's DTC or digital or customer service or loyalty programs or even our sales force. Our direct-to-consumer campaign has gotten a lot of publicity for Botox. It's actually more focused on women than men but the media cover the male component more than the female component because I guess it's newsworthy.","The return on all of our DTC investments, and Botox is no different, is pretty positive. We usually break even within six months. We see new patient acquisition increases of roughly 20% to 30%. As it relates to Botox, it's still only several weeks old. We have seen a lot more traffic in our Brilliant Distinctions loyalty program where the number is up about 20%. That ultimately has to translate to sales but that's a work in progress.","And we're going to continue to invest in Botox in that way. I would also expect that we'll do a lot more work with Juv\u00e9derm both in the United States and internationally with consumers, which I think could provide nice opportunity in the second half of 2018 into 2019.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Great. So, Arrow, that's our last question. I would just like to close by thanking everyone for participating in the call and thanking our colleagues around the world for a great first half of the year. We're excited about our company and our strategy and our future and we look forward to delivering a strong second half as well. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session.","I will now turn the call over to Daphne Karydas.","Daphne Karydas - Allergan Plc","Thank you, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to the Allergan first quarter 2017 earnings conference call.","Earlier this morning, we issued a press release reporting Allergan earnings from continuing operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The press release and our slide deck which we are presenting this morning are available on our corporate website at www.allergan.com.","We are conducting a live webcast of this call, a replay of which will be available on our website after its conclusion. Please note that today's call is copyrighted material of Allergan and cannot be rebroadcast without the company's express written consent.","Turning to slide 2, I'd also like to remind you that during the course of this call, management will make projections or other forward-looking remarks regarding anticipated future events or the future financial performance of the company. It's important to note that such statements and events are forward-looking and reflect our current perspective of the business trends and information as of today's date. Actual results may differ materially from current expectations and projections depending on a number of factors affecting the Allergan business. These factors are detailed in our periodic public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Also on the call and available during the Q&A are Rob Stewart, our Chief Operating Officer, and Bob Bailey, our Chief Legal Officer.","With that, I will turn the call over to Brent.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Good morning, everyone. Thank you, Daphne. We're very excited and happy to have you on this end of the call for this quarter and excited about having you leading our Investor Relations and Corporate Strategy functions. Welcome.","2017 is all about execution. We are well positioned to deliver compelling growth through effective execution in this pivotal year. So why do we call 2017 a pivotal year? Whereas 2016 was a year of transformation for Allergan, 2017 is the first full year of operating as a dedicated branded biopharma company, and it is pivotal for setting the foundation for sustained high performance and strong shareholder return.","In 2017, we are focused on driving revenue growth despite the impact from generic entries on some key products. In 2017 we are expanding Medical Aesthetics into regenerative medicine and body sculpting through the accretive acquisitions of LifeCell and ZELTIQ. 2017 is the first full year of significant direct competition to RESTASIS, one of our major growth drivers. And six months into that launch, we are in a strong position and back on offense with two of our own product launches.","2017 is a big launch year. We have 11 launches that we think could combine to generate up to $5 billion in peak sales, including VRAYLAR, VIBERZI, KYBELLA, and two novel devices, TrueTear for dry eye and XEN for glaucoma, in diseases traditionally dominated by medicines.","2017 is a year that our teams will advance each of our six stars into Phase 3. In 2017, we will extend our R&D into adjacencies like NASH, Parkinson's disease, and gene therapy for blindness and other eye conditions. In 2017, we will finish the accelerated stock repurchase program. And as you know, we have already paid our first-ever dividend on our ordinary shares.","And then 2017 is our first full year operating under a social contract in a world of intense pricing scrutiny. I'm very confident in the team we have assembled at all levels of our company. I know we can do all those things and do them exceedingly well. Our ability to perform well in 2017 will set the foundation for success in 2018, 2019, and beyond. That is why 2017 is a pivotal year for our company.","Turning to slide 6, we are out of the gate with a solid first quarter. Revenues were up 5%, right on track with our plan, with great performance from Medical Aesthetics, Eye Care, Women's Health, CNS, partially offset by continued erosion of NAMENDA XR and generic entries for ASACOL HD and MINASTRIN. In addition, as anticipated, this quarter was negatively impacted by year-over-year trade buying patterns.","Gross margins remain above 87% due to product mix and efforts we undertook in the quarter to buy back some royalty streams from partners. While operating margin was lower due to our seasonally lower sales in Q1 and investment in R&D and sales and marketing, we expect the operating margin to improve as revenue grows during the remainder of the year. In the first quarter, the increased operating spend and higher tax rate were offset by share count reduction, netting out to double-digit increase in performance net income per share.","We're very proud to see the R&D pipeline is really humming. Key programs like atogepant and rapastinel are rolling ahead of plan, and we completed Phase 3 enrollment of abicipar for AMD. We have started screening patients in the CVC [cenicriviroc] Phase 3 trial and announced a collaboration to study CVC in combination with Novartis's FXR inhibitor for NASH. We announced very robust data from ESMYA's second pivotal U.S. trial, and plan to file in the second half this year. BOTOX depression data was encouraging, and David will touch on that during his remarks. Sarecycline met its endpoint in its second pivotal trial. And we have added more high science projects to our pipeline with deals like CRISPR technology for eye diseases.","We also closed LifeCell in early February and ZELTIQ on April 28, just in time for the Aesthetic Plastic Surgery meeting in San Diego. I attended this meeting and had an opportunity to meet with many of the top plastic surgeons from around the world. We used this event as an opportunity to announce the CoolSculpting acquisition to our customers with an expanding and commanding presence.","Our colleagues from Allergan and our new colleagues from LifeCell and ZELTIQ worked in tandem to drive home the message that Allergan is the go-to company in the medical aesthetics and regenerative medicine world. We were the talk of the show with this very important customer base, and we are all-in when it comes to fueling growth and innovation in medical aesthetics. There's a long runway for this business, and we want to be the face of medical aesthetics and regenerative medicine.","In closing, we had a solid quarter and are off to a good start in this pivotal year.","Now let me hand the call over to Bill.","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Thanks, Brent, and good morning, everyone.","Turning to slide 8, this quarter we had solid commercial performance. reflecting the underlying durability of our business. Revenue was up 5%. Our top products, which account for approximately 75% of our sales, were up 13% versus prior year, based mostly on volume. Formulary coverage this year is strong across the entire portfolio.","In 2017, we have four key themes. First, we're fueling the growth of medical aesthetics with the addition of ALLODERM and CoolSculpting. Next, we're focused on maintaining Eye Care leadership with RESTASIS and new product introductions. Third, we're driving new product launches in GI and CNS. And finally, we expect to grow our international business at double-digit rates.","Turning to slide 9, you can see the key themes reflected in our growth this quarter. Overall, this is a high-quality and balanced portfolio. In Medical Aesthetics, sales were driven by BOTOX Cosmetic, up 14%, and our JUV\u00c9DERM collection of fillers, up 20%. In Eye Care, RESTASIS showed durability with an increase of $9 million, up 3% versus prior year. Collectively, our new products, VRAYLAR, NAMZARIC, KYBELLA, and VIBERZI, contributed $92 million to net revenue growth. Growth was partially offset by sales erosion from NAMENDA XR and loss of exclusivity, mainly from ASACOL HD and MINASTRIN.","Turning to slide 10, with the acquisitions of LifeCell and ZELTIQ, Medical Aesthetics is our largest and fastest growing business. What we have here today is the broadest and deepest product line in one of the hottest areas in all of healthcare, and it's built on three pillars, facial aesthetics, plastics and regenerative medicine, and body contouring.","In Q1, Medical Aesthetics grew 26% excluding foreign exchange, including two months of LifeCell. And now with the addition of ZELTIQ, we expect it to be one of the fastest-growing areas of our business in 2017 and beyond.","As you can see on the slide, consumer penetration rates are low, 16% in facial aesthetics, 17% in plastics and regenerative medicine, and 5% in body contouring. We're really just scratching the surface here. Attitudes toward aesthetics are changing, and there are two trends driving market expansion. The first is a youth movement, with the 20 to 30-year-old segment expanding rapidly. The second is a male movement, with more interest by men in aesthetic procedures, and we expect these trends to accelerate over time.","On facial aesthetics, we launched two new JUV\u00c9DERM collection fillers in the past year for the mid to low face: VOLBELLA, a lip enhancer; and VOLLURE for moderate to severe wrinkles and folds. We now have the broadest and most comprehensive line of fillers of any aesthetics company.","KYBELLA continues to be a work in progress as we focus on developing the market through three activities: training more injectors; shifting to a procedure sell; and co-positioning with CoolMini. We expect KYBELLA will be a bigger contributor over time. The addition of ALLODERM has fueled the positive momentum in breast implants. This new combined platform, consisting of regenerative medicines and plastics, is exceeding our expectations.","And regarding body contouring, we're getting very positive feedback from our customers on CoolSculpting. They love the technology, and we see significant opportunities for revenue synergies with our facial aesthetics business.","Turning to Eye Care on slide 11, let's start with dry eye. In the first quarter, RESTASIS has proven again to be a durable business even in the face of a new entrant. The market is approximately 25% larger today than it was a year ago, and we've maintained a leading position with more than 75% share. After just one month of promotion, RESTASIS MDPF accounts for approximately 10% of new RESTASIS prescriptions, and roughly half of these prescriptions were for patients new to RESTASIS. TrueTear, which is approved and is a handheld device that produces a natural tear on demand, which includes all three layers of the tear film, we believe TrueTear is highly complementary to RESTASIS. This launch will be rolled out in stages between now and 2018.","Turning to slide 12, no company offers as many treatment options for glaucoma patients as Allergan. The XEN Gel Stent, which launched in the U.S. in Q1, is the first step to transforming our glaucoma product line. XEN provides significant IOP reductions and can be used with or without cataract surgery, an advantage over other options. Because it's a surgical procedure, the adoption curve for XEN is different than for traditional pharmaceuticals. We're making an investment in training and reimbursement this year, and we expect to see significantly more sales in 2018 and beyond. In retina, OZURDEX continues its strong growth in the U.S. at 16%, and outside the U.S. at 29%, excluding exchange.","Turning to our launch products in CNS on slide 13, demand for VRAYLAR remains strong and above expectations. It's currently the fastest-growing atypical antipsychotic on the market. Outlook for the product is excellent. VRAYLAR has a long patent life to 2029, and we see potential for several high-value future indications which we believe will be sales accelerators. We're expecting to roll out a consumer campaign targeted at the bipolar mania audience in the middle of the year.","With NAMZARIC, sales are primarily coming from an increased use of combination therapy by neurologists, with patients transitioning from monotherapy ARICEPT to NAMZARIC, which is the largest part of the market. At the current rate, we expect NAMZARIC to be annualizing at approximately 30% of the NAMENDA franchise by the end of 2017. We have good formulary coverage for the balance of the year, and we expect it to be strong as we look ahead to 2018.","Turning to GI on slide 14, the first quarter was highlighted by the launch of a new 72-microgram dose of LINZESS, which expands the dosing options for physicians and should drive conversion of mild to moderate OTC users. The new low dose is off to a strong start, with approximately 70% of patients new to LINZESS. Overall prescription demand is up 20% in the quarter. LINZESS sales were up 8% in the quarter, impacted by trade buying patterns.","On VIBERZI, the label was changed and is now contraindicated in patients without a gall bladder. The best way to think about the impact is a one-time step down in demand of approximately 10% to 15%. The outlook here is still positive. IBS-D is a big market. The unmet need is high, and VIBERZI works on multiple dimensions of IBS-D, which no over-the-counter does. And satisfaction rates are high relative to antispasmodics and antidiarrheals. We expect sales trends to begin to normalize in the second half of the year.","Turning to slide 15 and our international business, sales increased 10.5% this quarter, excluding FX. In our international markets, we're seeing operational growth in every single region, with Asia-Pacific and Latin America-Canada each growing at approximately 14% in the quarter. China is our fastest growing country, up 42%, mostly driven by the aesthetics business.","Medical Aesthetics and Eye Care anchor our business internationally. In Medical Aesthetics, the business is powered by BOTOX Cosmetic and our JUV\u00c9DERM collection of fillers, while Eye Care is driven by OZURDEX and OPTIVE, our over-the-counter tear.","Across our business, our continued focus is on execution. We're well positioned, both inside the United States and internationally, to drive volume and market share, to continue making progress on new product launches, and to maintain strong formulary coverage.","With that, I'll turn the call over to David.","C. David Nicholson - Allergan Plc","Thank you, Bill. Good morning, everyone.","Turning to slide 17, in the first quarter and this year, we continue to make great progress in building and delivering Allergan's pipeline to patients. We enhanced our gene therapy pipeline and entered gene editing through an alliance with Editas Medicine to develop five ocular programs, which may include their preclinical lead LCA program.","With our acquisition of LifeCell, we are advancing innovation in regenerative medicine with programs in fat grafting, breast reconstruction, and abdominal wall repair. We're excited to add ZELTIQ technology and their pipeline to our R&D efforts.","Our NASH collaboration with Novartis will combine CVC with an advanced FXR agonist. This collaboration will certainly accelerate our understanding of this combination in NASH.","Now delivering the pipeline. So far this year, we've made significant progress. We've achieved eight major pharma and device approvals, including RHOFADE for rosacea, LINZESS 72-micrograms for IBS-D and CIC, TrueTear for dry eye, and VOLLURE for nasolabial folds. And we submitted seven programs for review by the major regulatory authorities, including VRAYLAR for schizophrenia maintenance, a multi-dose preservative-free formulation of GANFORT for glaucoma in Europe, as well as additional indications for our breast implants and fillers. Together with our partner Amgen, we filed for approval of a biosimilar to HERCEPTIN in the EU.","Turning to slide 18, we are focused on delivering innovation for patients. While we continued to advance all of our programs in development, I'm going to focus on our six stars. In CNS, recruitment in Phase 3 for ubrogepant and Phase 2b for atogepant in migraine is ahead of expectations. We expect to have top line results from both programs in the first half of 2018. We continue to work with the FDA, and if successful, these will be the first oral CGRP antagonists to be approved and available for the treatment of migraine.","Our Phase 3 program for rapastinel is ahead of schedule, and we expect to have top line results for the short-term studies in 2019. As a reminder, rapastinel could be a real game-changer treatment for MDD, a condition that desperately needs innovation.","In Women's Health, following the positive Phase 3 results for ESMYA, we expect to submit an NDA for intermittent treatment of uterine fibroids in the second half of 2017. In Eye Care, we have completed enrollment in both Phase 3 studies for our AMD abicipar program, and we expect to announce top line results from these trials in 2018.","And in GI, we have initiated screening in our Phase 3 program for CVC for NASH, and we are preparing to begin Phase 3 development of relamorelin, our ghrelin agonist for diabetic gastroparesis, in the second half of this year.","Turning to slide 19, we recently announced the results from our Phase 2 study for BOTOX in major depressive disorder [MDD]. The study evaluated the efficacy and safety of a single administration of two different doses of BOTOX, 30 and 50 units, relative to placebo in adult females with MDD. The results compared to placebo are shown on the left side of the slide. The 30-unit dose demonstrated numerically superior efficacy on MADRS total score. We saw placebo-adjusted effects between 3.6 and 4.2, which is consistent with data from clinical trials of SSRIs and SNRIs. Separation from placebo was consistent and observed across multiple other therapeutic measures.","Administration of the 50-unit dose resulted in a very similar reduction in total MADRS as the 30-unit does. However, the difference in score for the 50-unit dose was not greater than that of its own placebo group. It's notoriously difficult in clinical trials in depression to always show a placebo drug difference. For a trial to be fail or negative is a frequent occurrence. Based on this trial, evidence from the physician-sponsored studies, and reports from the field, we feel that depending upon feedback from regulatory authorities, we should continue to investigate our toxin program in depression.","Treatment with BOTOX was very well tolerated, and no new safety signals were identified. Adverse events typically associated with antidepressants, such as sexual dysfunction, metabolic changes, and drug\/drug interactions were not observed in great rates in placebo.","Turning to slide 20, together with our partner, Paratek, we have announced the results from Phase 3 studies of sarecycline, an antibiotic for the potential treatment of moderate to severe acne. Both trials met their 12-week primary efficacy endpoints of acne score and lesion count. The positive results obtained in the Phase 3 trials show sarecycline to be an effective, safe treatment option for patients with moderate to severe acne. Based on these data, we plan to file an NDA with the FDA in the second half of this year.","As I have outlined, we've made significant progress in building and delivering our pipeline. We have many R&D milestones this year, and we are well on our way to delivering. We remain confident that our open science approach delivers real value to patients. As always, I thank our global R&D team for their continued focus in advancing innovation and for their commitment to the work ahead for the patients we serve.","Now I will turn the call over to Tessa. Tessa?","Maria Teresa Hilado - Allergan Plc","Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone.","Turning to our overall results for the first quarter of 2017 on slide 22, in Q1 we delivered solid year-over-year performance. Non-GAAP continuing operations net revenues were $3.57 billion, a 5% increase versus prior year, primarily driven by continued strong growth in key brands, new launches, and the addition of LifeCell. As Bill mentioned, the growth was partially offset by LOEs and NAMENDA XR decline. In addition and as anticipated, sales were negatively impacted year over year by trade buying patterns.","Non-GAAP gross margins for the first quarter remained strong at 87.3%, which included the negative impact from LifeCell lower gross margin and the positive impact from product mix as well as royalty buyouts of certain products during the quarter.","Non-GAAP operating margin was 45.3% in the first quarter of 2017, a decline of 570 basis points versus prior-year period as a result of: one, a lower quarter in sales, as previously mentioned; two, higher R&D investment to support advancements of the pipeline; three, increased sales and marketing investments to continue to support new launches and the addition of LifeCell; and lastly, increased G&A expenses primarily due to the addition of LifeCell. Note that sequentially, G&A declined by $22 million. As we expect sales to increase in the subsequent quarters and SG&A expenses are expected to be lower in the back half of the year, we expect operating margins to improve.","Performance net income per share of $3.35 reflects growth of 12% versus prior year, driven by revenue growth, lower net interest expense and share count reduction, and partially offset by a higher tax rate and lower operating margins. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 13.2% in the quarter.","Cash flow from operations for the first quarter was approximately $723 million. Excluding R&D, asset acquisitions, and restructuring payments, adjusted cash flow from operations remained strong at $1.1 billion. Our GAAP financial metrics and reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP metrics can be found in our earnings release issued this morning and posted on our website.","Turning now to our Q1 performance by segment results on slide 23, U.S. specialized therapeutics revenues were $1.48 billion for the quarter, continuing strong double-digit growth of 14.1% versus the prior-year period, driven by exceptional growth across facial aesthetics of 14% and BOTOX Therapeutic of 13% as well as Eye Care growth of 4%.","In our U.S. general medicine business, first quarter revenues were $1.35 billion, a decline of 7.4% versus prior year. Growth from our key products along with new product launches was more than offset by the losses of exclusivity of ASACOL HD and MINASTRIN, lower NAMENDA XR revenues, as well as year-over-year impact of trade buying patterns.","International first quarter revenues were $737 million, representing 10.5% growth versus prior year excluding FX. Growth was driven mainly by Medical Aesthetics and Eye Care. As Bill mentioned, growth was seen across all the regions.","Looking at segment contribution margin, U.S. specialized therapeutics is the highest margin segment, mainly attributed to strong gross margins. The decline of 250 basis points versus last year was mostly due to the addition of LifeCell, an increase in promotion for KYBELLA and Eye Care and dermatology businesses. U.S. general medicine contribution margin declined this quarter versus prior year due to the decline in revenues, as explained before, and higher promotional spend to support new product launches, partially offset by royalty buyouts. International showed slight improvement in contribution margins from 53.3% to 53.9%, as revenues continued to grow double digits.","Turning to slide 24, we ended the year (sic) [quarter] (27:53) in a strong capital position with total debt of approximately $31.8 billion and a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 3 times. We reduced our total debt by $1 billion in the first quarter and expect to continue to repay our contractual maturities, which will further reduce debt by an additional $5.5 billion over 2017 and 2018. Post first quarter 2017, we paid $500 million in debt ahead of its June maturity schedule.","Turning to slide 25, we are raising our 2017 guidance to primarily reflect the ZELTIQ acquisition. Note that our prior guidance already reflected the addition of LifeCell, which closed on February 1, 2017. We continue to be committed to managing operating expenses as we continue to invest behind the progression of the pipeline and new product launches. With the addition of ZELTIQ as of April 28, 2017, we now expect full-year 2017 branded revenues to be between $15.8 billion to $16 billion, which reflects high single-digit growth versus last year.","Other revenue assumptions remain unchanged such as: one, we continue to expect NAMENDA XR generic competition in early fourth quarter; two, stable revenues of RESTASIS; three, we have not anticipated generic competition for ESTRACE for the remainder of the year; and lastly, our annual guidance reflects a potential negative foreign exchange impact of approximately $100 million.","Our gross margins are expected to remain between 86% to 87%, consistent with our expectation that gross margin will be impacted by product mix, as partner products such as LINZESS and VRAYLAR experience strong growth, the loss of exclusivity in March of MINASTRIN, which is a high-margin product, lower gross margins for LifeCell and ZELTIQ products, and the impact from the royalty buyouts for certain products.","Our updated non-GAAP SG&A guidance of $4.45 billion to $4.55 billion reflects the incremental SG&A from the ZELTIQ acquisition. We expect minimal synergy capture for ZELTIQ this year as we focus on expanding our footprint in body contouring as a third pillar in our Medical Aesthetics business.","We now expect non-GAAP R&D spend of approximately $1.6 billion, an increase versus prior guidance, as we experience faster patient enrollment in ubrogepant and rapastinel as well as expected faster enrollment for CVC, low R&D program attrition rates, and the addition of ZELTIQ R&D. We are encouraged by these developments, and the updated R&D guidance reflects support for our 2017 projects, including important advancements of our six stars. We continue to expect R&D to be fairly evenly spread throughout the year.","Our tax rate for the full year is now anticipated to be approximately 13%.","Net interest expense other of approximately $1.05 billion remains unchanged and will be back-half weighted, as other income in the first two quarters of the year includes dividend income from Teva. In addition, Q2 net interest expense is expected to be higher relative to Q1 as a result of lower cash balances due to acquisitions. Average 2017 share count remains unchanged at approximately 356 million shares and assumes a Q3 or earlier settlement for the ASR.","As a result, we now expect full year 2017 non-GAAP performance net income per share to be in the range of $15.85 to $16.35, reflecting strong double-digit growth in the range of 17% to 21%.","Now given the addition of ZELTIQ in the middle of the quarter, we wanted to also provide you with some perspective for the second quarter of 2017. For the second quarter, we expect total reported revenue of approximately $3.9 billion to $4 billion. We also expect SG&A spend to be somewhat higher in Q2 compared to the remainder of the year due to continued strong promotion of key brands, the addition of ZELTIQ, and the launch of RHOFADE. We are on track for a strong 2017.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Brent for some closing remarks.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Thank you, Tessa.","In closing, we're off to a solid start. I'm proud that we are executing in all areas of our business. Sales are up 5%. Performance net income per share is up 12%. This good financial execution allowed us to increase investment in product promotion, and importantly, it allowed us to increase investment in R&D to accelerate development of our six stars. With the addition of CoolSculpting, we are raising our top line and bottom line expectations for 2017, and we are driving effective execution in this pivotal year for our company.","Melissa, we're now ready to begin the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Chris Schott, JPMorgan.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thanks so much for the questions, just two here. Maybe first, can you just talk a little bit about the IBS competitive landscape for both LINZESS and for VZ [VIBERZI] with incremental investment from one of your competitors, a new player in the market? And maybe a second part of that is with for VZ with the label change, is there any concern that this label change could impact the broader physician view of the product, just given it's not as clean as the profile had been initially?","My second question was just on business development. You've obviously been very active over the last six to nine months or so. But when you look at the current franchises and some of the recent acquisitions and pipeline deals, where do you see the biggest opportunity to continue to build out the portfolio via external transactions at this point? Thanks so much.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Thanks, Chris. Maybe I'll take the BD question and then turn the IBS questions over to Bill. On the BD front, we remain very active and plugged into the global marketplace. I think our strategy essentially is unchanged as we continue to look at stepping-stone transactions to support our current seven therapeutic areas. And I think a good bookend of types of deals are the ones we just recently did, ZELTIQ on one end as an accretive going concern that is a plug-in right into our Medical Aesthetics business, strong strategic logic and accretive, with good revenue synergies for the long term, to doing a deal with Editas for our ability to get into the CRISPR space and gene editing in eye disease. So those are the way we think about business development.","As I look, where we tend to focus are on the big four, which is Medical Aesthetics\/dermatology, Eye Care, CNS, and GI, and that's where we tend to spend most of our time. But we're always interested in women's health, anti-infectives, hospital platform, as well as urology. Bill, do you want to take IBS?","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Yes, I'll start with LINZESS. The first comment I would make, from a pure demand perspective, we had a great quarter, with prescriptions up 20%. If you step back and think about the market and activity by other companies, what I go to is the fact that we have a three-dose product with two indications. We have promotional leadership. I don't think that's going to be challenged. We have formulary coverage that's taken us \u2013 let's face it \u2013 three or four years to develop. And so I see this as a very reliable double-digit sales stream for IBS-C and CIC for the next several years.","Beyond the core indications, as you know, we're developing with Ironwood a delayed-release or colonic formulation of LINZESS, which could be considered a next-generation LINZESS. We still have to do the work, to be fair. And we have a patent till 2026 and maybe beyond, if you look at other patents and formulations. And so this is a great business right now. And we're focused on what we can control, and that is the promotion of the product and the customers. And I don't see anything in the market that's going to disrupt this business. That's one of the advantages of having a leadership position and incumbency.","As it relates to VIBERZI, I think that the past four weeks have been very reassuring. We've seen a rebound in prescriptions. I expect that the growth rate will normalize in the second half of the year. What I'm most encouraged by is that satisfaction rates for VIBERZI for IBS-D are as high as they are for any product that we have. There's going to be a one-time step down in demand, which I talked about during the remarks. It's the only product that works on both aspects of IBS-D, pain and diarrhea. That's an advantage relative to the OTCs. It's a very, very big market, and I think the best opportunity for growth going forward is going to be with the primary care segment, which accounts for 70% of our prescriber base. And so we hit a speed bump, but fundamentally this is still a very, very good business, and should produce meaningful growth in the future. That's how I think about it.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Melissa, next question.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ken Cacciatore, Cowen & Company.","Ken Cacciatore - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning, everyone. Just a question on RESTASIS. Brent, you have the IPR [Inter Partes Review] challenge coming up in December, and I know there's litigation in the federal courts. Can you just update us on the settlements to date, and how you're viewing this challenge going forward? Is there any discussions with others?","And then second question, just wanted to understand the dividend strategy going forward. Can you articulate, or can you give us a sense of when you'll articulate, a growth strategy on the dividend? Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yes, so I'll take the shorter answer first, which is the dividend. We are committed to our dividend and annual increase \u2013 annually increasing our dividend at, obviously, the discretion of our board of directors, but something we're absolutely committed to. And it's year one, and we anticipate an increase next year.","With respect to the RESTASIS IPR and the federal court case, Bob Bailey, our General Counsel, is here. Maybe I'll ask him to just provide a little detail or color on our position, although we believe we are in a strong position here.","Ambrose Robert Douglas Bailey - Allergan Plc","Great, thanks, Brent. So on RESTASIS, we have two matters that are coming up in August. We have the hearing on the IPR, and we also have the trial in the court in Texas. We anticipate decisions in both of those in the November to December timeframe, so just from a timing perspective ,to lay that out there. Any decision on appeal would likely come about a year after that. So we think about a worst-case scenario in the 2019 \u2013 early 2019 timeframe, under a worst-case scenario. We do have, and we continue to have, six issued patents covering the product. We do have confidence in our IP portfolio there, and continue to defend that and assert that in both matters.","Another thing worth noting is that approval of a generic RESTASIS is not a given. The approval pathway has been defined, in part but not in whole, by the FDA. They did issue the bioequivalence guidance a couple of years ago. It does not include specific direction. And to date, there is no specific direction on the testing required to determine whether or not the product meets the seven physiochemical properties that have been identified by the FDA. And so as a result, we recognize that there are multiple shots on goal here, to be able to hold off generic competition.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Anything else, Ken?","Ken Cacciatore - Cowen & Co. LLC","No, thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Great. Melissa, next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin, Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you, just a few questions here. Brent, maybe to you on the margins, if I take the midpoint of your margin guidance this year, I'm getting about \u2013 just a little above 48%, which is down from 50% last year, and some of that too is mix, ZELTIQ is a lower margin business. But also, it's based on increased promotional spend. How should I think about that margin going forward?","And I guess a bigger picture question is, you have seven therapeutic areas, many of which are large primary care focus. And it just seems counterintuitive to have industry-leading margins. And just, if you can explain, should we assume that you can maintain those industry-leading 48%-plus, 50% operating margins? Because I think, when I look at Street models, the Street is assuming that margins continue to improve year after year after year. So if you could address that please, that would be very helpful.","And then secondly, a question for you, Tessa, is on your free cash flow. I think you had said your adjusted cash flow this quarter was $1.1 billion. And if memory serves me right, I think on previous calls, you have talked about $1.5 billion to $2 billion in cash flow every quarter. Was wondering if there are any one-timers. Should we expect a stronger second half in terms of cash flow? But if you could talk about, why the slight shortfall? Thanks very much.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yes, so thank you, Jami. I'll turn, frankly, both questions over to Tessa. But just I would say, with respect to margins and maintaining a capability in primary care, I think arguably, we do the most calls in primary care in our industry. So we have the most productive primary care field force.","Our entire strategy in the United States is predicated in large part on having the ability to do both specialty and primary care, and that's been important for drugs like LINZESS, BYSTOLIC, VIBERZI, and we anticipate other opportunities in our pipeline to leverage that capability. Remember why we can do volume over price is in large part because volume is in primary care, even though adoption in trials generally is in specialty. And so being able to participate in both parts of that market is strategically critical to our business model and future strategy. With respect to the margins themselves, Tessa, do you want to provide some color for Jami?","Maria Teresa Hilado - Allergan Plc","Good morning, Jami. So you're absolutely right. We're posting based on the midpoint of guidance a lower margin at 48%. But you have to note that this year, we obviously added LifeCell and ZELTIQ, which are accretive businesses but posting lower both gross margins and operating margins. And despite that, we've been able to maintain our operating margins at the high of 48%. We did not change our guidance at all from our prior guidance with the exception of adding ZELTIQ in the mix. SG&A over time will create leverage there as sales increase as well. And we're not giving guidance for 2018 obviously, but I would say that we're very pleased with 48%, even despite the fact that we added lower-margin business such as LifeCell and ZELTIQ.","On free cash flow for the quarter, the really main adjustment to that are the three asset acquisitions that we did, which is Editas, Assembly, and LTI, as you know. So if you add that back, that's about $1.1 billion in operating cash flow for the quarter. Note also that Q1 is the lowest revenue quarter, as we noted. And combined with SG&A and R&D being relatively stable throughout the quarters, that really poses lower earnings as well and lower cash flow. From an expectation standpoint, we expect to post operating cash flow \u2013 adjusted operating cash flow of about $1.5 billion to $2 billion in the second half of the year, absent any additional acquisitions, obviously. Does that help, Jami?","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes, it does. Thank you very much.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Great. Next question, Melissa?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Risinger, Morgan Stanley.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much, so I have two questions. First for Brent, could you talk about the latest on U.S. pricing from a Trump administration standpoint, just the latest that you're hearing, any next steps or dialogue with industry leaders that you expect in the near term?","And if you could, also comment on the opportunity for the pharma industry to drive toward point-of-sale rebates to reduce the sticker shock that many U.S. patients experience when they get to the pharmacy. I'm hoping that you could maybe frame for us how you see that playing out over time. Obviously, the payers and PBMs may not be interested in that, but it would certainly be a solution that the pharma industry is already advocating for and that the Trump administration may find as a solution to lower prices for consumers at the point of sale.","And then, Tessa, could you just provide a little bit more color on the second quarter of 2017 outlook sequentially, so specifically, how we should think about the gross margin versus the first quarter that you just reported and the SG&A in the second quarter versus the first quarter? Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","So I think with respect to pricing today, I think \u2013 and I've been saying this I think for over a year \u2013 we have to just get used to the fact that we live in a quick trigger Twitter world today. I know a lot of people got upset with me when I said that President-elect Trump was going to be worse on Twitter than Hillary. I think that's proven out to be correct. He will tweet in the moment, and so we've got to get used to that kind of dialogue.","I think that being said though, the discussion around pricing within the administration and within the industry I think is very rational and level-headed. I think that what you're seeing in the mainstream biopharma industry is a much more focused, disciplined approach to pricing and access to important medicines. And in fact, this morning Sanofi joined the club of companies making a pledge to responsibly price their medicines along with us and companies like Novo Nordisk and AbbVie and J&J and some others. So that group is growing and I'm pleased to see that happening.","I think with respect to the point-of-sale rebate, that is an important issue. I think ultimately in part why the price of medicines gets such a disproportionate share of voice in terms of the cost of healthcare in perspective to hospital care or doctors or diagnostics or the other long-term care is because you have to actually pay for your medicines at the pharmacy counter in order to receive them. And when you have to pay your deductible, particularly in the first quarter, which is the seasonality you see at Allergan and many other pharmaceutical companies, a lot of patients walk away from their prescriptions as a result. And that's not what we want and that's not what's good for any healthcare system.","I think you're seeing a lot of discussion, and we are going to continue to discuss with policymakers even this week how to extend point-of-sale rebates to patients. There are some private solutions that are already underway. Express Scripts recently announced some programs on some medicines to do just that as well.","So my sense, David, is over the course of this year, whether through private market solution or policy intervention, we're going to solve the patient point-of-sale rebate issue and pricing issue, which really will affect potentially positively first quarter next year because we do see such a strong seasonality during the high-deductible season of Q1. So net-net, I we're moving in a constructive positive way and I think the industry is moving in a constructive positive way, so I'm cautiously optimistic on the pricing environment.","Maria Teresa Hilado - Allergan Plc","David, on your question with regards to how to think about the quarter, revenue sequentially will obviously be higher. We've guided you to $3.9 billion to $4 billion. Q1 we posted a little bit north of $3.5 billion, and we explained the reason why.","Gross margin, just to guide you for the second quarter, will be lower than Q1, really largely due to product mix. Two things to note, full quarter for LifeCell, two quarters of ZELTIQ in Q2, which as you know has lower gross margins. And then also note that MINASTRIN, it's the first full quarter of MINASTRIN going generic. As we also mentioned on the script earlier, SG&A will be higher than our other quarters, largely due to promotion of key brands and the launch of RHOFADE. However, operating margins will actually start to trend higher versus Q1, largely because of higher revenue. And then I also mentioned that interest expense will be higher in Q2.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Thanks, Dave.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal, Bernstein.","Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Two, one on just a couple of the generic risks, maybe to Bob. You're modeling ESTRACE for the full year. Can you just give us the basis for this? Obviously, Mylan said on their analyst day that they think they can launch this year. And similar on RESTASIS, historically generics launch on district court decision, not on appeal decision. Can you just give us an idea why you're assuming that in this particular case they will wait for the appeal?","And second, shifting over to the pipeline program, I noticed you've got a very large Phase 2 program for the long-acting anti-CGRP, about 810 patients. But you haven't started a second trial, and you call it a Phase 2. Can you just give us a feel for what is the duration of that plan and why you've done this very large Phase 2 as opposed to a couple of Phase 3 programs? As long as you're doing it, why not do just two big trials and have the drug to come to market earlier?","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Okay. So, Rob Stewart, do you want to answer the ESTRACE?","Robert A. Stewart - Allergan Plc","Sure. Hey, Ronny. With ESTRACE, we've obviously been monitoring what Mylan has said. They did indicate that they were going to launch ESTRACE as well as I think generic ADVAIR and VYTORIN. I don't think any of those have happened yet, so we continue to keep our ear close to the ground on this one. From our standpoint, we have prepared to launch an authorized generic in the event that Mylan does get approval and launch. Our assumption at this point in our forecast is that they are not going to launch this year. I'll just keep it at that. But if they do, we are prepared to launch an authorized generic with them.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","And obviously, if we hear something different, we'll update the market accordingly. I think with respect to the district court versus appellate court launch for a potential generic RESTASIS, Bill, do you just want to just provide a little color?","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Yes, Ronny, happy to comment on that. You're right that there is the potential for a launch at-risk scenario. There are a couple of factors that could mitigate (53:52) against that, the biggest of which is that this is a large product and the significant potential damage exposure, not that that would dissuade some of the generic competitors, but it's certainly a factor. The second factor is that we see injunctions granted pending appeal in the majority of cases involving products of this magnitude where there's a sole product in the market, as we have here.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","And then the third point I would make is someone actually has to get an approved product...","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Correct.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","...which I think provides three points for that rationale on timing.","Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Is it safe to say the settlements you have there's an acceleration clause, so if somebody does launch, you will not get the benefit of a full launch because whoever you settle with will be able to launch at the same time?","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","That's hypothetically how you should think about these things.","Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","And with respect to ubrogepant, do you want to talk about that, David?","C. David Nicholson - Allergan Plc","Sure, happy to. Hi, Ronny. Yes, so CGRPs, obviously we've got two of them, ubrogepant, where we are in the middle of two Phase 3 studies. Now for atogepant, we're running a Phase 2b study because first of all we need to identify the optimal dose, so we set it up as a Phase 2b trial. As you know, the FDA obviously requires two adequate and well-controlled studies. We believe that this Phase 2b\/3 trial, whatever you want to call it, could be one of the two adequate and well-controlled studies that we'd need to get approval depending on how the data pans out, which would mean we would just need to run one additional Phase 3 study once we've identified the right dose. That's our strategy.","Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Got it, thanks.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Thanks, Ronny. Melissa?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Mars (sic) [Maris] (55:45), Wells Fargo.","David Maris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I think I'm from Mars, but it's Maris. So on fillers...","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","You said it, not us.","David Maris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Exactly. So on fillers, it seems to be a really great story. From what we've seen, this is being driven only by a little bit of younger patients or men, but far more from your traditional target market. Does that coincide with what you're seeing in the market? And how penetrated is BOTOX and fillers versus the potential market?","And then separately on abicipar, when in 2018 do you expect having that top line data?","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","So with respect to fillers, I'll ask Bill to provide some color. But as you think about the JUV\u00c9DERM family or collection of fillers we have, which Bill mentioned is the broadest and deepest portfolio of fillers in the industry, the growth there, close to 20% for the quarter, was really high-quality growth across the entire world really. And I think it's one of the \u2013 we talk a lot about BOTOX, but we don't talk as much about the JUV\u00c9DERM family, which is I think really a significant portion of our facial aesthetics portfolio. The demographics are clearly improving. The number of injectors are clearly improving. But, Bill, do you want to add some more color?","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Yes, I think that probably the biggest driver right now is we've been introducing new fillers both in the United States and internationally. It's part of what's called our VYCROSS line of fillers, which is a premium-priced filler. And with those launches, we benefit from two outcomes. One is increased market share. In fact, market share for our filler line in the first quarter was up versus the prior quarter, and we benefit from a higher ASP.","As it relates to just fillers and how the aesthetics community thinks about it, five years ago, 10 years ago, it was about lines and wrinkles. And if you're at any aesthetic conference anywhere in the world, now they're talking about this concept of facial contouring. And so you see that the growth rate in the volume for fillers is actually rivaling that of BOTOX. Internationally, David, our filler volume is as high as it is for BOTOX, and I think that trend is going to continue. And you're right, it's coming from our core user base. The millennial movement I think is a BOTOX phenomenon more than anything else.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","And then, David, do you want to comment on the abicipar trial?","C. David Nicholson - Allergan Plc","Sure, yes. As we just mentioned, we completed enrollment. Readout is one year from now. Last patient, last visit is one year after that patient was recruited into the study. After that, we need to close the database, check it for no GCP [Good Clinical Practice] violations, crunch the numbers. So that takes a few weeks after we've had the last patient and the last visit, which is about a year from now. So readout after we've been through all of that, so sometime in the second half.","David Maris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And then if I can sneak in one follow-up, on biosimilars, can you update us on what's pending and what you expect to be in market in the next, say, two or three years?","C. David Nicholson - Allergan Plc","Yeah, happy to take that. Together with our partner, Amgen, we've got the AVASTIN biosimilar and the HERCEPTIN biosimilar in the works. Clearly, we'll be working with the regulatory authorities to get those biosimilars approved. The actual launch of the biosimilars can only occur once all the patents from the originating companies have expired. So whilst we've got, for instance, AVASTIN submitted and under review, the AVASTIN biosimilar launch cannot be expected until the IP has expired. Does that answer your question?","David Maris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great, thank you very much.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Next question, Melissa?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat, Evercore ISI.","Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC","Hi, thank you so much for taking my question. Perhaps David first, given the history of oral CGRP class with liver tox, I guess my question is, how confident are you that FDA will not require a 90-day continuous dosing study as part of your NDA package? And is that a trial that you may consider doing at your own volition, perhaps?","And then Brent, maybe a higher-level question for you. If we were to enter a phase with very large M&A in the broader industry, how should we be thinking about how Allergan will think through what to do or what not to do, in an environment like that? Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","David, do you want to touch on the oral CGRP?","C. David Nicholson - Allergan Plc","Sure, so we've got two oral CGRPs in development, as everyone is aware, atogepant, which is being dosed chronically for the prophylaxis of migraine. And then we've got ubrogepant, which is for the acute treatment of migraine. The present clinical study with ubrogepant looks at the agent for up to eight migraine attacks a month, and each migraine attack can be treated for two days. So ubrogepant at the moment can be given, in that study, maximally, 16 days a month.","Now, I am as confident as I can be that we have liver-safe compounds. In comparison to the originator molecules, ubrogepant and atogepant are much more potent, so the daily body burden is much less than with the originator molecules. We believe we have an understanding of why the originator molecules were toxic. We have simulations showing the degeneration of chemically reactive intermediates during the metabolism of those originator molecules. Ubrogepant and atogepant have a lower propensity to induce the formation of \u2013 or to have the formation of these reactive intermediates.","If we peel back the onion even more, we do feel we understand the mechanism of the liver toxicity of these reactive intermediates, which seem to be due to attenuation of mitochondrial respiration, as well as modulation of bile salt extrusion pumps. So we really start to understand things. We are of course in discussions with the agency about the package of information that we need for submission for ubrogepant, and we'll sort out whether we need to do more chronic dosing studies or not \u2013 chronic daily dosing studies or not.","Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC","So that's not final then, David?","C. David Nicholson - Allergan Plc","We're in discussions with the agency what package we need, yes.","Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC","Okay.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Just to be fair on where we're at, all development programs are similar in that regard. There's nothing...","C. David Nicholson - Allergan Plc","Oh sure. We're always discussing with the agency precisely what package we need, if that's what you mean, Umer. And we consistently have dialogue with them.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","I wouldn't read into this any different than any other development program, and our interaction with regulators that is fluid and dynamic all the time. That's how you minimize the potential for surprises.","Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC","Right. But the fact that you haven't initiated it today, is it fair to say that that basically implies, as of today, you don't think you need a continuous dosing study?","C. David Nicholson - Allergan Plc","Right.","Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC","Okay.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Okay. I think, with respect to large M&A, it's hard to speculate on the theoretical. I would say that Allergan is in a very strong position today, with no need to do large M&A, with the caveat that we'll always be opportunistic and do what's right for our shareholders. Our focus is on stepping stones and continuing to advance our own strategy.","I think large M&A generally is driven \u2013 good, smart, large M&A is generally driven by strong strategic rationale, and that usually is because you believe the asset is better in your hands. A combination you can do more with. You can grow the business better and gain efficiencies out of the business, or because you have a big gap in your own business that you need to cover for. We don't have a big gap in our business that we need to cover for, so the odds of us doing large M&A, I think, are very low.","Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Marc Goodman at UBS.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning, two questions. First, Brent, can you talk about the OUS business and the infrastructure that you have ,and how you think about building that out internally, and whether you feel like you need to do maybe some small bolt-ons to give you better infrastructure overseas? Obviously, you've got a lot of products to push through, and I'm just wondering if you're maximizing that opportunity right now, and how you think about it?","And then secondly, you all talked about trade buying patterns that were a bunch of one-timers. We're familiar with the change with LINZESS. Can you help us with some of the other products that had some significant changes in the quarter? Thanks.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Sure, and I'll ask Bill to chime in here as well. From my perspective, when you look at our international business, it is one of the consistent shining stars of our growth story, sales up 10.5% excluding FX. And we saw strong growth from every region, anchored by Latin America\/Canada and Asia-Pacific. But also Turkey, Middle East, Africa put up a strong double-digit growth. Western Europe, high single digit, and even growth out of the NESEE [North, East & South East Europe] region, which is traditionally a more difficult area. So this is a good business.","Remember, it's anchored by Medical Aesthetics and Eye Care. In the markets which we compete, we are continuing to make select investments in field force and support for brands and promotion. And R&D continues to invest to get product approval and product flow in these markets. We're always open to bolt-on acquisitions in those markets, to the extent they make strong strategic logic and have strong financial results. But, Bill, any other comments?","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Yes, I don't think, from a geographical footprint, we need to do anything different. We're operating directly in 35 countries. Roughly 12 power over 70% of our business. We expanded our commercial operations in Asia-Pacific and in part in Turkey, Middle East-Africa to support our Medical Aesthetics business. I think as Brent said, Medical Aesthetics and Eye Care will be solid businesses for the next several years. And with our pipeline, I'd expect that gastroenterology and CNS will become much more relevant in the future.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","With respect to gross-to-net, do you want to \u2013 trade buying patterns.","Maria Teresa Hilado - Allergan Plc","So, Marc, we expect that \u2013 we experienced some change of inventory destocking in Q1 of less than one week, which we guided you through last quarter. It was LINZESS, but it was across many of our general medicines products plus glaucoma is where we experienced this destocking.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","I think, operator, we'll take one more question.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert, Deutsche Bank.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks, good morning and welcome, Daphne. David, a couple for you. I'm sorry if I missed it, but can you share the next steps and timeline on the BOTOX depression program. And on the Novartis NASH deal, can you talk to your confidence in your internal FXR? Was this really just a speed play?","And lastly for Bill, can you comment on RESTASIS? I assume it's tracking as you had expected in the face of new competition. And maybe talk about how Part D dynamics in there being better covered there next year play into the equation longer term. Thanks.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","David, do you want to take the first part?","C. David Nicholson - Allergan Plc","Sure. Regarding the Novartis NASH collaboration, yes, this essentially allows us to accelerate our understanding of the potential of the CVC FXR agonist. Please don't read into that deal any decrease in the confidence of our own programs. The IND is open for our lead FXR, and we'll be starting to test the agent in volunteers very soon. So no decrease in confidence in our own programs to accelerate the understanding.","Regarding BOTOX in depression, we need to go and have a discussion with the agency about the data and how they see it. And we also need to finalize our thinking around what part of our toxin program we should move forward with in depression.","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","And as it relates to RESTASIS, I think most of the competitive pressure over the past three quarters roughly has been offset by innovation, market expansion, and our formulary coverage. Just in terms of innovation, we're launching four new products in Eye Care. We of course have MDPF, TrueTear, a new artificial tear and Omega 3 based artificial tear, and then XEN, so we're in a very good position. I think Brent said it well, which is we're back on offense.","As it relates to formulary coverage, roughly 40% of RESTASIS and other dry eye products will run through Medicare Part D, and today we have 95% coverage. Our out-of-pocket cost is probably $1.00 \u2013 $1.50 a day given that coverage and the reversal and rejections are very low. And we don't have a complete line of sight into 2018, but my sense is that once we complete negotiations for Part D, the picture in 2018 is going to look comparable and as good as 2017. And so we're exactly where we want to be as it relates to RESTASIS.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Great. So with that being our last question, I just wanted to again thank our colleagues at Allergan for very strong financial execution, which will allow us to continue to invest in medical innovation and specifically our six star programs. Thank you all for joining us today, and we look forward to keeping you updated as we continue to progress throughout the year. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for joining today's conference call.

With us on today's call are Brent Saunders, our Chairman and CEO; Bill Meury, our Chief Commercial Officer; David Nicholson, our Chief R&D Officer; and Matt Walsh, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available during the Q&A is Bob Bailey, our Chief Legal Officer.","With that, I will turn the call over to Brent.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Thanks, Daphne, and thank you, everyone, for joining our third quarter earnings call this morning. Let's turn to slide 5. As we approach year-end, our business continues to show strong momentum across the board. Our focus on execution is evident in our performance, and we continued to deliver solid results in the third quarter. We remain on track to meet our commitments as we advance our strategy to strengthen our leadership position in our four key therapeutic areas.","Our third quarter performance highlights are strategic focus and the durability of our business. Our Medical Aesthetics business delivered another quarter of double-digit growth. As a global leader in the fast-growing market that is expected to double in the next five to seven years, we see exceptional prospects to continue to grow this business. At our Medical Aesthetics Day in September, we provided further insights into the trends and dynamics that are driving the medical aesthetics market and our business.","In CNS, VRAYLAR and BOTOX Therapeutic continue to be our anchors, each growing at double-digit rates again in the third quarter. And concerning the richness of our CNS pipeline, the long-term outlook for our CNS business is very good.","We continue to demonstrate significant progress in our pipeline with a number of potential key launches over the next three years. This quarter, we sold our medical dermatology assets and acquired Bonti to continue to sharpen our focus. Finally, we continued to generate robust cash flows and maintained a disciplined approach to capital allocation with a strong balance sheet, strategic growth investments and capital returned to our shareholders. We achieved all of this in a quarter where we also experienced some near-term headwinds, some of which were unexpected.","During the third quarter, we recalled OZURDEX in certain international markets. David will go over the details, but importantly, the issue that drove the recall was self-identified and no related safety issues have been reported to date. Patient safety is always our number one priority, and we have already implemented corrective actions. We expect to restart the supply of OZURDEX in the impacted markets before the end of this year.","Unfavorable currency movements, LOEs and ongoing pressure from payers have been felt industry-wide and we are well positioned to effectively manage through them. Given our strong underlying business momentum in each of our core therapeutic areas and our confidence in driving solid sales and earnings growth, we are raising our outlook for full year 2018.","Turning to slide 6. Let me run through our performance this quarter across our four key metrics. First, in the third quarter we continued to drive double-digit growth and strong performance from most of our key promoted brands. Despite the 3% decline in net revenue, driven primarily by our LOEs, we maintained strong operating margins, continued to generate strong cash flow from operations and grew non-GAAP performance net income per share by 2.4%.","Our R&D pipeline also achieved significant milestones during the quarter including the acceptance of the sNDA for cariprazine in bipolar depression, successful completion of two safety studies for ubrogepant, our oral CGRP antagonist for the treatment of acute migraine, which now positions us to file the NDA by the first quarter of 2019, and encouraging Phase 3 results for abicipar and Phase 2b results for brimonidine DDS in geographic atrophy, which were presented at the American Academy of Ophthalmology just last week.","We have also been very disciplined in our capital deployment. We continue to reinvest in the growth of our business where we are seeing compelling opportunities, as demonstrated by our recent Bonti acquisition which closed last week. Bonti is a clinical stage biotech company focused on novel, fast-acting neurotoxin programs and is complementary to BOTOX. We plan to develop this novel toxin as an introductory treatment or for an on-demand use. The addition of Bonti expands the potential of our best-in-class R&D pipeline in Medical Aesthetics.","We also continued our track record of actively managing our debt levels and buying back shares using the proceeds from the sale of our medical dermatology assets. With this strong momentum in the business, and based on our revised expectations for RESTASIS, we are increasing our full-year 2018 guidance for revenue and non-GAAP performance net income per share.","Turning to our performance drivers on slide 7. This chart illustrates the strength of our core business which grew 6% versus prior year or 7.4% excluding foreign exchange. This core business represents nearly 90% of our total revenue and is comprised of our promoted brands with ongoing exclusivity and other established products.","As mentioned earlier, OZURDEX had a negative impact in the performance of our core business this quarter. Excluding this impact, our core business grew an impressive 8.4% excluding FX.","I am proud of what our team has accomplished so far this year and excited about our potential to create more value for patients, employees and shareholders for many years to come.","Now let me turn the call over to Bill.","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Thanks, Brent, and good morning. Slide 9 is a product-level sales analysis for the third quarter ranked in terms of growth versus prior year. We had another very solid quarter with double-digit sales growth for a number of our major products. BOTOX, VRAYLAR, JUV\u00c9DERM, ALLODERM and Lo Loestrin are at the top of the list and were standouts in the quarter. Other key brands including OZURDEX and CoolSculpting experienced trend breaks which I'll discuss shortly. The core business continues to be in a strong, sustainable position as we approach the end of the year. As you can see at the bottom of the graph and as expected, total sales growth was impacted by products already facing loss of exclusivity as well as RESTATSIS sales decline ahead of anticipated generic competition.","Turning to slide 10, our Medical Aesthetics business delivered growth in the third quarter of 12.4% versus prior year. Let me start with Facial Aesthetics which had an impressive 17% growth this quarter. Globally, sales for BOTOX Cosmetic increased 22% versus prior year with strong growth in both the U.S. and international markets of 14% and 33% respectively. International experienced the highest growth in the past two years driven in part by continued sales growth in China and in the Middle East, partly due to timing of shipments. JUV\u00c9DERM sales also increased at a double-digit rate, with the U.S. up 10% and international up 17%.","In the U.S., share was at an all-time high with our premium VYCROSS line. VOLUMA, VOLLURE, VOBELLA contributing to these gains. As we discussed during our Medical Aesthetics Day, both products have been on a solid and sustainable growth trajectory and the global outlook for the business in the next several years is excellent.","CoolSculpting sales increased 2% in the U.S. while declining 3% internationally. In the U.S., consumables grew 10% off of a strong base in the prior year. System placements also continued strong double-digit growth of 13%. However, system revenues declined by 11% due to price discounting which we used to drive system placements. Our CoolSculpting systems base is up approximately 30% in the past year and is approaching 6,000. System placement is key to strong and sustainable consumables growth the future.","International growth was impacted by ongoing integration activities across many of our markets. We expect an acceleration of sales in the fourth quarter bolstered by a relaunch in China. Overall, the prospects for this business continue to be very positive. Plastics and regenerative medicine showed solid 8% growth in the quarter versus prior year. ALLODERM, our tissue matrix for breast reconstruction, continues to exceed expectations with sales up 24%.","Turning to slide 11. Our CNS business is being driven by two cornerstone therapies, VRAYLAR, our atypical anti-psychotic, and BOTOX Therapeutics for migraine and other neurological and movement disorders. VRAYLAR continues to be the fastest growing atypical anti-psychotic brand in the market. Physician and patient experience and satisfaction with this product is very high. We continue to support VRAYLAR with a market leading peer-to-peer promotional program and direct-to-consumer advertising. Quarter-over-quarter demand for VRAYLAR is robust and consistent. With the filing of the bipolar depression indication, we're one step closer towards an important growth catalyst in 2019.","On the right you can see BOTOX Therapeutics on a solid growth trajectory. In the third quarter, global BOTOX Therapeutic sales grew 12% versus prior year driven mainly by volume. Growth is coming from all indications: migraines, spasticity and overactive bladder; across all channels, office and hospital; and all specialties including neurologists, physiatrists and urologists.","I want to take a moment to address the impact of CGRPs on BOTOX migraine. Demand for BOTOX has remained strong despite an additional quarter of promotion for Aimovig and the recently-approved Emgality and AJOVY. We continue to expect BOTOX and the CGRPs will co-exist in a larger chronic migraine market. While the growth rate of BOTOX Therapeutics is likely to moderate, we expect it will remain strong in the mid- to high-single digits. Over the long term, migraine has the potential to be one of the largest businesses at Allergan with BOTOX and our oral CGRPs, ubrogepant and atogepant.","Turning to slide 12, we have a robust franchise in GI. In the third quarter LINZESS sales grew 7%. Demand growth was up 12% but was partially offset by trade buying patterns. Almost seven years into launch, we expect LINZESS demand growth to remain at mid- to high-single digit levels and we anticipate continued strong formulary access into 2019 as well. However, we expect that industry-wide pricing dynamics will negatively impact the net price for LINZESS in the future. As a result, we estimate LINZESS growth in the low- to mid-single-digit range going forward.","ZENPEP and VIBERZI continue to contribute positively to the franchise growth in the quarter and are collectively heading towards $0.5 billion on an annual basis.","On the right, Eye Care performance was significantly impacted this quarter by OZURDEX and a decline in RESTASIS. In dry eye, RESTASIS declined 18% versus prior year due to a lower net price, demand and continued prudent management of trade inventory levels ahead of a potential U.S. generic entry. Our glaucoma business remained stable with solid mid-single-digit growth internationally, partially offset by a moderate decline in the United States.","Turning to slide 13, in international, sales were up 8%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, fueled by strong Medical Aesthetics demand. BOTOX Cosmetic and JUV\u00c9DERM grew 33% and 17% respectively. Also, BOTOX Therapeutic experienced significant growth at 17%. Sales for OZURDEX, however declined 45% which impacted overall international growth by almost 400 basis points in the quarter.","Finally, Asia-Pacific\/Middle East\/Africa continues to be our fastest growing region led by China with growth of 64% this quarter compared to last year. China is on pace to be our largest market internationally. Latin America\/Canada growth was stable versus prior year due to the impact from the OZURDEX recall in Brazil and Canada and the Fibristal label change. Our performance in international this quarter was solid despite OZURDEX and foreign exchange, and the outlook for this business remains excellent.","Now let me turn the call over to David.","C. David Nicholson - Allergan Plc","Thanks, Bill. Good morning everyone. Turning to slide 15. In the third quarter our R&D organization continued to deliver on our key pipeline projects, building upon the success from the first half of the year. We advanced our pipeline across several key therapeutic areas including CNS, Eye Care and Medical Aesthetics. The sNDA for cariprazine for bipolar depression was accepted by the FDA and we have a PDUFA date in May of 2019. This brings us one step closer to being able to offer a new treatment option for patients suffering from bipolar depression.","Turning to ubrogepant, we successfully completed our two safety studies for the treatment of acute migraine. The results support the product's positive efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, positioning us to file an NDA in early 2019.","As previously announced, atogepant, our oral CGRP antagonist for the prophylactic treatment of migraine demonstrated robust efficacy and safety in a Phase 2b\/3 study for the prevention of episodic migraine. As such, we will be initiating Phase 3 studies for both episodic and chronic migraine prevention in the first half of 2019.","We have already initiated the requisite long-term safety study. The potential of our oral CGRP antagonist to offer migraine patients a novel treatment option further strengthens our position in CNS.","Before I move on to the development progress in Eye Care, I would first like to make a few remarks regarding the OZURDEX recall in some international markets. Nothing is more important than patient safety. It guides all that we do at Allergan. The issues that drove the OZURDEX recall were self-identified by our quality assurance group and corrective measures were immediately taken. Importantly, our review has not identified the related safety signal, with nearly 10 years of post-marketing surveillance data. We have met with the European regulators to review the corrective actions and anticipate that we will start to resupply those markets affected during the fourth quarter of this year, with full supply back during the first quarter of 2019.","We continue to make great strides in Eye Care innovation. Last week at the American Academy of Ophthalmology, AAO, we presented data from our Phase 2b BEACON study which evaluated our cytoprotective neuroprotective asset, brimonidine DDS in patients with geographic atrophy. We have identified the path forward based on our compelling Phase 2a and Phase 2b results, moving as a step closer towards developing a potential therapy for this life-changing disease that has no approved treatment options anywhere in the world.","We remain excited about the potential of abicipar as the only fixed, 12-week therapy for neovascular AMD. At AAO, we presented the secondary efficacy endpoints including changes in mean, best corrected visual acuity and central retinal thickness from both Phase 3 studies, SEQUOIA and CEDAR. Those results corroborate the primary endpoint, and we expect to file abicipar with the FDA in the first half of 2019.","We look forward to results from our MAPLE study, examining the safety of a further optimized formulation of abicipar, which are expected in the first half of 2019. Further in Eye Care, bimatoprost SR represents our first-in-class, sustained-release, biodegradable implant for the reduction of IOP in patients with open-angle glaucoma. Earlier this year, we presented topline results from the first Phase 3 study, in which we showed a reduction of IOP by approximately 30% over a 12-week period. These initial data also showed the potential for the majority of patients to remain treatment-free for one year after their last implant was inserted. We expect topline results from the second Phase 3 trial in the first half of 2019, and we expect to file in the U.S. in the second half of next year.","With regards to our NMDA modulators, we expect data from our three acute adjunctive MDD studies with rapastinel in the first half of 2019. As for our oral NMDA modulator, 241751, we initiated a Phase 2 study in the second half of this year.","Finally, at our Medical Aesthetics meeting in September, we provided investors with a deeper look into several of our pipeline assets. We highlighted Phase 2 data for BOTOX Masseter, and we will be initiating a Phase 2B study for this indication next year. In addition, CoolSculpting received submandibular 510(k) clearance this quarter, and we expect CoolSculpting 2.0 for muscle stimulation to obtain 510 clearance and CE mark in the second half of 2019.","As you can see, we have had multiple successes this year. Our pipeline is strong, and 2019 promises to continue to be a very busy and productive year within the R&D organization at Allergan.","Turning to slide 16, we have a table with an overview of the upcoming catalysts for our key programs through 2020. Year-to-date, we have achieved multiple milestones, each of which brings us closer to several potential product launches in 2020 and beyond. We will hold a Type A meeting with the FDA concerning Esmya by the end of this year, and we will keep you updated on our progress.","The programs highlighted in this table remain on track, and we are proud of our achievements year-to-date. We're working hard towards continuing our string of successes into 2019 and beyond. As always, I thank my colleagues in R&D for their hard work, and I especially thank the patients who participate in our clinical trials.","And now I will turn the call over to Matt.","Matthew M. Walsh - Allergan Plc","Thank you, David. Turning now to the key financial highlights. Our third quarter results exceeded the high end of guidance that we provided last quarter, both for revenue and non-GAAP performance net income per share. This was led by the continued delay in generic entrants for RESTASIS, combined with solid performance of our core business.","Besides the impact from LOEs, two smaller issues impacted results in the third quarter, none of which was significant individually. First is OZURDEX and second is foreign exchange translation. The strength of our reported results despite these issues speaks to the overall resiliency of our business today. As such, we're well positioned to achieve the goals we've set for the year, as we'll see shortly when we discuss our improved guidance.","Looking at page 18 and starting with the upper left quadrant, you can see net revenues in the quarter were $3.9 billion, a 3% decline versus prior year. Shown in constant currency, the decline narrows to 1.8%. The core business grew 5.9% year-on-year on a reported basis, 7.4% at constant currency. Normalizing for the impact of OZURDEX on the top line, underlying core business growth was 8.4% during the quarter, which more closely aligns with the good core business growth realized in the second quarter.","LOE products declined 38% year-on-year during the quarter, mainly attributed to NAMENDA XR and ESTRACE generic entrants as well as the significant decline in RESTATSIS. To this group we've now added the divested medical dermatology products and we'll continue to include divested products to this group as asset sales progress.","Turning to the upper right quadrant you can see non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 85.2%, a decline of 90 basis points versus prior year. This decline, driven by-product mix, mirrors what we saw in the first half of the year with the addition this quarter of a 30 basis point impact from the OZURDEX recall. Non-GAAP operating margins remained strong at 48.7% mainly due to lower operating expenses from successful execution of the restructuring program completed early in 2018.","As a result, and as a reminder, our operating margins throughout 2018 year-to-date and versus our expectations for the fiscal year have been running on the high side by approximately 200 basis points because we have had the exclusivity of RESTATSIS while our P&L simultaneously reflects the lower costs achieved by the restructuring undertaken to help offset LOE products including RESTATSIS.","Moving to the lower left quadrant, third quarter non-GAAP performance net income declined 1% versus prior year due to the revenue and gross margin declines just mentioned, partially offset by lower operating expenses and lower net interest expense as we continue to reduce debt. Trending in a positive direction, non-GAAP performance net income per share in the quarter of $4.25 grew 2% versus prior year as a result of lower share count due to buybacks executed over the last year. Included in revenue and non-GAAP performance net income per share for the quarter is the impact of OZURDEX, $32 million and $0.11 respectively, and foreign exchange translation of approximately $50 million and $0.05 respectively.","In the lower right quadrant, we look at operating cash flow generation on a last-12-months basis for each ending period which continues to be strong. I want to highlight, as I did last quarter, that these operating cash flows have no adjustments of any kind and represent the same operating cash flow figures you'll find in our GAAP reported results. In the third quarter operating cash flow was $1.44 billion which drives our last-12-months operating cash flow to $6.2 billion as of September 30. Nine-month results continue to support our full-year guidance of $5.2 billion in operating cash flow which remains unchanged despite the recent acquisition of Bonti for $195 million which closed in the fourth quarter.","As we do every quarter, we have provided more detail on the movements in cash and marketable securities in the appendix as well as our anticipated R&D milestone payments.","On slide 19 you can see a more complete look at our key P&L line items for the third quarter as compared to prior year. I've already covered most of the highlights but a couple of items here I'd like to touch on. Net interest expense continues to improve largely due to lower average debt balances. Our gross debt balance at September 30 is 22% below the year-ago balance sheet. And our effective tax rate, as anticipated, was aligned with last quarter as we continue to see delay of RESTATSIS generic entrants.","Turning now to our third quarter performance versus prior year by reporting segment on slide 20, U.S. Specialized Therapeutics revenue decline of 1.1% was mainly attributed to lower RESTATSIS revenues as well as lower sales of the now-divested medical dermatology business. However, this segment continues to be our highest contribution margin segment and, in fact, contribution margin increased 180 basis points as cost savings from our restructuring program more than offset downward pressure from lower volumes and gross margin.","U.S. General Medicine continues to be the segment most impacted by LOEs as reflected by the revenue decline of 7.8%. Contribution margin declined slightly, 70 basis points, as savings from restructuring initiatives partially offset the impact from lower volumes and product mix shift.","International revenue growth of 1.7% was significantly impacted by foreign exchange translation and OZURDEX. As you can see on the slide, at constant currency, revenue growth was 7.8% versus prior year and 11.8% excluding the impact of the OZURDEX recall. Contribution margin moved in the right direction, rising 40 basis points to 54.7% due to operating leverage.","Turning to slide 21, you can see on the left side of the slide our capitalization table and on the right-hand side, the disciplined actions taken towards capital deployment and return of capital to stakeholders. Three points I'd like to address here. Point number one, we retired approximately $750 million of debt during the third quarter. And the emphasis we're placing on reducing leverage is especially important given the pending generic entrants for RESTASIS.","Point number two. Total debt retired in the third quarter was actually a larger number at $1.8 billion. However, approximately $1 billion of the $1.8 billion is earmarked for a leverage-neutral refinancing that we are in the process of executing as we speak as a normal part of debt portfolio management. As such, we expect to conduct one or more financing transactions in the fourth quarter, subject to market conditions. These issuances, together with any additional repurchases during the fourth quarter, are expected to reduce our outstanding debt on a net basis by at least $750 million, as I just mentioned. And please note, the leverage ratios shown on the left side of the slide have been computed on a pro forma basis to exclude any temporary debt reduction that has happened as part of the leverage-neutral refinancing.","Point number three, last point. In conjunction with prior statements we've made on asset sales, the $550 million in net proceeds from the sale of the medical dermatology assets were immediately deployed to a combination of debt reduction and share buybacks, all of which were completed during the third quarter. The amount allocated to debt reduction is included in the $750 million of debt reduction that I discussed in point one.","As a reminder, our capital allocation priorities as stated previously remain unchanged and I'll reiterate them. First, reinvestment in our business for growth in our four key therapeutic areas. The acquisition of Bonti in Medical Aesthetics is a prime example of our commitment to deploying capital first and foremost to grow the business; second, debt reduction to maintain our investment-grade credit rating and to offset the otherwise leverage-increasing impact of the anticipated RESTASIS loss of exclusivity; third, funding the current dividend and prudently growing that dividend annually; and fourth, share buybacks to manage dilution created by long-term equity-based incentive plans as well as potential earnings dilution from asset divestitures we may complete.","Moving now to slide 22 on our updated guidance, and let's start with net revenues. We're raising our full-year outlook and now expect 2018 net revenues to be between $15.55 billion to $15.7 billion, a $100 million increase at the bottom and top of the range compared to our prior guidance. This increase reflects continued strong performance from our core business, an additional three months of RESTASIS generic entry delay which together more than offset, A, impact in the fourth quarter from OZURDEX and foreign exchange translation, which combined are estimated at approximately $125 million in revenues and approximately $0.30 in non-GAAP performance net income per share; and B, the sale of the medical dermatology assets, which were expected to contribute about $35 million of revenue in the fourth quarter and approximately $0.08 in non-GAAP performance net income per share.","Non-GAAP gross margin for the full year is expected at approximately 85.5%, slightly below our prior guidance of 85.5% to 86% to reflect the impact from product mix and OZURDEX. Our SG&A and R&D expenses remain unchanged versus prior guidance and reflect approximately $150 million increase for the second half of the year for reinvestment of additional profits from the delay of RESTASIS generic competition. Non-GAAP net interest expense, tax rate and share count also remain unchanged versus prior guidance. And moving to the last line of the slide, reflecting the incremental revenue guidance, we are increasing our full-year 2018 non-GAAP performance net income per share to be in the range of $16.20 to $16.60.","Our guidance for 2018 reported cash flow from operations remains at approximately $5.2 billion and that reflects, one, generic RESTASIS entrants between November 1 and January 1 of 2019, restructuring and other M&A integration payments in the range of approximately $225 million as previously stated, and finally, success-based milestones from existing pipeline projects of approximately $735 million in 2018, which now includes the payment of $195 million for the acquisition of Bonti in Q4.","And with that, I'll turn the call back to Brent.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Thank you, Matt. Allergan's performance in the third quarter and so far this year highlights our business momentum and our keen focus on execution. We have accomplished a lot. And we are gratified to see the strong momentum in our business, the continued growth of our key products and the achievement of several key milestones within our R&D pipeline.","Now let's open the call to questions, and please remember to limit yourself to one question. Operator, we can open the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question is from Liav Abraham with Citi.","Liav Abraham - Citi Research","Good morning. Brent or Matt, I'm curious how we should be thinking about operating margins in 2019. I understand you're not giving guidance here on 2018 but just given the expectations for RESTATSIS generic competition and the relative profitability of the product, curious on how we should be thinking about operating margins beyond 2018. The Street's modeling roughly flat margins in 2019 versus 2018. And if I could sneak in a quick second. Bill, BOTOX in migraine, based on the data you have, to what extent is BOTOX being used in combination with the CGRP drugs at the moment? And how are you thinking about the migraine opportunity beyond 2019 once the sampling and zero co-pay programs for the new class cease and end? Thank you very much.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Thanks, Liav. Matt, why don't you take the operating margin please.","Matthew M. Walsh - Allergan Plc","Sure. Thanks, Brent. So on operating margins, obviously we're not providing guidance today. There's a lot that will impact that in 2019. But one of the reasons why we decided to discuss the pro forma impact of RESTATSIS on our 2018 results causing an uptick of about 200 basis points in operating margin is to at least provide some directional indication for what the business will do on an operating margin basis ex-RESTATSIS.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Bill?","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Yeah, and then, Liav, on BOTOX, look, we're above expectations for 2018 in terms of sales. We haven't seen any significant change in demand for BOTOX in migraine. To answer your question, we estimate only roughly 6% of patients on Aimovig are receiving BOTOX, which isn't surprising. I think if the market's going to move to adjunctive treatment, there's going to need to be data produced and then a fairly strong health economic argument made to health insurance companies and PBMs.","I think a couple other data points that dimensionalize the dynamics around BOTOX here that are worth noting. First, 48% of patients on Aimovig were new patients, new to the market. 25% have been switched from Topamax. Only 1.2% have been switched from BOTOX. And so I think the conclusion here is the market is large. It's growing. There's an unmet need. There's room for multiple treatment options and I think to a certain extent, Aimovig will expand the market and could be a gateway for BOTOX. Only 50% of people are going to respond to Aimovig, and to be fair, the reverse is true. I like the way this market is setting up for BOTOX and the CGRPs and I think the outlook for 2019 and beyond is positive.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Great. Thanks, Liav. Operator, next question.","Operator","It's from Seamus Fernandez with Guggenheim.","Seamus Fernandez - Guggenheim Securities LLC.","Great. Thanks for the question. So I have one question on the CNS pipeline and two subparts. So the quick one is on atogepant, can we get a sense of how the ubrogepant safety may have helped to inform the start of the atogepant Phase 3? Was that a gating factor at all to being able to start the atogepant longer treatment trials, the Phase 3s, or was it just the Phase 2? And then the second question is just simply on rapastinel and the oral rapastinel follow-on product that you guys are developing. Can you just give us a sense of what you're hoping to see as kind of the headline type of results from the Phase 3 studies that are going to read out in the first half of next year? Thanks so much.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah, thanks, Seamus. And I would just say, I'm going to try to reiterate one more time, one question because you guys are pretty good at this getting that second question as subparts. But thanks, Seamus. David you want to take it?","C. David Nicholson - Allergan Plc","Yeah, thanks for the question, Seamus. I can be I think relatively brief in the answer. With atogepant we \u2013 the start of the Phase 3 programs where planned and started, are starting independently of ubrogepant. And we have already started the atogepant long-term safety study and anticipating starting the Phase 3 efficacy studies with atogepant in the very near future. Yeah, regarding the rapastinel Phase 3 studies, the adjunctive MDD studies, yeah, report out in the first half of next year and we'll be concurrently running the Phase 2 studies with 241751. It's premature to have any discussions about the implications for the rapastinel data on that 241751. Yeah. Looking forward to the data.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Great. Thanks, Seamus. Next question, Darla?","Operator","Is from Ken Cacciatore with Cowen & Company.","Ken Cacciatore - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. Just a quick question on the divestiture process. Any update there for Women's Health and Infectious Disease, and maybe some of the things you're thinking through as you continue to discuss a potential to go ahead and sell these assets? Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah, sure. Thanks, Ken. So, look, just to ground everybody in where we stand. As you know, we have initiated processes to sell both our Anti-Infective and Women's Health businesses. As we've told you before, the Anti-Infective process is internally driven and the Women's Health process is advisor led. Both processes are going at full speed and progressing. They're stepping through the various processes for divestiture.","I will tell you we have received now the preliminary expression of interest for some of these businesses and they are below what I believe the value of these businesses are. And we should just remind you, and maybe I'll ask Matt to comment as well, these are good businesses, right. We have always said that while we absolutely would like to sell these businesses, we need to make sure that we get the right price, given the dilutive effect on a variety of our financial metrics and the growth profile some of these business; look at Lo Lo up 18% in the quarter as an example. So we're going to stay very disciplined. We've been a good, disciplined asset seller in the past. I think we got a good price for our medical dermatology assets, and we'll continue to make sure that we create value through this sales process by getting the best price.","Matt, you want to add some color at all?","Matthew M. Walsh - Allergan Plc","Yeah, just to add to the statement that getting the right price is important, these businesses have been, on a year-to-date basis, accretive to our growth rate, accretive to our margins. Just in case there's a misperception out there that because we've considered options for these businesses that they're somehow below the company's average, that is a misperception. These are good and contributing businesses to the overall portfolio.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","So to kind of conclude, Ken, and a long-winded answer, I apologize. We will continue forward with the process. We will do everything to try to negotiate the best price possible, and we look forward to hopefully updating all of you perhaps before the end of the year or soon thereafter.","Ken Cacciatore - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Next question, Darla?","Operator","It's from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Chris Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much. Just my question is on CoolSculpting. You talked about system discounting impacting revenues this quarter. Can you just elaborate a little more on the dynamics there? I know the high system placements are a long-term growth driver. But should we anticipate a near term headwind similar to what we saw this quarter as that flows through the P&L? And if I could just follow up on that, the last answer on divestitures. If you don't get the price you're looking for on these assets, is there a formal end to the review or are these assets that you'll continue to revisit over time and potentially monetize at some point in the future, or is this kind of a yes\/no decision that we should expect later this year? Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah, so let me answer the second part and then Bill can take the CoolSculpting. So there will be a formal end to the process, but there's never a formal end to our evaluation of the opportunities to create value inside of Allergan. For example, we didn't announce a formal process for the medical dermatology assets, but it's I think a proof point that we're always looking to focus our portfolio and create value for shareholders. And so if it doesn't work this time, we may end the process for now and consider it again at some future date but that will be up to the board. But just to be clear, this process is just stepping through its normal course. We've only received preliminary interest and anything can still happen. We're going to push very hard. We are disciplined sellers and we'll provide an update as we move through the process over the next several weeks.","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Hey, Chris. This is Bill. I wouldn't think about the price discounts on systems to be a long-term headwind. I would look for two things and I expect two things in this business. The first is we'll see an acceleration of consumables growth in quarter four. I think we'll sustain a high rate of growth in 2019. I would also look for a pick-up in our international business. And so any discounts that we're providing on systems to drive placements, and look, since we've picked this business up, placements are up 50% year-over-year, which is exactly what we wanted to do when we merged or acquired with ZELTIQ. I think it'll all be covered by very solid consumable growth over the next several quarters.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah, I would just add, I think we look at this as a very strategic part of the business and establishing a beachhead in body contouring. And the key to that, as we said when we acquired the business two years ago or about, it's about getting system placements in the right accounts and Bill's team has done a really nice job getting to almost 6,000 of the accounts, up about 50%. So that's our short-term goal. Our long-term goal is to drive consumables, and I think we're going exactly where we need to be. Next question, Darla?","Operator","It's from Jason Gerberry with Bank of America.","Jason M. Gerberry - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Quick question for David just on ubrogepant. The 500-person safety trial, the placebo controlled trial, can you comment at all about what were the general rates of liver enzyme elevation between drug and placebo arm? Just trying to get a sense of ultimately what that data looked like or when it would be presented and how comfortable you are that this drug's now approvable without a liver function test requirement.","C. David Nicholson - Allergan Plc","Yeah, thanks for the question, Jason. Yeah, look, really happy that we finished all the trials, the efficacy and the safety trials that the FDA has requested for submission. We have not seen liver safety issues of concern, and this was confirmed by our independent Data Safety Monitoring Board. We are going to be presenting the data in the very near future at the best, most appropriate medical conference which we feel is by far the best forum for presenting these types of data. And we're looking forward to filing ubrogepant with the FDA in the first quarter of next year. Yeah. It's all good.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Thanks, Jason. Darla, next question?","Operator","It's from Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Great. Thanks for taking my question. I'll also just keep it to one topic here. Just around drug pricing, we've obviously seen a lot of discussion from Washington and, Brent, you've obviously been a leader in this area. So just curious on your thoughts on what you think is the most likely output of some of the recent discussions. And maybe you can just sort of provide for us how much of the growth this quarter was on \u2013 from net pricing benefit versus volume. I don't know if one of you said that.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah, so thank you and a good question. Look, as you know, as you mentioned, we've been thinking about the new pricing world or dynamic now for a few years and certainly, a proof point would be the social contract we passed now almost two years ago, or over two years ago at this point. And look, back then I said to all of you and I remain consistent of my thinking that the biopharma business of the future cannot be reliant on price increases. It needs to be reliant on innovation and new product flow and amazing execution in the marketplace. And so those are the things that Allergan has been focused on.","And so as a result, our growth came with zero price appreciation in this quarter. I'll say it again. Zero price appreciation in this quarter. We are focused on driving demand and volume with our new products. And so when you think about the underlying core growth of 8.4% ex-FX, FX ex-OZURDEX, that is why we believe in the future of our ability to execute and to drive growth.","And I think on a go-forward basis, taking price is going to become more difficult. I think that that's fair. I think we have to watch, though, the counter-balance from the administration of stifling innovation, and some of the proposals that are being put forth to reference price potentially to price-controlled countries I think could have a destabilizing effect on how we think about investing for innovation in our industry. So I think everything has to be taken in context and be done thoughtfully. But this is a business in the future that's going to grow from demand and innovation, not from price. And we've thought that way for several years now.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thanks so much.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Next question, Darla?","Operator","It's from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. Thanks very much. I was hoping that you might be able to provide some color for us so that we better understand your hopes for the optimized formulation of abicipar. Could you give us a sense for what magnitude of reduction in inflammation risk you are targeting? Is it a quarter reduction? Is it an 80% reduction? I mean, what is your hope for this reduction in inflammation that you'll be reporting out next year? Thanks so much.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah, so, David, I'll give an answer and if David wants to add some commentary, feel free. Look, we don't design the study that way. That's not the way we go into thinking about it. Obviously our goal, as is our goal with every development program, is to create the best risk-benefit profile we can possibly create. So clearly here we've demonstrated what was even confirmed by KOLs at the AAO last week as the best efficacy in that it is the only true 12-week duration for all comers and so a consistent 12 weeks is the best duration study out there. So that's very solid efficacy.","And on the safety side, the inflammation rates are higher than we'd like, and so David's team has been working for a few years to improve the formulation, as other VEGFs have done, and our goal is ultimately to get it as low as possible. Whether MAPLE delivers that, we'll see when we get the data. But we don't come at it from saying we'd like to only get to 20% reduction or 50% reduction. This will be a continuous process improvement just like the others have gone through. And so we hope to get a strong improvement from MAPLE and continue to work on improving it in a continuous improvement cycle. David, anything else you'd add?","C. David Nicholson - Allergan Plc","I think that was a perfect answer, Brent. You covered it.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yes. All right. Thanks, David.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Darla, next question.","Operator","Your next question is from David Maris with Wells Fargo.","David Maris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. On brimonidine DDS, can you give us an update on it? What was the feedback at AAO? And is this a product that you think will be a premium price product for hard to control patients, sort of a niche expensive product, or is this going to be a broader product for glaucoma patients in general? Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah, I appreciate the question, David. Maybe I'll start and then Bill and David can chime in on brimo DDS. Look, geographic atrophy and neuro protection are right now, in essence, the holy grail in the retina community, only in that there is no approved treatments. There are actually no treatments for these two diseases today and they're very large markets, as you know. And so it's hard to figure out exactly what the right positioning is for brimo DDS in that it is still in development. But given the ease of the implant and the safety profile from what we've seen, I think it would be something that would be used in a majority of patients. But there's still a lot of work to be done and there's still a lot of product profile that has to be developed. But obviously it's exciting for us in that it's a huge opportunity to drive innovation into probably the greatest area of need in the retina community. David, anything you'd add?","C. David Nicholson - Allergan Plc","Yeah, perhaps just a couple of comments. So the first indication that we're developing brimonidine DDS for is as a cytoprotective, neuroprotective agent in geographic atrophy where there are no approved therapies at all. We're happy with the effect on lesion size because that is going to be the primary endpoint for the Phase 3 studies where there's a secondary endpoint effect on visual function. In terms of glaucoma and the potential for neuroprotection in glaucoma, which you mentioned, David, that is something that we need to take some decisions on and it's an earlier stage of development.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","And just to make sure we're being clear, because David, maybe we're \u2013 we have two programs. We have brimo DDS for geographic atrophy or neuroprotection and we have bim SR, or bimatoprost SR, for glaucoma. Both programs are very exciting and both address huge unmet medical need and if you go back to the glaucoma product, bim SR, there we're really very excited about the first Phase 3 study in that we saw what David mentioned in the script, patients controlling IOP a full year after receiving their last implant. So now, in the AAO, the excitement there among the glaucoma specialists is maybe, maybe we have a disease-modifying drug. Maybe, maybe, this is the first glaucoma product to actually treat the biggest issue with the disease, which is compliance and persistence, not necessarily efficacy of the current eyedrop therapies.","And so I would say \u2013 I spent a few days over the weekend at AAO. I think there was \u2013 among the glaucoma community, this was the most exciting thing. And among the retina community, clearly a fixed-dose, 12-week drug for AMD was pretty exciting, but probably even more exciting was the potential to have a treatment with brimonidine DDS for geographic atrophy. That really was the talk of the meeting.","David Maris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Thanks, David. Darla, anything else? Any other questions?","Operator","We have a question from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you very much. David, for you, on abicipar. Both EYLEA and Novartis's Bmab offer both 8- and 12-week dosing with clean safety profiles, and Roche is developing a 16-week drug, but obviously early. Recognizing that abicipar has shown that a majority of patients achieve efficacy at 12-week intervals, is there \u2013 I guess this is back to David's question \u2013 is there a level of inflammation from the upcoming MAPLE trial that's too high to take the product forward? Or is the feedback that you get from physicians that they will take the trade-off of the dosing advantage with higher inflammation rates? And also, David, if you could address abicipar, looks like it underperformed LUCENTIS in the CEDAR trial. Thanks very much.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","David?","C. David Nicholson - Allergan Plc","Yeah, thanks for the question, Jami. As presented at AAO, the vast majority of the inflammation cases with abicipar were mild to moderate that we've seen so far and were effectively treated with topical corticosteroids. And as you mentioned, we're very excited by the fact that we have a fixed-dose 12-week regimen with abicipar, which is potentially the first agent that's going to have this fixed 12-week regimen.","Regarding CEDAR and SEQUOIA, the most important point of both of those trials is that after the loading doses from week 16 to week 52, the efficacy was maintained, which shows that it's a fixed 12-week regimen. And as we pointed out, the slight difference in effect between CEDAR and SEQUOIA on the abicipar arm is entirely consistent with the variability in effect that you see both with LUCENTIS and EYLEA in the VIEW trials, which shows that you do get some variability, in effect, with the same agent, with all of these anti-VEGF agents between studies. Yeah, thanks.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Thanks, Jami. Darla, next question.","Operator","It's from Ronny Gal with Bernstein.","Aharon Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning. Congratulations on a nice quarter, and thank you for taking the questions. Brent, for you on this IPI model, I appreciate the topline view. But I was wondering if you actually looked at the pricing difference of BOTOX between U.S. and international and kind of estimated for yourself the exposure if indeed we go to this 1.26 times O-U.S. prices in the U.S. for BOTOX specifically. Essentially, if this model's getting implemented, essentially what is Allergan exposure? And if I could sneak one for Nicholson following up with brimo DDS, are you going for breakthrough designation for geographic atrophy?","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah, so Bill can provide some color on the first part of your question. But I would just say, in my opinion, and obviously there's a bias to it, I think we're very well positioned to deal with these proposals, even if, as I mentioned earlier, they could ultimately impact our ability to, as an industry, to innovate in the United States or invest for innovation in the United States, which I think is dangerous. But that being said, I think Allergan is as well positioned as any other company. And Bill, you want to provide some color around that?","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Yeah, Ronny, roughly today, 6% of our sales are subject to Medicare Part B. So I want to sort of put that in perspective. As it relates to the international pricing index, not surprisingly with a biopharmaceutical like BOTOX there's going to be a difference between the price in the United States relative to markets internationally. When you look at that overall proposal, I think the therapeutic areas that are really in focus are oncology, MS, RA and other spaces. I don't consider BOTOX a big budget-buster in any way, shape or form. And we'll just have to see how the rule plays out. I know there's a phased-in approach there that's going to extend about five years. I think it's a little too early to estimate what the impact would be. That being said, it would be relatively modest given our business and our exposure to Part B.","C. David Nicholson - Allergan Plc","And, Ronny, regarding brimo and breakthrough designation, we'll be going to talk to Wiley Chambers in the coming months to sort out exactly where we are in terms of finalizing the Phase 3 studies and other possible interactions with the FDA. Yeah. Clearly, we're always interested in getting breakthrough designation, but it's too early to say anything about that.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Thanks, Ronny. I think, Darla, we'll take two more questions.","Operator","And your next question is from Elliot Wilbur with Raymond James.","Elliot Wilbur - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. Just maybe a follow-up question on some of the earlier conversation around OZURDEX. Just specifically, I would have thought the supply chain was relatively similar ex-U.S., in-U.S. and wondering if that in fact is the case and if anything that came out of issues ex-U.S. might impact growth rates in the U.S. market going forward?","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah, so thanks, Elliott. So as I mentioned this was a \u2013 or David mentioned as well, this was an issue that was self-identified and corrective actions were put in place immediately. We've been meeting with regulators from around the world. Obviously each one has their own opinion on how this should be handled and under what conditions. That still is a bit of an ongoing process. But what I can tell you is our corrective actions were meaningful and the problem was \u2013 as we said, there's no real patient safety reported or issues reported yet. So we think we have the issue in hand and under control. And that doesn't mean a regulator can't show up tomorrow with a different opinion, but we're working very hard to be transparent, to be open, and obviously to implement our corrective actions. And so I think we're in pretty good shape. Last question?","Operator","Your last question is from Umer Raffat with Evercore.","Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Brent, is there a possibility that you could do something transformational for your dry eye franchise beyond RESTATSIS? And I'm referring to the possibility of perhaps a lifitegrast tuck-in and also wondering if that would only make sense before you lose your gross-to-net structure prior to generic RESTATSIS entry. Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah, so thanks, Umer. Look, I'm never going to comment on a specific M&A transaction on a conference call. That being said, we should just recognize, we have RESTATSIS. We don't know exactly when RESTATSIS will go, although we believe that that is the most likely scenario. We have an obligation to maximize our focus on RESTATSIS until the day it loses exclusivity and so that's our real focus. That being said, we're at AAO, we're always looking for innovations in dry eye. We're always looking for novel, real improvements in the treatment and therapies for dry eye. And so we fully expect to remain very active in helping our customers, the physicians and optometrists serve their patients that suffer from dry eyes. So we're absolutely focused on the category, the space and driving innovation into eye care.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","So I'd like to just conclude our call and thank everyone for their participation. We are again very focused on execution at Allergan. We see good momentum in our business and we look forward to providing further updates over time. And certainly into next year. Thank you for participating.

I'd like to welcome you to the Actavis first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release reporting Actavis' earnings for the first quarter ended March 31, 2015.

Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with the obvious. We had a terrific quarter on all key measures, and we are on an excellent trajectory for 2015 and beyond. Actavis' first quarter performance was highlighted by double-digit non-GAAP revenue growth versus the prior year, double-digit growth from key North American brands, double-digit growth from global generics and double-digit growth from Anda, our distribution business, three rock-solid pillars to which we are adding the Allergan business.","While keeping focused on customers and driving robust growth, we also achieved a long list of accomplishments during the quarter, including: completion of a largest deal in healthcare over the last 10 years; expanding the reach of our International portfolio; executing deals that increase our focus on profitable generic markets such as Auden Mckenzie in the UK, while completing divestitures that sharpened our brand therapy focus, such as our respiratory and Doryx deals and Pharma Tech deal.","Ramping up productivity of our branded\/generic R&D team with four new brand product approvals and about 20 new generic launches in the United States. And completing the largest financing ever in healthcare. Not to mention kicking off one of the most thoughtful and rapid integrations I've ever seen.","I am so proud of each of the people on our combined global team. One thing is clear: this combined team rallies quickly around surprising opportunities, focuses on the key objectives and executes flawlessly. When it comes to execution, we are like a finely tuned, high-performance engine.","Even though we just closed the Allergan acquisition on March 17, we have already made significant progress on the integration and we're doing exceptionally well on our cost synergy capture. How did we do it? We quickly named the new management team with skilled and experienced leaders from both companies. But we didn't stop there. In the vast majority of countries, we designed our entire organization all the way to the front line pre-close so we could rapidly inform our colleagues about their future, give them certainty and move quickly to the new go-forward team.","For example, our global sales force of approximately 7,500 representatives has already been realigned in all but a handful of countries with the intent to minimize customer disruption. We also stood up our new international model with one country manager per country, allowing us to operate as one company, while taking full advantage of our global brand and generic capabilities.","Being bold, nimble and focused during the integration is how we are staying on track with our aggressive synergy targets and, more importantly, how we will keep our sales momentum going. After just six weeks, we are making great progress on our integration milestones and are on track to deliver about 80% of our synergies by the end of the first quarter of 2016.","And in a moment, David Nicholson will give an overview of the tremendous progress in the pipeline and will make a few comments about the R&D portfolio prioritization, which is nearly complete.","Tessa will also join us to describe our financial performance in detail. But from a high-level perspective, you can see the impact of our transformation over the past 12 to 18 months. Non-GAAP net revenue was $4.2 billion, a 65% increase, largely driven by the Forest acquisition with only two weeks of Allergan in the results; $4.30 in non-GAAP EPS, even with the impact of the Allergan financing; $1.8 billion in adjusted EBITDA; and $525 million in cash flow from operations, more than $800 million if you add back the one-time cash charges for severances, restructuring and integration.","Turning to the business performance. On a pro forma basis, total U.S. branded sales increased 5% if you exclude Allergan and increased 17% if you exclude Namenda IR. Eight of the top-10 Actavis brands are growing double digits versus prior year; not just growing, thriving. In fact, many of our key products are hitting new highs in volume and market share, including Linzess, which is now approaching a run rate of $400 million annually.","Bystolic had a strong performance, running towards $650 million annually. And Lo Loestrin, Estrace and Minastrin are really soaring with the focus we are putting on women's health. Liletta will likely be a beneficiary of that focus. Meanwhile, Namenda XR sales are up sharply, as we continue to drive the conversion rate and have resolved last year's supply constraints.","Physicians and caregivers continue to convert more patients to Namenda XR with its more convenient and cost effective profile. Over 70,000 physicians have prescribed Namenda XR, which is a testament to its usefulness and treatment with patients with Alzheimer's disease. Our patient awareness campaign focused on caregivers and their loved ones with Alzheimer's disease has been well received and is helping with conversion. We are currently at about 50% and climbing towards 60% by the end of the second quarter.","And we expect to exceed that figure with the launch of Namzaric, which opens up the donepezil market segment worth about $2 billion. The primary source of business for Namzaric will be the donepezil or donepezil-plus-Namenda IR market. The main point here is that the market for Namzaric is bigger than the market for Namenda XR. Namzaric will give patients all the benefits of combination therapy for Alzheimer's disease in one pill, once a day. We intend to support Namzaric with formulary access and direct-to-consumer marketing. Shipping begins this week and full promotional launch later this month. Given the broad use of combination donepezil and memantine therapy, we think there's a great opportunity for Namzaric to expand the once-a-day branded market.","Turning to the Allergan business. Here again, we come back to our theme of double-digit growth. In the midst of planning for the integration, legacy Allergan delivered double-digit pro forma sales growth of 13% in constant currency to $1.75 billion for its final quarter. Allergan drove this performance while maintaining inventories in the customary, well-managed range. The performance was broad-based, driven by continued strong performance across the company's Eye Care, Botox and Aesthetic businesses.","Eye Care was up 14% in constant currency, driven by Restasis and Ozurdex. Botox up 16% in constant currency, driven by growth in therapeutic. Skin Care, Breast Aesthetics and Facial Aesthetics up a combined 12% in constant currency. International Allergan sales were also up double digits in constant currency, with all three units, Eye Care, Medical Aesthetics and Specialty Care achieving double-digit growth. We are capitalizing on the exceptional sustained performance of Actavis and Allergan to create an impressive leader in Growth Pharma.","So the bottom line on our combined company brand performances, strong performance for our key brands, including Namenda XR, Linzess, Botox, Restasis, Bystolic and Ozurdex. Meanwhile, you only have to look at the performance of Lo Loestrin, Saphris, Minastrin and the GI products to see that our team has firmly established a core competency in re-launching products that we acquire.","This ability to invigorate acquired products is a differentiator for us. We acquire assets to grow them, and we succeed. That opens up more possibilities for us than is appreciated, more growth, more leverage and more credibility for other bolt-on deals.","While it is early, we're off to a very good start with our new launches, and we are now poised to be a significant player in the increasingly important antibiotic space with Dalvance and AVYCAZ. This is where our model of development prowess, life-cycle investment and smart business development is creating an enduring, competitive advantage.","Turning to the North American Generics & International business, sales were up 20% this quarter in constant currency versus prior year. North American sales were $1.2 billion and continue to benefit from the contribution from key products like generic Concerta, Lidoderm and Intuniv. Special capabilities and being first to file again and again combined to make our Generics business a best-in-class competitor.","This year, we have launched 20 generic products in the U.S., including our most recent launch of generic Pulmicort, following our court win last week. We also launched generic OxyContin, Temovate and generic ophthalmic products as well.","This quarter, we also launched our Generic Injectable business after we regained the rights to about 20 injectables from Sagent at the end of 2014, giving us added strength with hospital purchasers. On the R&D side, our Generic business continues to fire on all cylinders, with seven confirmed first-to-files out of the total of 18 total filings posted on the FDA website this quarter.","On the International side, non-GAAP sales were $527 million, growing 20% excluding foreign exchange. We launched close to 100 products during this quarter. International revenue growth was driven by multiple markets, including Russia up 41% on a constant currency basis, driven by our strong sales organization and OTC performance, and the UK up 22% on a constant currency basis driven by new product launches.","Our strategy in International generics is to continue allocating resources to markets that deliver high growth potential and where we can be among the leaders. That is why we divested generic products in Australia and invested in Auden Mackenzie acquisition in the UK, which is expected to close in the second quarter.","Let me close with a few comments on our preliminary view of the 2015 financials. We are certainly off to a terrific start. We had previously planned to provide guidance at the end of Q2. But given the strong performance this quarter, the progress we're making on integration synergies and the impact of foreign exchange and divestitures, we felt it would be good to give you our preliminary view of 2015 today.","First, since we acquired Allergan on March 17, as-reported revenue is projected to be in the range of $20.5 billion to $21 billion. On a pro forma basis, full-year sales are projected at $22 billion to $22.5 billion, which was consistent with or slightly ahead of our prior comments of $23 billion, if you exclude the impact of foreign exchange and the multiple divestitures such as respiratory and Pharmatech.","Our current view on 2014 non-GAAP earnings per share on an as-reported basis, including Allergan as of March 17, is in the range of $17 to $18.50. We will narrow the range over time. With this view, you can see that we have put together a terrific company with a very compelling outlook for 2015. And we are executing like a high-performance engine, driving towards our aspirational target of $25 per share in EPS in 2017. We look forward to giving you more refined guidance on our second quarter call.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Tessa, who will provide you with an overview of our financial performance during the quarter. Tessa?","Maria Teresa Hilado - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Brent. Good morning, everyone. Before I turn to our results, I would like to remind you that the current quarter results, which I will discuss, now include 15 days of financial contribution from the Allergan acquisition, which was completed on March 17. The Allergan business contributed $258 million in net revenue and $113 million in adjusted EBITDA in the quarter.","Turning to our results for first quarter on slide 15. In Q1, we delivered strong performance with top-line growth across key franchises, both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, despite negative foreign currency impact. The year-over-year increase was also driven by the Forest and Allergan acquisitions. On a non-GAAP basis, consolidated net revenue for the first quarter was $4.2 billion, an increase of 65% versus the prior-year quarter. Non-GAAP R&D investment for the quarter was $284 million compared to $175 million in the prior-year period. Non-GAAP R&D spending was $110 million for generics, $125 million for brand, $15 million for biosimilars and $34 million for Allergan.","Non-GAAP SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 20.9%, an increase of 1.7 percentage points over the prior-year quarter as a result of the Forest-branded products that have higher SG&A spend. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $1.78 billion, an increase of 107% versus the prior year, driven by strong revenues and higher gross margins across the business. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter increased 23% to $4.30 compared to $3.49 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2014.","Excluding the impact of Allergan and its related financing, Actavis non-GAAP EPS was $4.59 for the first quarter 2015, representing a 17% sequential increase from $3.91 in the fourth quarter. This highlights our continued strong performance on top of integration activities.","Our non-GAAP tax rate improved from 16.4% in the year-ago period to 14.3% in the current-year quarter, mainly due to geographic mix. Cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $525 million. Our cash flow from operations would have been more than $800 million if cash charges for severance, restructuring and integration are added back.","Turning now to our business segments. North American Brands business delivered strong performance year-over-year, powered by the acquired Forest products and growth in our Women's Health franchise. North American Brands revenue was $1.74 billion for the quarter, up 192% versus the prior-year period, driven by the addition of the Forest business, including strong, double-digit year-over-year growth from eight out of our top-10 products.","Compared to the prior quarter, sales were down slightly, driven by normal decline in prescription fill rates from fourth quarter to first quarter that typically recover in the second quarter and the wholesale buying patterns. Adjusted gross margin with the North America Brands decreased to 86.6%, largely due to partner products within the Forest portfolio, including Namenda and Linzess. Sequentially, adjusted gross margin improved due to lower Namenda IR sales, which carry a lower margin.","Non-GAAP SG&A as a percent of revenue increased to 27.8%, driven by expenses related to the acquired Forest products.","Our North America Generics and International business continues to perform strongly, with non-GAAP revenues of $1.7 billion for the quarter, up 12% versus the prior-year period. Growth was driven by strong sales of key products and new product launches, including generic versions of Concerta, Lidoderm, Intuniv and OxyContin.","Internationally, our Generics business was negatively impact by the strengthened U.S. dollar. But at constant currency rates, this business grew 20% versus prior-year quarter.","On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted gross margins increased 3.2 percentage points compared to the year-ago quarter, due to continued strong performance within our International business. Non-GAAP SG&A as a percentage of adjusted net revenue for the segment declined to 14.8%, due to the divestiture of our Western European assets and elimination of the supportive infrastructure of that business.","Turning to our Anda business. Revenues increased $462 million, up from $300 million in the prior year, an increase of 18%, driven by a higher mix of chain drugstore sales. Gross margin for the Anda business decreased 2.6 percentage points, 12.5%, as a result of the higher product mix of chain drugstore sales.","Slide 19 details our debt capitalization following the close of the Allergan acquisition. We ended the first quarter 2015 with total debt of approximately $44 billion and equity of $71 billion related to the Allergan acquisition and previous financing. Currently, our leverage ratio stands at 4.1 times debt-to-pro-forma adjusted EBITDA.","Over the next 12 months, we are committed to using our anticipated strong free cash flows from our business segments to accelerate debt repayment. We expect to achieve a pro forma leverage ratio of 3.5 times debt-to-adjusted EBITDA by the end of the first quarter of 2016, in line with our prior guidance.","Finally, I would like to provide an overview of our key assumptions for the 2015 combined forecast Brent provided earlier in this call. Our non-GAAP EPS of $17 to $18.50 includes key near- and longer-term drivers that we expect over the next few months that will impact our business including: in U.S. Brands we assume the Namenda XR conversion trending to 60% by the end of Q2; Namenda IR generic enters the market in mid-July; Namzaric launch this week.","In our Gx business, we assumed launch of generic Pulmicort; continued current market conditions for Concerta; additional competition on Lidoderm; Auden McKenzie acquisition close late in Q2; a tax rate of approximately 15%; 2015 fully diluted average shares of approximately 386 million; and year-end 2015 fully diluted shares outstanding of 415 million. Foreign exchange rates are based on average forward consensus for Q2 to Q4.","I'd now like to turn the call over to David Nicholson, who will provide an update on our Brands R&D progress in the quarter. David?","C. David Nicholson - Senior Vice President, Brand Research & Development","Thank you, Tessa, and good morning, everyone. During the first quarter of 2015, our R&D teams focused on advancing our near-term development programs whilst also looking towards the future and the integration of the Actavis and Allergan pipelines.","Turning to slide 22, we have achieved tremendous progress. And I would applaud the combined efforts of our commercial and R&D teams. We have nearly completed the rationalization of our combined pipeline. Our teams have identified and confirmed 70 projects that will move forward as part to the combined development program, with more than 50 projects in either late stage or registration stages of development. Whilst we have made very significant progress on the rationalization of our pipeline, we are still evaluating certain projects.","We continue to drive these projects forward to key milestones to allow us to make cost-effective, but also data-driven decisions. We will present our combined rationalized pipeline as part of an up-and-coming R&D day. We have achieved significant progress across key programs from both the legacy Actavis and the legacy Allergan R&D pipelines.","Turning to slide 23. You get an insight into the extent of our progress, to strengthen our key franchises. In the quarter, we achieved milestones across core franchises, including Women's Health, Infectious Disease, CNF and Gastroenterology. Key FDA and European approvals included: Liletta. This was FDA approved in February, as a long-acting progestin-only intrauterine system, or a IUS, to prevent pregnancy for up to three years and was launched in the U.S. in April.","To support the use of Liletta of up to seven years, we are continuing the ACCESS study. The initial results of this study were published online in April in Contraception. The study found Liletta to be more than 99% effective for the prevention of pregnancy for up to three years of use in women age 16 to 35, regardless of their race, history of previous births or BMI.","AVYCAZ, our combination of ceftazidime and the novel beta-lactamase inhibitor, avibactam, was FDA approved in March as a treatment for adult patients with complicated intra-abdominal and urinary tract infections. The AVYCAZ launch is in progress. As you have heard, Namzaric is being launched, and we are in discussions with the FDA about extending the range of doses that we can make available to maximize convenience to patients.","Dalbavancin was approved in Europe in February as Xydalba for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections, ABSSI (sic) [ABSSSI]. We are developing a single-dose regimen of Dalvance. And in April, we announced positive top-line results for a phase 3 study comparing a single 1.5 gram dose of Dalvance with the same total dose given as two doses one week apart for the treatment of ABSSI (sic) [ABSSSI] infections caused by susceptible Gram-positive bacteria, including MRSA.","The top-line data demonstrated that the single dose of Dalvance achieved its primary endpoint for control of infection at 72 hours after initiation of therapy. The study was also positive at end of treatment, the endpoints required by the European Medicines Agency. I will return to Botox later.","We also announced the initiation of a Phase IIb study to relamorelin, our investigational treatment to gastroparesis in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. We are very pleased with this collaboration with our partner, Rhythm Health.","Turning to slide 24. We achieved sNDA approvals for a lower dose of 20-milligram Viibryd, expanding dosing options for clinicians, and for Saphris monotherapy for the acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with Bipolar I disorder in pediatric patients. FDA has accepted our sNDA to expand the Teflaro label for ABSSI (sic) [ABSSSI] with concurrent bacteremia.","We received FDA approval for the expanded label of Botox for the treatment of upper limb spasticity. The FDA also approved an increase to the maximum Botox cumulative dose for adults within three months treated for one or more indications. We remain very committed to extending our Botox franchise.","Looking ahead and moving on to slide 25, we have a significant number of regulatory milestones in the next few months. We have upcoming PDUFA dates for Eluxadoline in the second quarter and Cariprazine in June. For Eluxadoline, we do not expect an FDA Advisory Committee hearing on our submission, and DEA scheduling begins once approval is achieved.","We are continuing to build out our Linzess franchise, and we expect to submit an sNDA for a low-dosage form of the drug to treat chronic idiopathic constipation in 2016. For DARPin, our Phase II programs for AMD and DME in the U.S. and Japan are ongoing. And we will begin enrollment in our Phase III program in the U.S. later this quarter or early in the third quarter. This on-time start of Phase III is just one of many examples that our strong combined R&D team is maintaining momentum during the integration of our two companies.","Restasis is on track to submit to the dossier for multi-dose preservative-free formulation by the end of the year.","I'm excited about Bimataprost SR. The Phase III trials are continuing in the U.S., and we will be starting Phase III in Europe later this year.","SER 120, a low-dose nasal formulation for the treatment of Nocturia, is nearing completion of Phase III, and we are looking forward to seeing the data.","I also wanted to mention our Dermal Fillers. We're continuing to roll out additional HA formulations. We anticipate extending our Volite line in Europe and our Juvederm line in Asia during the course of this year.","In conclusion, the first quarter of 2015 has been very productive for the R&D team, and we will continue to see momentum in the second quarter and beyond from our industry-leading pipeline.","With that, I will now turn the call back over to Brent, who will provide closing remarks. Brent?","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, David. As you have seen, we're off to a great start. We are taking bold actions, firing on all cylinders and establishing a very strong trajectory, while creating the most dynamic company in Growth Pharma. And we are well on our way to achieving our key aspirations: double-digit branded revenue growth; about $8 billion in free cash flow in 2016; and our aspirational EPS target of $25 per share in 2017.","With that, I'll turn the call back to Lisa and we'll take your questions.","Lisa M. DeFrancesco - Head-Investor Relations","Thank you, Brent. And I'd like to ask all of you to limit yourselves to one question. If you have any follow-ups, please reenter the queue so we can get through all the Q&A. Jackie, we're ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. My one question is for Brent. Sometimes, the best things in life come along when you're least ready for them. Can you speak to your readiness and desire to move on a large acquisition in the near-term, if it were to make strategic and financial sense? Thanks.","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Gregg. Obviously, history is a proof point of that with the Allergan acquisition, which was not part of our strategy, but as you know was put in play. And we were able to be opportunistic as a white knight and really combine these two great companies.","I think as you look forward, obviously, our commitment to maintain our investment-grade rating is of critical importance to us. We will continue to look at bolt-on deals as a matter of course. I think with respect to transformational deals, we would be limited by cash constraints, obviously. So it would have to be something truly compelling for us to want to use our equity to do something like that.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. And Brent, just another question for you. How are you thinking about your Generic business, given that obviously there's someone out there right now who is willing to pay a very high multiple for it? And is there a way to sell the Generic business in a tax-efficient manner? Thanks.","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. It's a great question, Jami. And obviously, that is something we get from a few folks from time to time, and no surprise. Look, I think the generic industry is in a bit of turmoil right now with two hostile situations going on. And you know my views on hostile situations of going concern for companies. It tends to destroy value and cause lots of distractions.","When you look at our business, up almost 20% on top line this year, firing on all cylinders, an R&D pipeline that's the envy of the industry, continuing to just beat on first-to-files in the U.S. time and time again, launching 100 brands \u2013 or products outside the United States. And our way we manage it, which is so different than anybody else, I think it's something that we take a lot of pride in and we see a lot of connectivity to generics and our Branded business.","That being said, I think if you look at trying to sell it, I'm not sure there's a tax-efficient way. We do have a reasonably high basis in it, but it'd still be a very difficult thing to do. But I think the bigger takeaway should be, strategically, we value that business.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Marc Goodman with UBS.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Yes. Good morning. You talked about the $25 in 2017 as the target. Maybe you can just give us a sense of the push and pulls on that number relative to where you were when you first put that number out. And I know you said we can't do a second, but just on the LUMIGAN implant, can you just give us a sense of how long that product is lasting relative to the daily eye drop? Thanks.","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So, I think, Marc, it's a great question. Really, to be fair, not a lot has changed. The good news is, as we sit here several months from when we announced the deal and came up with the $25 aspiration, we're pretty much on course. There are obviously some minor puts and takes that occurred in the model, but overall, we're exactly where we kind of thought we would be. Obviously, currency has moved against us, but stronger performance has compensated for some of that. I think we're seeing good productivity out of the R&D pipeline. David has to finish and tie up the pipeline review, which we expect to happen this quarter. But overall, I'd say we're pretty much where we thought we would be.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Are the synergies coming through as fast as you thought when you originally set it out?","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I would say we're probably a little ahead, and that's why you saw quite a large cash charge this quarter. We're making great progress. For example, on head count, up; but for a few countries, we're substantially ahead of where we thought we would be. And both the severances and the charges associated with that came through in a large way this quarter. You should expect that to dissipate over time.","And so and I think we're feeling good by the bold and aggressive actions we've taken to combine these companies, get the distraction behind us and focus on top-line growth.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","And the Namenda sales piece of it hasn't changed much?","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No. I think \u2013 and I'll ask Bill to chime in here, but I think when you look at XR, it is an amazing performance. Obviously, the legal setback is what it is. And perhaps we'll get a ruling from the court; perhaps they'll delay so it doesn't matter anymore. We'll see what happens. But when you look at what our team has done and by pulling off the shelf a plan B 24 hours after that court ruling, it's nothing short of extraordinary.","I'll ask Bill to just comment on that.","William J. Meury - Executive President-Branded Pharma","Yeah. Hey, Marc. I mean, listen, we're trending toward 60%. If you add Namzaric to it, which I think'll be a sales accelerator, we should achieve our target. And in all the research that we've done, if we can provide for formulary coverage, then we believe we're going to be able to move more and more patients either from IR to XR or patients to Namzaric, which is, frankly, a stronger selling proposition than even XR; fewer pills, fewer administrations, no increase in side effects, better efficacy. And we've made sure that it's economical for health plans and caregivers. And so it's taken a lot of effort and a lot of investment and a lot of energy, but I think we're going to reach the target.","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Plus the donepezil market, which is much bigger than the memantine market.","William J. Meury - Executive President-Branded Pharma","That's right.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Liav Abraham with Citi.","Liav Abraham - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning. Just a quick question on DARPin and your decision to move forward here. Just curious as to what your objective is with the assets. Do you view this as a highly differentiated compound in a wet AMD market that'll be even more competitive in 2019 than it is now? Or are you progressing forward of this in order to potentially bring a combination DARPin, PDGF to market?","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I'll start and let me ask David to comment. And just one backup on LUMIGAN for Marc. I mean I think in the studies, we're seeing it lasts about three to four months, something in that range versus the drops, which compliance and persistence is a huge issue in glaucoma. And if you talk to glaucoma specialists, they're dying for an effective treatment that would increase compliance and persistence for a disease that's typically asymptomatic that's doing a lot of damage to the back of the eye.","In terms of DARPin, Liav, I think you're right on both tracks. I think the way we're thinking about DARPin is that it should achieve the three to four times a year dosing regimen to make it really a differentiator. Obviously, people don't like getting an injection in the back of the eye. If you look at even EYLEA, they're doing it more frequently than the label suggests. And so doctors are really looking for something that \u2013 and patients probably even more so \u2013 looking for something to minimize injections. So we're really trying to design the experiment \u2013 or the Phase III to hit the 12-week dosing regimen.","The other thing I would put out there is, remember, we put nothing in our deal model in DARPin. And so outside the cost of the Phase III study, it's essentially a free call option. And so given where we are, we think after all the modeling and everything we looked at, it was worth going for. But you're right, it's a high hurdle to get there. And to the extent we can, it should provide a very compelling, large opportunity for us in the future. But we've got to get there.","I think the second thing it does, it sets us up dual DARPin, and that could be a very exciting place to be, but it's early. And so we've got a lot of work to do there as well. I don't know, David, if you want to add any color?","C. David Nicholson - Senior Vice President, Brand Research & Development","Brent, I think you said it. We're very excited by our partnership with Molecular Partners. The DARPin's anchoring binding proteins are a novel plus of therapeutically active agents. Our lead DARPin has an incredibly high affinity for VEGF, which opens up the possibility for administration every 12 weeks. We're going to evaluate that in Phase III.","And as Brent mentioned, coming along behind it, we have a number of other anchoring binding proteins, other constructs. Those projects are early, so it's too early to talk about those. The dual DARPin is just in preclinical development. It's very exciting. It's a combination of PDGF and VEGF, which should have advantages in AMD but it's very early. It's still in preclinical development. We need to work our way through and generate more data just to see how exciting that project is really going to be.","Liav Abraham - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And you feel comfortable with the inflammation at this point?","C. David Nicholson - Senior Vice President, Brand Research & Development","We know that \u2013 I'm sure you do as well \u2013 that all VEGF inhibitors cause ocular inflammation. It was kind of interesting for me to see the change in rate of ocular inflammation that was observed during the course of Lucentis development. So we're very carefully watching ocular inflammation as we progress into Phase III. We've got a Data Safety Monitoring Board in place, and we're confident that we're in control of the situation. Yeah.","Liav Abraham - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line Ronny Gal with Bernstein.","Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning and thank you for taking my question. My question is for David Nicholson. David, you keep on seeing clinicaltrials.gov trials that you guys are doing in dry eye. Can you just organize this pipeline for us? What are the various programs? Where are they in development? When do they expect to reach the market?","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. So, Ronny, it's Brent. I know you wanted David. I'll turn it over to him in a second. But to be fair, we're not ready to go into great detail on the pipeline. We will do that soon. I will tell you that we have roughly four programs in dry eye. We think we have some really interesting ones and ones that maybe perhaps will fall out. We'll go through that over the course of the next month or so. But dry eye is something that we're also very committed to, and we're looking at a variety of external innovations as well as our internal programs. And you'll see us very committed to this space for the long term.","C. David Nicholson - Senior Vice President, Brand Research & Development","Yeah. I mean I think basically, that covers it, Ronny. Obviously, always happy to discuss this with you. As you know, we continue to be very excited about Restasis and expanding the Restasis geographies. And we've also got a novel formulation of cyclosporine in early stages of development, which we think could be a real advance over Restasis, itself. And as Brent said, we really believe we can maintain our leadership in this franchise. Yeah.","Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. And the product which you just discussed everything for the end of the year, that's Restasis X?","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I mean. So \u2013 the what \u2013 I'm not sure the question, Ronny. Ask again.","Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So the product that you just mentioned, the preservative-free multi-dose product, is that what used to be called Restasis X?","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No. Yeah, sorry. Absolutely not. That is not Restasis. That's just the preservative free, which doctors have been asking for.","Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","C. David Nicholson - Senior Vice President, Brand Research & Development","Yeah. Multi-dose formulation.","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","C. David Nicholson - Senior Vice President, Brand Research & Development","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Christopher T. Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much. Can you just talk a little bit about your expectations for the legacy Allergan products for the remainder of this year, particularly as we get some tougher comps as the year progresses? I guess should we think about this as a double-digit growth business for the remainder of 2015 on a constant currency basis?","And if I can just do a quick follow-up to I think Jami's question earlier. If Actavis shares remain at current valuations, does that change your view at all about a potential separation of your Brand and Generic franchises, acknowledging you've got a great Generic business. But does valuation play a factor here at all if, again, we're six or nine months away and you're still trading at a fairly low multiple on forward earnings? Thanks very much.","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So I mean I think as you think about the legacy Allergan business, our expectation is double-digit branded growth in a constant currency basis. I think there's nothing to suggest otherwise. The business has a lot of momentum behind it.","We have completely solidified our sales and marketing colleagues around the world with perhaps a few countries as an exception only. The team is absolutely committed. They've been driving lots of growth in the first quarter, and we expect that to continue throughout the year and beyond. And that is part of the firm basis of which we believe we'll have double-digit branded growth along with the North American Forest legacy brands.","I think to respect to your second question, Chris, in terms of the stock being perhaps at lower levels than we all would expect. I don't think it's a question of selling the Generics business. I think it's a question of digesting this integration, help and teach shareholders understand the value proposition here, the compelling growth opportunity that we've created in Growth Pharma, the enduring, sustainable bottom line growth, continuing to prove out our aspiration of $25 of EPS in 2025. And then showing how the businesses support each other and add additional turbo-boosting growth to one another.","And so it's still early. We only closed Allergan a few weeks ago, I think five, six weeks ago. And so I think no one wants to have a trigger finger and overreact to five weeks of weakness, if you will, in the midst of closing, rebasing your shareholders, having a lot of people sorting through different moving parts. Let's let things settle down and let us tell our story and prove our points as we continue to execute on all cylinders here.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Cacciatore with Cowen & Company.","Ken C. Cacciatore - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks, Brent. Just wanted to flesh out a little bit of your earlier comments for hostile versus not, combined with your discussion about potentially a large deal. And you indicate, as always, a lot would have to come together, especially to use to your currency. But just wondering if you saw \u2013 and this is clearly down the road \u2013 a reason to approach a larger player. When would you become more encouraging \u2013 I hate to use the word hostile \u2013 versus remaining passive? Is there any time that you would kind of alter the philosophy that you have? Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I mean you never say never. I just think that doing a hostile deal against a large-going concern, like we've seen in the industry over the last 12 months, is value-destroying. We are quite experienced in integrations. We do them quite well. And one of the largest reasons we do them well is because we treat people with dignity and respect. We have information exchange freely, of course, following all the rules and regulations around gun jumping. And that allows us to get a jump on things, like you saw in this quarter with the integration of Actavis, Allergan. But it also shows how you restore momentum by keeping people's morale high, and that is certainly the case, for the most part, in our combined company.","I think there are opportunities to do hospital deals. I think you have to do them when you're buying a single product, perhaps, or just a research program or file where people aren't the key driver. But in most of these businesses, people are such a large part of the equation, I think, going hostile in virtually every instance a mistake. There could always be an exception to that.","I think that the second thing is, there are other large players that we believe are inefficient that would benefit from our operating model, our management philosophy, the way we approach customers in a more efficient manner. And so over time, there may be some targets that could be surprising to folks. But we have to delever and we have to maintain our investment-grade rating. And so those are all the factors that go into everything we look at.","And obviously, I think by now, we've earned some trust that if there's something opportunistic that creates shareholder value, this isn't a team that sits back and watches it pass us by. We react very quickly and do things in a very creative but value-creating way.","Ken C. Cacciatore - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI.","Umer Raffat - Evercore ISI","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. My question actually is for Tessa, not for Brent today. Tessa, I noticed $525 million in cash flow from operations, based on the results today versus $1.3 billion in non-GAAP net income. And I also noticed on the cash flow statement, you had $700 million in headwind from accounts receivable as well as $200 million in inventory. So I just wanted to understand that better, if you had any color on that. Thank you.","Maria Teresa Hilado - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. So good question. First, if you add back restructuring and integration charges back into cash flow, you'll get to roughly $800 million. But $400 million in receivables change was really largely due to two things: one, a change in payment terms with a couple of customers; and two, with higher sales, obviously, you have higher AR.","And then on the inventory side, that was purposely done to ensure that we don't have any outages in terms of supply. But what you'll find is towards the next couple of quarters, sequentially, our cash flow will improve in a manner such that by 2016, we will be at roughly $8 million of cash flow. So there's a couple of puts and takes in Q1 that are, I would say, abnormal in nature, largely due to restructuring. But you'll see that improve sequentially through the next couple quarters.","Umer Raffat - Evercore ISI","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Faerm with Wells Fargo.","Michael Faerm - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. My question's on Eluxadoline. Do you have a specific PDUFA date for that? And what sort of a timeframe are you anticipating for launch along for the DEA schedule? Thanks.","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So maybe I'll turn it to David. Do you want to...","C. David Nicholson - Senior Vice President, Brand Research & Development","Yeah. As I just said, we've got an upcoming PDUFA date for Eluxadoline. We're in the middle of labeling discussions at the moment with the agency for this potential product. Labeling discussions are going well. Once we have finalized the approval from the division, then the scheduling goes to the DEA for finalization. The timeline for scheduling is \u2013 it varies from company to company. So it's not possible for us to say when we'll get the scheduling, the finalized schedule decision. The PDUFA data, as I mentioned earlier, is in second quarter.","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I would just add that our current model has us launching likely at the end of this calendar year but most likely in the first quarter of next year. And so that's how we've been anticipating it. And we think that that's still a very accurate way of thinking about it.","Michael Faerm - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Thanks so much. My question is for Brent. Brent, could you just explain your 10% Branded revenue growth target in some detail? Could you define that, the timing, what it includes, what it excludes, just so we have a better sense for how you're thinking about that 10% goal? Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So the 10% Branded growth is a long-term goal. We expect that over our planning period, which is a few years, that our Branded business will achieve 10% growth on the top line into the future or better. Obviously, currency is one of the moving pieces to that. And I think if you look at it in constant currency \u2013 and it's hard to hold management out in the field and in the countries accountable for currency; obviously, you can hold us accountable for it here at the center but not a lot we can do about it \u2013 that we see that growth.","When you look at how we've kind of base-lined it, it really is starting in this quarter with generic IR. Then everything else is in. And so that's how we think about it as a CAGR on a go-forward basis. And we expect that as we look at it, we should do better than 10% Branded revenue growth throughout our planning period.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. So that excludes the impact of IR.","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It excludes currency and IR. That would be the only two exclusions that I'm aware of. And of course, the...","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it.","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. We did have respiratory\/Doryx, Pharmatech, Australia. We've had some divestitures. Just \u2013 we've re-baselined it against those divestitures as well.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yep.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Louise Chen with Guggenheim.","Louise Chen - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So just a more macro question here. Curious how you think about brand and generic drug pricing, given that there have been concerns that it may not be as favorable going forward. Just curious your thoughts here. Thanks.","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So let me tackle generic pricing. Maybe Paul will want to weigh in as well since he has a deep history here. We haven't seen much of a change despite all the fanfare and publicity around drug pricing in generics. There are obviously a few products that go up. But the model for generics is price decreases as more competitors come into the market. That's just the way the business works. And overall, we still model a mid-single-digit price decrease in our business.","That being said, the environment has remained pretty stable and favorable. So we don't expect that to change short term, either. I don't know, Paul, do you have other thoughts on...","Paul Navarre - President-International Brands","I think the only thing I would say is that our pipeline and product line gives us a bit of an advantage because of the uniqueness of it. It allows us to be somewhat insulated from the general reduction of prices. As you know, we've worked very hard to create that product line, and we're obviously taking advantage of the situation as situations present themselves.","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Bob, anything you'd want to add?","Robert A. Stewart - President, Generics and Global Operations","No. I think that exactly covers it.","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. In terms of the Branded side, again, I think our goal over the medium and long term is to continue to climb the innovation curve with novel drugs like Eluxadoline or Esmya or relamorelin where we believe we can continue to command the prices associated with the innovation. But in the short term, when you look at our current price portfolio, we're reasonably well positioned. And Bill, you want to expand on that?","William J. Meury - Executive President-Branded Pharma","Yeah. I don't think when we look at our sales expectations over the next several years, we're overly dependent on price as a driver. A lot of the growth trends that you're seeing are volume based.","I would also point out that, generally speaking, our pricing strategy is tied to our IP, and most of the assets that we have on the market right now have long exclusivity periods. And so our primary objective, generally speaking, in a market, is market share. And as it relates to price increases, we're very realistic about what they can look like. We feel we're predictable and reasonable. I think payers know that. I think that's the right way to be over the next several years, and I don't anticipate any surprises to our plan because of price.","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And I would add \u2013 Philippe, you want to make a comment about Aesthetics?","Philippe Schaison - President, Allergan Medical","Yes. On the cash base side, we, have increased our price by 3% this year and we can see double-digit growth from double-digit growth in our business. So we're pretty confident about the future of this business.","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Great.","Lisa M. DeFrancesco - Head-Investor Relations","Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Amsellem with Piper Jaffray.","David A. Amsellem - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Thanks. So on this theme of bolt-on M&A, wanted to ask about the Generics business. And is the addition of additional businesses, either ex U.S. or small businesses in the U.S., a priority? And also maybe talk about what kind of formulations and dosage forms might be a high priority in terms of bolstering the business via M&A. Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. I'll turn it over to Bob Stewart to comment on that.","Robert A. Stewart - President, Generics and Global Operations","Yeah. Hi, David. Looking at our business, I'm pretty comfortable that we've got pretty much all the technology platforms that we need. When you look at what Forest brought to us as well as what Allergan brings to us in terms of technology base, we have now the full range of dosage forms that we need to be able to compete globally.","We'll always look at opportunistic M&A in the U.S. I think we've got the scale that we need. I don't necessarily think that another acquisition in the U.S. is really going to give us anything because I think, again, we've got the size, the portfolio. We've got a best-in-class commercial team. Perhaps, maybe looking at some portfolios of products in injectables and things like that, that would be the only thing I would see that would be of interest in the U.S.","Outside the U.S., we're always looking at different geographies that were already strong. You saw us do it with Auden McKenzie in the UK. We may look in certain markets where there might be some tuck-in type acquisitions to just increase our overall strength there, more portfolio based, more small company type of transactions. But outside of that, I don't necessarily think that we need a large-scale transaction within the Generics business to remain viable or competitive.","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I would say best in class.","David A. Amsellem - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Randall Stanicky with RBC Capital Markets.","Randall S. Stanicky - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. Just a quick one on methylphenidate. I think you said in your guidance reflects current market conditions. The share's been ramping. Obviously, we're going to get an update here imminently. We don't know what the two other competitors are going to do, and there's obviously a very good case for you where they leave the market and that leaves you with some pricing opportunity as well. So if you could maybe just comment on how you're thinking about that situation, that would be great. Thanks.","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Bob?","Robert A. Stewart - President, Generics and Global Operations","Yeah. So Randall, I guess the way we've guided is exactly how you illustrated it there. So we are modeling it as if both the manufacturers remain in the marketplace and that we continue to hold onto or maybe slightly pick up in share from where we're at today. But we see both competitors in the BX kind of situation. Now obviously, if FDA does take action and\/or if the manufacturers or, further, the retailers do the responsible thing by continuing \u2013 by not dispensing the BX rated product, that would provide upside to us, both in terms of volume as well just overall I guess stability within the marketplace. So we would see that as an upside compared to what we guided.","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And we could supply.","Robert A. Stewart - President, Generics and Global Operations","And we have 100% of the volume, and we've notified FDA that we have 100% of the volume or inventory needed to supply the marketplace. So in the event that the competitors do come out of the marketplace, that we would be able to ensure that all customers are served.","Randall S. Stanicky - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of David Maris with BMO Capital Markets.","David W. Maris - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning, Brent. Wanted to talk to you a little bit about distraction, so both in the Generics and in the Aesthetics business. When you see two of your major competitors coming together, is that something that you \u2013 or potentially coming together \u2013 is that something you spend a lot of time wringing your hands about? Or do you see that as something you're pretty happy about that maybe two competitors will be distracted for a year or two in an integration? Is that more of an opportunity?","And separately, in Aesthetics, we've heard from a number of cosmetic derms that they've seen several of your peers being distracted lately but they've seen no change in their Allergan sales coverage. So what have you done to minimize the disruption to customers, and how do you think you've done holding on to share during this transition period?","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Great questions, David. Thanks. I think as you think about this, the generic industry right now \u2013 I kind of alluded to this earlier. Having two out of your three major competitors kind of tied up in knots, fighting each other in a hostile way certainly should create some opportunity for us. It certainly doesn't distract us. It keeps us laser focused on our competitors.","And just anecdotally, I'll give you one example. I was down at the NACDS with Paul and Bob Stewart and our Branded colleagues. And our other competitors were either there in a very light presence or not at all because they were on the road, trying to convince shareholders that their plan or their defense was on track. And so you can already see them, despite what they say, saying it doesn't impact them, impacting them. And so hopefully, we're already in the pole position with respect to R&D. But this will hopefully continue to allow us to continue to be in a pole position with respect to customer service.","On the Aesthetics side, maybe Philippe will chime in and Paul perhaps internationally. I think our goal was to really do no harm, right? And so we approached this integration very, very carefully in that there was really no change to the facial aesthetics teams around the world \u2013 or virtually no change around the world with a key focus on maintaining customer focus and connectivity in the U.S. and key international markets. Philippe, anything you'd add to that?","Philippe Schaison - President, Allergan Medical","Listen, we're growing by 13% during Q1. We are investing heavily in direct-to-consumer advertising. You've seen that behind Botox and VOLUMA. VOLUMA is becoming the number one filler. Has grown 30% during the first quarter. And despite a Derma (01:05:40) that is, I would say, stronger than Valeant, we're still gaining market share. So overall, I'm very confident and very positive of that business.","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. And Paul Navarre, who runs International Brands, would you want to chime in?","Paul Navarre - President-International Brands","So very briefly, Q1 for Medical Aesthetic was great. We grew by 15.9%. And as you say, Brent, the sales force were actually not affected by the integration so we maintain exactly the same level of service with customers.","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Just to conclude, you couldn't do that if this was a hostile deal. These sales reps would've been taken out by competitors. The marketing teams would've been distracted immensely. And so that's why, again, I underscore in most situations, hostile deals are value destroying. And you have to look to do things on a friendly basis, obviously, with a few exceptions to that rule.","David W. Maris - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Thank you very much.","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Thank you, David.","Brenton L. Saunders - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So I think that was our last question. I would just, again, close with saying that this team has continued to take bold and decisive action to create value. We are absolutely well on our way to achieving our key aspirations of double-digit Branded growth, $8 billion of free cash flow in 2016 and remain committed to our aspirational target of $25 per share in 2017.","We thank you for joining us today and taking the time to go through a quarter with lots of moving parts.

After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I would now turn the call over to Ms. Daphne Karydas, Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategy, to begin.","Daphne Karydas - Allergan Plc","Thank you, Brandy, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to the Allergan third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release reporting Allergan earnings from continuing operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2017. The press release and our slide deck which we are presenting this morning are available on our corporate website at www.allergan.com. We are conducting a live webcast of this call, a replay of which will be available on our website after its conclusion. Please note that today's call is copyrighted material of Allergan and cannot be rebroadcast without the company's express written consent.","Turning to slide 2, I'd also like to remind you that during the course of this call, management will make projections or other forward-looking remarks regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. It's important to note that such statements and events are forward-looking statements and reflect our current perspective of the business trends and information as of today's date.

Our GAAP financial metrics, and reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP metrics, can be found in our earnings release issued this morning and posted on our website.","Turning to slide 3 and our agenda this morning. With us on today's call are Brent Saunders, our Chairman and CEO, who will provide some thoughts on our business and highlights from our third quarter results; Bill Meury, our Chief Commercial Officer, who will provide an overview of our commercial performance; David Nicholson, our Chief R&D Officer, who will provide an update on our pipeline; and Tessa Hilado, our Chief Financial Officer, who will then discuss the Allergan third quarter financial results and our guidance in more detail. Also on the call and available during the Q&A are Rob Stewart, our Chief Operating Officer, and Bob Bailey, our Chief Legal Officer.","With that, I will turn the call over to Brent.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Thank you, Daphne, and good morning, everyone. A great deal has happened over the past few months, and we have a lot to cover on today's call. I want to make sure that we have time to address everyone's questions, so let's get started with three key points.","First, our results and full year 2017 outlook are solid. Revenue growth, non-GAAP performance net income per share growth, and cash flow generation were all strong this quarter. The pipeline is moving forward, and our team is very focused on execution.","Second, we are facing some loss-of-exclusivity challenges, just like any biopharma company in our space. Those challenges are manageable, and we will deal with them head-on. We know how to take costs out of our company while maintaining the right level of investment to drive future growth. We've done this before.","Finally, this business will generate significant cash flow even if we were to lose RESTASIS, and we will deploy that cash flow to create value for our shareholders.","Now, before we turn to the quarterly results, let me address the question that is on everyone's mind: How will we mitigate the financial impact of RESTASIS loss of exclusivity following the unfavorable District Court decision? We filed a notice of appeal last Friday. We believe we have strong arguments on the appeal, and we will keep fighting to defend our intellectual property. But you should know that we are taking action and do what is necessary to protect the P&L if generics launches.","Turning to slide 5. With approximately $1.4 billion in annual revenue and approximately 80% contribution margin, RESTASIS contributes over $2 in non-GAAP performance net income per share. In addition, as we have previously highlighted, in 2018, we also face other potential loss-of-exclusivity headwinds for ESTRACE Cream, NAMENDA XR, DELZICOL and ACZONE.","We will do what is needed to manage our business and shield our P&L from full impact of these headwinds. We will drive growth in the promoted products. We will take actions at the right time to reduce costs rapidly while positioning the position for growth going forward. And we will use our strong balance sheet while continuing to deliver on our capital commitments, including increasing our dividend and paying down nearly $4 billion in debt in the first quarter of 2018. We will remain disciplined in our capital allocation activities, with no plans (sic) [plans] (5:22) to reserve excess free cash flow post our debt paydown and dividend commitments for returning cash to shareholders.","Since the FDA has not approved a generic, we don't know the exact timing of a potential generic entry, but we won't wait to take action. One scenario is for a midyear 2018 entry of generic RESTASIS. In that midyear 2018 scenario, our 2018 non-GAAP performance net income per share would be no less than $16, including the impact of our $2 billion share buyback.","Under an even more conservative scenario that assumes a January 1, 2018, date for generic competition to RESTASIS, our non-GAAP performance net income per share in 2018 would be more than $15 per share. While we do not believe the more conservative scenario is the most likely outlook for 2018, we are prepared for it. Obviously, if no generic RESTASIS enters in 2018, non-GAAP performance net income per share would be expected to be higher than 2017.","Regardless of the scenario, I want to make it clear that 2019 non-GAAP performance net income per share will be higher than in 2017, even though 2017 includes a full year of sales of RESTASIS and the other products potentially facing loss of exclusivity. Despite the revenue and earnings headwinds from LOEs, we think this is both realistic and achievable.","We will provide a more precise range of 2018 non-GAAP performance net income per share and other financial metrics, including revenue and margin guidance, early next year, either during Q4 earnings or perhaps sooner. But we wanted to provide you with this important perspective to frame expectations for 2018 in an appropriate and realistic manner. With that, let me turn briefly to our performance in the quarter.","Turning to slide 6. With three quarters of the year now behind us, we are continuing to execute on our commitments. Revenue growth was strong, with sales up 11%. We continue to deliver strong results in Medical Aesthetics, including the synergistic impact of Regenerative Medicine and CoolSculpting. We did a good job of controlling costs and reducing our share count to drive a 25% increase in non-GAAP performance net income per share.","We are converting our revenue growth into strong cash flows. This quarter, we had $1.5 billion in reported cash flows from operations. Our R&D team is making good progress, especially in advancing our six star R&D programs, with relamorelin for diabetic gastroparesis about to commence a Phase 3 study, all of our six star programs will be in Phase 3 or beyond very soon.","In closing, we had a very strong quarter due to our team's focus on execution, and we are well positioned for the remainder of the year. Although 2018 is a year where we will face LOEs, we will take appropriate actions to mitigate the impact without compromising the key elements of the strategy that will drive our business going forward.","Now let me hand the call over to Bill.","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Thanks, Brent. Good morning, everyone.","Turning to slide 8. As Brent mentioned, revenue was up 11.4% over last year, including the addition of ALLODERM and CoolSculpting. Growth was based primarily on volume over price and was balanced with products from all seven therapeutic areas. Sales for many of our top promoted products increased versus prior year. Sales for six of them increased at double-digit rates in the third quarter.","In Medical Aesthetics, growth was led by BOTOX Cosmetic, up 11% ex FX, and our JUV\u00c9DERM collection of fillers, up 19%. In Eye Care, sales for RESTASIS and our glaucoma business were each up 3% and 2%, respectively, versus prior year. And OZURDEX was up 14%. Within Medical Dermatology ACZONE declined 32% in the quarter versus prior year due to continuing overall genericization of the branded acne market. This pressure is coming from payers, branded generic competition, and compounders. Additionally, a generic version of dapsone 5% was launched this month.","LINZESS sales were up 16% versus prior year, based on strong demand and slightly favorable trade buying. And Lo LOESTRIN sales were up 14% \u2013 strong results for both products, which anchor our GI and Women's Health businesses. And finally, product launches including VRAYLAR, NAMZARIC, KYBELLA, VIBERZI, XEN, and RHOFADE contributed $82 million to net revenue growth compared to last year.","Turning to slide 9, our Medical Aesthetics business remains strong. We continue to see this as one of the fastest-growing businesses and one of the best markets in healthcare. Starting with facial injectables, the JUV\u00c9DERM line of fillers is at an all-time high market share, plus 50%, which was powered by the launch of three new fillers in 2017, Volbella, Vollure, and Volite. Growth is coming from both our U.S. and international businesses. BOTOX is the gateway into our Medical Aesthetics business. We're just launching a new indication forehead lines in 2018; BOTOX is the only neurotoxin with data and an approval for three areas of the upper face.","CoolSculpting is exceeding expectations in the United States. We have approximately 3,100 of our top 10,000 Medical Aesthetics accounts using CoolSculpting. Our focus is on closing this gap and doubling the number of CoolSculpting accounts in the United States over the next several years. We've increased the size of our capital equipment sales team. We've increased the number of training programs, called Cool Events, and we've increased DTC levels to drive awareness and demand for this important business.","The Plastics and Regenerative Medicine business had another strong quarter, too. Sales for ALLODERM, a tissue matrix for breast reconstruction and the flagship of the line, are exceeding expectations. Our breast implants business also had a strong quarter, powered by the launch of two new premium implants, INSPIRA SoftTouch and Cohesive.","In terms of Eye Care, even without RESTASIS, we have an attractive portfolio of other Eye Care product lines, including glaucoma, artificial tears, and OZURDEX. This portfolio without RESTASIS contributes over $2 billion in global annual sales. We're committed to Eye Care for the long term. As for RESTASIS, the promotional program will be modified in anticipation of potential generics in 2018.","In gastroenterology, LINZESS, as I mentioned earlier, had a very strong quarter. The prospects for growth here are excellent. We expect LINZESS to be a high single-digit growth driver over the next several years, with a path to a $1 billion potential. VIBERZI sales were stable quarter over quarter. We still have work to do here. This month, we're launching a new study showing the utility of VIBERZI in Imodium nonresponders, and in January, we're planning to launch a new seven-day trial package to get this product back on track. Physician satisfaction rates with VIBERZI are as high as they need to be. We're looking for movement in new prescription and riders in the next two quarters.","Turning to CNS, demand for VRAYLAR remains strong and above expectations. It continues to be the fastest-growing atypical antipsychotic on the market, and we see a long runway for this product. To sustain growth in the short term, we're launching new data on relapse prevention, as well as a nationwide DTC campaign for bipolar mania. As for NAMZARIC, sales increased both year over year and sequentially. Importantly, we have formulary coverage for this product through 2018.","Now turning to slide 10. In international, we're focused on driving sustainable growth. We're anchored by Medical Aesthetics, which grew 31% ex FX, and Eye Care and BOTOX Therapeutics, both of which grew 5% ex FX in the quarter versus prior year. Two of our regions, Asia Pacific and Middle\/East Africa and Latin America\/Canada, grew double digits, and Europe continued high single-digit growth, up 7% versus prior year. China continues to be one of our fastest-growing markets and was up 63%. Others like India, Brazil, Canada, Turkey, and Iberia also showed significant growth. We continue to have a very positive outlook for our international business.","Turning to slide 11. You see we have a diverse product portfolio of high-quality, durable products on the left, partially offset by key products facing LOE risk through 2020 on the right. We're now including RESTASIS and ACZONE into this category, given the recent court decision on RESTASIS and given the acne market headwinds, and dapsone 5% generic launch. Including RESTASIS, our LOE exposure is mostly concentrated in 2018. As Brent noted, we're preparing to take actions to mitigate the financial impact of generic competition for RESTASIS and for the other brands facing LOEs.","Turning to slide 12. When we think about our business, we think about it in three parts. The first part is our promoted brands with ongoing exclusivity, which represent approximately 70% of sales year to date and are up approximately 13% versus prior year, excluding the impact of acquisitions. Growth here is largely volume-based. This is our core; these are durable growth assets and are the focus of our investment. The prospects for growth here in 2018 and beyond are excellent. Sales for this group of products are expected to increase at a high single-digit rate and are expected to make up approximately 85% of total sales in 2019.","The second part is other products, which represent approximate a 10% of total sales year-to date. Sales for other products were up 2% versus prior year. These products have limited investment, but are highly profitable and provide a solid cash flow stream. Going forward, we think about this group of products as a stable to low single digit declining group. When we think about our business on a longer-term basis, we see an opportunity for these first two groups that today represent approximately 80% of year-to-date sales to drive strong mid-single digit durable growth. Approximately 40% of those sales are coming from cash-pay and BOTOX Therapeutics, and there's an opportunity to enhance that growth profile with potential success of the pipeline.","The third part of our business is made up of those products which may lose exclusivity through 2020 and which represent approximately 20% of total sales year to date and now includes RESTASIS and ACZONE. We continue to be excited about the prospects for both our top promoted products and pipeline products will be forward.","With that, I'll turn the call over to David.","C. David Nicholson, Ph.D. - Allergan Plc","Thank you, Bill. Good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, we continued to deliver on Allergan's pipeline for patients. So far this year, we have achieved 13 major pharma and device approvals. With relamorelin about to commence a Phase 3 clinical study, we will have initiated Phase 3 programs for all of our six stars, and we have submitted an NDA for Esmya.","Turning to slide 14, and looking at our six star programs, the development of these first or best-in-class compounds continues according to our previously reported timelines. In CNS, our CGRP programs continue to move forward. Recruitment for our pivotal single single-attack Phase 3 studies for ubrogepant in acute migraine are planned to be completed this month. We look forward to top line results from these studies, which are expected in the first half of 2018. The additional ubrogepant two-month 400 patient safety study that we announced last quarter is expected to start enrolling patient this month, and we continue to expect launch in 2020.","Recruitment in our Phase 2b study with atogepant for migraine prophylaxis is progressing according to schedule, and we expect to have top line results from this program in the first half of next year. The Data Safety Monitoring Committee met in October and recommended continuation of all trials of our CGRP antagonists. So we continue to be very encouraged by the safety of these two compounds.","Turning to rapastinel, recruitment in our Phase 3 program remains on track, and we continue to expect to have top line results from the short-term studies in 2019, followed by data from the maintenance studies in 2020.","On VRAYLAR for the treatment of negative symptoms of schizophrenia we were disappointed with the FDA's decision to issue a Refusal to File letter. There is a high unmet need for patients who suffer from negative symptoms associated with schizophrenia, and we are prepared for further discussions with the FDA on this topic. In addition, we are pursuing additional indications for VRAYLAR, including bipolar depression.","In Women's Health, we are happy to report the NDA filing for Esmya for the treatment of abnormal bleeding associated with uterine fibroids. Based on the FDA's feedback, we are presently not anticipating an advisory committee meeting for Esmya, and we continue to plan for approval in 2018.","In Eye Care, we anticipate announcing the top line results for our abicipar AMD Phase 3 studies in the second half of 2018.","In GI, we announced top line additional one-year as well as two-year data from the Phase 2 CENTAUR study for CVC. We will be presenting these data at a major liver meeting in 2018. We also started screening patients in our Phase 3 program for relamorelin, our ghrelin agonist for diabetic gastroparesis. This is an area of high unmet medical need where no new treatment options have been available for several decades.","As I have outlined, we have made significant progress in delivering and advancing our pipeline in 2017. We are well on our way to achieving our goals for the year while simultaneously prioritizing our pipeline activities to ensure we are efficiently and prudently investing in our long-term growth drivers. As always, I thank our global Allergan R&D team for their continued commitment to advancing the programs and for the work ahead for the patients we serve.","I will now turn the call over to Tessa.","Maria Teresa Hilado - Allergan Plc","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Turning to our overall results for the third quarter of 2017 on slide 16.","In the third quarter, we delivered another solid quarter of year-over-year performance. Net revenues were $4.03 billion, an 11.4% increase versus prior year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the third quarter was 86.1%, which was negatively impacted by product mix, including the Regenerative Medicine products and CoolSculpting, in line with our expectations.","Despite lower gross margins, non-GAAP operating margin was 48.8% in the third quarter of 2017, a sequential improvement from the second quarter, but a decline of 50 basis points versus prior-year period, primarily as a result of, one, higher non-GAAP R&D expenses versus a year ago as we continue to advance the pipeline; two, increased non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses, primarily from the addition of Regenerative Medicine and CoolSculpting, partially offset by lower spend in our general medicine segments; and finally higher non-GAAP G&A spend. However, note that excluding the impact from foreign exchange, G&A expenses decreased by approximately 9% versus prior year due to tight expense management.","Non-GAAP net interest expense in the quarter was lower versus last year, as our debt balance has been substantially reduced due to the debt paydown of approximately $9.4 billion beginning in the third quarter of 2016. Performance net income per share of $4.15 reflects growth of 25% versus prior year, driven by revenue growth, lower interest expense, and share count reduction, partially offset by a higher tax rate and a lower operating margin. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 13.1% in the quarter, in line with expectations.","During the quarter, we recorded approximately $5.4 billion in impairment charges on a GAAP basis, including $1.3 billion relating to the impairment of our holding in Teva securities, which is included as a component of other income expense. These charges were primarily caused by the impairment of RESTASIS and the impairment of ACZONE, driven by the recent market conditions that Bill discussed.","Cash flow from operations for the third quarter remained strong at approximately $1.47 billion. Excluding R&D acquisitions, restructuring charges, and other one-time payments, adjusted cash flow from operations was $1.63 billion. Our GAAP financial metrics and reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP metrics can be found in our earnings release issued this morning and posted on our website. In addition, we have provided more detail on our movements in cash and marketable securities in the appendix.","Turning now to our third quarter performance by segment results on slide 17. U.S. Specialized Therapeutics revenues were $1.73 billion for the quarter, continuing strong double-digit growth of 18.7% versus the prior-year period. U.S. Specialized Therapeutics is the highest contribution margin segment, mainly attributed to strong gross margins. The decline of 360 basis points versus last year was primarily due to lower margins from Regenerative Medicine and CoolSculpting additions.","In our U.S. General Medicine business, third quarter revenues were $1.5 billion, a growth of 0.6% versus prior-year period. U.S. General Medicine contribution margin improved 220 basis points this quarter versus prior year, due to actions taken to appropriately manage our costs.","International third quarter revenues continued to experience double-digit growth, ex exchange, at 14%. International contribution margin declined from 55.4% to 54.3% due to increase in selling expense to support higher revenues and the acquisitions of the Regenerative Medicine and CoolSculpting businesses.","Turning to slide 18, we ended the quarter in a strong capital position, with total debt of approximately $30.3 billion and a gross debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 3.9 times and 3.2 times on a net basis. We will pay our contractual maturities, which will further reduce debt, by an additional $3.8 billion in the first quarter of 2018. In the third quarter, our cash and marketable securities were impacted primarily by the change in market value of Teva shares, offset by strong operating cash flows. In line with our commitment to sell the Teva shares in a measured approach, we anticipate starting to sell the securities in the next several days, and we expect to complete the selling of the shares in 2018.","Turning to slide 19. With solid execution and strong cash flow generation in the first three quarters, we remain confident in our outlook for the remainder of the year. As such, we are narrowing our 2017 full-year revenue and non-GAAP performance net income per share guidance to a range of $16.15 to $16.45 from the prior range of $16.05 to $16.45. In summary, we are on track for a strong 2017, and we are very pleased with our 2017 results thus far.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Brent for closing remarks.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah, thank you, Tessa. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we are facing some very specific challenges right now with future LOEs. You can rest assured we will take all necessary actions to mitigate against these headwinds in the near term and position the company for future growth. I want to make it clear: We will do what is needed to manage our business to create value.","Let me also note, because I may have misspoken in the prepared script, that we will remain disciplined in our capital allocations. We plan to reserve excess free cash flow for returning cash to shareholders.","Look, the fundamentals of our business are strong, and our team is executing. Three consecutive quarters of top and bottom line growth, we are generating strong free cash flow, and our pipeline is moving forward. There is a lot to look forward to at Allergan. With that, let's open up the line for Q&A. Brandy?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Chris Schott of JPMorgan.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much for the question. So, Brent, your stock appears very undervalued, at least in our view, and seems like much of the dialog in the story has been centered around either patent expirations or smaller, older products versus the core aesthetics BOTOX franchise. So can you talk a little bit about, one, how you're thinking about the levers that you have available to improve stock performance; two, do you think the portfolio as it's structured makes sense or is the company too broadly positioned; and, three, if we don't see better performance in the stock, would you be open to the idea of splitting the company or selling off additional businesses to unlock what seems like pretty significant trapped value here? Thanks very much.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah. Hold on, Chris, I'm just writing those down, so I get them, since you gave me so much at once. So, look, thank you for the question. I absolutely agree with your first statement; our stock is undervalued. I understand the focus on the LOEs. That does make sense to me. That's why we're trying to provide some clarity or a framework for our investors to think about those LOEs as they impact us in 2018 through 2019, and hopefully that will give some perspective. Clearly, we'll provide more details when we provide 2018 guidance in early 2018. And so there's that look forward to.","But, look, I think, the best way for us to focus in the short term on improving the stock is to continue to focus on driving execution within the business, to continue to do what we did this quarter, put up strong sales growth, strong non-GAAP net performance income growth, strong free cash flow generation. Those are all very important fundamentals that show the health of the underlying business.","I think the second mission we have is what I mentioned in the script, which is reducing costs to prepare for any scenario, even if they're conservative, with respect to the LOEs, namely RESTASIS. And this team, I think, has \u2013 it will be a lot of work, but this team is up for it. We've done it before. We know how to do it. I hate to say that we know how to take costs out of the business, but we do. And we know how to do that in a way that protects the long-term growth drivers. So we're in the planning stages, and we will be implementing something as soon as we complete our planning. But rest assured, we will do it rapidly.","I think in terms of the portfolio, I think it does make sense. I think we have the right portfolio. Our focus on our big four therapeutic areas: Medical Aesthetics, CNS, GI, and Eye Care, are all the right place for us to focus. Our Eye Care business, even without RESTASIS, is a $2 billion global business. It's our legacy. It's something we're deeply committed to.","And I think the last thing I would say with respect to splitting the company, that's not on the table. We have a strategy. We're focused on executing against it. We don't have religious conviction about whether or not you should or shouldn't split the company. We obviously have been bold and sold large businesses in the past, like our generics business last year, which was a lot of work. But right now, we think this is the right configuration for the long term to drive growth. That being said, if over time we think our views change, we're not afraid to take that action. But you should recognize splitting the company is several years of work, or at least a few years of work, and that's not something that we're focused on right now.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Maris at Wells Fargo.","David Maris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. A couple questions, first on the bimatoprost SR, what sort of marketing research have you done on this? Because I think a lot of people consider it just a niche product. So I want to understand, is this something that you think will be a mainstream glaucoma treatment? And then separately, Tessa, the uptick in receivables and inventories, was that largely related to acquisitions during the quarter or during the year? Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah. So, David, maybe I'll take try to take the first question. Bill or David, feel free to chime in. Yeah, I think with respect to bimatoprost SR, we know the eye care market really well. We know the glaucoma market even better. And clearly there's a need for novel treatments and advances in treatments for geographic atrophy and the like. That being said, we haven't invested a lot of money in market research on bimatoprost SR because it's a very early and I would say relatively high-risk, as I've always maintained, program. And when we get the data, we'll decide whether or not it's worth doing. I think David wants \u2013 you want to chime in, David?","C. David Nicholson, Ph.D. - Allergan Plc","Yeah, I just wanted to say that bimatoprost SR for glaucoma, we're running these two studies. And we've completed enrollment in one, and we'll complete the enrollment in the second one next year. And I think Bill wants to talk a little bit about the market potential for this type of formulation for glaucoma.","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Yeah. David, I think \u2013 you know that Brent was thinking you said brimonidine DDS, not bimatoprost SR.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","That's right.","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Here's how I would think about it. There's 2 million to 3 million people on glaucoma drops right now. All the drops are pretty effective at lowering IOP. Innovation in this area is going to stem around new delivery technologies, whether it be surgical procedures, minimally invasive surgical procedures, or in this case an implant. And if we can provide, based on the studies, IOP control and IOP lowering over let's say a four- to six-month period, you're essentially solving the number one problem that glaucoma specialists are solving for, which is noncompliance.","There's no issues with the molecules out there; there's an issue with taking them \u2013 and even when people do take them, it's not easy to administer a drop. And so I think it's going to be \u2013 I think you could see this market move \u2013 right now is it 30%, 40% \u2013 to a non-drop alternative, and I like the idea that we have a surgical procedure in XEN, which we're building right now, and then potentially with SR.","And that's how I'd look at the glaucoma business. We also of course have a bimatoprost ring, and so there's a supermarket of options here that would be non-drop alternatives. And as long as the injection procedure is simple and the benefit-risk ratio is high, this is a great way to preserve that business.","Maria Teresa Hilado - Allergan Plc","David, on your question on receivables and inventory, you're right. Versus prior year, receivables and inventory is up actually due to LifeCell and ZELTIQ. But if you look at the prior quarter, receivables are actually right about the same, and inventory is down. This is one that we clearly focus on from a working capital perspective to ensure that our cash flow generation is strong.","David Maris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Thanks, David.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Cacciatore of Cowen & Company.","Ken Cacciatore - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you. Brent, one of the areas that you indicated to mitigate the impact of RESTASIS, you say, is to deploy the balance sheet. So just trying to dig down into that a little bit more, if you're thinking more business development; sounds like that might be the case. And some folks are indicating they want to see more of a focus on debt paydown, even maybe accelerating it, although you have a lot coming up in Q1. So can you talk about balancing those two views as you think about future capital deployment? Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah, absolutely. Thanks for the question, Ken. We have, for the last few years, talked about business development as stepping-stone-like transactions. And I think we've been very consistent in delivering on stepping-stone transactions, whether they be accretive deals like LifeCell or ZELTIQ, or R&D based deals that supported our open science model and in our therapeutic areas.","When we look at the future, I would say that over the next several months, until we have a better handle on RESTASIS, we will take a pause from stepping-stone deals. That doesn't mean that if we saw something strategically compelling and relatively manageable, we wouldn't evaluate and look at it. But we're going to add an extra layer of discipline and focus to preserve cash to return to shareholders, and that could include future buybacks, as a good example.","Ken Cacciatore - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Maybe on the debt, too. We have been paying down lot of debt since Teva closed, Ken. We paid down about $10 billion in debt. We're going to pay another close to $4 billion in the first quarter of this year. Breaking away from the contractual maturities versus doing it when they naturally mature can be expensive. But we'll continue to look at that opportunistically and see if there are areas where we can excel at paying down debt, and that's something we always are looking at.","Maria Teresa Hilado - Allergan Plc","And if I could add, Ken. I mean, that's definitely a focus for us. As you know, we did some debt liability management actions this year that reduced interest expense by actually issuing in euro and paying down U.S. debt. We also accelerated debt paydown in the second quarter ahead of the debt maturity, so that's clearly a focus for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin of Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Brent, just if I can go back to the earlier question on sort of trying to understand the strategic direction of the company. It sounds like you're pretty much saying you are pleased with the strategic direction of the company, that you're not really contemplating a major shakeup or a reshaping of the portfolio. And I just wanted to make sure that I understood you correctly.","And just if I can move on to a different topic, there's been a lot of discussion around drug distribution and alternative forms of drug distribution. Just wondering if you've had any discussion with other companies regarding this, if you see new alternative models or potential new entrants into the drug distribution business? Thanks very much.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah. Thanks, Jami. I think you heard me right: We are pleased, or comfortable, with the strategic makeup and direction of the company. Yes, we're facing some LOEs, but we're not the first nor will we be the last biopharmaceutical company to have to deal with loss of exclusivities on products. That in and of itself is not a reason to change course, I think, strategically. We are prepared to deal with and manage through the loss of exclusivity. We know how to do that, and that in and of itself doesn't, I think, require a change in strategic direction.","That being said, we always look at our strategies for refresh or resetting, and that's generally based on factors like market dynamics, advances in science, and competitive threats. LOEs factor in, but they're a very minor factor in changing strategic direction. So I think you heard me correctly.","With respect to drug distribution, obviously there's been a lot of talk about Amazon entering the space, looking at the potential for a CVS-Aetna deal and what that will do as they are a large part of the ecosystem on drug distribution. So my sense is that the whole ecosystem is ripe for some disruption to figure out a way to do it more efficiently, to do it more conveniently for patients, to better manage compliance and persistence. The CVSes and Walgreens of the world have done a nice job in terms of compliance and persistence. But I think if you even spoke with them, they're always looking for new ways to make improvements and have better touch points with the patients and consumers.","So, yeah, I do think that just like science is disrupted with gene therapy or novel treatments, I think the drug distribution channel also should be disrupted with improvements based on technology or efficiency.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Risinger of Morgan Stanley.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","David? Are you on mute?","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Sorry about that. Yes, my apologies. So I have just a couple of financial questions. The first is could you just explain what the Street's missing with respect to cost-cutting opportunities at Allergan? I think the Street has thought of Allergan as being pretty efficient, given how you've run businesses in the past, and if you could talk about the areas of cost-cutting ahead.","And then just a quick question for Tessa. On the deferred tax liabilities on the balance sheet at $12.7 billion, could you just frame the prospects for future tax payments? And I'm not sure if there was a payment in the second quarter related to that to reduce that amount, but that's why I'm asking the question, just to understand how we should think about future tax payments. Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah. So to the first part of the question, maybe I'll make some remarks and ask Bill to also weigh in. I don't know what the Street's thinking in terms of cost cutting. I can tell you that we are in the planning phases, and we do see potential opportunities to even become more efficient.","And, look, I think the reality of the situation is when you have the LOE burden that we will likely have in 2018, RESTASIS plus the other products, that's what we get paid for as management. We need to manage this business to protect our shareholders while not sacrificing future growth. And that's something that we as a management team have started debating. We have lots of plans that we evaluated earlier in the year. We're now going through those in fine detail. And you can expect us to move on those rapidly. But there's always trade-offs to be made, and that's what \u2013 they're difficult decisions, but those are the things that leadership needs to do in times like this when you have the headwinds that we're going to have next year.","Bill, you want to \u2013 ?","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Yeah. The only thing I would add is, listen, it has to be done carefully. I think Brent described it well. The underlying business here is a growth business, and we have to protect and we will protect catalysts. But keep in mind that we just passed through a 12- to 18-month period where we launched roughly a dozen new products or line extensions. And so the investment level over the past year, year and a half, has been fairly high. And for some of those businesses, the investment level's got to be moderated, whether it's because of results or because a product's at a different point in its life cycle.","And the only other comment I'd make is, we're one of the largest direct-to-consumer advertisers in the industry. A big part of our DTC budget is national television advertising, and there are social media and other analytics techniques that are emerging, I think, that are going to allow us to do that a lot more efficiently. Without getting into specific plans for product lines, as efficiently as I think we run this operation, there's room to make some changes.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Tessa, you want to take the deferred tax liability?","Maria Teresa Hilado - Allergan Plc","Yes. David, so our GAAP deferred tax liability is really primarily related to the valuation of intangible assets acquired through business acquisitions. As we pointed out, our balance sheet is largely a fair valued balance sheet. Just to be clear, this is a GAAP liability, not a cash liability. And therefore the liability will actually be relieved over the amortization of the useful life of the intangible assets.","With regards to your question on taxes this quarter, there were no cash payments in the quarter related to deferred taxes. Happy to talk about that offline, too, because I'd love to talk about deferred taxes.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","I'd suggest you guys spend more time on that off \u2013 yeah. Anything else in that topic, or was that clear?","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","No, that's great. Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","All right. Thanks, Dave.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Liav Abraham of Citi.","Liav Abraham - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning. So just going back to slide 5, where you framed the RESTASIS LOE impact. Can you just give a few more specifics? Do the $15 and $16, or at least $15 and at least $16, numbers assume erosion of ESTRACE, DELZICOL, ACZONE, the other products that you call out, and to what extent? And do these EPS estimates also assume cost-cutting? And maybe you can be more specific about that. And then what are the underlying \u2013 the operating and free cash flow assumptions, or your estimates for operating and free cash flow under each of these scenarios? Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah. So let me answer the first part, and then Tessa can take the remainder. Thanks, Liav.","So, look, on the slide 5, we tried to give you a floor, right, of where we see non-GAAP performance net income under two scenarios. I believe they're conservative, and clearly the January 1 scenario is the most conservative. But keep in mind, we need to run a business. And given that we don't know exactly how RESTASIS will ultimately sort itself out, we have to take the actions irregardless of either scenario to protect the P&L. And so that will play out as it will and we'll ultimately see where we go with RESTASIS, but this team will take action irregardless.","That being said, with the other LOEs, I think the best way to think about timing on each one \u2013 and let's just take them one at a time. We view ESTRACE as a Q1 event. We view NAMENDA XR to date \u2013 these are all for planning purposes only. We view NAMENDA XR as a Q1 event. We view DELZICOL as a early Q2 event. And we view ACZONE as already happened. And so that's probably the best framework to think around timing of those things. And I think for most of those, generic erosion will be fairly normalized typical generic erosion patterns. I don't see anything particularly unique about those in terms of an erosion curve.","Maria Teresa Hilado - Allergan Plc","Yes. To further give you a framework, so we provided you a framework for RESTASIS assuming January 1 and July 1. We will provide you more detailed guidance for 2019 next year, including our assumptions on revenue and margins.","With regards, Liav, to your question on cash flow, so the impact of RESTASIS, assuming the more conservative scenario of January 1, excluding any benefits from cost mitigation and cash restructuring charges, is about $700 million to $800 million.","I also want to be clear that with regards to margins, given the LOEs in 2019, that's something that from a framework standpoint and detail we'll provide you next year.","Liav Abraham - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Thanks, Liav.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gregg Gilbert of Deutsche Bank.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes, hi. Back to you, Tessa, on cash flow from ops. I don't think I heard an update this quarter on your \u2013 any update to the guidance you gave last quarter for cash flow from ops for the year. And I think the last time you said it, it implies a big range for 4Q. So could you tighten that up?","And then perhaps for Bill and\/or David, how are you viewing the longer-term competitive threat from a longer-acting toxin? I believe Revance has some Phase 3 data coming in the next couple months, and in Phase 2 they showed a five- to six-month duration of action. Can you talk about the long-term threat?","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah, why don't we answer that question; we'll come back to Tessa for the cash flow. Bill, you want to talk about, or David, about longer-acting toxins or other competitive entries?","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Yeah, I just would say first we have to really look at the data and understand whether or not there's a longer-acting concept there. I will tell you, it'll have a place. I think in the aesthetic space, it could have a place. There's an awful lot of work to do if you want to carve out a position on the therapeutic side of the business.","When I think about BOTOX right now, for us, the focus has got to be on market expansion. We have a 65%-plus share, we have an iconic brand, two-thirds of our users are enrolled in the Allergan loyalty program, we have data and approval for three different uses or areas of the face. And if we're worried about smaller toxins entering the category, then we frankly haven't done our job to grow this market. We have a multibillion-dollar business, it's growing at a double-digit rate, and we penetrated less than 10% of all the consumers that are aware of our products and want to use them. They just don't know how and when. And I think that's what we're going to focus on.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","David, anything you'd want to add around the longer-acting toxins?","C. David Nicholson, Ph.D. - Allergan Plc","Yeah. Maybe just a couple of points. Clearly at Allergan we've got the most comprehensive toxin program of anybody in the industry. We have in our pipeline various of (51:13) R&D, we have toxins of different molecular weights. We're looking and understanding how to modulate the duration of activity of toxins, be it by looking at dose responses or spreading of toxins. We have topical toxins, and we're looking at liquid formulations of toxins. So whilst obviously we need to see the Revance data in detail and look at the Phase 3 data when we get the complete data set, I do think we've got a very competitive pipeline ourselves of toxins.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah, I would just add before I turn it over to Tessa, I think the other thing people should be thoughtful around is that toxins aren't interchangeable. They all spread and act differently in the face. And it could be that if you increase the dosage of a toxin, you could get a different outcome or compromise the outcome that you would have gotten if you were used to injecting BOTOX.","And so there's a lot of loyalty amongst users of toxins because they get accustomed to the outcome they get from the way they inject the toxin they're used to injecting. And so there is some additional stickiness, if you will, around the market. And that needs to be factored in as well.","Maria Teresa Hilado - Allergan Plc","Yeah, so we indicated that we would generate $3 billion to $4 billion in adjusted operating cash flow for the back half of the year, so we're very proud, obviously, of our cash flow generation this quarter, $1.5 billion reported and $1.6 billion adjusted. Given Q4 is our highest-revenue quarter for the year, and assuming no M&A or other restructuring charges, we would expect that our cash flow generation on an adjusted basis would be better than that in Q3, and we would, therefore, definitely be within the range of $3 billion to $4 billion in the back half.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Thanks, Gregg. Next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vamil Divan of Credit Suisse.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Great. Thanks so much. Just want to take a question on the pipeline if I could. Just on the CGRPs, you mentioned the liver safety monitoring board met in October. Are there any other looks that you expect to be doing before we get the final data in the first half of next year? And if you could just remind us or give exactly what they've had access to as they've done their analysis, and what they've seen so far.","And then if I could squeeze one another one in, just on the VRAYLAR Refuse to File. I know you mentioned you will be meeting with them in December, and so I'm sure we'll hear more after that. But just \u2013 can you give us some initial sense on what it is that the FDA is looking for? Is it more clinical data? Is it more data from U.S. patients? And just why was this sort of found out after you filed the application as opposed to being known before you did? Thanks so much.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah. So I'll ask David to provide some context around both of those answers.","C. David Nicholson, Ph.D. - Allergan Plc","Yeah, sure. Great questions. Thanks. Regarding the CGRPs, so as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, ubrogepant will get the data from the acute studies in the first half of next year. And clearly those are going to be really important efficacy data for us, and we're really looking forward to those singular-tack efficacy studies. And we'll get the Phase 2b efficacy data for atogepant in the first half of next year as well.","A lot of interest, of course, in the liver safety. What we've been doing is to look at the liver safety data from placebo patients across therapeutic areas. So we've looked at the TransCelerate industry database, and there were 71 studies in that database involving 12,000 patients who received placebo. And 1.4% of those placebo-treated patients showed elevations of ALT and AST equal to or above three times upper limit of normal, 1.4%. The last time the DSMB for ubrogepant looked at the data cut \u2013 and this is blinded, so I don't know what was placebo and what was ubrogepant \u2013 but only 0.3% of patients in those studies had elevations of liver enzymes greater than or equal to three times upper limit of normal. So 1.4% placebo, 0.3% ubrogepant studies.","In the atogepant patients, 1% of patients had liver enzyme elevations greater than or equal to three times upper limit of normal. So, again, less than the percentage that we see in the TransCelerate industry database of placebo-treated patients. So, so far, liver safety is looking good for both ubrogepant and atogepant.","Yeah, regarding VRAYLAR, we've had a lot of interactions with the FDA about the negative symptom study. We are going to continue to challenge the FDA, and we have requested a Type A meeting, which we will have with them in December to further understand the reasoning for the Refusal to File letter and how we can further progress negative symptoms with the agency. Does that answer your questions?","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah. We can go to the next question. Thank you.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Fine.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ronny Gal of Bernstein.","Aharon Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. If I can sneak two here \u2013 first, Brent, about the cost structure, can we just expect you guys, at least as a planning basis, to hold operating expense at flat at better in 2018? And I think you've made some comments in the past about primary care participation and the conditions of that, if you can give us your thought there. And second, on the pipeline, Esmya, now that it's filed, should we expect an AdCom on this issue of limit of the number of cycles? Or is the FDA going to make a decision on this internally?","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah. So on the cost question \u2013 and then David can answer the AdCom question. As I think I told you before, Ronny, we had scenario-planned for this eventuality, for a negative ruling from the District Court. We are now in the final stages of planning \u2013 or finalizing our planning stage. We're not going to announce the cost-cutting specifics on this call. You can stay tuned. We will do that, and sometime this year, but we need to get our internal structure finalized here. And so we're close, but not quite ready to announce it. So I'm going to have to defer the question. But I would say we will do it, and will do it rapidly. And people should rest assured we know what we're doing.","With respect to the pipeline, David, I think you mentioned it in your prepared remarks, but maybe just a little more color around the AdCom.","C. David Nicholson, Ph.D. - Allergan Plc","Yeah, sure. Happy to give some more color, Brent. So in the U.S. studies, Ronny, as you probably know, the Phase 3 studies involved treating patients for one and two three-month cycles with a drug holiday. The European data, which we also included in our NDA submission, involved treating patients with uterine fibroids for multiple cycles. And in Europe as well as in Canada, Esmya is indicated for chronic intermittent use in the treatment of abnormal bleeding with uterine fibroids. In the U.S., we have requested approval without limitations on the duration of therapy. And the FDA have told us that at the moment, they are not planning an Advisory Committee, and continue to expect approval in 2018.","Aharon Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Marc Goodman of UBS.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. International business, obviously, has been strong. Brent, can you talk about the continued spending that you're thinking about for the next couple of years? Obviously, you've been spending double-digit increases, but you're getting a massive return on the top line. How do you think about what needs to take place over the next couple years? Or have you kind of done the spending that's necessary to plant the seeds and we're going to see even better margins in that side of the business?","And then second question, I think it was Bill who mentioned LINZESS, high single-digit growth for the next couple of years. I guess, were you speaking of volume growth? And second of all, it seems high single digits is a little bit lighter than where it's been. Just wondering why you're being so conservative from that standpoint? Thanks.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah, sure. Thanks, Marc. I think with respect to where we spend, we spend exactly as you suggested, where we get the highest return. And the art or science of cost management or cost reductions exercises is just that. It's taking away from the lower-return-on-investment spend and putting it squarely on the higher-return-on-investment spend.","And so things like Medical Aesthetics, the new product launches, drugs like VRAYLAR, the international businesses certainly are showing a higher return on investment, just as a general matter. And so you can expect that we would continue to direct more of our resources there and perhaps less to some of the established brands that I think Bill showed you in one of his charts. And that's just the art or science of doing a cost reduction program in an appropriate way versus other companies that just assign a flat reduction across the board, which is easier to do and very clear, but I think that standardized approach is not the right way to do cost cutting in a high-growth business, which is what the base business is here. And so we will do it -","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","I guess what I'm really asking is if you looked at Brazil or Turkey or of any of these high-growth areas, do you have the infrastructure in place now and you can start to leverage that? Or you've just begun, and \u2013 ?","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yes. No, no. I think, look, selectively there may be some pockets of places, but it would be fairly de minimis. Really, when you look at \u2013 take China, up over 60% this year, we made an investment last year to increase our field force. Recently we've upgraded some talent in some key positions around the world. And we feel that, with maybe a few minor exceptions, we really do have the resources that will allow that growth to not only continue, but hopefully accelerate in select markets over the next few years.","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Listen, as it relates to LINZESS, I think about it over a multiyear period, and that's why I commented on high single-digit growth. You're right; the business is in great shape right now. I mean, we're up \u2013 demand for the quarter was up on IMS terms 17%, which is very impressive for a business that's on the market for five years. And we shored up formulary coverage this year. And of course that offset some of that demand growth, but over several years, with the front part of that period being higher and the back end of that period being a little bit lower.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore.","Umer Raffat - Evercore ISI","Hi, guys. Thanks so much for taking my question. I actually wanted to focus in 2018, and I had three parts to that. So first, perhaps for Brent and Bill, so not on LOEs, but my question is when you think about forecasting 2018, are you factoring in or thinking about factoring in a double-digit growth on BOTOX Therapeutic despite CGRP MAb launch? So again, I'm focusing on the assumption, not the expectation on BOTOX Migraine.","Tessa, the cash milestones you show on slide 23, should we assume those milestones will come out of non-GAAP going forward?","And then finally, David, I understand that you made comments recently in investor meetings on an ultra-pure DARPin. I was curious, where did the ultra-pure DARPin come from, as well as do you think that ultrapure can deliver inflammation rates of under 3%? Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah, so thanks, Umer, for the question. Just to be clear, we're not giving 2018 guidance. We've tried to provide a framework for investors to think about the LOEs. When we will do guidance for 2018 in a normal course, Q4, perhaps we'll bring that forward to an investor conference. But that's the current thinking with guidance.","I think the impact of CGRP on BOTOX Therapeutic for migraine, Bill, you could certainly comment on that, though.","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Yeah, listen, it'll be second half of the year event. It's going to take time for Amgen and the other companies to secure formulary coverage. As you know, Umer, when you look at the data between BOTOX and the CGRPs, they're both very effective treatment options, I'll put it that way. I think the CGRP class has a great deal of potential.","I see the two treatments coexisting. As successful as we've been with BOTOX, we've only scratched the surface. We have under 200,000 people receiving it for migraine. Depending on how you want to define that market, 3 million to 5 million people suffer from migraine. And so my sense is that there's going to be a nice expansion.","The economics around BOTOX are of course \u2013 for practices, for neurology practices \u2013 are different than they are for the CGRPs. I don't get a sense that someone who's very satisfied managing their migraines on BOTOX is going to be switched. And, remember, as important as migraine is to BOTOX, it's 40% of our business. And there may be some interruption in growth with a new class of drugs launching for a couple quarters, but I still think that this is a pretty solid business for us, or a very solid business, over the next several years, even with the CGRPs.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","So, David, do you want to...","C. David Nicholson, Ph.D. - Allergan Plc","Yeah. Thanks, Umer. Yes, regarding abicipar. Look, it's absolutely normal with these types of biologics to continue to refine their production process over time, to refine the analytics, to identify impurities, and to enhance the purification process to remove any impurities. We saw this happening with other VEGF inhibitors, which are used for ocular disorders, and we are continuing to do this with abicipar. So of course we will have purer and purer abicipar over time. We will see what impact this has on the incidence of ocular inflammation. It'd be pure speculation to talk about percentage.","Operator","Your next question comes from Elliot Wilbur of Raymond James.","Elliot Wilbur - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. Just want to ask a follow-up question around the expectations on the RESTASIS LOE impact in 2018, timing issues aside. Just want a little bit more of your perspective on the shape of the curve. So it's really kind of a twofold question. The multi-dose preservative-free, I think, has about 15% share of the market, and that's been increasing about 100 basis points per month. So I'm wondering if you expect that to increase into potential generic entry, whether or not you believe you can accelerate it, and then how defensible that would be with generics on the market?","And then as a follow-up to that, if there is a generic entry, obviously, from one of the companies you haven't yet settled with, how does that impact the timing of entry from the companies that you have settled with? And I guess the questions really \u2013 is, are those settlements and entry dependent upon those companies actually getting FDA approval? Or are there supply agreements as part of those settlements that would basically bring one or more or all of those players into the market simultaneously with the first launch? Thanks.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah. So thanks for the question on RESTASIS. Maybe there was a question that we forgot to question on Umer's list about the milestones. So maybe, Tessa, you could quickly address that, and then we'll come back to your RESTASIS questions.","Maria Teresa Hilado - Allergan Plc","Yeah. So first very quickly, the schedule we provided in the appendix are success-based milestones. So there's really no guarantee all that cash would be paid out. Having said, that we would be happy to pay that cash, given the success of those milestones.","With regards to your question on how we would treat it, we have no plans to change the treatment of milestone payments. We've been very consistent from a policy perspective. The disclosures are very clear, and so we have no plans to change our accounting treatment.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","And then maybe Bill can comment on defending with the multi-dose.","The one thing I would just say is the scenario planning that we provided on the LOEs was designed to be clearly more conservative. And that would include the kind of typical generic erosion that you would see in a launch. Whether or not \u2013 because it's ophthalmology or whether or not because we had the multi-dose preservative-free may change the slope of that curve, but that's not really fully factored into our analysis. I don't know, Bill. You want to add some comments to that?","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","I would just add consumers prefer the MDPF configuration. I think that 15% is going to continue to climb. But as Brent said, for planning assumptions, we're taking a conservative outlook on it.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","But I think clearly, we're going to continue to try to make that available to consumers and to patients, because it's something that from an administration perspective is a much better way of delivering the drop to the eye versus the single dose, so. You had also asked about the other settlements. I'll ask Bob Bailey, our Chief Legal Counsel, to perhaps comment on that.","A. Robert D. Bailey - Allergan Plc","Yeah. So on the question of a launch-at-risk scenario, because I think that's what you're describing, where one or more of the players, one or more of the generics, was able to obtain approval from FDA. Whether others would be able to follow, either with their own product or with an AG, an authorized generic product supplied by us, is confidential. And so we're not in a position to comment on that from the overall settlement structures. The question really is once one of the generic manufacturers opens the market, or opens the approval process, will others able to follow quickly with their own product? And that really is a question that should be addressed to the generic manufacturers themselves.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Finkelstein of Susquehanna.","Andrew Finkelstein - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you could just address, number one, KYBELLA, where you noted lower promotion year on year, and I know there's some comp with the launch, but how you're thinking about investment in that franchise. And then in terms of compounders of marketed drugs, any thoughts on sort of the spreading of that phenomenon? And what kind of impact it's having both in terms of the marketplace and how you approach formularies for coverage of some of the drugs? Thanks.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah. So, Bill, you want to take KYBELLA?","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Yes, listen, KYBELLA financially is trading a little bit below expectations. We know that. Strategically, it's very strong. We have one of the largest, as you know, facial injectable offerings in the world. This is part of it. The body contouring market over the next several years, both for the face and the rest of the body, is going to continue to develop. I think the use of KYBELLA is still being \u2013 there's a lot of training still happening, and physicians are learning how and where to use the product to selectively reduce fat. The real positive here is we have the infrastructure in place to support KYBELLA. It's part of the facial injectable team. And I think it's going to be a steady contributor over time.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah. I think with respect to compounders, it's an issue we have to watch carefully and closely. There is a blurry line there, and we need to make sure that policymakers, regulators, and politicians keep an eye on making sure that compounders do what's appropriate and not try to substitute or find an alternative pathway to launching drugs without the full oversight and review that the FDA has for medicines. And that's the balancing act. And we certainly are engaged in that discussion as appropriate. And I think other biopharmaceutical companies should pay attention to it and stay on top of it.","Andrew Finkelstein - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Douglas Tsao of Barclays.","Douglas Tsao - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. If you could maybe, Bill, maybe provide some updates on VIBERZI. I think you noted sort of performance isn't where you want it to be. What's your sense that the sort of safety warning or communication from earlier this year and sort of label change has been a little bit of an overhang for the product performance?","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Yeah, you're exactly right. We have a lot of reeducation to do. VIBERZI got off to a fast start. As you know, we've launched into IBS before, and we had a pretty good handle on things. We had a label change. We have to reeducate both primary care physicians and gastroenterologists on safety and on which patients are the best patients. We're doing it right now. We've been adding new patients and new writers on a weekly basis.","And while we were pretty much stable third quarter over second quarter, third quarter for the market was down versus the second quarter. I would expect over the next two quarters that we're going start to see movement, most importantly on new prescriptions. We have new data on the utility of VIBERZI with Imodium users. We continue to run DTC. And then at the end of two quarters we're going to reevaluate it.","But I'm still positive in terms of this being a part of the GI business. We just have to get past this label change and make sure that everyone's aware of which patients it can be used in and which ones it shouldn't be used in.","Douglas Tsao - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, great. And then just as a follow-up question. In terms of the performance of the fillers business, how much is coming from new products versus growth with the sort of legacy product suite?","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Yeah. We definitely saw a great reception from our Vycross line, which is made up of Voluma, Volbella, and Vollure. And I think we're most optimistic about the utility of Vollure moving forward. If you talk to most plastic surgeons and derms, they'll tell you it's probably the most versatile filler in our product line.","I don't have the split. My guess, it's probably 50-50. I think the base business, JUV\u00c9DERM, JUV\u00c9DERM Plus, are contributing half the growth, and the balance is coming from the three new fillers that we launched in the United States. We also have a fourth one in the international business, Volite, which is for skin quality. And so it's a pretty \u2013 I would think about it as a balanced growth story.","Douglas Tsao - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And then if I could jump in with one final quick question. Any impact in the aesthetics business from the hurricanes?","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Nothing at this point that I would describe as material. If you take a look at BOTOX, JUV\u00c9DERM, CoolSculpting, implants, and ALLODERM, they're all up 10% to 20% in the quarter versus prior year. And so I think we had a pretty solid three months as it relates to aesthetics.","Douglas Tsao - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Great. I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Randall Stanicky of RBC.","Randall S. Stanicky - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks, Brent. Your message on not wanting to split the business up was pretty clear. But can you help us understand some of the synergies that might be less obvious? For example, how does selling GI and aesthetics on the same platform help you sell both better? And then, as an alternative to splitting the business up, which is arguably a very big strategic move, would you consider selling off some assets that perhaps are not growth additive or assets that you consider less core at this point? Thanks.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah. So thanks, Randall. I hope I didn't say that selling GI products and selling BOTOX or Medical Aesthetics products are synergistic. Clearly, they both \u2013 they provide diversification. And certainly infrastructure costs can be spread across both businesses.","But where we do see some overlap is in neuroscience, where BOTOX Therapeutic is frankly larger than BOTOX Aesthetic, and we sell it in neurology, we sell it in our headache business, we'll have the \u2013 hopefully \u2013 oral CGRPs in a year to complement BOTOX Migraine. And so that's where we see more of a synergistic between \u2013 specifically between BOTOX and the therapeutic side of the business.","I think that for now, the better way to think about Allergan is as a diversified, durable biopharma company with an LOE story in 2018 and an underlying business with strong growth. And so that's what we're going to focus on, and that's how we see the business for now. Again, not a religious conviction to it. If ultimately one of the things I mentioned earlier impact \u2013 or change the direction and strategy, then it won't impact a change in direction and strategy. But just simply having an LOE isn't in and of itself a reason to change our strategy, in my opinion.","I think with respect to selling businesses, we always are open-minded about selling non-core businesses. We've done it virtually every year I've been CEO. That being said, we're not out marketing a business for sale. We don't have any current plans to sell any business within the Allergan family. But if ultimately we determine it's non-core and someone's a better owner of that business, then we would make that decision.","Randall S. Stanicky - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks, Brent.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah. So let me just wrap up the call, again, by thanking everyone for participating. And I hope that you take away from this that while we have some very specific challenges with respect to LOEs in our immediate future, that you understand that this team is ready and willing to take all the necessary actions to mitigate against these headwinds and more importantly position this company for future growth.","We think that we have a strong fundamental business. I think this third quarter, again, demonstrates that our team is laser-focused on execution, on delivering on our commitments, and we look forward to trying to repeat that in the fourth quarter and for the full year. So thank you for joining us, and we look forward to talking to you in the future.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's conference.

Earlier this morning, we issued a press release reporting Allergan earnings from continuing operations for the fourth quarter and full year, ended December 31, 2015. The press release and our slide deck, which we're presenting this morning, are available on our corporate website at www.Allergan.com.","We're conducting a live webcast of this call, a replay of which will be available on our website after its conclusion. Please note that today's call is copyrighted material of Allergan and cannot be rebroadcast without the Company's express written consent.","Turning to slide 2, I'd also like to remind you that during the course of this call, management will make projections or other forward-looking remarks regarding future events or the future financial performance of the Company. It's important to note that such statements and events are forward-looking statements and reflect our current perspective of the business trends and information, as of today's date. Actual results may differ materially from current expectations and projections, depending on a number of factors affecting the Allergan business. These factors are detailed in our periodic public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Allergan disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as expressly required by law.","Turning to slide 3 and our agenda this morning, with us on today's call are Brent Saunders, our CEO and President, who will provide an overview of our fourth quarter and full-year business highlights. David Nicholson, our Executive Vice President and President of Global Brands R&D, who will provide highlights from our pipeline achievements in 2015 and upcoming milestones. And Tessa Hilado, our Chief Financial Officer will then discuss the Allergan fourth quarter continuing operations results in more detail.","Also on the call and available during the Q&A are Paul Bisaro, our Executive Chairman; Bob Stuart, President of Global Generics and Commercial Operations; Bill Meury, President of Branded Pharma; Paul Navarre, President of International Brands; Philippe Schaison, President of Allergan Medical and Bob Bailey, our Chief Legal Officer. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brent.","Brent Saunders","Thank you, Lisa and good morning, everyone. It great to be with you to review our results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2015. It has been a very exciting and successful 2015 for Allergan, as we continue to transform our business into a Growth Pharma leader.","Allergan's fourth quarter and full-year performance reflects a continued laser focus on executing on the four pillars of our growth strategy. First, operational excellence. We powered another quarter of exceptional financial performance, while successfully integrating Forest and Allergan. With the planned divestiture of our generics business to Teva, we're accelerating our transformation into a Growth Pharma leader.","Second, our focus on therapeutic area leadership has led to strong growing branded franchises with new product launches serving as a growth accelerator. Third, our productive and innovative R&D engine continues to produce at a record pace.","In 2015, we delivered four branded NME FDA approvals. That is nearly 10% of all such approvals by the Agency in 2015. With more than 70 mid to late stage programs in development, our branded pipeline is poised to continue to delivering innovative products for patients across our key therapeutic areas.","Our best-in-class generics R&D engine also finished the year strong, with 46 new ANDAs filed, including 22 first-to-file applications. And we're continuing to execute on strategic business development opportunities. Our Open Science model has helped us build or expand number one or two positions in many of our key therapeutic areas and has delivered significant R&D assets to build a sustainable pipeline. With our proposed combination with Pfizer, we're positioned to create the leading global biopharmaceutical company in the world.","Turning to slide 6, this year was highly transformative for Allergan, with the announced divestiture of our Global Generics business to Teva. We continue to make great progress on our planning efforts and Teva continues to make progress with regulatory authorities. We're working towards satisfying all conditions in order to close by the end of the first quarter of 2016; however it is possible that closing could slip beyond the end of the first quarter. I'm very proud of the tremendous focus and execution of our Global Generics team and we look forward to the combination of our two great generics businesses.","Slide 7. Now let me turn to the continuing operations business performance in the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter net revenue grew 74% on a year-over-year basis to $4.2 billion, as a result of the Allergan acquisition and strong global growth within all of our key therapeutic categories.","Strong sales in key products across our businesses drove a 33% increase in non-GAAP earnings per share to $3.41. Meanwhile, non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA rose to $2 billion, an increase of 115% versus prior year and cash flow from operations was $1.8 billion, excluding R&D asset acquisitions, restructuring and integration payments. These results illustrate the strong long term growth profile of Allergan and our Growth Pharma model.","Our team continues to drive strong performance. Five of our seven franchises have now reached the $1 billion mark. We maintained or expanded our leadership position in all of our key therapeutic categories and when you exclude the impact of foreign exchange and Namenda IR, all of our therapeutic area businesses delivered double digit growth.","Slide 9. Our branded revenues grew double digits for the year and growth was broad-based across our key therapeutic areas. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, three quarters of our top global products grew at double-digit rates. Nine of our top global products grew more than 15%. Leading growth drivers included Restasis, plus 19; Fillers, plus 20; Botox, plus 14; Linzess plus 55; Viibryd, plus 26 and Lo Loestrin, plus 26.","We continue to solidify our leadership in key categories, with strong execution on new launches. Our recent launch of Viberzi for the treatment of IBSD is off to a strong and early start and is in line with our previous launch of Linzess in IBSC. In anti-infectives, our launches of Avycaz and Dalvance had delivered strong results throughout the year and are out-pacing competition with an impressive launch trajectory.","The launch of Liletta, our IUD earlier this year, has been very successful, showing continued growth momentum in unit sales. Voluma, a key driver within our Fillers line in the U.S., continues to drive strong growth for our Allergan medical business. Looking ahead, we will continue to drive growth through new approvals and upcoming launches, including Vraylar in the first quarter of 2016.","Touching on our international business, our teams delivered continued double-digit revenue growth from key products including Botox therapeutic, Ozurdex and our glaucoma business. Our international eye care team has led an exceptional rollout of Ozurdex in new countries with new indications, driving a 35% growth rate for that product year-over-year. In addition, our international team launched several key products in 2015, including Juvederm in China and we gained rights to Constella in more than 40 markets, which adds another growth driver for this business in 2016.","Turning to slide 11, as noted earlier, we have made tremendous R&D progress this year. Our Open Science model seeks to deliver innovation regardless of its source. We have utilized this model to acquire or in-license innovative products that expand our therapeutic area of leadership and 2015 was a year of impressive productivity on this front.","In eye care, we continue to add shots on goal and development opportunities for dry eye disease and glaucoma, with the acquisitions of Oculeve, Mimetogen and Aquesys. In aesthetics, we completed the acquisition of Kythera, adding Kybella, a non-surgical treatment for submental fullness or double chin. We also acquired Northwood Medical Innovation and its less invasive surgery-sparing product, earFold, as well as Anterios and its proprietary NDS platform delivery technology that could enable local targeted delivery of neurotoxins to the skin without the need for injections.","In CNS, we completed the acquisition of Naurex, which added Rapastinel, a breakthrough designated treatment in the development for depression and other potential breakthrough treatments in depression. We also in-licensed the right to Merck's development stage oral CGRP programs for the potential treatment of migraines, which we expect to enter Phase III later this year.","And late in the fourth quarter we announced our collaboration with Rugen Therapeutics, to support the discovery and development of novel therapies for autism spectrum disorder and obsessive compulsive disorders. And in GI, we acquired commercial rights to Constella in key international markets. This adds an important flagship product for our international GI commercial team and positions us strongly for the potential introduction of Eluxadoline in international markets later this year.","Turning to slide 12, a key driver of our future growth is new launches in 2016 and beyond. Both in the U.S. and internationally, we're poised to deliver sustainable growth through a number of new launches across five different therapeutic categories in 2016 and early 2017. We will add important new products in the U.S., including Vraylar, multi-dose preservative-free Restasis, a new Botox indication, Aczone 7.5, XEN Shunt for glaucoma, Oculeve for dry eye and new Fillers including Volbella and Volift.","Internationally, we will drive growth through new products including the XEN Shunt for glaucoma; Optive gel drops in the EU; Kybella, also known as Belkyra in Canada and Australia and Volite in the EU later in 2017. With more than 70 projects in mid to late stage development, we have multiple programs in each of our leading therapeutic areas, to help us to sustain strong future growth.","With that I'll turn the call over to David Nicholson, who will provide a more detailed pipeline update. David?","David Nicholson","Thanks, Brent. Good morning, everyone. On slide 14, as you see and as mentioned by Brent, Allergan's R&D team has had a highly productive year, with more than 100 pharma and regulatory approvals worldwide. These strong results included submissions of our multi-dose preservative-free formulation of Restasis and Nebivolol\/Valtarsan fixed dose combination in the United States.","We have 25 major drug approvals globally, including Liletta, Viberzi, Kybella and Vraylar in the United States and Dalvance in the EU. We had 12 major device approvals, including Volite in the EU and Juvederm in China. 45 NMEs were approved in the U.S.A last year. Allergan compounds, Vraylar, Viberzi, Kybella and Avycaz accounted for nearly 10% of these approvals.","This was a truly remarkable year for Allergan's R&D team and I applaud them for their hard work and tremendous success. I do want to take a moment to recognize my colleague, Hafrun Fridriksdottir, who heads up the generics R&D. Their team's achievements continue to set the industry standard, with 46 new ANDAs filed, which included 22 first-to-file applications. Outside the U.S., they filed more than 1000 marketing applications to key products in key markets around the world.","On slide 15, I look forward into 2016. Allergan's R&D team is poised for another productive year. We expect more than a dozen approvals and regulatory submissions.","I'm not going to talk about everything on this slide, but I do want to go through a few key highlights. In medical aesthetics, we expect U.S. approval of Aczone 7.5% in the first half of the year and Volbella for lips in the second half. We anticipate international approvals for Botox in crow's feet lines and Voluma XC in Japan. We're looking for the approval of Kybella or Belkyra, as it is known outside of the U.S. in the EU, in the second half of 2016. New Drug Applications for Oxymetazoline in rosacea and Botox for forehead lines are expected to be filed with the U.S. FDA in the first and second half of this year respectively.","Moving on to eye care, we're expecting U.S. approvals of a multi-dose preservative-free formulation of Restasis in the second half of 2016. We also expect to file 510k submissions for XEN 45, our ocular stent to treat glaucoma and the Oculeve Tearbud, which is an intranasal neurostimulatory device for dry eye in the second half of 2016. We're anticipating the Phase III enrollment for that Bimatoprost SR will be completed by the early 2017 timeframe.","In gastroenterology, we expect the second half 2016 EU approval for Eluxadoline for the treatment of IBSD. We're also preparing an SNDA submission for low-dose Linzess 72 micrograms for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation for the first half of 2016. And we're looking forward to seeing the Phase II-b data for Relamorelin, our investigational treatment for diabetic gastroparesis in the second half of 2016, which we're working on with Rhythm Health.","In women's health, we expect to have top line results from the first Phase III study of Esmya in the first half of 2016. In CNS, we expect to submit an NDA for Semprana in the U.S. This is an investigational treatment for acute migraine in the second half of the year.","We expect to begin new trials for some of our mid stage compounds. This includes initiation of a Phase III study for Cariprazine in bipolar depression. Importantly, Phase III studies for Rapastinel, an investigational treatment for major depressive disorder and Ubrogepant, a potential treatment for acute migraines, are expected to begin in the second half of 2016. Note that Repastinel obtained breakthrough designation from the FDA.","Finally, in anti-infectives, urology and cardiovascular, we anticipate receiving FDA approval for Nebivolol\/Valtarsan fixed dose combination treatment for hypertension in the first half of 2016. We have submitted and the FDA has accepted, our SNDA submission for chronic intra-abdominal infections for Avycaz and we're planning our further SNDA submission utilizing Phase III data for complicated urinary tract infections in the second half of 2016.","As I have outlined, we did have an extraordinary 2015 and we're expecting an equally exciting 2016 for our brands R&D pipeline. I really thank our more than 2,000 Allergan employees R&D colleagues around the world for their tremendous work and dedication in achieving these results. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Tessa to review our fourth quarter and full-year financial results. Tessa?","Tessa Hilado","Thank you, David and good morning, everyone. Slide 17 provides overall results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015. Please note this discussion of results reflect continuing operations only, which we began reporting since the third quarter of 2015, following the announcement of the divestiture of our Global Generics business to Teva.","In the fourth quarter, we continued to deliver exceptional year-over-year performance. On a non-GAAP basis, consolidated net revenue for the fourth quarter was $4.2 billion, an increase of 74% versus fourth quarter 2014. This increase was primarily driven by strong performance in our Botox, eye care, medical aesthetics and GI businesses, offset by the loss of exclusivity for Namenda IR.","On a non-GAAP gross margin basis for the fourth quarter, it was 78.1%, an increase of 12.1 percentage points versus fourth quarter 2014, which reflects the addition of the Allergan business. Non-GAAP R&D investment for the quarter was $338 million compared to $203 million in the prior-year period. Non-GAAP SG&A, as a percentage of revenue was 24.9%, an increase of 1.4 percentage points versus the prior-year quarter, as a result of the launch of Kybella, sales force expansion within our facial aesthetics franchise in the U.S. and transactional FX impact of approximately $30 million.","Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $1.98 billion, an increase of 115% versus the prior year, driven by strong revenues and higher gross margins across our business segments. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter increased 33% to $3.41 per share compared to $2.57 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2014.","Our non-GAAP tax rate was 8.2% in the quarter. This rate was driven primarily by the entire interest expense being included in our continuing operations earnings. Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $1.6 billion, impacted by recent R&D acquisitions Excluding the impact of restructuring and one-time items, cash flows were strong at $1.8 billion.","Turning now to our U.S. brand results on slide 18, the business delivered strong performance year-over-year. U.S. brands revenue was $2.5 billion for the quarter, up 38% versus the prior-year period, driven by the addition of the Allergan businesses and strong growth across key products in the GI and women's health franchises, offset by a decline in Namenda IR with a loss of exclusivity for that product.","Adjusted gross margin within U.S. brands continued to be strong, with margins of approximately 87.8%, up 7.1 percentage points versus the prior-year quarter. SG&A as a percentage of revenue decreased to 18.2% versus 21.2% in the year-ago quarter, driven by our continued ability to maximize our commercial infrastructure and continued synergy capture from recent acquisitions.","Turning to slide 19 and our U.S. medical business, fourth quarter revenues were $490 million, an increase of 7% versus the prior quarter. There are no prior-year comparisons for U.S. medical, as it was acquired as part of the Allergan acquisition in March of 2015. On a pro forma basis, the U.S. medical business grew 9.3%, reflecting strong growth in Botox, Fillers and breast implants.","Our breast implant business had its best quarter to date, driven by the launch of Inspira and market share expansion as we were able to capitalize on a competitor being out of the marketplace. Fourth quarter gross margins continued to be strong at 93.4% and SG&A as a percentage of revenue increased to 23.3%, due to additional Kybella promotional spend and sales force expansion related to the launch of that product.","Turning to slide 20 and our international brand results, fourth quarter revenues were $691 million versus $79 million in the prior-year period, largely due to the Allergan acquisition. Excluding foreign exchange on a pro forma basis, international revenues in the fourth quarter grew 12%, driven by continued strong growth of Ozurdex, Botox Cosmetic and Fillers. Gross margins were 83.7% in the fourth quarter. Segment SG&A increased 1.6 percentage points to 31.4% versus third quarter 2015, due largely to new product expansion for Botox and Fillers.","Turning to our ANDA business on slide 21, revenues decreased 5% to $547 million versus $576 million in the prior quarter, driven by lower retail business, primarily from the Target merger with CVS, which had some impact in the fourth quarter. The impact in 2016 revenue will be more significant, in the range of $500 million; however, we expect margins to remain stable. Results in all periods include third-party revenues and related expenses of generic products manufactured by the Company and distributed through ANDA.","Slide 22 details our debt capitalization. We ended the fourth quarter of 2015 with total debt of approximately $42.7 billion and equity of $76.6 billion related to the Allergan acquisition and previous financing. At year end, our leverage ratio was 4.09 times debt to pro forma adjusted EBITDA, versus 3.98 times in the prior quarter. Since year end, we have repaid approximately $500 million of term loan debt and $200 million toward our revolving credit facility.","We remain committed to maintaining our investment grade ratings. Following the close of the divestiture of our generics business to Teva, we anticipate making a debt repayment toward the remaining term loan balance of approximately $8 billion. The remaining proceeds will be reflected on the balance sheet until the Pfizer close.","Let me close with a few comments on our preliminary view of 2016 financials. Please note this guidance will remain in effect until prior to the filing of the EU prospectus to be filed by Allergan, in connection with the Pfizer transaction, subsequent to the U.S. filing. We expect full-year net revenues to be approximately $17 billion, including branded business revenues of approximately $15 billion. Our revenue forecast reflects foreign currency headwinds of approximately $200 million and lower year-over-year revenue expectations for ANDA of approximately $500 million, due to the merger between Target and CVS.","In our branded business, excluding Namenda IR and divestitures, we continue to expect double-digit revenue growth, driven by strong sales of key products and new launches in 2016. Note that revenues will be back-half weighted as a result of contribution from launches being greater in the second half and typical pharma seasonality. As a result, the first quarter of 2016 will be lower than the fourth quarter of 2015 and will be the lowest quarter of the year, with each quarter subsequently increasing. Our gross margin should remain strong, with no material change from current levels.","Because of the initiation of the pre-integration planning process with Pfizer, we will no longer proceed with our plan for our restructuring following the divestiture of the generics business. As a result, SG&A as a percentage of non-GAAP revenue is now anticipated to trend above our previous expectations of 21% to 24%, to approximately 25% of total net revenue. SG&A as a percentage of revenue will be higher in the first quarter and then trend downwards throughout the year as we support a number of important launches this year, including Kybella, Viberzi and Vraylar.","R&D spend is expected to be approximately $1.5 billion, reflecting increased investment from 2015. The increase is almost entirely project-related as a result of the many important late-stage programs advancing our pipeline. Our tax rate should begin to trend toward normalized levels in the range of 14%, following the close of Teva.","And now I will turn the call back over to Brent for an update on the Pfizer transaction. Brent?","Brent Saunders","Thank you, Tessa. Before we start the Q&A, I wanted to provide a brief update on our proposed combination with Pfizer. In late November, we announced with Pfizer the proposed combination of our businesses, bringing together two successful pharmaceutical companies to create a premier global biopharmaceutical leader, with the resources and capabilities to bring more medicines to more people around the world.","Together, we will leverage the best of both organizations, matching Pfizer's strong infrastructure, broad portfolio and global reach, with Allergan's operating agility, growth profile and new therapeutic areas. We will have breadth and depth in key therapeutic areas, strengthened by an expanded global footprint, allowing Allergan brands to reach more patients in more markets more quickly, including two of the world's largest pharmaceutical markets in Japan and China.","We will have an innovative R&D pipeline, consisting of projects sourced from strong internal science and Open Science to fuel our future growth. We're two months into the planning for this combination and I'm already pleased to see early progress on our integration planning efforts, such as the announcement of our proposed executive team.","Both teams are hard at work planning for the integration for what will be the premier biopharmaceutical Company in the world. We continue to expect the combination with Pfizer to close in the second half of 2016. With that, I'll turn it back to Lisa and we'll open it up for Q&A.","Lisa DeFrancesco","Operator, I think we can get started on the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger","The first is, Brent, could you just talk at a high level about the outlook for the global aesthetics business, in the face of potentially slowing economies ex-U.S.? And then, maybe within that answer, you could also comment on the Botox revenue outlook for 2016 and whether you expect the aesthetics portion of the Botox franchise to grow faster or slower than the medical indications? And then just finally, a quick minor question on ANDA. You mentioned that the Target\/CVS merger impacted ANDA. Could you just provide a few more comments on that? Thank you.","Brent Saunders","So I think turning to the global aesthetics business, I think we feel good about the business. I think when you look at history and even go to the great recession, the durability of that business I think was tested and it was proven that even in slower economic times, people still look to elective procedures, particularly non-invasive procedures over surgery. So we tend to do well and remain strong, even in the great recession. So we're very optimistic despite any slowing economic factors around the world for the aesthetic business.","With respect to Botox, perhaps Tessa can jump in, but we believe both the aesthetic application and the therapeutic indications are going to drive strong growth and not only from expanding markets in the U.S. and abroad, but also expanding indications across both of the uses. And we continue to, as David outlined, we continue to look for new indications. For example, crow's feet outside the U.S. and we continue to study Botox in areas like depression and so we think Botox still has a decade or more of strong growth ahead. Tessa do you want to touch on those numbers?","Tessa Hilado","Yes, for both medical aesthetics and therapeutic, both are actually growing at a very healthy pace and not one of them is outpacing the other. Obviously, slightly higher growth for Botox cosmetic internationally.","Brent Saunders","And with respect to ANDA, I don't know if Bob Stewart wants to jump in. I think when CVS bought the Target pharmacies, we fully anticipated that CVS, the main reason they bought the Target pharmacies, outside of having their brand inside of Target or their capabilities inside of Target, was to save on some of the leverage, some of their distribution capabilities. So we knew that was coming.","It was a very low margin business for us anyway and so it doesn't impact in any substantial way our profitability, but it does impact revenue. And so you're just going to see that full-year effect flow through in 2016. Bob, any other comments on that?","Bob Stewart","I think you said it there, Brent. Really, what we were doing within ANDA was offering different services to what we considered our key customers. Target was one of those and what we offered them was a virtual warehouse capability that basically moved the product through ANDA, but at a very, very low margin. And so what you saw here is the effect of that business moving back to CVS and there's a top line impact, but in terms of bottom line impact, it's negligible.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Cacciatore with Cowen and Company.","Ken Cacciatore","Just a question, Brent. Is it possible you could provide us some nuance on the regulatory process, both for Teva and Pfizer, that we might not appreciate, in terms of either how well it's going or maybe some of the difficulties?","And then also not sure if you would be willing to do this, but could you give us a perspective on the discount that we're observing between your price and Pfizer? Clearly a lot of fear. Is there anything you can just help contextualize that could provide some perspective around that? Thank you.","Brent Saunders","Sure, Ken. I think with respect to the Teva transaction, I think the team has been working incredibly hard. It's a very complex regulatory filing around the world and requires every individual product and overlapping product to be analyzed by the regulators.","So I think given the sheer volume of products there, we should be a little understanding of the time it takes. We still, as I said earlier, believe that it should close, close to the end of this quarter or slip a little bit into the second quarter. But nothing really surprising or concerning on our end.","I think it's just a matter of managing complexity and the timeline. And I have to give our legal team, but also the team at Teva, a lot of kudos. They are managing through complexity with amazing grace, so I'd give them a lot of kudos for that and I wouldn't stress too much about that. It's just running its normal but complicated course.","On the Pfizer situation, everything is moving ahead. All of the filings are being contemplated or in process and we do expect that to close in the second half and we haven't stumbled across any surprising - or information that we thought was different than when we originally contemplated the deal. So I would say, absolutely where we thought it was going to be and moving ahead full steam.","I think with respect to the spread or the discount, it's a little baffling from my perspective and I know from Ian Reed's perspective. I think if you look at buying us, you look at Pfizer, you're buying Pfizer in the low 20s. I haven't done the math recently, but it's a fairly significant discount. I think 20%-plus and my guess is there's just some skepticism around, could the government do something to intervene?","All of our knowledge and sources of both our side and Pfizer's is that this deal will close. It was highly - it was constructed in a highly legal way with advice of many experts and I think we're in a very strong position to close this deal in the second half of the year. I don't see any obstacles.","Operator","Your next question comes from Randall Stanicky with RBC Capital Markets.","Randall Stanicky","Just a couple questions, Brent. The key metric this morning is really the 10%-plus growth in the branded business, so can you just characterize for us any changes or lack of changes in how you're thinking about the price volume outlook there?","And then second one for Bill, maybe, can you just talk about more about the Viberzi launch, should we be thinking about the Linzess trajectory as the right analog for that opportunity? Thanks.","Brent Saunders","Yes, so I'll make an opening remark and then turn it over to Bill. I think with respect to price volume, nothing in our behavior has changed. Obviously, we watch the outside environment and a lot of the rhetoric around pricing, but I think we have had a long history and if you go back at things I have said on this topic dating back to Forest Labs even, we always treated our payer colleagues as customers.","And we always were mindful of the respect that you need in that relationship and so we were always, with some exception for mispriced products, but for the large majority of our products, we were always very respectful of the price-volume relationship. And so we see it as business as usual. It is always a negotiated relationship.","For those people who think we can just take price increases as we see being fit, that is not true. There is always a repercussion to doing that and they are always highly negotiated. We don't see - the pressure was there last year, it was there the year before and it's there again this year and it's something that innovation and good data and good customer service tend to help balance on our end. And so I know there's a lot of rhetoric, but we don't see any impact on our business or any change in the foreseeable future. With that, I'll turn it over to Bill.","Bill Meury","First on the pricing point, I agree with Brent. Generally, our aim here, especially for our top products, is real estate and market share and volume. We have exclusivity periods on most products that extend well into 2020 and our pricing approach reflects that. The price-volume relationship on our top 10 products leaned heavily towards volume. In 2015, we expect the same and in 2016.","And our price increases generally trade for our growth products below 10% and as Brent said, we have excellent formulary coverage and that's given the relationships that we have with health plans. As it relates to Viberzi the price-volume relationship or equation is a little different relative to Linzess. I think a good way to think about it, the trajectory will look like the IBSC component of Linzess, which is about 50% of the volume.","In terms of pricing, of course, the price point is public. Viberzi is in the, let's call it $15 to $20 a day range, relative to Linzess, which is probably like $7 or $8 a day. There's a big primary care and GI detailing effort, direct-to-consumer advertising will start in March and based on the first six to seven weeks of data, this feels very much like Linzess. The pharmacology of the product is very intuitive to physicians, it has got a good benefit-risk ratio and so I think it can be - it could double the size of our GI business over time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin","I know that the focus of the call is not on the generic business, but was wondering if you could share with us anything that you are seeing that might constitute a change in pricing dynamics? Obviously we've seen generic drug price deflation over the last couple of quarters, after a period of inflation at this point, you're seeing there. And then lastly, Brent, what's driving the 1.5 billion in R&D spend in 2016? Thanks very much.","Brent Saunders","Yes, so let's talk about generics first and this will just give me the ability to just make a quick comment before I turn it over to Bob Stewart about the generic performance. Given the disruption and the pre-integration period with Teva and the complication, the divestiture of the business is a lot harder than integrating an acquisition.","Our folks just continue to have impressive performance despite all of the additional work they've had to do regarding the Teva pre-integration process. So something that I just have been very proud of that team for and maybe Bob, you can talk about the environment. I think Paul Bisaro is on as well, so maybe he will chime in as well.","Bob Stewart","Jami, it's Bob here. So with respect to the pricing environment, I don't see a lot of change between what we saw in 2015 versus 2016. There's no question about it, with the purchasing consolidation and the buying now and fewer hands, there's no doubt that there's challenges to that remaining status quo going forward. But I think what you're seeing now in the way the companies are reporting, some are reporting higher price erosion versus others and I think that's largely due to the strategies that they are employing.","Some companies are really trying to fill their capacity and they're chasing share. And usually when you're chasing share, you're basically discounting your products in order to be able to get that volume benefit. So that wasn't our strategy, nor was that the same strategy from others. And from what we've been focusing on over the years is making sure that we've got the right capacity and differentiating ourselves with the portfolio.","And those companies that have differentiated portfolios that are harder to manufacture, less competition in products generally see price erosion on the lower end of the range. And so what I see in our business and Brent alluded to the fact that our business has performed very well, despite obviously going through this integration, what we're seeing is that price erosion consistent with 2015, which we saw that in more the mid-single digits and I see that continuing in 2016, as well.","Brent Saunders","Paul, anything you want to add?","Paul Bisaro","I agree with Bob. I would only add one thing. I think Teva is going to be well-positioned to deal with these market dynamics in 2016, 2017 and 2018, given the portfolio they would have.","Brent Saunders","Only thing I would add too, is I think the FDA, again I haven't tracked the numbers, but the FDA I think, has really stepped up the approval process, so a lot of the backlog is clearing and that's creating for some more competition and for others with more innovative first-to-file portfolios like we have, it could create a better dynamic as well.","With respect to R&D increase, as Tessa mentioned in her comments, it was all the project or program related, which is where you'd like to see the increase, particularly when it's late-stage programs. And so, just by way of example, some of the big programs that we have kicking off in 2016 are the Repastinel Phase III, the oral CGRP Phase III, as well as a lot of work in Esmya Phase III and a few others. So it really is late stage program related for the vast majority.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Schott of JPMorgan.","Chris Schott","Just two here, first can you elaborate on the 25% of sales for the SG&A target for 2016 and how that relates to the proposed Pfizer\/Allergan synergy targets? Are those potential simplification savings now in the $2 billion target for the Pfizer deal? And trying to get a sense of what we should be looking at for the pro forma OpEx when we consider those synergies.","My second question was just thoughts on the broader M&A environment. When we think about this pro forma business post close, how are you thinking about the recent market volatility, what that does to consolidation in this space and the type of targets that the Company will be looking at? Thanks very much.","Brent Saunders","Sure, so with respect to the SG&A, in essence, stability plus cost of launches, which make a slight increase. It really is related to not being able to execute the restructuring that we had essentially worked very hard to plan and we're ready to pull the trigger on when the Pfizer deal came around and so we put that on the shelf. I don't think it's fair to treat people through - to put people through the stress of a reorganization, while they are also doing a pre-integration of the size and scale of the Pfizer one and so we have in essence put that on the shelf or cancelled it, due to the pending Pfizer deal close and obviously all of the work that's on everybody's plate, given the pre-integration work.","I think with respect to the synergy numbers, Pfizer was aware we were going to do that and when we built our model that was contemplated. The M&A environment, I think, remains of high interest to us. I think when you look at the volatility or the weakness in the marketplace, I think it does a couple things. One is, as it sustains itself, right, it has to stay in this environment. I think we're seeing some high fliers now become more fairly valued and I think we're also seeing opportunities.","As you know, Chris, you can't strike on these opportunities, because everybody is going to look at various lengths of average price to figure out premiums, so whether it be a 30, 60, 90 days VWAP, you have to let these things settle out before there's really any actionability around them. But I think we're going to continue both as a standalone Allergan and as a combined Pfizer, look for things that expand our intellectual property and our therapeutic areas, to complement our discovery and own pipeline capabilities inside of Pfizer.","I think we're going to look for opportunities to expand our therapeutic area leadership and our key therapeutic areas, much like standalone Allergan has been doing today. So I think the thing you won't probably see, both for standalone Allergan and likely for combined Pfizer, is large transformational M&A in the short term. I think we'll be looking more for intellectual property, tuck-in, geographic, expansion and therapeutic area leadership support-type deals.","Operator","Your next question comes from Liav Abraham with Citi.","Liav Abraham","Brent, as you've gotten to know the Pfizer organization a bit better, I'd be interested your thoughts as to how you think your key franchises will be able to maintain this impressive double-digit revenue growth over the long term, within a larger organization that operates very differently from yours and presumably isn't as nimble. And then secondly, just a question on Restasis and Namenda XR, formulary positioning, post 2016, if you can provide any comments on that, given the competitive pressures that both these products will be facing, thanks.","Brent Saunders","Sure, I'll answer the first one and maybe ask Bill to touch on Restasis and Namenda XR formulary. I think, with respect to the combination with Pfizer, I think it's incredibly exciting for our franchises and our growth profile. When you look at the Pfizer organization, combined with the Allergan organization, I think the word that immediately comes to mind is opportunity.","That's opportunities to expand our capabilities, it's opportunities to strengthen our franchises and it certainly is opportunity to expand our geographic footprint. So when you look at those things in combination, it's intuitive. I think the thing I picked up in last two months though is, it's also an opportunity for talent and capabilities. And when you have an organization the size of the combined Pfizer-Allergan you really need strength in your executive and management ranks and in the first two months, the combination of our executives and managers with Pfizer's looks like a huge opportunity to drive these businesses and really have better performance than the market.","Bill Meury","This is Bill. As it relates to formulary coverage for Restasis and XR, I'll start with Restasis. Sustaining growth for that product is going to be a function of formulary coverage, share of leadership and ultimately launching new other dry eye products. The coverage for Restasis today is over 85%.","We expect that to be maintained through 2016 and we're already in the process of submitting bids, at least on the Part D side of the business, for 2017. It's a very, very popular product with a big user base and I don't expect any real surprises or major changes in formulary coverage for Restasis and I think over the next two years we can continue to manage our discount rate.","And as it relates to XR, we look good for 2016, for both XR and Namzaric. Optum just added both products to formulary and here again, as we look into 2017, which we already have a line of sight to, I think the numbers are going to look very, very good. Again, if Namenda XR and Namzaric are popular products, especially with neurologists and select primary care physicians. I like the way the next two years looks for both businesses.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank.","Gregg Gilbert","Just a couple. First for Brent, I know you're very confident in closing the deal, but what are your sources telling you about what the Treasury will say and when they might say it or any other speed bumps along the way ahead of your expected close?","And then secondly for Teva, are there any caveats you'd like to offer before we see your long term forecast in the S-4, given that some folks might take that to mean - well, frankly, is that your long term forecast or further caveats you'd like to offer, thanks?","Brent Saunders","Yes, so I think with respect to Treasury, what's interesting to me is how much rhetoric there is around what Treasury will and won't do and how many, I guess, supposed experts or pundits tend to want to opine on this and how the market takes it as - almost as it being real. I think the reality is, Treasury has issued two notices of proposed rulemaking with respect to this provision, related to inversions. We have carefully considered and evaluated both of those and have constructed our deal in a manner that takes those into account.","What we understand is Treasury is working hard at promulgating the actual regulations to support those notices and that seems to be their focus, as you would expect and we don't hear anything about a third notice coming. If in fact, a third notice did become public, then certainly we would evaluate that, but we don't expect anything Treasury could do could impact our deal, since we structured it according to the law. And so we feel very optimistic.","I think most of the noise around the third - or most of the rhetoric around the potential third notice is just noise. The Treasury, from all we can tell, is working on promulgating the regulations to support the first two notices, which haven't been issued yet.","Tessa Hilado","In terms of caveats, I'm just trying to think this through, one, the projections are really on a standalone basis and what we provided you were non-GAAP metrics, consistent with the guidance we provided you in the past. And as also I noted in my prepared remarks earlier, that this guidance will remain in effect until prior to the filing of the EU prospectus to be filed by Allergan, in connection with the Pfizer transaction, subject to the U.S. filing, so that's a technical matter and also to note, it's not our long term guidance. It's our 2016 guidance.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason Gerberry from Leerink Partners.","Jason Gerberry","Quick one on Restasis, Bill, maybe if you can comment, just how should we be thinking about the growth profile next year and net pricing. We've seen in some instances where competitors gear up for new competitors in the market and start really aggressively to lock up market share, just wondering how we should think about the net pricing impact to Restasis in 2016? Thanks.","Bill Meury","Okay, good. First when I think about Restasis in 2016 and 2017 and beyond, I focus on the fact that 70% of our user base are repeat users. It has got a great following in both ophthalmology and optometry. As I mentioned earlier, after Liav's question, the formulary coverage looks really good.","You're just scratching the surface of the dry eye market. The percentage of people treated, as of the dry eye is sufferers, is very small. We'll have perhaps a step down in the growth rate. Of course, when Shire launches Lifitegrast, that's not surprising. I think it will recover. We came off of a very high double digit year.","When I look at Restasis relative to Lifitegrast, in terms of efficacy measures, sustaining tear production and goblet cell density, I think Restasis is a great option. When you look at tolerability, it's an even better option, in my opinion. We'll be launching Restasis multi-dose preservative-free in the second half of the year. I think dry eye sufferers are going to love it, instead of getting 60 single unit vials, they're going to get one 60-dose vial.","And importantly, it's just much easier to administer a drop into your eye with a 60 unit vial as opposed to these single-unit vials. And I think we're going to find out in the second half of the year they are going to prefer the option. Even when you go beyond multi-dose preservative-free we have Oculeve and Mimetogen and so we're essentially building a super market of dry eye products. I like the overall outlook for the business.","As it relates to pricing, it is a highly economical product, relative to all the products that health plans are managing. I don't expect any real issues. We have excellent formulary coverage, preferred status on most plans. I mentioned the 85% figure and even with the introduction of Shire's Lifitegrast, I just don't see any major disruption.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Shibani Malhotra with Nomura.","Shibani Malhotra","I've got a couple actually. The first one is on Restasis and the potential for generic. The FDA recently issued new revised guidelines and just wanted to see what you thought about those guidelines and if you think it's more difficult for generics to come into the market for that product?","And then, a question for Brent and Tessa, I guess. We held a call with the tax expert a couple weeks ago and he talked about the combined companies' tax rate being well below 10%. If there's anything you can say about that or any work you've done on that scenario that you could share with us, that would be great.","Final question for Brent. From investors, we do hear sometimes that not everyone has bought into the deal still and just wanted to get your perspective. Is this spread just based on the rest of the government can block the deal or do you think there's some investors that are still holding out at the moment and waiting for more information or to be convinced? Thank you.","Brent Saunders","Sure, so with respect to intellectual property and FDA guidance on Restasis, maybe I'll ask Bob Bailey, our General Counsel to open?","Bob Bailey","Sure, Shibani, on Restasis, the FDA actually accepted in part our comments on the revised guidance and rejected that in part also. And so we're pleased that the FDA has given some credit to the points that we were making. They did amend their guidance in that respect. The FDA still has not identified a release rate test for an approvable product and so that remains a continued obstacle for generic entry.","And finally and most important, we do have now six patents covering the Restasis product. The sixth patent came out in early February and is listed in the Orange Book, so we will continue to push the FDA to make sure good science is being applied in the review of products, but importantly, we will also continue to enforce our valuable intellectual property.","Brent Saunders","Shibani, with respect to your tax experts' review of the combined tax rate, I really think we can't comment on that. I think Frank D'Amelio laid out the expectation of the combined Company tax rate many times and I think we really have to leave it at that.","I think with respect to investor support of the deal, I have been out and about since the deal announcement, talking with investors and we always get unsolicited comments from investors as well and I really haven't picked up anything but support for the deal and enthusiasm for the deal.","Not suggesting that it's unanimous in any way, shape or form. We have a very large shareholder base with very diverse opinions, but from what I can see and from where I sit, I think there is broad-based enthusiastic support for the deal and I continue with the benefit of a little bit more hindsight in a few months of pre-integration, believe this is the absolute best course for Allergan shareholders. I think owning 44% of the pro forma Company of the combined Pfizer-Allergan puts our shareholders in an absolute better position for continued growth, for continued value creation and is absolutely the right move at the right time.","Brent Saunders","So I think that was our last question. I thank everyone for joining us and I would just add that 2015 was a highly successful year for Allergan on a broad number of areas, whether that be double-digit branded growth in our commercial performance, strong performance from our generics business during the face of a divestiture and of course, R&D productivity both in brand and generics was I think of record pace. We look forward to challenging ourselves to outperform our 2015 performance in 2016 and looking forward to keeping you all up-to-date as we move forward. Thank you for your time.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

Ms. Karydas, please go ahead.","Daphne Karydas - Allergan Plc","Thank you, Crystal, and good morning everyone. I'd like to welcome you to the Allergan fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call.","Earlier this morning, we issued a press release reporting Allergan earnings from continuing operations for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. The press release and our slide deck which we are presenting this morning are available on our corporate website at www.allergan.com. We are conducting a live webcast of this call, a replay of which will be available on our website after its conclusion. Please note that today's call is copyrighted material of Allergan and cannot be rebroadcast without the company's expressed written consent.","Turning to slide 2, I'd also like to remind you that during the course of this call, management will make projections or other forward-looking remarks regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. It's important to note that such statements and events are forward-looking statements and reflect our current perspective of the business trends and information as of today's date.","Actual results may differ materially from current expectations and projections, depending on a number of factors affecting the Allergan business. These factors are detailed in our periodic public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Allergan disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements except as expressly required by law.","All figures discussed during the call refer to non-GAAP. Our GAAP financial metrics and reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP metrics can be found in our earnings release issued this morning and posted on our website. In addition, all global and international growth rates referenced this morning are on an ex-FX basis.","Turning to slide 3 and our agenda this morning, with us on today's call are: Brent Saunders, our Chairman and CEO, who will provide some thoughts on our business and highlights from our fourth quarter results; Bill Meury, our Chief Commercial Officer, who will provide an overview of our commercial performance in the quarter;","David Nicholson, our Chief R&D Officer, who will provide an update on our pipeline; and Tessa Hilado, our Chief Financial Officer, who will then discuss the Allergan fourth quarter financial results and our guidance in more detail. Also on the call and available during the Q&A is Bob Bailey, our Chief Legal Officer.","With that, I will turn the call over to Brent.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Thanks, Daphne, and good morning, everyone. Before I start with the fourth quarter and full-year results, I want to thank each of our Allergan colleagues across the globe for their hard work and accomplishments. 2017 was a challenging year on several fronts, and I am so proud that our team remained focused on our customers and patients to bring the year to an exceptionally strong close.","As a result of the LOEs we face this year, we have taken the necessary but difficult actions to resize our company, and we enter 2018 from a stronger position to move past them. We have a strong future and a lot to look forward to in 2018, including continued growth of our key products, expansion of our international business, and several key pipeline catalysts that will provide fuel to sustain the growth into the future.","This morning, we are pleased to announce positive top line results for the first of two Phase III single-attack studies of ubrogepant, our oral CGRP receptor antagonist. This is an important milestone, and we look forward to seeing results from additional studies later this year. David will discuss these data in more detail in a bit.","With that, let me turn to the results on slide 5. 2017 was a pivotal year, marked by good execution on many fronts. We drove strong revenue growth of 9.4%, including the very successful acquisitions, integrations, and growth of our Regenerative Medicine and Body Contouring businesses. We've repeatedly demonstrated that we can acquire commercial assets and take them to new heights. CoolSculpting and ALLODERM are just the latest examples.","We launched a dozen new products in 2017, including VRAYLAR, LINZESS 72- micrograms, VOBELLA, VOLLURE, and VOLITE, three of our premium JUV\u00c9DERM family of fillers, as we continue to build of the strength of our therapeutic areas and commercialize our pipeline. We also advanced CVC and relamorelin into Phase III, and we filed the ESMYA NDA. We advanced many other pipeline programs, and our mid to late-stage pipeline has multiple shots on goal in each of our key therapeutic areas. David will walk you through some of the exciting pipeline catalysts that we expect in 2018.","And, we are executing on our capital allocation plan, including initiating a dividend, completing a $15 billion share repurchase, and making progress on our new $2 billion share repurchase plan. We also paid down our net debt by $2.9 billion.","Turning to slide 6, we ended the year with a very strong fourth quarter result. We delivered very strong revenue and non-GAAP performance net income per share growth. Fourth quarter revenues were up 12% and non-GAAP performance net income per share increased 25%. Our non-GAAP operating margin exceeded 50%, driven by disciplined cost management and operating leverage. And we delivered strong operating cash flows of $2 billion in the fourth quarter.","On a full-year basis, revenue increased 9% versus prior year, up 4% excluding the impact of Regenerative Medicine and Body Contouring. For the year, volume contributed approximately 8% and price 1% to growth.","Full-year non-GAAP operating margins were 48%, and non-GAAP performance net income per share increased 21% to $16.35 in 2017, and we generated $5.9 billion of operating cash flow in 2017. These results speak to the strength of the underlying business and our focus on execution.","Slide 7 illustrates the strength of our underlying business. Approximately 80% of our 2017 total revenues came from promoted brands with ongoing exclusivity and other established products. This part of our business grew approximately 12% versus prior year excluding the impact of Regenerative Medicine and Body Contouring.","Approximately 40% of the sales in this part of our business come from cash pay and BOTOX Therapeutics, so the outlook here is very good with durable mid single-digit growth. Promoted brands with ongoing exclusivity are the core of our current and future growth, and we expect this group to continue to grow high single digits. Other product revenues included non-promoted brands, and we expect these products to remain stable or to experience low single-digit decline on a go-forward basis.","The products facing LOE exposure were $3 billion in 2017, and we laid out our expectations for timing of these LOEs in 2018. We expect this group to decline significantly as generics are introduced in the market, and we are cutting expenses by approximately $400 million relative to our 2017 cost base to mitigate the impact of the LOEs, as we announced in early January.","In closing, we had a very strong ending to the year due to our team's focus on execution. We are implementing tough but necessary cost-cutting initiatives, and we are prepared and well positioned for 2018 and beyond with strong durable base, an exciting pipeline with several key readouts starting this year.","Now let me hand the call over to Bill.","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Thanks, Brent, and good morning everyone. Turning to slide 9, the fourth quarter was highlighted by strong sales growth from many of our flagship products, partially offset by the decline in products that lost exclusivity. In the quarter, revenue was up 12% over last year, including the addition of ALLODERM and CoolSculpting. Growth came from products from every therapeutic area and was based primarily on volume over price.","In Medical Aesthetics, growth was led by BOTOX Cosmetic, up 17%, and our JUV\u00c9DERM Collection of fillers, up 21%. BOTOX Therapeutics was also very strong in the quarter, up 16%. There was strong demand across all therapeutic indications. In Eye Care, sales for RESTASIS and our glaucoma business were both relatively stable, and OZURDEX was up 17%. In GI, LINZESS sales were up 12% versus prior year, and VIBERZI sales also saw solid growth at 13% versus prior year. And in Women's Health, LO LOESTRIN continues double-digit growth, up 18% versus prior year.","And finally, product launches, including VRAYLAR, VIBERZI, NAMZARIC, KYBELLA, and XEN, contributed $82 million to net revenue growth compared to last year.","Turning to slide 10, our US Medical Aesthetics business posted its strongest quarter of the year. Performance through the entire year was exceptional across all three pillars, Facial Aesthetics, Plastics and Regenerative Medicine, and Body Contouring, and the outlook for 2018 beyond is very positive.","We're currently launching our Not Cool versus Cool DTC campaign for CoolSculpting, a new DTC campaign for BOTOX, and a new Allergan loyalty program for physicians. And we will be piloting several cutting-edge initiatives to move millions of consumers from considering aesthetic treatments to actually receiving them. Our presence with consumers in 2018 will reach all-time highs.","In Facial Aesthetics, fourth quarter sales grew 14% in the United States. BOTOX Cosmetic and JUV\u00c9DERM benefited from strong demand as well as the timing of our physician rebating program, which drove additional benefit into the fourth quarter. As a result, we expect the first quarter growth rate to be somewhat lower than the annual 2018 growth rate.","In Plastics and Regenerative Medicine, fourth quarter U.S. sales were exceptionally strong, up 15% on a pro forma basis versus last year. Growth in this segment has been driven primarily by ALLODERM, our tissue matrix for breast reconstruction, which is exceeding expectations, and market share gains for our two new INSPIRA breast implants. Our implants line also benefited from supply disruptions at a key competitor. We expect ALLODERM sales growth in 2018 will remain strong. Growth for our breast implants business will moderate to low single digits.","Finally, CoolSculpting posted another strong quarter, up 21% in the United States on a pro forma basis, and we exited the year with over 3,300 accounts. With our expanded sales force, systems are at an all-time high and procedure demand continues to be very strong.","Turning to slide 11, today we're also excited to announce a new addition to our pipeline for our JUV\u00c9DERM line of fillers with the acquisition of Elastagen. Elastagen is a clinical stage Australian company that is developing injectable aesthetics products containing recombinant human tropoelastin, a necessary precursor to making mature elastin fibers in the skin.","Elastin is known as one of the youth proteins and is essential for maintaining healthy youthful skin. Over time, the aging process can deplete the skin of this substance. Our vision here is to develop fillers incorporating tropoelastin to replenish this lost protein and counter the effects of aging. This will be the first of a next generation of fillers based on a technology we plan on calling Rejuvecross. Our JUV\u00c9DERM collection has sales of over $1 billion globally, is one of the fastest growing parts of our aesthetics business, and we anticipate it will rival the size of BOTOX over time.","Turning to slide 12, CNS could be our largest product line in the future, driven by VRAYLAR and BOTOX Therapeutics as well as multiple shots on goal in the pipeline, including CGRPs and rapastinel.","Let's look at VRAYLAR. It's exceeding expectations, with the current indications reaching close to $300 million and is the fastest growing atypical in the United States. We recently received the results of a second positive study in bipolar depression, which David will discuss. The indication alone could be a $500 million-plus opportunity. With BOTOX Therapeutics, growth is coming from all indications, and we finished the year with 14% growth, 16% in United States and 9% internationally. There is room for growth in each of these indications.","Now in migraine, we get a lot of questions on the potential impact from the entry of CGRP antibodies. Here's how I think about it. First, we expect that BOTOX will coexist with CGRPs, and diagnosis and treatment rates should increase. We expect that BOTOX will maintain a dominant position in the chronic migraine market with the CGRPs garnering more use in frequent episodic. Second, there's no clinical or economic reason for current BOTOX patients to switch to a CGRP. Third, chronic migraine represents approximately 40% of all BOTOX Therapeutic revenues in the United States. The balance of sales is for movement disorders and OAB, which are both growing indications too. Even if there's a short-term impact to BOTOX migraine growth, we expect total BOTOX Therapeutics to continue to be an important growth driver. Penetration rates across all approved BOTOX indications is still very low.","Turning to slide 13 and GI, we have a great IBS business, as you know. LINZESS is on its way to $1 billion in sales. In the fourth quarter, revenues grew 12% versus prior year, with demand growth at 18%. A key source of LINZESS growth continues to be dissatisfied OTC patients.","VIBERZI is being promoted right alongside LINZESS to cover the other side of IBS. Satisfaction rates for this product are high. It's being used primarily in more moderate to severe forms of IBS-D. We're adding new writers each week, with a total of 30,000. And we'll continue to work on expanding the use of VIBERZI into more moderate forms of IBS, with new data in Imodium users. In the future, we have the opportunity to reshape and even double or triple this business, with three shots on goal with relamorelin, brazikumab, and cenicriviroc.","On slide 14, our Eye Care business is a formidable $2 billion-plus global business excluding RESTASIS, with potential growth rates in the mid-single digits. The future of our Eye Care business is in glaucoma and retina, with a robust pipeline including abicipar, bimatoprost SR, and Pilo\/Oxy for presbyopia, all of which could have the potential to more than replace RESTASIS revenue loss.","Our OTC artificial tears business, which has sales of approximately $500 million globally, is a growing and durable business too. Our glaucoma drops business remained stable in 2017, and we continue to have the majority of the topical market. Our strategy here is to shift the treatment paradigm in the next several years towards dropless therapies with bimatoprost SR along with our XEN implant.","In retina, OZURDEX continues to be the anchor, experiencing 17% growth globally in the fourth quarter. We're expecting abicipar Phase III results later this year. And if successful, abicipar could be a major improvement for patients and a multiplier of our retina business.","Turning to slide 15, in international we finished the year strong with fourth quarter sales up 17%, with strong double-digit growth coming from every region. In international, we're anchored by Medical Aesthetics, which grew 33%, and Eye Care and BOTOX Therapeutics, which grew 4% and 11% respectively versus prior year. We continue to have a positive outlook for our international business.","Now let me turn the call over to David.","C. David Nicholson - Allergan Plc","Thanks, Bill. Good morning everyone. 2017 was a very productive year for R&D. We continued to make significant progress in advancing our pipeline for patients. Since our last quarterly report, we achieved four new major pharma and device approvals, including approval of a new indication for VRAYLAR in schizophrenia maintenance in the United States and the most recent approval of Avycaz in pneumonia.","We also made six major regulatory submissions and achieved several major milestones, including initiating a Phase II study of ROR-gamma-T in psoriasis, initiating a study of rapastinel in suicidality. We announced a positive study of cariprazine in bipolar depression. And today we announced positive data from the first single-attack Phase III trial of ubrogepant in migraine.","Turning to slide 18, we have advanced our mid to late-stage pipeline beyond the six stars. In Women's Health, the NDA for ESMYA for the treatment of abnormal bleeding associated with uterine fibroids was accepted last quarter, and we anticipate FDA approval in the first half of this year.","As you may be aware, the EMA's Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee [PRAC] is evaluating four cases of severe liver injury identified during post-marketing surveillance in European patients using ESMYA. We anticipate hearing the outcome of their deliberations shortly. We have not seen evidence to suggest that there is a causal relationship between ESMYA and liver injury, and indeed no cases of liver injury were observed in controlled clinical trials. We are supporting our partner, Gedeon Richter, with the internal and external analyses of the benefit\/risk profile of ESMYA, and the FDA has been informed of the European post-marketing findings. Separately, the Canadian regulatory authorities have abated the ESMYA label to reflect these liver cases in the post-marketing events section.","Turning to slide 19, we are pleased to announce positive results from ACHIEVE I, the first of two single-attack Phase III studies of ubrogepant. ACHIEVE I is the first of two U.S. multi-center randomized trials designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ubrogepant for the acute treatment of migraine.","The ACHIEVE I study included 1,327 patients in the modified intend-to-treat population. Individuals with a history of migraine were randomized to either 50 milligrams or 100 milligrams of ubrogepant and placebo. They were treated for a single migraine attack of moderate to severe pain intensity.","The co-primary efficacy endpoints were pain freedom at two hours after dosing and absence of the most bothersome migraine-associated symptom, either photophobia, phonophobia, or nausea, also measured at two hours post-dosing. Both doses studied demonstrated statistically significant efficacy on both co-primary endpoints.","In both the 50-milligram and 100-milligram ubrogepant groups, approximately 61% of patients achieved pain relief at two hours, and the ubrogepant-treated patients showed numerically similar efficacy in triptan responders and triptan non-responders. Both doses of ubrogepant continued to significantly enhance pain freedom and increase the absence of the most bothersome systems up to eight hours post-dosing.","Ubrogepant was very well tolerated, with an adverse event profile similar to placebo. The most common side effects were nausea, somnolence and dry mouth, none of which had a frequency greater than 5%.","Only six cases of elevated liver enzymes greater than three times upper limit of normal were observed across all treatment groups, including placebo. There are alternative explanations in all cases, and none of the cases were adjudicated to have a probable relationship to drug. No cases of hives at all were observed. We track cases of liver enzyme elevation in all of our ubrogepant and atogepant studies, and we continue to see rates which are similar to or lower than those reported in the TransCelerate placebo database.","Migraine is an underdiagnosed and undertreated disease, with significant need for new treatments. The data I'm presenting today are an important milestone towards progressing a new treatment option for this disease, and we look forward to the results of ACHIEVE II, the second single-attack Phase III study of ubrogepant, which we continue to anticipate in the first half of this year.","Turning to slide 20, we recently announced positive top line data for our Phase III study of cariprazine in bipolar depression. In this study, shown on the left of this slide, both the 1.5-milligram and the 3-milligram doses showed a statistically significant reduction in MADRS total score in comparison to placebo at week six. That was the primary endpoint of this trial. Cariprazine was well tolerated, the side effect profile in this study being very similar to that observed in other cariprazine clinical studies.","This is the second positive adequate well-controlled trial, the data from the second study being shown on the right-hand side of this slide. We will submit these data in addition to data from a third trial to the FDA in the second half of the year.","As I have outlined, we have made significant progress in delivering and advancing our pipeline in 2017. We are looking forward to important data readouts in the coming weeks and months. And as always, I thank our global Allergan R&D team for their continued commitment and hard work to advancing these programs and for the hard work ahead for the patients we serve.","And now I will turn the call over to Tessa.","Maria Teresa Hilado - Allergan Plc","Thank you, David. Turning to our overall results for the fourth quarter of 2017 on slide 22, in the fourth quarter we delivered another solid quarter of year-over-year performance and the strongest quarter of 2017. Net revenues were $4.3 billion, a 12% increase versus prior year.","Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 85.9%, which as expected was negatively impacted by product mix, including the Regenerative Medicine and CoolSculpting products. Despite lower gross margins, non-GAAP operating margin was 50.3% in the fourth quarter of 2017, an improvement versus prior-year period of 190 basis points, primarily as a result of: one, lower non-GAAP R&D expenses versus a year ago, as we continued to prioritize the pipeline and manage expenses tightly; and two, good operating leverage.","Non-GAAP performance net income per share of $4.86 reflects growth of 25% versus prior year, driven by revenue growth, lower R&D spend, and share count reduction, partially offset by lower gross margins and higher SG&A spend.","Our non-GAAP tax rate was 11.4% for the quarter. And our full-year non-GAAP tax rate was 12.6%, which was slightly lower than anticipated, primarily driven by mix of income.","Cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter was strong and the highest quarter of the year at approximately $2 billion.","Our GAAP financial metrics and reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP metrics can be found in our earnings release issued this morning and posted on our website. In addition, we have provided more detail on our movements in cash and marketable securities in the appendix.","Turning now to our Q4 performance by segment results on slide 23, U.S. Specialized Therapeutics revenues were $1.88 billion for the quarter, continuing high double-digit growth versus the prior-year period. U.S. Specialized Therapeutics continues to be the highest contribution margin segment. The decline of 190 basis points versus last year was primarily due to lower margins from Regenerative Medicine and CoolSculpting additions.","In our U.S. General Medicine business, fourth quarter revenues were $1.5 billion. U.S. General Medicine contribution margin improved 280 basis points this quarter versus prior year due to lower promotional spend.","International fourth quarter revenues continued to experience strong double-digit growth, powered by Medical Aesthetics. And international contribution margin increased 80 basis points due to operating leverage.","Turning to slide 24, we ended the year with a solid capital position. Total debt ended at approximately $30.1 billion, with a gross debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 3.7 times, which represents a significant improvement from 4.3 times at the beginning of 2017. As mentioned before, in the first quarter of 2018, we plan to further reduce debt by an additional $4.2 billion, including $3.75 billion in natural maturities and an additional $459 million margin loan paydown borrowed in connection with the early retirement of our 2019 bonds. And we expect to exit 2018 at a ratio of approximately 3.3 times gross debt to adjusted EBITDA.","On our current $2 billion buyback authorization, we completed approximately $450 million of the buyback in the fourth quarter, and we expect to complete the remaining amount during 2018. In addition, we continue to sell the Teva shares in a measured approach. We entered into a forward sale agreement for 25 million of the 100 million shares, which was completed in mid-January. We are also selling additional shares opportunistically in the open market, and we plan to sell our remaining position in 2018.","As you saw in our 8-K filed last week, we entered into a settlement agreement with Teva in connection with claims made under the Master Purchase Agreement, or MPA, for the sale of the Actavis Generics business. We have agreed to pay Teva $700 million in full settlement of the approximately $1.5 billion working capital dispute asserted by Teva, which was under arbitration.","Importantly, Teva has also released all current claims for indemnification under the MPA, whether or not those claims are subject to the $500 million cap provided in the agreement. As a result, the parties have put all current disputes behind them, and Teva has confirmed its responsibility for all liabilities and obligations of the Actavis Generics business. We will record a one-time charge of $387 million after tax, shown as a loss from discontinued operations. Keep in mind that our non-GAAP financials only relate to continuing operations.","Turning to slide 25 and our fiscal year 2018 guidance, on net revenues, we continue to expect full year 2018 net revenues between $15 billion and $15.3 billion based on our assumption of RESTASIS generic entry between April and July of 2018 and that an injunction is not granted. As anticipated, ESTRACE was already facing generic competition since the beginning of the year, and we anticipate that NAMENDA XR will be facing generic competition imminently. We also expect DELZICOL generic entry in early Q2.","We expect non-GAAP gross margins for 2018 to be between 85.5% and 86%, as our gross margins will be impacted by the loss of exclusivity from high-margin products like RESTASIS, ESTRACE, and DELZICOL and the impact of product mix.","Our non-GAAP SG&A of approximately $4.25 billion reflects continued investments in our key long-term growth driver products and includes savings from the restructuring initiatives we announced last month.","Non-GAAP R&D spend of approximately $1.5 billion reflects support for our 2018 projects, including important advancements in key programs highlighted by Brent earlier.","Despite the significant LOEs, we expect our operating margins in 2018 to be in line to slightly below 2017 operating margins. Net interest expense\/other of approximately $900 million reflects interest savings from further debt reduction. And we now expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate in 2018 to be approximately 14%, reflecting the full impact from U.S. tax reform.","Average 2018 share count is forecasted to be approximately 350 million shares and assumes completion of the $2 billion share buyback in 2018. As a result, we expect full year 2018 non-GAAP adjusted performance net income per share to be in the range of $15.25 to $16.00. If RESTASIS generics enter the markets outside of our current assumptions, we will provide an update to guidance.","Reported cash flow from operations for the year 2018 is expected between $4.7 billion and $5 billion. This range assumes: one, generic RESTASIS entrants between April and July of 2018; two, success-based milestones from existing transactions in 2018 of approximately $500 million, including the payments for Elastagen and Repros; and three, restructuring and other integration payments in the range of $200 million to $400 million.","Since this is an unusual year given the multiple LOEs we are facing, we will provide you with some preliminary guidance for the first quarter of 2018. For the first quarter, we expect total reported net revenue between $3.5 billion and $3.6 billion and performance net income per share between $3.20 and $3.40, which will be the lowest revenue and performance net income per share quarter for the year. This reflects our normal revenue seasonality as well as the slightly lower Facial Aesthetics sales that Bill mentioned in his remarks and impact from ESTRACE and NAMENDA XR generic competition.","In summary, we finished 2017 on a high note and delivered on all of our commitments, and we look forward to another year of solid financial performance despite the LOEs we face.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Brent for closing remarks.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Thanks, Tessa. So we finished 2017 on a high note, and we're off to a very solid start in 2018. While 2018 is a year where our business is facing some headwinds from LOEs, we have right-sized our business and our outlook is strong. 2018 is not only a year of execution, but also a year with several important pipeline catalysts, and positive data from ubrogepant is a nice start to the news flow. We have a lot to look forward to.","We'll now open the line for Q&A, Crystal.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Seamus Fernandez with Leerink.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks for the questions, so just a few here. First question for Bill, Bill, you mentioned the fillers potentially growing to be larger than BOTOX. I assume you meant BOTOX Cosmetic, but just trying to get a better sense of where you guys are seeing the strongest growth rates and the reasons behind that.","The second question is for David. David, can you just give us a little bit more color around two things, number one, the efficacy and how you see the efficacy of the oral CGRP of ubrogepant relative to triptans and then other potential competitors in the acute setting? It looks to us like efficacy may be a little bit lower, but I know these baseline comparisons are a bit dangerous. So, love to know a little bit of the benefits in triptan non-responders on a relative basis. And then also if you could just clarify the number of cases above three times the upper limit of normal in the placebo arm. Thanks very much.","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Hey, Seamus, this is Bill. In terms of filler growth, it's strong both domestically and internationally. It's especially strong internationally, where it's up almost 30%. Middle East-Africa and Asia-Pacific are the two highest-performing regions. The teams in both places have done a great job.","I think the reason we're seeing such strong growth in the fillers and will continue to see it in the future is because there are more dual users. That means that there are more patients who are receiving BOTOX, opting for \u2013 or for fillers. And that's because aesthetic treatments have shifted from just softening lines to volumizing and contouring, and that's been a trend that we've seen for several years, and I think it's going to continue.","The next reason is there's more volume being used per treatment than there was in the past. And then the third reason for growth is going to be more uses for fillers, especially in the lower face, and new fillers that we introduce. I think the Elastagen deal is a perfect example of developing a next-generation option. And so I'm pretty confident that this business will rival BOTOX in the next three to five years.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","David, do you want to take the?","C. David Nicholson - Allergan Plc","Yes, happy to talk a bit more about the efficacy of ubrogepant. As you mentioned, it's always difficult to do cross-study comparisons. I find the data with ubrogepant very compelling. You asked specifically about the comparison to triptans. One data point that I can mention is that we got 61% pain relief at two hours, which is very comparable to the triptan data. So I think we're showing overall efficacy at least comparable to the triptans.","You also asked about data from triptan non-responders. We had about 27% of triptan non-responders in the study population in this trial. And the efficacy data in the triptan non-responders was numerically very, very similar to the efficacy data from the triptan responders. I'm also very intrigued by the fact that you get a rebound sometimes with triptans quite often. And we didn't see any evidence of rebound headache in the ubrogepant-treated patients. So overall, the data look good.","And you asked about the liver enzyme elevations. I think it's really important to point out that we carefully monitor the liver enzyme in all the patients in ubrogepant and atogepant studies, and we continue to feel good about it across all of the trials. That's a big take-home message that I want to give here. We did see one patient in the placebo-treated arm in this particular trial which had liver enzyme elevations above three times upper limit of normal, and it's a couple on the drug and one on placebo, that type of ratio.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Next question, operator?","Operator","Your next question from the line of Ken Cacciatore with Cowen & Company.","Ken Cacciatore - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks, guys. Just David, just wanted to clarify the last point on those six cases. Could you just give us the split between drug and placebo? Would be helpful. And then also really good data on cariprazine, just trying to put that into some context in terms of competitive products, maybe, David, for you.","And then, Bill, maybe again, a little bit more perspective on what this means for VRAYLAR in general, what you can do with it now that you have an expanded indication or should have an expanded indication. Thank you.","C. David Nicholson - Allergan Plc","Yes, sure. Yes, happy to talk more about it. About the liver enzyme elevations, let me talk a bit about it in more detail. As I say, we monitor the liver enzyme elevations in all of the ubrogepant studies and the atogepant studies. And then in the TransCelerate database, which I've talked about previously, there's about 1.4% of placebo-treated patients who have liver enzyme elevations above three times upper limit of normal. And we're looking now at blinded data in the second ubrogepant acute treatment study, where we get an 0.3% incidence of liver enzyme elevation, so that's 0.3% in that trial in comparison to 1.4%. And we get about the placebo incidence in the other studies that we're monitoring, so.","In this particular trial, as I've just mentioned, we got a two-to-one ratio of drug-treated individuals, two arms of ubrogepant and one arm of placebo. That was the two-to-one that I mentioned in the previous answer. And as I say, we get one case of three times upper limit of normal in the placebo arm and then five across the two arms of ubrogepant.","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Do you want me to touch on?","C. David Nicholson - Allergan Plc","Bill, do you want to?","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Yes. Ken, here's how I think about it. We're developing right now \u2013 we have two indications for VRAYLAR, schizophrenia and bipolar mania. And there are three others that we're working on, bipolar depression, major depressive disorder, and negative symptoms. I would say bipolar depression is the most important one and has the potential to create more value than the other ones.","There are only two atypicals on the market with indications for bipolar depression. SEROQUEL was the first one. LATUDA was the second one. Sales for SEROQUEL at branded pricing was roughly $16 billion, 30% to 40% of that total is bipolar disorder. And then if you look at LATUDA, when it received its indication for bipolar depression, demand doubled in the 12-month period following the approval. And so this has the potential to be a real value creator for VRAYLAR in the future.","If you look at the data, David can comment. In the magnitude of effect on the MADRS, we had roughly a 50% reduction versus baseline. The placebo-adjusted numbers are in line with what was observed with LATUDA, which was the most recent study done.","And the last thing I would say is in terms of benefit\/risk, by the numbers, VRAYLAR's got one of the best safety and side effect profiles in that market. And so I think it's a great opportunity, and the sooner we launch it, the better.","Ken Cacciatore - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great, thank you very much.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Next question, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thanks very much, just two questions, maybe the first on BOTOX migraine and the impact from the CGRPs, I appreciate the comments during the prepared remarks. I just want a little more color in terms of what you're expecting in terms of the ramp for these products. Basically, do you expect these to ramp quickly out of the gate, so you'll have a fairly quick sense if there's going to be an impact to BOTOX migraine, or are you thinking about a more gradual rollout? I'm just trying to get my hands around when we should be able to get a better sense of if there is an impact or not to that franchise.","And the second question I had was on abicipar as we go into the Phase IIIs later this year. Could you just frame expectations into that study readout as we think both about duration and particularly information for that study? And I know you're running or working on an ultra-pure version of the product, maybe just an update on the timelines that we should think about there. Thanks very much.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Why don't, Bill, you take the first part and David.","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Chris, I don't want to speak for Amgen, Novartis, and Teva or I guess Lilly and Alder. I don't think there's a fast ramp for many products, to be fair, in the industry anymore. This product is going to be paid for by both commercial health plans as well as Medicare Part D. As you know, there's a calendar related to when products are added to formulary. And I think formulary coverage for the subcu CGRPs will probably start to materialize in the latter half of 2019. That's at least been my experience with our own product launches as well as other product launches that I've observed in the industry for the past 12 to 24 months.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Do you want to talk about abicipar?","C. David Nicholson - Allergan Plc","Yes, I'm happy to do that. So we anticipate having the readout from our two Phase III trials, SEQUOIA and CEDAR, in the second half of this year. Based on the data that we saw in Phase II, we anticipate seeing efficacy when administered every 12 weeks.","In terms of safety, recall that we're using essentially the same material, the same formulation that we used in Phase II, so there's no real reason to believe that we're going to see inflammation rates differ substantially from the Phase II data. But as you mentioned, we are now producing material that you called it ultra-pure. That's a nice term to use. We have now developed new analytical and purification methodology to remove all of the wholesale proteins that we can see using our present analytical methodology. We have that material. We will be initiating a study in AMD patients in the first half of this year, and we'll be looking clearly at the ocular information that this ultra-pure material produces, and we'll have six-month data mid next year.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Maris with Wells Fargo.","David Maris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, so a couple questions. First, given the market recently, I think I'd like to ask about depression. So aside from VRAYLAR, could you talk about the status of BOTOX in depression, the status of rapastinel, and any other programs that you have in depression?","And then secondly, Brent, I know you take all competition seriously. But can you talk a little bit about what the challenges might be for either a long-acting toxin like what Revance's hopes to be or another Bot-A [botulinum toxin A] that just claims similar-sized protein as BOTOX? Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yes, sure. So why don't we start with the depression and I'll come back to the competitive toxin environment. We can make a joke about the stock market, but I'll let David talk about the more serious stuff.","C. David Nicholson - Allergan Plc","First of all, rapastinel, we're running three short-term, three-week studies looking at the efficacy of rapastinel in major depressive disorder. These are trials on top of standard of care, so in relatively treatment-resistant patients. We anticipate readout from these trials in the first half of 2019.","Patients in these short-term studies can roll over into a maintenance study. The FDA wanted to see maintenance of effect in the first NDA. Rollover into the maintenance study is going exceptionally well. Patients are wanting to stay on rapastinel and roll over into the maintenance study. So obviously, everything is blinded, but so far so good in running those studies. We anticipate getting the maintenance study finished in 2020.","People ask us quite often about how does rapastinel compare to ketamine. Let me just be really clear. Rapastinel is not ketamine. We really don't see the ketamine-like side effects in patients receiving rapastinel.","You also asked about BOTOX in depression. I'm sure people will recall that there's been three investigator-initiated trials showing efficacy of BOTOX in depression, and we ran our own 30 and 60-unit study with intriguing data, intriguingly positive data from the 30-unit dose with efficacy maintained well beyond the six-week time point. We're presently gearing up to run an additional Phase III trial with A-toxin in depression, and we'll be making the choice of the toxin for that particular trial during the course of this year.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","So your second question, David, went to longer-acting toxins and perhaps lower-cost toxins. Look, you said it to begin with. I think clearly, we take all competition seriously. I would point out that we're not competition na\u00efve as some may believe. The world is incredibly competitive when it comes to toxins. There are dozens of competitors in markets like Europe. There are several dozen competitors in markets like Asia and Latin America, and BOTOX remains the number one toxin in these markets. We also have had very important and real competition in the U.S. from companies like Galderma and Merz, and BOTOX has always remained the market leader.","That being said, some new toxins coming in, I think, one, on price point doesn't really concern me as much. I think we will take it seriously, but I think we have a very high value proposition. And consumers have shown over and over that they demand the brand, they demand BOTOX, and we're well prepared for that type of competition.","I think with respect to a longer-acting toxin, my perspective on that is that we know there's a dose response and when you give a higher dose, you get a higher response. David can walk you through all the technicalities and why that this, but we don't see that as all that novel. I don't know, Bill, would you add anything else?","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","I would. I think the big question on any long-acting toxin, is the aesthetic outcome natural or frozen, and it's going to take time for injectors if it's approved. It's going to take time for injectors to figure that out. And so you're really talking about a market development, to be fair, in 2023.","And I would second what Brent said about price. I think the economic proposition is not obvious to me. If the practice passes on the savings, there's no benefit to them. If they keep the savings, there's no benefit to the patient to switch. And if there's going to be an undifferentiated toxin launch, my sense is they're going to compete with Xeomin or Dysport, but it's really difficult to compete with us given our competitive advantage in terms of consumer awareness, injector training programs, loyalty programs, practice support services, and also additional indications for BOTOX, which we expect to get over the next several years in the lower face.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Next question, operator?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Randall Stanicky with RBC Capital.","Randall S. Stanicky - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great, thanks, guys. Brent, I just have two questions. Number one, bigger picture one for you, with the cost cuts and some of the LOEs, you'll assume to be behind this, and some pipeline converting. As you think about the longer-term pathway through to midyear 2022 revenue color that you provided or at least growth rate that you provided, can we start to see some operating leverage? In other words, can we see revenue grow faster than the overall cost base? That's number one.","And then secondly for David, just on ESMYA, I think your PDUFA here is in May. So can you just maybe comment on a couple things: one, level of confidence that the EU deal will be done by then; and two, your confidence in getting a favorable label? Thanks.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yes, so we did at JPMorgan's conference on the webcast provide a longer-term outlook on revenue, at a 5% CAGR. Obviously, that ramps over time given the LOEs in the short-term. We do have some pipeline built into the back end of that. About 10% of the growth in the end is associated with risk-adjusted pipeline sales.","And so when you look through all that, absolutely we start to see operating leverage in the P&L towards the back end of that period. And we will continue to do everything we can as prudent managers of the business and stewards of the business to control costs and drive increased profitability. Tessa, anything you would add to that?","Maria Teresa Hilado - Allergan Plc","In fact, in 2018 we were very deliberate about our cost structure. We planned for an early RESTASIS \u2013 April RESTASIS LOE. And as we guided you through for 2018, in the low end it will be a potential slight deterioration in operating margin. But on the top end, despite the huge LOE in 2017, we could actually expect operating leverage to occur slightly relative to 2017.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","So, David, do you want to talk about ESMYA?","C. David Nicholson - Allergan Plc","Yes, sure, happy to do that. So look, the pharmacological characteristics of ulipristal, the active ingredient in ESMYA, together with all of the non-clinical and clinical data collected from the controlled clinical trials, didn't show any liver toxicity signals on ulipristal. And so the tox studies were clean, the controlled clinical trials were clean. About 700,000 patients have been exposed to ESMYA worldwide, and only four severe cases of liver injury were reported.","Now clearly, all cases of severe liver injury have to be taken seriously. The PRAC is doing its job in reviewing those. And we'll get the outcome of the PRAC deliberations shortly, and these findings will be shared with the FDA. So far, we have no reason to believe that the approval of ESMYA is going to be delayed by the deliberations in Europe.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Great. Next question, operator?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Liav Abraham with Citi.","Liav Abraham - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning. So, Bill, the first one is for you. I appreciate your previous comments on BOTOX in migraine. I just wanted to understand your assumptions a bit better. What was BOTOX migraine growth for 2017? And what exactly are your assumptions for the growth of this franchise of BOTOX in particular for the second half of 2018 given the competitive dynamics? And how do you think about growth in this franchise as you head into 2019?","And then, David, the second one for you on atogepant, I think the last time that you updated us, I think that the DSMB had seen the unblinded data from the study twice. Is there an update on that? Have you seen the unblinded data more than that? And can you give us an update on the numerical reports of elevated liver enzymes three times normal in the atogepant study on a blinded basis? And also, what percentage of patients in the trial have been enrolled and either on drug or placebo for greater than six weeks at this point? Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","So, David, why don't you answer that one first since there were a lot of questions and we can remember it, and then we'll come back to the migraine?","Liav Abraham - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","C. David Nicholson - Allergan Plc","So the question was on atogepant, correct, Liav?","Liav Abraham - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Correct, yes.","C. David Nicholson - Allergan Plc","Okay. So at the moment, the trial is fully enrolled, and more than 800 patients have been exposed to atogepant, and there are about 1,200 patients in the trial. There are just 1% of patients in the atogepant study that's blinded across all patients receiving drug and placebo, 1% had a post-dose ALT or AST above three times upper limit of normal. Of the patients receiving the drug, more than 600 have had the drug for three months. Does that answer your question, Liav?","Liav Abraham - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yes, that's great. Thank you.","C. David Nicholson - Allergan Plc","Thanks.","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","And then, Liav, on BOTOX Therapeutic, as you know, we finished the year up 16% versus prior year. The migraine piece was roughly 20% growth year over year. I don't estimate much of a step down in the second half of 2018 based on the launches of the CGRPs. It's going to take time for those products to secure formulary coverage and create awareness. But it will be lower than the 16% but above 10%. And as you look into 2019 and beyond, this is going to be, I still believe, a high single-digit to low double-digit growth business over that period of time.","Liav Abraham - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. I have three questions. First, Brent, could you just please discuss your confidence in Phase III trial results in 2018 validating Allergan's Open Science business model?","Second, Bill, I think you mentioned that you expect CGRPs to gain more share in episodic migraine than chronic migraine. I think that that is the opposite of the consensus view. So I would love to get some more color from you.","And then third, Tessa, could you speak to 2018 operating cash flow prospects relative to performance net income, please? Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","So on the first question, look, I don't think any one trial validates our model. I think to be fair, Open Science, while that is what Allergan is 100% committed to, is the methodology used by the entire industry to drive innovation. In fact, I would argue that almost all the innovation in this industry comes from deploying Open Science-like strategies. So I don't think it necessarily needs to be validated. I think it has been validated by the industry and by the data.","That being said, I think every time we are successful, I think it proves that Allergan is good at analyzing, developing, and getting drugs approved, and I think our track record over the last four years is pretty darn solid. In fact, I don't think we've had a major failure in the pipeline since I've been CEO and David has been head of R&D. This year we are looking forward to continuing to move forward with, obviously, ubrogepant. We'll see data from bimatoprost SR. We'll see data from abicipar, and we'll see the ESMYA NDA outcome.","Look, I think for us to bat 1.000 in all of our R&D projects would be all-time industry setting records. And if that's expectations, I would say they're too high. But I think we'll do better than most, and I think we have calculated our own return on investment, and it's much higher than industry averages. And so I think we have extreme confidence that our strategy is working. But by no means would I say everything we do will be perfect. Do you want to talk about?","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Yes, and I think I agree with consensus. I believe CGRPs will garner more use in episodic migraine simply because it's a larger market, and BOTOX is at the other end of the chronic segment of the market, and I think that makes sense. And I do believe that products ultimately are going to coexist here. And I find it hard to believe that someone who's well-controlled on BOTOX given the clinical and economics is going to move over to a CGRP.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","And, Tessa, you want to talk about cash flow?","Maria Teresa Hilado - Allergan Plc","Yeah, on cash flow, David, we provided you just now guidance on 2018 operating cash flow. That's GAAP cash flow of about $4.7 billion and $5 billion. That obviously already includes milestone payments and the deals that are construed as asset deals and restructuring as well. That's about $700 million to $900 million included in GAAP operating cash flow.","So if you just simply do the math and take a look at our guidance for performance net income on the low and the high end, you'll get to a conversion that's higher than the 90% if you obviously take out CapEx as well, so on the low end, maybe close to 90% and on the high end, 100%. But we don't really look at that because on a quarterly basis, our cash flow cadence is very different. But suffice it to say if you look at 2017 overall for the full year and you do the same math, the conversion ratios were north of 100%.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","And the only thing I would just add, and this goes to what we also provided in the quarterly guidance, the first quarter is \u2013 there's a seasonality to our business. There's a rhythm to our business, where the first quarter is the lowest revenue, the lowest net performance operating income, and obviously the lowest cash flow. And last year I know that caused some consternation. And so just to be clear, we fully expect the first quarter to be the lowest, and we tend to see more strength in the second and fourth quarter than we do in the first and third. But remember, this year may be a bit unusual with the LOEs, and the timing of the LOEs may impact that. So that's why we gave quarterly guidance, and we will likely continue to do that until we work our way through these large LOEs so to help you guys see visibility on it.","Maria Teresa Hilado - Allergan Plc","And then I would add, we provided milestones as well, data in our disclosures, which means you can get all of the elements, including a cash flow bridge that provides clarity hopefully to all of you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yes, it's all in the appendix, so let's move on to the next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gerberry with Bank of America.","Jason M. Gerberry - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First for David just on ubrogepant, can you just confirm that none of the liver enzyme elevations were 5x the upper limit of normal?","And then two questions for Bill. Just Bill, as you think about the value proposition for ubrogepant, just curious as we do the cross-track comparisons to lasmiditan what you think the value hook here is. Is it more about efficacy beyond two hours? Is it more about tolerability? I mean with lasmiditan, I know that the AE rates were pretty high in Phase II and were moderated in Phase III based on some exclusion criteria. So just curious how you see this backing up to lasmiditan.","And then just lastly on BOTOX Cosmetic, don't disagree with your views just in terms of the financial incentives around BOTOX loyalty. But could you just maybe confirm what proportion of BOTOX Cosmetic patients also get another Allergan aesthetic product? Thanks.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","So, David, you want to talk again about ubrogepant?","C. David Nicholson - Allergan Plc","Yes, sure, happy to do that. Hey, lots of questions of course, and concerns about, potential concerns about liver enzyme elevations. I really want to reiterate that we track all cases of liver enzyme elevations in all ubrogepant and atogepant studies. And so far, across the board, we see rates which are similar to or lower than those reported in the TransCelerate placebo database. Migraine patients are renowned for all the concomitant medication that they take, and none of the cases that we've seen in the ubrogepant trial adjudicated have a probable relationship to the drug. We did see three cases in the ubrogepant study above five times upper limit of normal, but again, in the context of not being concerned about the liver enzyme elevations that we see across all of the studies to date.","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Yeah and then, Jason, as it relates to lasmiditan, I do think it's about benefit\/risk. If you want to compare ubrogepant to that, I think they have dizziness rates that are probably in the 10% to 20% range. If you look at the tolerability of ubrogepant in the recent study, it looks very, very good.","I think the proposition for ubrogepant is great. This triptan category hasn't been challenged in over 20 years. At branded pricing, it's a $5 billion market. You have failure rates or non-responder rates, I should say, in the 30% range. You got 10% of people using opioids, 20% of triptan users have cardiovascular \u2013 or migraine sufferers have cardiovascular risk factors, which means triptans aren't great options. 10% of people are using opioids.","And so there's a real need for something that can provide pain freedom in 20% of patients at two hours and you got pain relief in 60% of patients, which is, as David said, comparable to the triptans. I'm not thinking too much about the products that are in development. I think our focus is purely on that triptan category. And if we can replicate in the next Phase III study that we've showed in the first one, this could be a big enhancement to our migraine business.","C. David Nicholson - Allergan Plc","And so I just want to come back. I think I said three cases above five times upper limit of normal. That's two cases. I misspoke, sorry.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Just two. And, Bill, how many patients I think get both BOTOX and another Allergan?","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Jason, there's two programs, as you know. There's the APP program and then there's the Brilliant Distinctions program. In APP, I would assume that 80% to 90% of physicians are purchasing more than one product from Allergan, and Brilliant Distinctions is probably closer to 50%.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","And I would tell you the largest growth that we see and the biggest opportunity is, as we continue to grow the portfolio of Medical Aesthetics, the proposition has always been about leveraging BOTOX fillers, CoolSculpting, KYBELLA, SkinMedica, and the like to the existing patient users.","Jason M. Gerberry - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Great, thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you, just a couple questions. First, Brent, now that corporate tax reform has passed, the advantages of being an inverted company are less obvious. Have you looked at the possibility of reinverting other financial or tax rate benefits? Certainly, there would be a great PR advantage I would think to moving back. But I'm just wondering if that is something that you've looked at.","Secondly, just back on ubrogepant, can you talk about or frame the revenue opportunity for the acute migraine indication? I think most of the focus has been on the prophylactic use in terms of the size of that opportunity. But how are you thinking about ubrogepant in this initial acute indication?","And then just lastly, what are your commercialization plans for the new acne drug, sarecycline, that pending approval at the FDA in light of recently scaling back on the medical derm sales force? Thanks very much.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yes, so I'll answer the first question on tax reform very simply and clearly. No, we're an Irish company. We're going to stay in Ireland. Do you want to talk about acute migraine?","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","I mentioned it a moment ago, Jami. There are roughly 15 million prescriptions being written for triptans. If you want to think about the market at branded pricing, it's probably $5 billion. I think that ubrogepant to a certain extent is underappreciated. There really hasn't been a legitimate alternative to triptans since they were introduced in I guess it was the late 1980s. And so getting 10% or more of this market I think is very reasonable given the lack of alternatives and so far the data that we've seen on ubrogepant.","And it's a difficult condition to control, we know that. And many patients are cycling from one triptan to the next, and there's a large cohort of people that really can't take triptans because of cardiovascular risk factors. There was another question related to sarecycline.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yes.","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Yes, we're evaluating our commercial model right now in Medical Dermatology and how we'll commercialize sarecycline. And I think we'll have more about that in the next couple quarters.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Is that a business you would consider to divest?","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Right now we're focused on trying to leverage the assets we have and get the pipeline approved. We'll see where we'll go, but it's a very natural business for us to be in. Next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you, a couple cleanups there, Tessa. One on tax rate, can you provide any color beyond 2018? Even if you don't guide, can you give us some pushes and pulls, or is high teens the way to think about the longer-term rate?","Maria Teresa Hilado - Allergan Plc","We're not really going...","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","One more question...","Maria Teresa Hilado - Allergan Plc","We're not really going to...","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Impairment charge in Q4...","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yes go ahead.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","...can you say what that was on?","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","The impairment charge in Q4?","Maria Teresa Hilado - Allergan Plc","Okay, so on the tax rate, we're not really going to give guidance beyond 2018, but what I would say is that our rate in 2018 fully incorporates U.S. tax reforms on a go-forward basis. We don't think there's going to be any material change from that rate.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, thanks.","Maria Teresa Hilado - Allergan Plc","On impairment, really there were three impairments that totaled about $207 million. The biggest of that was Brimo DDS, which was really a delay and a hold on the program. And so the change is simply a delay in the cash flows. That was really biggest one out of that $207 million.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then if I could for David, which toxin are you using for depression and how could it be different?","And lastly for Brent, in light of ESMYA coming and the other assets you have in Women's Health, is Women's Health a priority area for you from a BD standpoint? It seems like there's more going on there these days than in years past. Thanks.","C. David Nicholson - Allergan Plc","Yes, so regarding the toxin for depression, we haven't actually made a final decision which toxin to use for our depression studies. We will be making that decision during the course of the year. We do have an additional toxin going into Phase I studies at the moment, which we may use for our depression trial, but we still have to make the final decision on that.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","And then lastly with respect to Women's Health, we're always committed to Women's Health. I think the performance of LoLo and the launch of ESMYA are two great reasons to believe in this therapeutic area. One of the reasons we haven't spoken as much about it is there's not generally a lot of innovation or meaningful innovation in this category, which is a whole different matter in and of itself. But we remain committed to it, and we'll continue to look for ways to help women improve their health. Next question, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein.","Aharon Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning, congratulations on the trial results and thank you for taking the questions, a couple of cleanups as well. David, most triptan results are reported in terms of response rate. Could you give us the response rate for placebo in the treatment arms in this trial just to make the comparisons just a little bit easier?","And, Bill, can you just discuss the loyalty program changes that you guys are making? How does it exactly change the balance for physicians as they think about BOTOX versus other products? Is there actually a difference in the economical proposition you're making with physicians?","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Great. So, David, you want to go first here?","C. David Nicholson - Allergan Plc","Yes, sure. So on the two co-primary endpoints, the placebo rate for the two-hour pain freedom was 11.8%. And for the absence of the most bothersome symptom, the placebo rate was 27.8%. So I think that falls within the range that we've seen from the placebo rate for other recent migraine \u2013 acute migraine studies, Ronny.","Aharon Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Most triptans reported...","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Go ahead.","Aharon Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Most triptan trials reported, the primary endpoint was response rate, not pain-free rate. I was wondering if you might have those numbers.","C. David Nicholson - Allergan Plc","These were our co-primary endpoints. Clearly, we've got a whole \u2013 a number of other secondary endpoints, many of which were statistically significant. We will be presenting those data at a major meeting, and it's difficult for us to give all of the top line data in a presentation like this, Ronny. Pain relief is one of the most frequently reported endpoints. And know we've got 61%, as I mentioned, for ubrogepant, and the comparison to about 40% on placebo, which is a normal number. And just to comment on the safety, I really do want to reiterate that we have no concerns about the safety reported in this trial.","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Ronny, as it relates to our APP program, which is essentially a physician loyalty program, we are pretty disciplined about discounting our business because it's not a commodity business. But very simply, the changes that we're going to make will provide more discounts for more volume. And there are many different elements to it, but we're going to reward the top practices in the country for using our products, like we always have. And it protects the business, and it also creates cross-selling opportunities. And given the activity in the market over the next 12 to 24 months, it's one of the advantages of being an incumbent.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Operator, next question. We'll take just a few more.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore.","Umer Raffat - Evercore ISI","Hi, thanks so much for taking my questions. David, just a quick follow-up, I know you've given color on ALT above three times being five cases, ALT above five times being two cases, as you corrected. What about ALT above eight times? Is there any over there, first?","Second, Tessa, can you just give us some color on cash taxes you're paying, especially as it relates to the $468 million in increase in the fourth quarter we saw in cash flow from operations from taxes payable? I just wanted to understand that.","And then finally, Brent, I'm curious. So there's a lot of speculation that we're in a year with potentially very large mega-M&As coming. And it would seem very uncharacteristic of you and Allergan as an organization to be absolutely uninvolved in an environment like that. So my question to you is how do you see this playing out?","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yes. So, David, you want to talk. And I think to be fair, you heard David say he's confident in the safety of these drugs. We'll answer this last question, but maybe we could move on to another topic with the last remaining questions if we can.","C. David Nicholson - Allergan Plc","Yes. Look, so I am confident about the safety data that we've seen in all of our studies. Maybe I could talk about the second blinded single-attack study with ubrogepant, where we have the blinded data. And in that study, no patients so far have had an ALT or ASD elevation about five times upper limit of normal. Clearly, that's blinded, but that includes placebo as well as ubrogepant data. 0.3% above three times upper limit of normal, no cases so far above five times upper limit of normal.","In the atogepant studies, where, as I said, we've got a 1% incidence of \u2013 overall 1% incidence of three times upper limit of normal, and again, everything's blinded, but three cases above \u2013 only three cases above five times upper limit of normal. So in the studies that we've just unblinded, two cases in ubrogepant are hard cases above five times upper limit of normal. So overall, we're very confident about the safety of the data. We have one case in the present study above eight times upper limit of normal. This was somebody with acute pancreatitis and appendicitis, and it was absolutely adjudicated as not being related to study drug.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","The second question I think was to Tessa.","Maria Teresa Hilado - Allergan Plc","On cash taxes, I would say look at our ETR rate that we guided to, which is roughly 14%. We don't really talk about cash taxes because, as you know, through the years there are different refunds or different taxes related to M&A that affect that. So I would guide you to using ETR, some measure of like economic payments.","With regards to what's in the cash flow of $468 million, as you know, in the fourth quarter we true up any taxes that need to be paid, including any other discrete items that need to get adjusted for the year, so that's nothing unusual I would say.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","And then lastly to M&A, I've said very clearly that Allergan was going to be taking a break from our stepping-stone strategy, with the exception of things that are important to our long-term strategic growth like we did with our filler technology, which we think is an incredible opportunity for us to take fillers to whole different level. We'll reevaluate our position in the second half of the year once we got through the LOEs. But I have to say it's most likely that 2018 will be a relatively boring year for Allergan on the M&A front. Next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great, thank you so much for taking my questions, so a couple just on the drug pricing side. First for Brent, I just wondered if you can comment on how much net pricing growth you guys are assuming for 2018 in your guidance.","And then second, you guys have been pretty vocal on this topic. I was just curious. Looking back now, how do you grade the industry and how they're doing in terms of managing this topic? Obviously, we've heard the comments from the President last week. It's obviously going to be something that remains in the headlines. I was just curious how you think your peers are addressing the topic.","And I think maybe just following up on the last question on tax, just in general working capital was a big delta from what we saw in the fourth quarter last year. If you can, just talk about some of the drivers there beyond the tax comments you just made. Thanks.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","So real quick on pricing, as I said in the prepared remarks, pricing wasn't a big part of our story in 2017, and that continues to be the case in terms of growth for 2018. It's roughly about 2% price or maybe a little less. You see the issue with the industry is net versus gross, and so everybody publishes net, but we provide huge rebates and discounts that get us to a better gross. And to be fair, U.S. patients pay some of the lowest prices in the world if you're at the VA or Medicaid and some of the highest prices in the world if you're uninsured. That's very different than the rest of the world, and that's the environment we're in.","Overall though, I think the industry has got a good scorecard on being disciplined on price and also enhancing patient access programs. And as you know, Allergan has among the leading access programs with some of our most important drugs getting accessible to people at five times the poverty limit. So we continue to look at ways to make our drugs affordable and accessible, and I think the industry has done a really nice job. Tessa, do you want to talk about...","Maria Teresa Hilado - Allergan Plc","I would say on working capital, our normal variances obviously with regards to shipments, product mix, and revenue. And the only thing that I would probably call out that's a change but not a big change relative to last year is the timing of gross-to-net settlements. That's all.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","So perhaps we'll wrap the call up. And with that, I'd like to thank all of our Allergan colleagues around the world for delivering a strong 2017. Execution was our promise and truly their focus. We've taken actions to mitigate the impact of the loss of exclusivity risks, and we are incredibly well positioned to deliver on our commitments for this year, including growing revenues of our key products.","Importantly, I'm also reassured about the progress we're making in our pipeline and optimistic of the value we can create for the future with ubrogepant for migraine and VRAYLAR for depression. We're also looking forward to seeing Phase III results from abicipar for AMD, bimatoprost SR for glaucoma, as well as FDA action on the ESMYA NDA for abnormal bleeding associated with uterine fibroids. This is all going to happen in 2018. Collectively, these R&D programs have the potential to help million of patients and produce significant value.","With that, I thank you all for your time and look forward to talking with you in the future. Thank you, operator.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"1219":["Allergan, Inc.

Following today\u2019s presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) At the request of the company, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. And now I would like to introduce today\u2019s conference host, Mr. Jim Hindman, Senior Vice President, Treasury, Risk and Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Jim Hindman","","Thank you, Jane, good morning. With me for today's conference call is David Pyott, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Edwards, Executive Vice President, Finance and Business Development, Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Scott Whitcup, Executive Vice President, Research and Development, Chief Scientific Officer; and Jim Barlow, Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller.","Before we move ahead, I\u2019d like to remind you that certain statements that we will make in this presentation are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements reflect Allergan's judgment and analysis only as of today and actual results may differ materially from current expectations based on a number of factors affecting Allergan's businesses.","Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. For a more thorough discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the forward-looking statements to be made in this conference call and webcast, we refer you to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements that is included in our second-quarter 2014 earnings release, which was furnished to the SEC today on Form 8-K as well as our filings with the SEC referenced in that disclaimer.","We will follow up the question-and-answer session of this call with a short listen-only segment where we will provide additional miscellaneous information that relates to our business. Under Regulation FD, in order to be able to discuss this information freely during the quarter, we must be sure that it is in the public domain.","This conference call and the accompanying webcast are being simultaneously broadcast over the Internet with replays available for one week. You can access the information on our website at www.allergan.com.","At this point, I would like to turn the call over to David Pyott.","David Pyott","","Great. Thanks, Jim. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. In Q2, Allergan enjoyed the strongest increase in absolute dollar sales in any quarter in our history with strong contributions from nearly all of our businesses and major products with overall sales increasing 15.9% in dollars and by 16.3% in local currencies.","These results demonstrate a continuation in the strong momentum in our businesses that commenced in the early part of 2013, driven by strong market conditions and many regulatory approvals all over the world, including 12 since 2010 from the FDA alone.","Our strong results are also a testament to our employees\u2019 continuing focus on delivering high value to our customers, generating positive R&D outcomes and productively attending to other top corporate priorities. It is very important to note that our employee base is galvanized around our commitment to create an even better stronger company.","In this context, voluntary employee turnover in Q2 was in fact lower than in the prior year. Regarding earnings, the upswing is even more notable than the growth in sales. In Q2, non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.51 leapt 23.8% versus Q2 of 2013. EPS topped the upper end of the outlook provided on the last earnings call by $0.07, which we\u2019ve added to the upper end of the outlook for full-year 2014.","The revised outlook for EPS for full year of 2014 is now in a range of 20% to 22% growth versus 2013. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP numbers to U.S. GAAP, kindly consult our press release.","It is to be noted that channel inventories at the end of the second quarter were at a low level. Looking to the full-year, we raised guidance for the top end of our sales and indeed 2014 is on track to be our best year ever in terms of sales growth.","After I\u2019ve covered the highlights of our Q2 operating results, I\u2019ll provide further commentary on our value creation plan for stockholders, which is contained in our press release. The essential elements of this plan are that we will reduce costs in 2015 relative to our earlier strategic plan by approximately $475 million and reduce our workforce by approximately 1,500 employees or 13% to drive a further major increase in EPS relative to the last strategic plan that we presented to stockholders in May.","This plan is based on deep knowledge of our business as well as on a thoughtful and detailed analysis of our cost structures, operating processes, and ranked order of returns from investments. The carefully accretive approach in developing this plan serves the twin goals of minimizing the impact of the cost reductions on our ability to grow sales at a double-digit rate in the period after 2019, as well as preserving the strength of our R&D pipeline.","We believe that we can deliver on these goals whilst greatly increasing EPS for 2015 in a range of $8.20 to $8.40 and for 2016 to approximately $10 per share. A presentation on our plan is to be found on our website and has been filed with the SEC this morning.","Returning to the highlights of Q2, whilst we drove the strong increase in earnings, we continue to invest in our greatest opportunities, namely the launch of VOLUMA in the U.S. supported by direct-to-consumer advertising, our businesses in Japan, China and Southeast Asia, as well as DTC for BOTOX for chronic migraine, DTC for BOTOX cosmetic, and for ACZONE.","Overall expenditure in Q2 on non-GAAP SG&A increased by 13% and within this, expenditure on DTC increased by 45% in Q2 versus Q2 of 2013 to approximately $70 million. Investment in non-GAAP R&D in Q2 increased by 8% to $288 million.","Regarding the individual businesses, I\u2019ll commence with ophthalmic pharmaceuticals. Q2 sales year-over-year grew strongly at 14.8% in local currencies and 14.5% in dollars. The second quarter produced growth at a higher rate than in Q1 with the year-to-date growth standing at 13.0% in local currencies and 12.0% in dollars. Year-to-date growth has been diversified with every operating region growing double digits, namely; North America; Europe, Africa, Middle East; Latin America; and Asia Pacific.","RESTASIS was an outstanding contributor with local currency growth of 25.2% in Q2 and 19.3% year-to-date. In the U.S., year-to-date June growth reported by IMS was 21.8% with approximately 10% in volume and the remainder in price. We attribute the continuing success to earlier treatment of therapeutic dry eye symptoms, strong uptake by a larger group of optometrists, and increase in consumer awareness driven by our DTC advertising.","Year-to-date, our glaucoma franchise has grown 5.8% in local currencies with strong double-digit growth ex-U.S., being offset by challenging market conditions here in the U.S. We have the impact in the U.S. of generics on the branded glaucoma business and rebate pressures from Medicare and commercial managed-care plans.","We are, however, pleased that LUMIGAN in the U.S. is steadily improving in volume. As we detail the benefits of LUMIGAN 0.01%, and improved pharmacy fulfillment of the brand as written. Year-over-year growth trends of trailing prescriptions were as follows; first-half 2013, minus 1.1%; second-half 2013, plus 2.1%; year-to-date May, 2014, plus 4.7%.","Overseas, every operating region enjoyed double-digit growth in glaucoma, both in terms of ex-factory and in-market sales as reported by IMS. In Europe, GANFORT unit dose was launched in Italy, Spain, and Switzerland.","Our artificial tears franchise, led by OPTIVE, also recorded double-digit growth in local currencies in Q2, as OPTIVE Advanced, marketed as OPTIVE Plus, in most overseas markets is launched. OPTIVE Advanced unit dose was approved in Canada and will be launched shortly. In the U.S., our tears share is approaching that of the market leader, Alcon Systane.","Due to shortages of some ophthalmic generics in the U.S. market and the resulting ability to increase prices for both branded and generic PRED FORTE and FML, we again had very strong sales in Q2 as we cleared production backlogs.","In Europe, our tears franchise is growing double digit year-to-date May in a market growing 9% as we introduced OPTIVE unit dose and OPTIVE Fusion. OZURDEX in Europe has garnered a 14% share of retina patients, which augurs well for the expected European approval of the diabetic macular edema indication later this year.","Regarding the global ophthalmic market per the IMS Q1 market report, the last period for which data is available, IMS again showed Allergan as the fastest-growing full-line branded company. In a market expanding a robust 12%, Allergan grew 16% with Novartis, including Alcon, at 6%; and Valeant, including Bausch & Lomb, at 5%. In the U.S., Allergan also gained more market share than any other company in the ophthalmic pharmaceutical market.","Moving on to BOTOX, Q2 sales increased year-over-year by 13.7% in local currencies with double-digit performance in both therapeutic and aesthetic categories and by 12.9% in dollars. Whilst we were able to ship some product in the quarter to Venezuela where we hold a commanding share position, sales were down considerably versus prior year as we manage our receivables exposure to this dynamic and challenging market.","In the U.S., we\u2019re seeing a strong upswing in sales for chronic migraine and the two approved bladder conditions, as we have continued to enhance our patient access programs, physician training and practice efficiency support. In addition, with the benefit of the upper limb spasticity indication and weakened competition, sales are growing double-digit in the neuro-rehabilitation channel.","With a new TV commercial for chronic migraine that aired since mid-June, we\u2019re increasing awareness and driving patients to train physicians. Regarding overactive bladder, we\u2019re also excited about a new print campaign entitled Calm Your Bladder and will initiate TV advertising in August.","The American Urology Association and the Society for Urodynamics and Female Urology updated their guidelines in May that established BOTOX as the only standard third-line treatment after, firstly, behavioral therapy and, secondly, pharmacological treatment, typically anticholinergic drugs. This will be helpful for creating appropriate therapeutic pathways for BOTOX.","Regarding regulatory approvals for BOTOX, we now have lower limb spasticity approval in 10 of the 14 countries in the mutual recognition procedure in Europe and, with this, approval in all of the major Western European markets.","In Western Europe, we\u2019re growing BOTOX therapeutic in-market over 10%, driven by good performance in movement disorders, benefiting from the expanded label as well as the reimbursed launches of chronic bladder and migraine. Overactive bladder was approved in France, Taiwan and Ecuador; and neurogenic bladder in Malaysia. Of course, in my prior remarks it was chronic migraine and the two bladder conditions in Europe.","Turning to the aesthetics side of the business, we estimate, based on survey data, that the U.S. market year-to-date grew high-single digits with our sales growth being further boosted by our 3% price increase posted in January. BOTOX market share remained high in June at over 77% with a point of shared loss versus June 2013 as Xeomin re-entered the market, now with 7% share and 1.5 points up versus June 2013. At 16% share, Dysport dropped one share point. In Europe, we are successfully holding share in a growing market, as we deal with price competition from Galderma and Merz.","In facial aesthetics, we had a blowout quarter with 46% growth in local currencies and in dollars. This was propelled by the launch of VOLUMA in the U.S., but also by the introduction of VOLBELLA and VOLIFT in many foreign markets. Every operating region recorded huge growth.","Vycross is a game-changing technology. The second quarter marks the continuation of the strong growth in the first quarter with year-to-date growth of 41% in local currencies and 40% in dollars. In the U.S., based on survey data, we estimate that the market in units grew mid-single digits, but also enjoyed a huge pickup in value due to the premium pricing of the Allergan product range.","We trained over 12,000 U.S. physicians via training events, heavily invested in DTC, and are using our CRM programs to bring new customers into the facial aesthetics marketplace. Based on our analytics, the introduction of VOLUMA has expanded the market in volume and led to an approximately 25% reduction in the volume of competitive products with the heaviest impact on the earlier-generation volumizing products i.e., RADIESSE, SCULPTRA, and PERLANE, and additionally close to zero cannibalization of base JUVEDERM.","In terms of market share, Allergan in June held 49% of the total market, 12 full market share points up year-over-year, with Valeant down 8 share points to 31% and Merz down 3 points to 20%. In the U.S. facial aesthetics and medical dermatology segments, we have profited greatly from the dislocation in the marketplace after the announcement of the Valeant offer, as physicians have literally voted with their pens and syringes.","Since late April, we have taken almost 450 accounts away from Valeant and almost 100 accounts away from Obagi. In the European Union, based on syndicated data for Q1, enormous market expansion continues with the market growing over 20% and Allergan growing at over double the rate of the market.","Allergan now has an estimated 45% market share despite the presence of literally hundreds of competitive products. In Japan, we launched base JUVEDERM products without lidocaine in March, creating a broad portfolio of aesthetic products. VOLBELLA and VOLIFT were launched in New Zealand. In terms of regulatory approvals, VOLIFT was approved in Canada.","Breast aesthetics sales in Q2 increased by only 2.9% in local currencies and by 3.2% in dollars. Market conditions in the U.S. were weak where we estimate that the implant market actually marginally declined in units and we accepted minor loss of share in low-priced saline and round gel implants as we migrate our mix to higher-priced products including the 410 shaped implant.","We\u2019re also dedicating selling resources to the introduction of our SeriScaffold product for tissue support, which is being rapidly adopted by U.S. hospital formularies. In Europe, the market was also weak, and we were prepared to walk away from some low-priced accounts. Per syndicated data for Q1, the European market for implants grew 7% in units with Allergan posting low unit growth. In other regions, we enjoyed strong growth in Japan, following our market introduction, as well as in China, Australia, Canada, and Brazil. Mexico had almost no sales in Q2 after initial large Q1 shipments when we commenced direct selling operations.","Our skin care and other franchise grew 6.8% in local currencies and 6.6% in dollars. Commenting the important constituent parts, we recorded strong growth of ACZONE in Q2 with IMS showing a 47% increase in acquisition dollars year-over-year driven by ACZONE\u2019s unique positioning for adult female patients, successful DTC advertising, and market share gains.","For TAZORAC, IMS recorded Q2 year-over-year acquisition dollar growth of 16%. Our topical skincare line, led by SkinMedica, had a weak performance quarter given a wraparound with a strong Q2 2013 when we introduced a new key skin lightening product called LYTERA.","LATISSE sales declined 9.4% in dollars, impacted by a decline in wholesaler inventory in the U.S. We presume that this was in reaction to a court ruling regarding our patents and permitting the approval of generics. Notwithstanding the court ruling, it is our belief that no genetic introduction is imminent given packaging challenges with brushes.","We also believe that the mid-term impact will be limited as consumers look to the LATISSE brand when product is dispensed in-office. In the quarter, in-office sales of LATISSE increased modestly.","One comment on Valeant, on July 18, Valeant pre-announced sales figures for Bausch & Lomb for Q2. We were impressed by some of the eye-popping growth numbers which are outside any range of normal growth of these global ophthalmic market segments. We would encourage investors to ask Valeant about in-market growth relative to inventory changes as well as any rebating or promotional programs. Finally, we also look forward to Bausch & Lomb growth figures for Q3 so the trends can be monitored.","I will now pass on to Jeff Edwards who will comment our financial performance and then, I will return to addressing our value creation plan for stockholders. Over to you, Jeff.","Jeff Edwards","Thanks, David, and good morning to all of you on the call. During the second quarter of 2014, Allergan once again continued its very positive trend and generated strong operating results as we benefited from double-digit sales growth across most of our geographic regions and businesses.","The company\u2019s thoughtful approach relating to investment decisions along with its continuing strength in operational execution allowed the company to once again overachieve both our product net sales and earnings per share guidance for the quarter. We continued to make selective investments in the components of our business where we\u2019re most likely to generate significant financial returns while leveraging areas that were deemed to produce less favorable financial returns.","Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2014 were $1.51 with growth of 23.8% compared to the second quarter of 2013 from continuing operations. A reconciliation of all of the adjustments to GAAP earnings is set out in our earnings release.","Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments, amortization of acquired intangibles, and discontinued operations, Allergan\u2019s Q2 2014 gross margins of 87.9%, increased 50 basis points when compared to Q2 of the prior year, driven primarily by favorable pricing as well as favorable regional and product mix. ","The non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses to product net sales ratio of continuing operations for the second quarter was 37.4%, totaling $684 million. This represents a 100 basis point decline compared to the second quarter of 2013 and reflects our commitment to leverage expenses. We\u2019re committed to direct an even greater focus on further enhancing our investment decisions on a going-forward basis. The comparable ratio and expense value for the same period in 2013 were 38.4% to $606 million, respectively.","Consistent with our annual budget and most current forecast, we continue to anticipate that Allergan\u2019s non-GAAP selling and general, administrative expense to product net sales ratio will be further leveraged in the second half of this year. Non-GAAP research and development expenses were 15.8% of product net sales for the quarter, totaling $288 million, an increase in spend of approximately $22 million over the $266 million or 16.9% of product net sales spent in the second quarter of 2013.","With respect to our balance sheet, consolidated Allergan days sales outstanding was 53 days while consolidated Allergan inventory days on hand was 123 days. Important to note, our in-channel or trade inventories continue to track towards the very low end of our internal targets. ","In the second quarter, operating cash flow, after CapEx, was approximately $410 million. At the end of the second quarter, Allergan\u2019s cash and equivalents and short-term investments and cash and equivalents and short-term investments, net of debt positions, totaled approximately $3.7 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. During Q2, share repurchase relating to stock-based employee compensation programs totaled $436 million.","With respect to our performance aspirations for third quarter of 2014, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $1,675 million to and $1,750 million and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $1.44 to $1.47.","Regarding full-year expectations for 2014, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $6,900 million to $7,050 million and our full-year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $5.74 to $5.80.","As a reminder, this EPS expectation assumes the U.S. R&D tax credit will be renewed in the fourth quarter 2014 with the full-year retroactive benefit impacting Q4 results. This will generate a higher effective tax rate in the first three quarters of 2014 and thus lower EPS results in those quarters while benefiting both Q4 effective tax rate and reported Q4 EPS.","Consistent with the previous quarters, please note that product net sales expectations excludes any further anticipated revenue from the transition services agreements related to the sale of the obesity intervention business.","As a reminder, the product net sales associated with the transition services agreement primarily relate to distribution services outside of the United States and contract manufacturing services. These transition services agreements are expected to continue to have a minimal impact to the bottom line for both 2014 and 2015. For your information, expectations for other lines of the income statement and specific product sales expectations are included in the current release.","Before we open it up to questions, I\u2019m going to turn the call back to David for a few additional comments.","David Pyott","Great. Thank you, Jeff. As you know, we committed to shareholders that we will be taking action to drive value both in the near-term and into the future. Today\u2019s results demonstrate that we\u2019re clearly on the right path and the actions announced today will only accelerate our trajectory.","As I stated during the introduction, our overarching goals with our value creation plan for stockholders is to drive sustainable operational efficiencies without compromising our effectiveness and to adhere to our core corporate values but focus on the customer and innovation. In this way, we can make Allergan an even stronger company than before.","So referring to the deck that we filed in our website and found with the SEC about 45 minutes ago, you can consult page 8 which is a good summary. We strongly believe that the reductions, whilst deep, serve two important goals; ability to grow sales in a double-digit rate up to 2019, the last year of our current strategic plan; preserving the strength of our R&D pipeline as we do not cancel any program that is in the clinic.","On page 20 of our deck, we lay out the plan and how we wish to generate $10 per share in 2016. Important to emphasize is that these earnings are reached before we deploy the considerable free cash flow of approximately $18 billion during this plan period.","Based on carefully listening to many investors, we heard that this level of EPS performance is what is required. We also heard a desire for deployment of our balance sheet, which is laid out in page 21. First order of preference is for a meaningful strategic acquisition that provides for accretion and further shareholder value. With many alternatives available, we\u2019re presently pursuing various options.","With this, operator, we\u2019re now open to questions.","Question-And-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Liav Abraham with Citi Research. Your line is open.","Liav Abraham - Citi Research","Good morning and congrats on a fantastic set of results. My question is regarding your tax rate. The reduction of tax rates has become of increasing focus for companies in this space, and several inversion plans by companies have been announced over recent weeks. One could argue that this is almost a necessity at the moment, a lower tax rate, and not a relative advantage in an industry that is rapidly consolidating. I\u2019d be interested in your updated thoughts on this, where do you stand with respect to lowering your tax rate? And is this a priority for you over the near to medium term? Thank you.","David Pyott","","Okay. I think I will answer that, Liav, at a very high level. Obviously, tax rate is one of the ways to create value. I would still argue that the ultimate one is driving sales growth and the greatest value of all is organic sales growth as demonstrated by what we're able to achieve this year.","I think another consideration I would have is how long these huge differentials in tax rate will remain. Clearly, that has an effect on valuation. One would assume that the U.S. Congress at some point, watching the mass exodus of U.S. companies to lower tax jurisdictions, at some point will act, although I would take the view that that certainly won't happen in the next couple of months.","So very high level, when we look at all our options, tax rate reduction is one of them. And in fact, there are some internal things we are doing outside the field of acquisitions that follow the rules to somewhat mitigate the very high rate of tax we pay in the United States.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Ronny Gal with Bernstein. You may ask your question.","Ronny Gal - Bernstein","","Good morning and let me add my congratulations to Liav's for this set of results. Let me ask, essentially, a question and a half. The first one is, you obviously had a very successful growth rate to your revenue. Can you just go through a little bit a couple of details and explain how could that be possible, or more correctly, how would that not be possible if you did not have the resources you have at hand? That is, if you adopted the Valeant model, what would have happened to the growth acceleration you currently have?","And second, and that\u2019s probably the main one if you have to pick one, is in my talk today with some investors the pushback I got on your cost cuts is the, why now? This is a company that could have cut costs a year ago, two years ago, three years ago, and suddenly when they are under threat they got religion around cost. Is this really something that they will execute if the drive, the bid from Valeant, will go away?","So I would ask you, David, if you could directly address that. Essentially as you think about the credibility of your management team in driving down costs, why is it possible to do now while it was not possible to do the same costs cut a year ago, two years ago?","David Pyott","","Okay, so taking them one by one. So I think when you look through all the details, you will see the growth was extremely broad. There was literally contributions from many, many parts of the business. I think when you -- there is actually a chart in the supplemental deck that we filed this morning, which very nicely lays out the trajectory of growth acceleration. It\u2019s actually on page 5 of the deck we just filed.","In terms of then addressing the why now, let me remind you what I said on the first quarter earnings call, and that is, that every year in September senior management meets with the Board of Directors. Our Board very rightfully challenged us last September to say, things looked so good on the sales growth side, obviously internally we had plans at that time for dealing with the RESTASIS generic challenge. And they said, frankly, you can do better than mid-teens earnings growth. And we agreed.","Fortunately, we had already started on that work and Doug Ingram, our new President, really started working in great detail already from January of this year. And that was how we were able to turn the first round of improved performance so quickly.","After that, it was very clear that we needed to do more. That was the feedback from our investment community. And the whole team, not just the commercial team, the R&D team, the G&A team, are all very galvanized around making this a better company and producing the results.","In terms of investors' ability to believe this new set of numbers, I\u2019d make two comments. One is, in my 16 years here, we have never disappointed you in any one single quarter. The only time we ever reduced our outlook during a year was during 2009, that was the year of the Great Recession. You saw us reacting very quickly that year to cost reduction.","And I think going forward, a very important point is we are asking our Board of Directors to approve really a new form of compensation for the very top people in this company and that compensation will be pegged to delivering the earnings per share numbers that we have in the sheet of paper for 2015 and 2016.","So the way it should be, if we deliver those numbers, speaking for the top management, we get paid and you get paid. If we don't deliver those numbers, then we will be looking at fresh air and that\u2019s the way it should be. So very strong commitment to delivering the numbers I had laid out in this presentation and in the earnings release.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Annabel Samimy with Stifel Nicolaus. You may ask your question.","Annabel Samimy - Stifel Nicolaus","","Hi, thanks for taking my question. Again, congratulations on a great quarter. I guess I wanted to focus on the launch from guidance, the 2015, the 2016 EPS guidance that you provided, which is significantly higher than the Street, even when we consider some of the cost-cutting restructuring plans that you have. So, is there anything more outside of what you\u2019ve laid out, the $475 million and I can't remember the last number you provided in terms of cost restructuring when you first announced it back in May. ","And if it's strictly just the $475 million, is this to suggest that the revenue growth is actually going to make up for the rest of it? And right now, it suggests that it should be probably above the 15% range. So can you just help us frame that a little bit because it\u2019s significantly higher than where the Street is right now, even with some of these measures put in place?","David Pyott","","Yes, okay. I think the best place to look is on page 20 of the supplemental deck that we filed with SEC this morning. It is on our website, and let me just walk you through the numbers quickly. So going to 2014, in simplicity, we beat the quarter by $0.07. We rolled that through to the full year. So currently, earnings per share outlook is $5.74 to the top end of $5.80. "," ","Then, we\u2019ve put out a number of -- a range for next year of $8.20, going to in a range at the top $8.40 and then approximately for 2016, $10.00. And when you look at all those numbers across the top with greater than 20% five-year EPS CAGR, you can do your own math on the fact that we still will continue to have interesting rates of earnings per share increases for 2017, \u201818, and \u201819. ","Now, coming back to the comment you made about cost reduction, clearly $475 million, as a quick reminder, the prior plan we announced in -- it was in May really contemplated moderation of increase, not absolute reduction. So that\u2019s why now we\u2019ve really gone back into great detail of where can we reduce cost ","And very saliently, we\u2019ve real protected those areas that we believe lead to the greatest revenue growth. So on the commercial side, DTC is untouched. Obviously, every year, there is a portfolio of different programs and when you think back to my remarks from this quarter, you can see us even increasing DTC this quarter, bringing on new campaigns. And that kind of thing will continue. ","Also, when you look at the sales force side, there you have only a 6% reduction on roughly 4,000 salespeople worldwide. So, very modest, very limited. It really addresses the conditions in the glaucoma market for intraocular pressure-lowering drugs as well as aesthetics, breast aesthetics. ","And that\u2019s why we believe that, relative to the last plan that we put out, the impact on revenue growth is only about 50 basis points per year and restating the obvious, still keeps us in that double-digit revenue growth range. So there was some moderation, but still we retain an extremely attractive growth profile and I think I would argue relative to most other companies, especially of our size, in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries.","Operator","","Our next question comes from David Maris with BMO Capital Markets. You may ask your question.","David Maris - BMO Capital Markets","","Good morning. I want to ask a question around the statement in the press release that there are a number of options, such as business development that are available. And I think today might be the first time that you\u2019ve said that you are presently exploring the options. So, first on the plural part of that option versus options, that\u2019s very interesting, but how confident are you in being able to complete something? "," ","And given your historical P\/E has been around 25 or so for the last decade and if you could do $10 in EPS in 2016, there is no reason to think that the stock can't be at $250 within a year or so. So since buying stock at $170 that is worth $250 seems like a pretty good deal, is it possible that a buyback would be part of the shareholder value creation plan, if a transaction -- if you had excess cash flow and balance sheet capacity after a transaction? Thank you.","David Pyott","","Right. Well, I think based on -- first of all, I very much like your arithmetic projections and I am sure a lot of people will be thinking about what multiples they should be applying to 2015 and 2016 numbers. Then going back to the options, I think when we listened very carefully to our major stockholders, their order of preference, as I stated in my remarks, would be that we complete a strategic transaction. I think that is logical, because if we found the right company with the right level of accretion, that is the biggest booster of further EPS growth on top of -- if we're talking 2016 above that $10 number.","Clearly, on the other side, if for any reason we weren't satisfied with finally completing a transaction of that nature, we always have two fallback positions which can be executed very quickly. One is stock buyback and I think we understand the mathematics pretty well. At different stock price levels and even at very high prices, there is still accretion."," ","And then in some quarters, we\u2019ve even heard the desire for a special dividend, which of course is a different set of calculations. So that\u2019s what we\u2019ve heard. And I would like to say that there are multiple options on the table and we intend to execute against those ideas.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo","","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow up, David, on the last question on M&A. Can you talk about the sense of urgency to get something done? You have had a few months to look for acquisitions. How would you describe the environment and any color on whether you would consider a new therapeutic area or something within your current or therapeutic area? Thank you.","David Pyott","","Well, going back on the question of time, you should assume that even in normal times we\u2019re looking at not only small acquisition opportunities but large ones. And clearly since April, in addition to the work that we\u2019ve been engaged in, we certainly stepped it up in terms of our analysis of various options. ","I think when I\u2019ve been speaking to investors, I\u2019ve been very clear that to find a strategic acquisition of scale and fit within our existing pillars, if you like, is relatively difficult, because we have very large market positions within them. And so the likelihood is that it\u2019s much more directed to a new pillar or it could be pillars depending on what the profile of the acquisition candidate would be. ","And so obviously I can't comment on names. But certainly you should think about the interest being specialists in nature, that\u2019s our fit, growth profile, obviously, normally these companies have good margins because they have differentiated technology positions. ","And we believe that such a new pillar would just be a start on which we could fit further add and if you think back what we did in all that time ago with Inamed in medical aesthetics, you saw that was the first step. Corneal was the second with JUVEDERM. And we\u2019ve done other things since then both in terms of adding from the outside but also dramatically developing new, innovative products, probably the most spectacular of which in recent vintage would be the Vycross range i.e., VOLUMA and then VOLBELLA and VOLIFT currently overseas.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Marc Goodman with UBS. Your line is open.","Marc Goodman - UBS","","David, the previous guidance for 2016 would have gotten you to like an $8.60 type of number, at least that\u2019s what I was thinking and so with this type of new cost-cutting you\u2019re adding, I don't know whether it\u2019s $1.15 or $1.20 or whatever it is. You're not quite at $10. And so I guess the question is, how do you get the math to work to get to the full $10? Is there any share buyback in there? ","And then just secondly, just on the cost cutting, in the R&D productivity enhancing slide here, it just says, streamlining organizational structure, $65 million. I\u2019m curious like, was that something that you were thinking of doing already? I know outsourcing has been something that you've been pushing for the past couple years, but why had you not done this already? ","It seems like cutting R&D pre-Phase I is very easy to do and doesn't really matter as much to the shareholders probably from that standpoint, but why not do the streamlining of the organizational structure before? Why now? Thanks.","David Pyott","","Well, I\u2019ll take the first part. So getting to the $10 there, there is no exceptional buyback at all. There will be the usual, what you\u2019ve seen in the past with any -- I mean obviously, we have a historical run rate of employee stock option exercises. And as you know, broadly speaking, we offset that, not exactly within a calendar year but pretty close. "," ","If you then do all the math, when you look through the $475 [million] [ph] of cuts, obviously on the other side we have that very strong revenue growth that produces a huge amount of increased EBITDA. We also have a little bit of a tax rate reduction, I alluded earlier on the tax question. These are the margin things that we can do internally without any external transaction.","And obviously, handing over now to Scott on the R&D side, we really went to great lengths to protect programs that are in the clinic, because those are the kinds of products that should lead to an approval in this -- some of them admittedly at the very end of the planning period, but, of course, we\u2019re bright enough to work out that if we produce some huge earnings per share number in 2016, but then we'd really crippled the R&D pipeline. I would take the view that you should penalize us in terms of the P\/E multiple that you described to the company and that view has never changed over the years and certainly not now.","So let me pass the baton to Scott who\u2019ll address the R&D question.","Scott Whitcup","","So, Marc, as you noted, we spent a lot of time looking at the R&D structure. We didn't want to decrease any program in the clinic. In terms of efficiencies, why now and why not several years ago? If you looked at the R&D portfolio five to 10 years ago, we had multiple small projects, which made it difficult to streamline the organization. ","Over the past several years we now have, although a balanced portfolio, a number of larger projects like the anti-VEGF DARPin, abicipar, like glaucoma sustained release or bigger BOTOX indications like depression. So that\u2019s allowed us over the last year to contemplate a much more efficient, streamlined organization. "," ","The other piece was geographic expansion. So over the last, I would say three to four years, we\u2019ve had to build a geographic regulatory and clinical footprint. Geographically, Eastern Europe, Asia Pacific and now we are able to leverage the investment that we made over the past several years. ","So I think it\u2019s the right time for a number of reasons to streamline the organization. But the major reason of why now as opposed to before, bigger projects in the balance and leveraging a geographic footprint that we\u2019ve already built.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Shibani Malhotra with Sterne Agee. You may ask your question.","Shibani Malhotra - Sterne Agee","","Hi, thanks for taking my question. David, Valeant put out a press release today basically accusing Allergan of making some misleading comments around its business model. And then, you talked about the spectacular growth seen with Bausch & Lomb and said that maybe investors should question where this growth came from.","I guess, could you expand on your comments a little bit and also kind of address the accusations that Valeant has made? Do you have any basis to believe that there could be inventory increases or rebates or that business is a house of cards or something? We're just trying to get beyond the back and forth and really understand the two businesses.","David Pyott","","Well, I think at the very high level, at the end of the day it\u2019s up to Valeant to explain what is going on. If I just glance at their sheet, I\u2019ll give you -- this is their numbers. They have 38% growth in contact lenses and 12% growth in consumer. Very interestingly, if you look at Novartis, they\u2019ve put out their numbers for Alcon last week. Alcon's vision care unit grew 1% in local currency. ","So two very, very different sets of numbers. And as you well know, Alcon and J&J, if we take contact lenses, are the big players. So when you see those kinds of disconnects, I think it should just lead to some really detailed questions on your part. And as I stated, we will be very interested to see whether this kind of growth continues into the third quarter. ","And I think another baseline, which we\u2019re always one quarter behind for pharmaceuticals on a worldwide basis, but IMS shows in-market worldwide 5% growth for Bausch & Lomb and that includes legacy Valeant businesses as well. So very different numbers than what we saw from Valeant's pre-announced 17% growth for pharma. We\u2019re still getting the June numbers in terms of dissecting what is value versus volume in the United States. But I am sure that will come out in due course.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Ken Cacciatore with Cowen. You may ask your question.","Ken Cacciatore - Cowen","","Great. Thanks, David, just wanted to know, what would be lost in having even at a lower level of an internal group from your shop go over to their shop and square some of the commentary that you are making and they are making? Is there something that would be lost if you sat down again, maybe not at a high level, but at a low level to assuage some of your concerns? Thank you.","David Pyott","","Well, I think in terms of absolute understanding of Valeant, given that major parts of their business now stem from Bausch & Lomb, obviously there\u2019s still some Medicis business left, although declining precipitously and I\u2019m talking about post-divestiture of the facial injectables business. We understand these businesses very well. We have access to a lot of data. ","IMS is clearly the most reliable. But then we\u2019re also -- we have access to other data through industry surveys and industry experts. So we feel we understand their model very, very well. And at a very high level, when their offer is so far away from the intrinsic value of this company, which by the way, has just been increased again based on the numbers we put on the table, there was no basis for a substantive discussion. If Valeant wants to change that number, that\u2019s up to them.","Operator","","We have a question from David Steinberg with Jefferies. Your line is open.","David Steinberg - Jefferies","","Thanks. In facial aesthetics, clearly it was a very, very strong quarter. I know that VOLUMA is off to a great start. You have also mentioned that you took very substantial share from the Valeant products, RESTYLANE, PERLANE, et cetera as well as from Dysport vis-a-vis BOTOX. I was just curious now that Galderma has purchased those assets from Valeant, do you think you can keep that share that you captured or should we expect that Galderma will retake much of what you took this past quarter?","David Pyott","","Well, I think the best way to answer that question is if you reflect upon the remarks I made about the European market, where we have access to syndicated data there and the market is growing in excess of 20% and Allergan is growing double the rate.","Now, given that the other key player is Galderma and then on top of that, there is lots and lots of small competitors, it\u2019s very clear we\u2019re massively picking up share in Europe as well where our key competitor has been for years now post their acquisition of Q-Med, Galderma. So we believe Galderma will be a more normal competitor than Valeant in terms of running a business for the long term. But I think the results speak for themselves, if we look at our ability to compete successfully and gain market share outside North America.","Operator","","We have a question from Seamus Fernandez with Leerink. You may ask your question.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink","","Great, thanks so much. So David, can you talk a little bit about the targets that you have for SG&A? I think R&D of 13% certainly makes sense in the context of the cuts that you're talking about. But on slide 20, you state that you are targeting SG&A ratios of the low-to-mid 20% range. ","And when I think about the businesses that you run, as well as sort of the global growth nature of the business, getting to the low-to-mid 20% range as I look across the industry, it tends to be limited to companies that are at extremely high price ratios. Cancer care businesses like Celgene, things like that. ","And the business at Allergan just seems structurally different in that regard. So just wanted to get a better understanding of how we\u2019re getting to that low-to-mid 20% range and if that is truly sustainable over the long term? Thanks so much. ","","David Pyott","","Obviously, one of the things we looked at too was where do we fit within the larger group of pharmaceutical companies. And we agree with you that if you look at companies with very limited numbers of physicians that they have to service or highly concentrated product sales, it makes it easier. ","But when I look at, what I\u2019d call, diversified companies, there are several that are in the mid-20s. And when we also look at their projections of what they plan to do in the next five years clearly they are going to leverage as well. ","So I think the very big backdrop to this is the pressure on our industry worldwide, and I mean pharmaceuticals in the broadest sense to become much more efficient. And I think the days of share of voice wars and battles I don't want to say it\u2019s over, because point-to-point when new products are being launched, if there's two products going toe-to-toe, people will invest a lot. ","But I think broadly we\u2019ll see lower spend across the industry and when I look through the peer set, I think we will be a very good company by the end of this plan period. Also for us, of course we invested a lot over the years to create critical mass. Our dollars are getting pretty big now and that\u2019s very different than when I started when let's say we were probably spending less than $0.5 billion in SG&A. Now the numbers are really, really large.","And we all know economies of scale, ability to negotiate better terms with vendors, you can go down and down the list. And our team is very, very committed to delivering these numbers. And because of the teams involved, a lot of the ideas, frankly, came up from middle management. And that is the most powerful guarantor for me versus some fiat from the guys at the very top with the middle management going, they must be crazy, no, no, these ideas came from them and were looked at diligently by Doug Ingram and his team. And they are very confident that we are going to deliver this.","Operator","","We have a question from David Buck with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","David Buck - Buckingham Research","","Yes, thanks for taking the question. A couple of quick ones, first, David, if I look at the sort of second phase of the value enhancement plan with potential for strategic M&A or return of capital, can you talk about -- you talked about it a little bit, but talk about just whether we should be looking at a series of transactions, whether you\u2019re looking for one larger strategic transaction? ","And can you give a sense of how you are looking at the potential need to withstand a shareholder vote if you use equity of more than 20% or if it\u2019s a tax inversion and how you look at return hurdles and what type of level accretion you\u2019d be looking at? So, in other words, is this one deal that you may be looking for or should we be expecting you in the next six to 12 months to be acting on a series of transactions? Thanks.","David Pyott","","Right. Well, let me take probably the simplest one. From an executability perspective, obviously doing one largest transaction is the easiest. Of course, I could also point out, if one did something somewhat smaller, you could always accompany it with a stock buyback or some form of capital return because when it comes to capital return, I take the view that that is very -- relatively quick and fairly mechanical exercise and hence something one would do fairly late in the whole management of the Valeant proposal. ","In terms of your comment about different options which would either lead to less than 20% of stock being issued, in theory it could be an all-cash deal because you all know that we have an enormous amount of balance sheet capacity which, of course, actually is the real origin of the Valeant proposal in the first place because really their intent is to buy us with our own balance sheet. ","Now, if we go the other way and say that it did require greater than 20% of shares outstanding, clearly it would require a shareholder vote. In such an instance it would have to be a very compelling transaction that I would be confident, along with the Board of Directors, that we would get a majority of investors voting for that proposal versus whatever might be on the table from Valeant at that point in time. So I think we just look through all these options very pragmatically and think about how do we create the greatest value for Allergan stockholders.","Operator","","We have a question from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs","","Thank you. David, just a high-level question, if I look at since earlier in this year when you started to announce plans to raise the long-term earnings projections, and again today, it just seems that the bulk of those -- the bulk of the driver is cost cuts, not top line. While the top line was very strong this quarter, you are not really changing the overall top line growth and in fact, as part of the new cost-cutting effort you acknowledge a 50 basis point decrement to long-term revenue growth. "," ","When you talk about acquisitions, is it your priority to acquire assets that would provide pipeline visibility, technology that would give better top line visibility to your double-digit prospects? Or is just earnings accretion the highest priority? ","I\u2019ve heard you kind of comment on both, and I\u2019m wondering if you could just - what\u2019s more important to you? Is it buying a pipeline or is it buying a company that would add more value near term to earnings? ","And then, just the other follow-up question is what is the timing of capital allocation, acquisitions, et cetera because Valeant and Pershing Square are trying to convene a special meeting and I would think that that would really give you sort of a limited runway to complete all your strategies? Thanks.","David Pyott","","Okay. First of all, the greatest creation of shareholder value is through very robust top line revenue growth. And I think you would all agree that double digit for a five-year period is substantial. If you then look at the reduction in revenue, I think you would all say it would be incredible if we take $475 million out of the business, of which some close to - it\u2019s over $350 million is from the commercial side i.e., short term, if we were to say this has absolutely no impact on revenue whatsoever. ","We\u2019ve reduced it, as I commented, by about 50 basis points. But that still gives us, as based on our plan, every year double-digit revenue growth. If I then think about your question on potential acquisition targets, I think the most important characteristic is that such a company could not substantially decrease our revenue growth, because this company is a growth company.","So, to kind of exaggerate, we would not buy a company that is growing 1% even if it had massive bottom line accretion in the very short term. I don't think that would have any real strategic fit. I think it would be very difficult to explain to our investor base. ","And, of course, going back to the timing question, what you on the outside can't know is when did some of these projects start, and obviously I can't comment on that. So I\u2019ll just give you the conclusion that I think that whatever we need to do can be done before a special meeting is held. And so our job is to not only deliver the plans as on the table, but then also to deploy our extremely strong balance sheet in a value-creating manner for Allergan stockholders.","Operator","","Our final question comes from Andrew Finkelstein with Susquehanna. Your line is open.","Andrew Finkelstein - Susquehanna","","Thanks very much for taking the question. If I could just slip in, ask for a final comment on your perspective on M&A. If you could comment about, particularly with the model you will have post the restructuring, what is most leverageable that you\u2019d be bringing to add value in a combination? ","And then, if I can slip in an additional question, just with RESTASIS, can you confirm if there have been any other purported notices from generics or when was the last time you were able to confirm with FDA that no one had been accepted for a filing? Thanks.","David Pyott","","I think at the very high level, I\u2019ve given you a lot of characteristics on potential acquisition targets. I think probably the greatest value we could bring is our knowledge of how to run a specialized business. And as I remarked earlier, whatever move we would make in a new therapeutic area or areas, we would see as a platform for further development, both on the internal side as well as through licensing.","And I think you\u2019ve heard me say many times over that, if you look at our pillars in recent years, it is clear that people with technology in areas such as ophthalmic pharmaceuticals, medical aesthetics, medical dermatology, neurology, urology come to us. I would take the view whatever would be added to the portfolio, the same would occur. And on RESTASIS, no new news, everything is as we saw and commented three months ago.","Jim Hindman","","We would like to thank you for your participation today.

My name is Hope, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Allergan second quarter earnings call. Thank you. Ms. Daphne Karydas, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Strategy, you may begin your conference.","Daphne Karydas - Allergan Plc","Thank you, Hope, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to the Allergan second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release reporting Allergan earnings from continuing operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2017. We had a slight delay posting the release due to adjustments from Teva's announced dividend cut, and now I know what it's like to be nimble at Allergan. The press release and our slide deck which we are presenting this morning are available on our corporate website at www.allergan.com. We are conducting a live webcast of this call, a replay of which will be available on our website after its conclusion. Please note that today's call is copyrighted material of Allergan and cannot be rebroadcast without the company's express written consent.","Turning to slide 2, I'd also like to remind you that during the course of this call, management will make projections or other forward-looking remarks regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. It's important to note that such statements and events are forward-looking statements and reflect our current perspective of the business trends and information as of today's date. Actual results may differ materially from current expectations and projections depending on a number of factors affecting the Allergan business. These factors are detailed in our periodic public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Allergan disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as expressly required by law.","All figures discussed during the call refer to non-GAAP. Our GAAP financial metrics and reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP metrics can be found in our earnings release issued this morning and posted on our website.","Turning to slide 3 and our agenda this morning. With us on today's call are Brent Saunders, our Chairman and CEO, who will provide highlights from our second quarter results; Bill Meury, our Chief Commercial Officer, who will provide an overview of our commercial performance in the quarter; David Nicholson, our Chief R&D Officer, who will provide an update on our pipeline; and Tessa Hilado, our Chief Financial Officer, who will then discuss the Allergan second quarter financial results and our guidance in more detail. Also on the call and available during the Q&A are Rob Stewart, our Chief Operating Officer, and Bob Bailey, our Chief Legal Officer.","With that, I will turn the call over to Brent.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Thank you, Daphne, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our second quarter earnings call.","Turning to slide 5. 2017 is a pivotal year for us at Allergan. Pivotal because of the many commercial, integration, operational and R&D milestones that we must execute flawlessly to maintain our strong momentum and build a dynamic future for Allergan. And, at the midpoint of 2017, it is clear that we are delivering on our pivotal year with a focus on operational excellence and execution. With our strong first-half performance and solid outlook for the remainder of the year, we are raising our full-year guidance for both sales and non-GAAP performance net income per share. We are delivering strong revenue growth, despite the impact from generic entries on a couple of our products, with eight of our top products posting double-digit growth this quarter.","We continue to demonstrate our best-in-class integration capabilities, with exceptional execution on the integrations of both LifeCell and ZELTIQ. We are optimizing our operations and managing expenses across all of our functions, and our R&D team is making significant process on every front, especially in advancing our 6 Star R&D programs. With the initiation of Phase 3 studies for CVC for NASH, five out of our 6 Star programs are now in Phase 3.","This progress comes while we continue to sharpen our focus behind programs that have the highest potential to address unmet patient needs. Our team led a transformation that has created an Allergan with a balanced portfolio of products with strong, durable growth, a large and fast-growing cash pay business, an open science pipeline focused on innovation in our key therapeutic areas, a faster growing international business, a strong balance sheet, and a dividend to return cash directly to our shareholders. Our strategy to build and strengthen our long-term growth drivers is on track.","Turning to our results for this quarter on slide 6. Revenue growth this quarter was strong, up 9%, with continued great performance from many of our top products. And Regenerative Medicine products and CoolSculpting have gained momentum under our ownership. That speaks to the synergistic benefits of operating them as part of Allergan and our top-notch integration capabilities. Performance net income per share was up 20%, driven by higher revenues, strong gross margins, a lower share count, partially offset by lower operating margins, and an anticipated higher tax rate. Gross margin was above 87%, primarily due to our reimbursement in the quarter for costs previously expensed in cost of sales, as well as buyout of certain royalty streams from partners. Strong revenue growth and tight management of operational spend drove solid operating margins despite a negative transactional FX impact to G&A, which Tessa will discuss in her remarks.","We continue to drive the pipeline forward, with eight pharma and device approvals so far this year and have made good progress on enrollment in our 6 Star clinical Phase 3 programs. And we demonstrated our commitment to a balanced approach to capital deployment with an additional $1.5 billion reduction in our debt this quarter, including $1.2 billion ahead of its fourth quarter maturity.","In closing, we had a very strong quarter due to our team's focus on execution. We are well-positioned for the remainder of the year and setting the stage for 2018 and beyond. Now let me turn the call over to Bill.","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Thanks, Brent, and good morning, everyone.","Turning to slide 8, our performance this quarter reflects strong execution. In Medical Aesthetics, we're making significant investments to maximize our leadership position, sustain our long-term growth, and expand the market. The long-term prospects for this business are excellent. In Eye Care, we're maintaining our leadership position despite competitive headwinds. In CNS we're building a flagship product with VRAYLAR while maximizing value with NAMZARIC. In GI, we're building IBS leadership with LINZESS and VIBERZI. And our international business is growing steadily, anchored by Medical Aesthetics and Eye Care. These are our priorities in a snapshot.","Turning to slide 9. We drove strong growth across multiple areas of our business. Revenue was up 9% over last quarter, including the addition of LifeCell and CoolSculpting. Sales for eight out of our top product lines increased at double-digit rates in the second quarter, and growth across the product portfolio is being driven primarily by volume. The Medical Aesthetics growth was led by BOTOX Cosmetic, up 13%, and our JUV\u00c9DERM collection of fillers, up 18% excluding FX. In Eye Care, RESTASIS continues to show durability with stable demand, offset by year-over-year trade buying patterns this quarter, which did not impact RESTASIS in the first quarter. We expect buying patterns to moderate for the remainder of the year, and for RESTASIS to be at expectations for the full year. And collectively our new products including VRAYLAR, NAMZARIC, KYBELLA, VIBERZI, XEN, and RHOFADE contributed $108 million to net revenue growth compared to last year.","Growth was partially offset in the quarter by continued sales erosion from NAMENDA XR, loss of exclusivity from ASACOL HD and MINASTRIN, and lower ACZONE sales that were negatively impacted by formulary coverage gaps and increased generic pressure in the category.","Turning to slide 10, Medical Aesthetics is our largest and fastest growing business, as you know, and it's built on three pillars: Facial Aesthetics, Plastics and Regenerative Medicine, and Body Contouring. We're seeing strong momentum across our broad and deep portfolio.","The Regenerative Medicine products and CoolSculpting are strong, and are at or above expectations. In Facial Aesthetics we had strong performance from our lead products. As I mentioned, BOTOX Cosmetic up 13% and our JUV\u00c9DERM collection of fillers, where we have launched several new products, including VOLBELLA, VOLLURE, and VOLITE, was up 18%, and surpassed a 50% U.S. market share, marking an all-time high. In Plastics and Regenerative Medicine, sales for ALLODERM, our market-leading acellular dermal matrix for tissue support and breast reconstruction, were very strong. And the launch of INSPIRA implants continues to exceed expectations.","And in Body Contouring we're off to a strong start. Sales for the quarter were up 40% pro forma excluding FX. Three takeaways here: First, the business is starting to accelerate following an increase in sales force effort and advertising. Second, system placements are at an all-time high. And consumable demand is very strong. It's early, but the growth prospects for this business and the market are excellent.","With KYBELLA we have a large group of trialists, but a smaller group of adopters. We're focused on education, training, and complementary co-positioning of KYBELLA and CoolMini. The fat reduction market is still in the early innings, and it's a market we're committed to for the long term. Remember, it took the facial injectable market five to seven years to develop. We're leveraging our existing commercial infrastructure to support KYBELLA. Success in Body Contouring business will take time and result from market development and potentially new future indications for other parts of the body, including jowls, where we're focused right now, as well as arms and knees.","Turning to slide 11, we continue to see Medical Aesthetics as one of the fastest growth areas of our business and one of the best markets in all of healthcare. Attitudes towards aesthetics are changing, and new demographics, including millennials and males, are expanding rapidly. There are approximately 30 million people in the United States alone who are considering an aesthetic procedure in the next one to two years. We've captured just a fraction of this potential market, as you can see on the slide: approximately 5% in Facial Aesthetics, 10% in Plastics and Regenerative Medicine, and 5% in Body Contouring. The main point here is that the long-term growth prospects for the market and our business are excellent, and this has and will continue to be a focus for Allergan.","Turning to Eye Care on slide 12. In dry eye, RESTASIS continues to demonstrate durability, with stable demand and market share. Unit market share for RESTASIS is solid at approximately 80%, and the outlook for the second half is in line with expectations. RESTASIS MultiDose, which was launched several months ago, is at approximately 10% of the total line and should exit the year around 15% or higher. We expect we can continue to grow share throughout 2018. In retina, OZURDEX has been a leading growth driver across our global portfolio, up 15% ex FX in the second quarter. The growth was balanced between U.S. and international markets, with new patients coming primarily from anti-VEGF failures. And in glaucoma, we're maintaining a strong position with this highly profitable product portfolio while continuing to deliver new treatments to the market. The XEN Gel Stent is getting very positive reviews in the initial launch period.","Turning to our launch products in CNS on slide 13. Demand for VRAYLAR remains strong and above expectations. It continues to be the fastest growing atypical antipsychotic on the market, and we see a long runway for VRAYLAR. We expect future growth will be driven by expanding coverage and access. Long term, we're looking to market expansion, with potential new indications such as negative symptoms, bipolar depression, and schizophrenia maintenance. With NAMZARIC the launch trajectory remains solid, and we're on track to exit the year at approximately 25% to 30% of the NAMENDA franchise. We have formulary coverage through 2018, and we'll continue to drive utilization of NAMZARIC during that period.","Turning to GI on slide 14. We continue our strong presence in IBS, of course, with LINZESS and VIBERZI. LINZESS is back on its growth trajectory, up 12% in the quarter, with strong prescription demand of approximately 19%, offset primarily by year-over-year trade buying patterns. Growth catalysts for this business are the 72-microgram launch, promotional leadership, and widespread formulary coverage. With VIBERZI, prescription levels have stabilized since the FDA label update, which is a good sign. Utilization in primary care is relatively strong, but we have work to do in gastroenterology. Our promotional levels and formulary coverage are where we need them to be. We expect demand for VIBERZI to pick up in the second half of the year.","Turning to slide 15. We saw another strong quarter from our international business, with sales up 16% excluding FX. In our international markets, we had operational growth in all regions, with Asia-Pacific and Middle East\/Africa up 20%, Latin America\/Canada up 16%, and Europe 10%. China continues to be one of the fastest-growing markets, up 61%, with others like Sweden, Spain, Brazil, and Canada also showing strong growth. We continue to have a very positive outlook for our international business. Medical Aesthetics, BOTOX Therapeutic, and Eye Care anchor our business internationally.","We'll continue to focus on execution. We're halfway through the year, and our balanced portfolio of high-quality products positions us very well, both in the United States and internationally. With that, I'll turn the call over to David.","C. David Nicholson, Ph.D. - Allergan Plc","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone.","In the first half of the year, we continue to make important progress in delivering Allergan's pipeline to patients. This includes our 6 Star programs. As Brent mentioned, so far this year, we have received eight major pharma and device approvals, including RHOFADE for rosacea, LINZESS 72 micrograms for IBS-C and CIC, and TrueTear for tear production. These approvals mark a strong start in advancing our pipeline in the first half of 2017.","Turning to slide 17, and looking at our 6 Star programs, development of these first or best-in-class compounds remains on track.","In CNS we continue to progress our CGRP programs. Recruitment is going well in our Phase 3 studies for ubrogepant in acute migraine. Top line results from the acute treatment studies are expected in the first half of 2018. Following discussions with the FDA, we are finalizing our Phase 3 program, which includes the addition of a two-month safety study. All necessary studies were started by the end of 2017, and we continue to expect launch in 2020.","Our Phase 2b study with atogepant for migraine prophylaxis in the U.S. is on track. We expect top line results from this program in the first half of 2018. If successful, these will be the first oral CGRPs approved and available for the treatment of migraine. In our atogepant migraine prophylactic program, approximately 600 patients have been randomized. There has been a low incidence of transaminase elevations, non-symptomatic, and no elevations greater than tenfold. The liver safety board has reviewed unblinded data from this program twice and has advised continuation. Compared to published data from Merck's telcagepant studies, which revealed the liver enzyme elevations associated with this compound, our atogepant studies have randomized a comparable or indeed greater number of patients without identifying safety concerns.","In our ubrogepant Phase 3 program, approximately 2,000 patients have been randomized to date. Results have shown a low incidence of transaminase elevations, none were symptomatic, and no elevations were greater than tenfold. The liver safety board has reviewed these unblinded data and has advised continuation. To summarize, recruitment is progressing well for both our oral CGRP antagonists, and there has been no safety signals identified in either program.","Turning to rapastinel, our Phase 3 program is on track, and we continue to expect to have top line results from the short-term studies in 2019. As a reminder, rapastinel could be game-changing in the treatment of MDD, with a rapid onset of action and activity in patients who are insufficiently treated with other therapeutic options. As we all know, MDD is a condition where patients desperately need innovation.","In Women's Health, following the quality Phase 3 results for ESMYA, which we announced in the first quarter of 2016, we continue with our plans to achieve approval for the treatment of abnormal uterine fibroid bleeding in 2018.","In Eye Care, we expect to announce top line results for our abicipar AMD Phase 3 studies in the second half of 2018.","In GI, we have initiated our Phase 3 program for cenicriviroc, or CVC. Our first-in-class, once-daily oral immunomodulator for NASH. We plan to announce the top line two-year data from the Phase 2 CENTAUR study in the second half of this year.","We also continue with our preparations to initiate our Phase 3 program for relamorelin, our ghrelin agonist for diabetic gastroparesis.","As we advance these key programs, as well as others, we're also continuing to regularly review and prioritize our pipeline and resources. As I have outlined, we have made significant progress in delivering and advancing our pipeline in the first half of this year. We are well on our way to achieving our goals for the year. Our continued work to identify the best science, matched with our solid results in advancing innovation, continues to validate our open science approach. I thank our Allergan global R&D team for their continued commitment to advancing our programs and for their work for the patients we serve.","And now I will turn the call over to Tessa.","Maria Teresa Hilado - Allergan Plc","Thank you, David. And good morning, everyone. First I'd like to apologize up-front for my voice, since I'm recovering from a bad cold. In the event my voice starts to fail, I'll request Daphne to take over my prepared remarks.","Turning to our overall results for the second quarter of 2017 on slide 19. In Q2 we delivered another solid quarter of year-over-year performance. Non-GAAP continuing operations net revenues were $4.01 billion, a 9% increase versus prior year, primarily driven by the addition of LifeCell and ZELTIQ, as well as the continued strong growth in key brands and product launches.","The growth was partially offset by ASACOL HD and MINASTRIN LOEs, continued erosion in NAMENDA XR, and the declines in RESTASIS and ACZONE. Non-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter was strong at 87.3%, partly due to the positive impact from royalty buyouts and the reimbursement of $15 million for cost previously expensed through cost of sales. These items offset lower gross margins from LifeCell and ZELTIQ. Despite the better-than-expected gross margins in the quarter, we continue to anticipate a negative impact to gross margins in the second half of the year due to product mix, including the Regenerative Medicine products and CoolSculpting.","Non-GAAP operating margin was 47.1% in the second quarter of 2017, a sequential improvement from the first quarter but a decline of 330 basis points versus prior-year period, primarily as a result of one, higher R&D expenses to continue to support advancement of the pipeline; two, increased sales and marketing investments to continue to support new launches and the addition of LifeCell and ZELTIQ, partially offset by disciplined cost management in our General Medicines segment; and, three, higher G&A spend, which despite tight management was negatively impacted by an unfavorable transactional FX headwind in the quarter. Excluding this impact, G&A expenses increased approximately 2% versus prior year.","Non-GAAP net interest expense in the quarter was significantly lower versus last year, as our debt balance has been substantially reduced due to the net paydown of approximately $9.4 billion since the second quarter of 2016, lowering our interest expense, in addition to the positive impact from the Teva dividend of $34 million this quarter. Performance net income per share of $4.02 reflects growth of 20% versus prior year, driven by revenue growth, lower interest expense, and share count reduction, partially offset by a higher tax rate and lower operating margins. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 13.1% in the quarter, in line with expectations.","Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was strong at approximately $1.6 billion. As you will see in our quarterly filings, we're also taking non-acquisition related severance and restructuring charges of approximately $66 million for anticipated cost management initiatives. We are taking action to manage the cost base of the business, to maintain our margin profile going forward given anticipated LOE headwinds for NAMENDA XR and ESTRACE in 2018. This will enable continued investment behind our long-term growth drivers, including product launches and our pipeline. We do not anticipate a material impact from these cost-saving activities for the remainder of the year. Our GAAP financial metrics and reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP metrics can be found in our earnings release issued this morning and posted on our website.","Turning now to our Q2 performance by segment results on slide 20. U.S. Specialized Therapeutics revenue were $1.72 billion for the quarter, continuing strong double-digit growth of 15.2% versus the prior-year period. In our U.S. General Medicines business, second quarter revenues were $1.43 billion, a decline of 1.5% versus prior-year period. International's second quarter revenues were $859 million versus $757 million in the prior-year period. Excluding the approximate 3% negative impact of foreign exchange, international revenues in the second quarter grew 16.2% versus prior year.","Looking at segment contribution margin, U.S. Specialized Therapeutics is the highest margin segment, mainly attributed to strong gross margins. The decline of 370 basis points versus last year was primarily due to the addition of LifeCell and ZELTIQ, and to a lesser degree an increase in promotional spending on key brands, and the new product launches of RHOFADE and XEN Gel Stent. U.S. General Medicine contribution margin improved 350 basis points this quarter versus prior year, due primarily to royalty buyouts and lower promotional and selling expenses. International contribution continued to improve from 53.4%, to 54.3% as revenues continued to grow double digit, coupled with a favorable product mix benefit.","Turning to slide 21. We ended the quarter in a strong capital position, with total debt of approximately $30.2 billion and gross-debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio of 4.4 times, and 3.2 times on a net basis. We continued to execute on our commitment to reduce our leverage with an additional $1.5 billion reduction in debt this quarter, which includes $1.2 billion ahead of its fourth quarter maturity. Year to date, we have paid down approximately $2.6 billion in debt, and we expect to continue to repay our contractual maturities, which will further reduce debt by an additional $3.8 billion in 2018. In the second quarter, our cash and marketable securities were impacted primarily by the acquisition of ZELTIQ and continue to include Teva shares of approximately $3.3 billion. Given the Teva lockup has just expired, we have requested Teva to register the shares consistent with our intent to sell the shares in a prudent and responsible manner.","Turning to slide 22. With strong execution in the first two quarters, and confidence in our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are raising our 2017 full-year guidance. Starting with net revenues, we are raising our full-year outlook and now expect 2017 net revenues to be between $15.85 billion to $16.05 billion, a $50 million increase at the bottom and top of our prior guidance net revenue range. This increase reflects our updated expectations for NAMENDA XR generic entry in the first quarter of 2018 versus our prior assumption of early fourth quarter 2017 generic entry.","In addition, given movements in foreign exchange rates, we now anticipate a negligible impact to revenues from FX versus our prior assumption of an approximate $100 million headwind for the full year. This is partially offset by sales levels on other products. Other revenue assumptions remain unchanged, including stable revenues of RESTASIS and no generic competition for ESTRACE for the remainder of the year. We also continue to expect revenues to be the highest in the fourth quarter, mainly driven by seasonality and formulary coverage dynamics across our product portfolio, while third quarter revenues are expected to be at similar levels to the second quarter.","Given the higher-than-expected gross margin in the first half of the year, we now expect our full-year gross margins to be between 86.5% and 87%, versus prior guidance of 86% to 87%. We do, however, expect that gross margins for the second half of the year will be lower than in the first half of the year. We continue to be committed to managing operating expenses as we continue to invest behind the progression of the pipeline and new product launches. Our updated non-GAAP SG&A guidance range of $4.5 billion to $4.6 billion reflects our focus on managing costs, offset by the unfavorable transactional foreign exchange impact to G&A.","With respect to sales and marketing spend for the remainder of the year, we anticipate promotional activities to be higher in the third quarter versus the fourth quarter, given the timing of new launches and expected promotional programs to support key brands. Non-GAAP R&D spend of approximately $1.6 billion remains unchanged, but given the timing of clinical trial activity, we now anticipate R&D spend to be higher in the third quarter compared to the fourth quarter. Our tax rate for the full year remains unchanged at approximately 13%.","We're also updating our non-GAAP net interest expense\/other guidance, which now we expect to be approximately $1 billion versus the prior guidance of approximately $1.075 billion, as we now anticipate dividend income from Teva shares in the third quarter, in addition to lower net interest expense from the earlier debt reduction and the euro bond offering. This update reflects Teva's 75% cut in their dividend that they announced this morning. Average 2017 share count forecast remains unchanged at approximately 356 million shares and assumes a Q3 settlement for the ASR. As a result, we now fully expect full-year 2017 non-GAAP performance net income per share to be in the range of $16.05 to $16.45 versus our prior guidance of $15.85 to $16.35, reflecting strong double-digit growth in the range of 19% to 22%.","In summary, we are on track for a very strong 2017, and we are very pleased with our first-half 2017 results. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brent for some closing remarks.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Thank you, Tessa. In closing, Allergan is executing this pivotal year very well. And we have assembled the right team to continue to execute on our strategy. By driving sales, advancing the pipeline, and managing costs, we are in a strong position to deliver an even stronger 2017 than previously forecast, while setting the stage for 2018 and beyond. I'm very proud of our entire team and what they have accomplished.","With that, we're ready to begin the Q&A. Hope, can we open the line for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Your first question comes from the line of Liav Abraham with Citi.","Liav Abraham - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Congrats on the quarter. A couple of questions. Firstly, regarding your revenue guidance for the year. I guess given the better-than-expected revenues for the quarter, I would've expected a greater increase in the revenue guidance. Can you perhaps discuss the pushes and pulls on revenues in the second half of the year?","Secondly, on SG&A and R&D cost management, which you mentioned in your press release, are there any numbers that you can put around this? To what extent will this restructuring, I guess, flow to the bottom line versus be reinvested in the business?","And then, lastly, just on your Aesthetics growth, you continue to show very strong growth of this part of your business. To what extent is this sustainable going forward? Is the growth coming from recurring patients or from increased penetration? I'd be interested in your thoughts on the strategic outlook for this division over the medium term. Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah, so let me see if we get all these. And, Liav, please \u2013 I was scribbling notes quickly. If we missed it or don't get it, please correct us. So with respect to revenue guidance, there were lots of puts and takes throughout the year. I think the net-net is an improvement in revenue, which is the important bottom line, but I don't know if Tessa or Bill want to add some color to it. Bill?","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Yeah. I would just say that we actively promote over 20 products, and the large majority of them at this point for the quarter are at or above expectations. But there are three, to be fair, that need some work right now, and that's VIBERZI, KYBELLA, and ACZONE. And so those generally offsetted some of the favorability from FX and XR, and that's how I'd think about it.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","So the second question you asked was related to the SG&A cost management. I think to be fair this is a strategic move that we're making to prepare Allergan for the future to make sure that we have the right capabilities, the right ability to invest in new product launches, to invest in R&D and the like, as we go into 2018. I would expect that given the timing of when we plan to do this, very minimal impact in 2017. And that we will quantify the impact in 2018 as we are in the process of ordinary course of doing our budgets now and preparing and looking at investment opportunities in 2018. And we'll give you an update on that later in terms of what flows through in 21018.","The last question you asked was related to aesthetics. Clearly, medical aesthetics strategically are a high priority for us. It is \u2013 and I've said this to you before, Liav \u2013 it is without a question in my mind, and obviously I have a biased opinion, the best pharmaceutical business in the world. It's high-quality, it's cash-pay, it's global, and we have a very strong market leadership position everywhere in the world. We've invested significantly in that business over the last few years with new technologies, with R&D, with strengthening our sales forces in not just the United States but around the world. And so we have a high conviction that that growth is sustainable for a very long period. We are just at the initial stages of market development in the U.S. and almost every market in the world. So we have very high conviction around the sustainability. I don't know if Bill would want to add that \u2013 ?","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Yeah. I think that's right. If penetration rates in the category were 30% or 40% or 50%, you might think that growth rates over time would moderate, but they're not, and we showed that on the slide. You're between let's call it 5% and 10%. The two biggest trends that we think are driving business is, one, there's a millennial movement or a youth movement underway, and there's an emerging male movement, which will take time. Given our leadership position, we're at 70% to 90% of that market, depending which product lines you look at. We're focused on one thing: building the market and expanding it. If we do that, we're going to be very successful.","And to answer your questions, Liav, most of the business we're talking about is balanced between customers that are satisfied with their aesthetic procedure, and then there's a large pool of new patients that are trying aesthetic procedures for the very first time, which is pretty characteristic of a market that's in growth mode.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah, maybe one last point I would say is the way I think about it in very round numbers. Take a market that many would consider more developed, the United States. Even though the penetration rate is very low, we see roughly 3 million consumers participating in the aesthetic market; we see 30 million considering. So even if we just improved the roughly 10% penetration in the considering population \u2013 and yet we still have an opportunity to turn the 30 million considering into 60 million considering. So we haven't even scratched the surface in terms of a market like the United States. You go to China and other places, or Brazil, the opportunity's even greater.","Liav Abraham - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great, thanks.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Hope, can we \u2013 ?","Liav Abraham - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah. Thanks, Liav. Hope, next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks very much, and congrats on the results. I have a couple questions. I guess first, with respect to the cash flow, Tessa, I was hoping that you could talk a little bit about the unusually strong cash flow in the quarter. Obviously that follows unusually weak cash flow in the first quarter. And when you comment \u2013 if you could provide some color on how we should think about the outlook for operating cash flow. With the $1.6 billion figure in the second quarter, the first half amounted to $2.4 billion. And I'm just wondering, as you look out to the second half of 2017, whether we should think about the second half operating cash flow being similar to that $2.4 billion in the first half or maybe higher or lower.","And then separately I wanted to ask a little bit about the CDC two-year data and when we should expect the detailed results.","And finally, with respect to rapastinel, that's obviously a compelling product in development for depression, but it's an IV. Just wondering whether you have confidence that you can convert it to an injectable product and where that development stands. Thanks so much.","Maria Teresa Hilado - Allergan Plc","Great. So let me address the first question, David. Happy to answer that. So obviously very happy with the strong cash flow generation in the second quarter in our results. It's what we expected. The incremental sort of like cash flow that I think you're referring to that was above expectations really was largely driven by a roughly $535 million refund coming out of the estimated taxes that we paid related to the gain on sale of Teva. And so that's really what drove, largely, the incremental cash flow that you're referring to.","With regards to cash flow for the back half of the year, first recall that fourth quarter seasonally is the highest quarter for us out of the four quarters, and I indicated that in my prepared remarks as well. From an expectation point of view, we expect back-half cash flow to improve relative to the first half, as you pointed out. And it would be about $3 billion to $4 billion in operating cash flow absent any M&A, excluding milestones and restructuring charges. So $3 billion to $4 billion for the two quarters in the back half.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","And so, David, do you want to touch on the rapastinel question for David?","C. David Nicholson, Ph.D. - Allergan Plc","Yeah, could I do the CVC first (41:02) \u2013 ?","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","All right. Yeah. Whichever one. Yeah.","C. David Nicholson, Ph.D. - Allergan Plc","Yeah. Okay. Sorry, Brent. Yeah.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","No problem.","C. David Nicholson, Ph.D. - Allergan Plc","Okay. Yeah, CVC data and the two-year results, obviously nobody's looking forward to seeing those data more than I am. What we have to do is to lock the database and then we can do that. Once we've cleaned the data, then we have to analyze it and understand it.","The year two data is somewhat more complex than the first year because what we did during the second year was to cross over some of the placebo patients to CVC. So we gain new year one data with that, which we can analyze in comparison to the previous year one data. We also have CVC patients who continue for two years, and we have some placebo patients who crossed over. So all in all, it's a rather complex analysis that we have to do, and we have to make certain that all the data is scrubbed. And as I mentioned in my introductory remarks, we do expect to get all of those data in the second half of this year. And we will be announcing the top line results as soon as possible.","Shall I go on and talk about rapastinel?","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah. Good idea. (42:24)","C. David Nicholson, Ph.D. - Allergan Plc","Okay, thanks. Yeah. And I think Bill wants to make some remarks on rapastinel as well. I'll restrict my comments to the oral rapastinel. We do have a second compound in development which mimics very closely the pharmacology of rapastinel. This is an agent that has high oral bioavailability both in animals and in man, and we will be moving that compound through into Phase 2 in an expeditious manner. Bill.","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","And as it relates to the formulation, David, the IV, while an oral often can be preferred, if we can replicate in the Phase 3 trials what we saw in the Phase 2 trials, my sense right now is the healthcare system is completely equipped, whether it be through infusion centers or home care centers, to deal with an IV treatment for depression. I think that statement probably may not apply if it was 20 years ago. But regular IV treatments \u2013 and this only takes about a minute to do on a weekly basis for people who have, in this case, failed multiple antidepressants and perhaps are suffering from suicidal thoughts and behaviors \u2013 it doesn't seem like it's going to be a big obstacle to me. And so the potential for rapastinel, I don't really think, trades on whether we have an oral formulation or not.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","And I would just add a quick follow-up. One, as Bill said, this is a quick infusion, under a minute. Second, I would tell you that there was, I think, several years ago great skepticism that we could train neurologists to do injections, and they do. In my meetings with community psychiatrists, they're very excited. They don't view the injection as an obstacle. In fact, they're used to doing more invasive things like electric shock and other things like that in their offices. They like this treatment. There are other places that could be developed \u2013 or delivered in infusion centers that are all over the place.","So I think commercially, that really is just a minor consideration and one that I think we understand how to do. And we know how to train people that don't know how to do invasive procedures to do invasive procedures, whether it be in aesthetics or neurology or the like. So we have just a lot of experience there, David.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thank you...","C. David Nicholson, Ph.D. - Allergan Plc","And in that connection, I would just quickly say we are, of course, running three Phase 3 studies. We've got 600 patients already recruited in those three Phase 3 studies. Recruitment's going really well, and I think that points to the demand for an agent like this.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Great. Hope, next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marc Goodman with UBS.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Morning. David, can you talk about CGRP? Just come back to some of the comments that you made. You were focused on above 10 times liver elevation. Talk about what is the actual FDA guidance? So when this product ends up, let's just say, working, and we're happy, and we're at a panel, and we get those questions, and they talk about up \u2013 what is the number of events above upper limits of normal for ALTs? Are we seeing bilirubin increases? Are we seeing any cases of Hy's law? Just give us a sense of what are the ground rules for FDA guidance, and maybe then you can come back and talk about what you've seen so far?","Second question is Novartis obviously showed some data for their AMD drug with longer duration. I was curious your thoughts about that and if that changes the opportunity for abicipar at all.","And then, third, just give us a sense of key international launches that you expect over the next year or so, so we can model that appropriately. I think we're all focused on the U.S. so much. Thanks.","C. David Nicholson, Ph.D. - Allergan Plc","Yeah. So I'll take the first two. I think Bill is going to handle the final one. Let me just kick off my remarks about ubrogepant and atogepant by saying we have seen no safety concerns or safety issues with either of these two CGRPs so far in the clinical studies. And we've treated a lot of patients now both with atogepant, more chronically for migraine prophylaxis, and approximately 2,000 patients randomized with ubrogepant in the acute migraine studies. So we're really starting to build a large database. Clearly, because of the history of CGRPs, we have a liver safety monitoring board, and they've reviewed the data twice and simply recommend continuation of the programs.","With telcagepant, what they saw was 13 patients out of just over 500 with very significant elevations of liver enzymes, and a couple of these patients had elevations of more than 30-fold. And it's a Merck program, so you need to talk to Merck. But it's my understanding that that's why they stopped the program with telcagepant, and that was on the back of canceling another CGRP prior to them moving telcagepant forward.","We of course have carefully analyzed the likelihood of ubrogepant and atogepant causing liver toxicity. There are multiple hypotheses of why the original CGRPs had liver toxicity issues, and I'll spare you the details of those on this call, but we believe that neither of our compounds have the likelihood of producing liver tox, and that's following very careful analysis, both by Merck and then subsequently by ourselves in our own laboratories. So we are increasingly confident in the safety of these agents. It is a complex issue, because of course we do have to remember that migrainers take many, many compounds, and so do have some polypharmacy. But we're increasingly confident of the safety of our agents.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","And we didn't restrict that in the study.","C. David Nicholson, Ph.D. - Allergan Plc","No, we did not. No, no. That's the point there. Thanks, yeah. Thanks, yeah. So they are on top of standard of care.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah.","C. David Nicholson, Ph.D. - Allergan Plc","And regarding AMD and the Novartis compound, I always say that I want to restrict my comments to our compounds, and it's up to Novartis to comment on their own. What I would say is that the abicipar program, and the protocol, differs from the protocol performed by, in this case, Novartis. What we're looking at is the ability of abicipar given, well, every eight weeks, but with a main focus on being administered every 12 weeks, to continue to improve visual acuity across the entire treatment population. That's the analysis that we're performing. We think that's the right analysis. And we're looking forward to seeing the results in the second half of 2018.","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Marc, I think this market ultimately splits between long-acting agents and short-acting agents, or cheap agents. And when it comes to something that's long-acting, I think abicipar, if we show that 90% of people preserve vision and 30% get an improvement in vision, I don't think there's another long-acting agent out there that's going to have a better profile than that, in an every-four-month, or even longer period. And so I think \u2013 I don't see the findings from any of the other companies impacting what our view of the potential of abicipar is. But we have to of course watch it.","On the international front, what I would look at over the next several years in terms of growth drivers \u2013 I'll talk about the marketed products first. BOTOX and fillers, internationally those businesses in most regions of the country are up 20% to 30%. And as Brent said, the international market has a long way to go as it relates to aesthetics procedures and probably has even more headroom than the U.S. In Eye Care, our fastest-growing product is OZURDEX across the board. And then in terms of new product launches, XEN, which is the glaucoma surgical procedure that we just introduced, probably the best IOP-lowering procedure on the market. And then I'd watch abicipar, of course, which we just talked about, and BELKYRA, which is approved in over a dozen countries around the world. And that's how I think about the international piece.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Hope, next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Brent, first, other than feeding your existing franchises, as has been your strategy for several quarters now, and how you've articulated your BD strategy, are there any capabilities or geographies that you're looking to add at Allergan or enhance, sort of cross-company, not necessarily specific to a therapeutic area?","And maybe, Bill, on ESMYA, I know it's a bit early, but do you have to add infrastructure to leverage that opportunity next year? Or can you leverage what you have?","And lastly, Bill, what are you doing to improve VIBERZI and ACZONE, things that the company can control from this point? Thanks.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Great, yeah. So I think our strategy largely remains unchanged. We'll continue to focus on building out global leading positions in each of our therapeutic areas, where relevant. I think as you look at \u2013 the past is a good indicator of the future. Obviously we've invested a lot in Medical Aesthetics. We believe that's paying off, and that will pay off for the long term. Our pipeline is focused in areas like Eye Care, CNS, and GI. And so we're looking for new product flow there to strengthen our business over time. And we continue to look at adjacencies, much like we did Regenerative Medicine to complement our plastic surgery business, much like we did NASH as an adjacency to our GI business. So we have what I call a lot of white space opportunity. There's no shortages of opportunities, and we really have to focus on leveraging or getting more leverage out of our existing infrastructure, maintaining leadership positions in each of our therapeutic area, and bringing new innovative first-in-class, best-in-class treatments or cures in our therapeutic areas.","That being said, you look at international, and our international business has so much opportunity to continue to grow and strengthen, on a 16% \u2013 over 16% improvement in sales in the quarter. We saw Asia and Middle East\/Africa up over 20%. We saw Latin America\/Canada up over 16%, and we saw even Europe up just \u2013 9%, just shy of double digits. So really robust performance outside the U.S., and I think that's something that we continue to invest in. We've really increased our field force in markets like China and Brazil. We look for other opportunities to do that where appropriate, where we see a good ROI. And so we're doing it prudently, but we're pretty excited about it.","Bill, you want to talk about ESMYA and then VIBERZI and ACZONE?","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Yeah. Gregg, on ESMYA we're not going to have to add any infrastructure to support the launch of ESMYA. We have coverage of obviously the OB\/GYN space or segment, primary care, and any institutions that we need to cover, and of course the payer environment. So there's certainly leverage there.","As it relates to VIBERZI, the problem that we're focused on right now is retraining over 500 gastroenterologists around the country to talk about the new label change and to put into proper context the benefit-risk profile of VIBERZI. At the same time, we're continuing to improve coverage for the product. I don't see that as being a problem for us going forward. It's progressing along with expectations.","And in terms of ACZONE, the distribution model there is in flux. As I mentioned, there are formulary coverage gaps that we need to close given the genericization of the category. There a lot of generic retinoids, generic anti-inflammatories, generic antibiotics that are being promoted. And it's something we have to manage. With ACZONE, we've been successful moving from 5.0% to 7.5%. In fact, we've converted 70% of the business over a relatively short period of time. We have an underlying demand problem that we're solving for because of the availability of generic alternatives. I think it can be managed, but it's just going to take a little bit of time.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Hope, next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Just sort of a high-level question. It seems that most of the guidance raise for the year is related to the lower net interest expense of about $0.15. And just wondering, with the $50 million increase in revenues, as you said, attributed to no FX impact versus a $100 million hit previously, plus no generic competition for NAMENDA, I'm just surprised that you wouldn't see more of that flow to the bottom line. I'm just wondering if there's something going on with the margins of that older business that we should be aware of.","And then also, Brent, if you could comment on just pricing in general. You were very, very prescient at our conference about a month ago in predicting the executive order and being not only potentially neutral but maybe even constructive, but here we are a month later and no executive order. I'm just wondering if you can share with us your latest insights into what's going on there. Thanks very much.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah. So maybe let me take the second question, and I'll ask Tessa to talk about the guidance.","Look, when I think we last spoke, Jami, around the executive order, I think I also commented that I didn't expect the White House to do anything while the Senate was debating healthcare reform. Clearly, that is \u2013 it's clearer now than it was several weeks ago. I do expect that the White House and the Senate and congressional leadership are still debating what to do next on healthcare. I think once that's resolved, I think the likelihood of an executive order would certainly increase, and based on what I'm seeing in the dialogues that exist today \u2013 and by no means do I have perfect insight into this \u2013 it appears to be constructive.","And I admire what Commissioner Gottlieb is doing to try to use the FDA powers to lower prices of medicines and create more competitive marketplaces. I think CMS and the administration are looking at opportunities that are, in my view, also constructive. And, look, we have to in this country \u2013 and Allergan has taken a leadership position in this over a year ago now \u2013 find the right balance between making medicines affordable and accessible while also creating the incentive needed to invest to find cures and treatments for unmet medical need. And these are daunting tasks that require significant investment, and there is a balance between the two, and I think we all need to be \u2013 in this industry and in the policymakers and the government \u2013 need to be sensitive to that balance and try to act responsibly. So I'm cautiously optimistic that we are moving into a more constructive dialogue and a more constructive environment.","Maria Teresa Hilado - Allergan Plc","So to address your first question, Jami \u2013 I think Liav asked a similar question earlier as well. So the removal of the FX headwinds of roughly $100 million, as Bill pointed out, was offset by lower sales levels from VIBERZI, ACZONE, and KYBELLA, which Bill spoke about earlier. And then just to remind you, the EPS raise wasn't really just simply driven by interest expense. Interest expense was one of them \u2013 and kudos to the team for our liability management efforts to not only reduce interest expense significantly but also strengthen the balance sheet. But also if you look at our guidance, we actually raised gross margin, if you take the midpoint, by about 25 basis points, which is significant from a profitability standpoint. So that allowed us to raise EPS guidance.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","And you have to also remember we're investing significantly in R&D, and we've increased our spend and guidance during the year on R&D, so -","Maria Teresa Hilado - Allergan Plc","If you recall, we raised R&D guidance last quarter.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Last time.","Maria Teresa Hilado - Allergan Plc","Yeah.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Last time. So we continue to also make the appropriate investments behind the new product launches and the Aesthetics franchise. So I think the team has done an incredible job across a broad base of issues in terms of investment, both in R&D and in promotion and sales, while keeping G&A very tight. It's been a very impressive performance.","Maria Teresa Hilado - Allergan Plc","Right. And operationally, if I could kind of like graph a picture around it, we raised midpoint on guidance and EPS by $0.15. If you strip out the incremental Teva dividend this quarter, there's the $0.13 EPS raise driven by various factors on the P&L. So very happy with that.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah. Hope, next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Chris Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much. Just a few questions here. Maybe coming back to VIBERZI, do you see the challenges this year as simply an interruption in the growth of the product given the label change? Or something more fundamental that's making the drug less attractive to physicians and could have a more significant impact on the ultimate opportunity in peak sales?","And then my second question, BOTOX Migraine, given that we're expecting some upcoming CGRP approvals, just remind us, how are you thinking about the dynamics of that franchise you start to think about competition from a number of players as we look out to next year? Thanks very much.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah. Let me make one comment on VIBERZI, and then Bill can certainly chime in and take the BOTOX. The way I think about VIBERZI, this was a unanticipated label change by the FDA, a contraindication for people without a gallbladder. The patient satisfaction with the therapy remains high. The adverse event profile remains consistent with the label. And so I view it clearly as a one-time step back. And the market so far is playing out exactly as we thought once it happened, which is we have to go through a period of stabilization, which it appears we are moving through, and the team's doing a nice job of stabilizing. And then we've got a return to growth, which we expect to happen in the back half of the year.","So unanticipated, but I think our team has managed it well, and we're exactly where we need to be, and it's got nothing to do with the performance of the product. I think it's performing consistent and exactly with the label and the risk-benefit within the label. I don't know, Bill, if there's much more to say than that. But feel free to chime in and then maybe take the BOTOX Migraine.","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Yeah. The only thing I'd add about VIBERZI, I think Brent's right, is I don't believe it's something fundamental. We're adding on a consistent basis weekly a lot of new writers. And by the time the year finishes, we'll probably have 20,000 or 30,000 writers. The PCP part of the story looks good, and as I mentioned during the first part of the call, new patient starts in gastroenterology over the past four weeks are up 10%, which I think is a good sign of a recovery. And, as far as I could tell, this should be in good shape as we move through the second half of the year.","As it relates to BOTOX Migraine and how we're thinking about it relative to the CGRPs, I think there are, depending on which estimate you use, 3 million to 5 million people that suffer from chronic migraine, and there's roughly \u2013 as successful as we've been with BOTOX in migraine \u2013 there's under 200,000 receiving BOTOX treatment. And so there's plenty of opportunity in this market for BOTOX to coexist with the CGRPs. Whether they're used sequentially or together I think remains to be seen. Of course, they haven't been studied together.","I would just remind you, Chris, that when you look at the data on BOTOX in the treatment of chronic migraine, it's as good as anything that's been published by the CGRPs, which means it produces roughly a 50% reduction in headaches on a monthly basis. And the responder rates, if you look at that kind of an analysis, are also 50%. In terms of the benefit-risk profile of BOTOX, it's probably as well-understood as any product in the world. And then, finally, it's the biggest bargain, as I've said many times in the past, effectively $5 to $7 a day depending on how you look at it. And so my sense is we can sustain growth for BOTOX through the launches of CGRPs that are maybe an interruption for a quarter or two. I think the bigger story about the market is that it's completely untreated, and there's a lot of off-label use of products like opioids and TCAs and things like that.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Hope, next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Maris with Wells Fargo.","David Maris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Can you tell us what you're seeing on the competitive dynamic there? Not just competitively prescription-wise, because we can all see that, but more like revenue per prescription,use, refill rates? What you're hearing from physicians?","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","David, I'm sorry. The beginning of your question was cut off, so we don't know what product.","David Maris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Oh, well, just fill in the blank. Any product will do. No, on LINZESS, can you tell us the dynamic there?","And then separately, Brent, you had a posting recently about cosmetic procedures in younger patients. So can you just tell us what prompted that posting? And if it does go away, does that impact any of your growth, and do you really care?","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah. So let me take that second part, and then Bill can talk about the LINZESS dynamic.","Just to level-set for everybody, I tend to blog. You guys know that. And I wrote a blog about what I believe \u2013 an important dialogue we need to have in our industry is the use of aesthetic procedures by minors. And one of the things that really opened my eyes to it was some conversations I had with my two teenage daughters that caused me to do a Google search of children getting lip injections, and it got over 50,000 hits. And so that kind of opened my eyes to it.","I spoke to all the medical associations. I spoke to many of the leading KOLs around the world, and there's just tremendous alignment around being thoughtful in terms of intervention with aesthetics in minors. Now, that's not to say that there aren't minors that \u2013 whether it be rhinoplasty, whether it be a scar, whether it be a real defect that is causing a loss of confidence and morale in the child \u2013 but a conversation needs to be had.","And so I will tell you that since I posted that, the reception amongst the community has been overwhelmingly positive, and now we're looking at convening perhaps a group to have a more robust dialogue that includes the associations and the KOLs. So it really was meant to start the conversation. It's done well. I don't think it \u2013 it's immaterial, I think, with respect to our business impact. But I do believe, given our leadership position in this space, we need to act like leaders and have responsible, appropriate discussions about the important issues. And this is one of them.","Bill, you want to talk about LINZESS?","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Yeah. David, in terms of just the overall picture here, I would describe it as very stable and manageable at this point. I think LINZESS has a pretty commanding lead of the category relative to Amitiza or Trulance. I don't think that that's going to change. Our formulary coverage is as strong as it's ever been. I think we're managing price-volume in a good way. The average patient on LINZESS is paying $30 or $40 a month, or $1 a day, for LINZESS. Our ASP is pretty stable on a quarterly or annual basis, and I don't see anything derailing the growth rate for this business over the next several years.","We just launched the 72-microgram, which I think was perfect timing, given some of the competitive activity. I would say the most encouraging finding so far from that launch is that 80% of use for the 72-microgram dose is coming from the over-the-counter market or from other businesses as opposed to the 145 microgram. And it's just a great product, and gastros love it, and so do primary care physicians. And we're going to continue to invest in it. We have a patent that extends well into the next decade. And our primary objective right now is volume and market share, and that's how we're thinking about it.","David Maris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Thanks, David. Hope, next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Cacciatore with Cowen.","Ken Cacciatore - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks, guys. We're getting close now to the back half of the year where we're going to be potentially getting decisions on RESTASIS. Just wanted to know if you could give us an update on how we should be thinking about potential for settlements and if you're in negotiations.","And then also, clinician checks on RHOFADE have been very positive. Just wanted to get your all's sense of the initial launch, when you might turn up the promotional efforts on what appears to be a real interesting asset. Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah. So let's take RESTASIS first. And before I ask Bob Bailey to comment on the litigation in IPR, I would just commend Bill and the Eye Care team in the United States for I think a tremendous performance a little over a year after a competitive launch to have roughly 80% unit share, to really be in a leadership position, to see multi-dose, preservative-free really take off I think is a testament to executional excellence in our Eye Care group. And for those that are listening from that group, we're proud of them, and they did a tremendous job. Set us up great for the future.","Bob, you want to comment? Bob Bailey, our General Counsel, will comment on the patent situation.","A. Robert D. Bailey - Allergan Plc","Sure. Thanks, Brent. On RESTASIS, since the last earnings call, a couple of things. First, we have a trial that is beginning in Texas on the 28th of August. We have an IPR hearing that has been adjusted to September 13. All of the discovery in the matter has been completed, and the case is pretty well set now as we move toward both of these proceedings. We continue to feel strong about our position. Having said that, we continue to be open to settlement discussions. And, as you've seen, we have settled with at least three of the filers, and we continue to be open, because certainty is better than the uncertainty that comes with litigation under the IPR process.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Does that answer your \u2013 oh, RHOFADE was your last question. Yeah.","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Yeah. I mean, it's early as you pointed out, Ken, but it passed Mirvaso. We have 3,000 dermatologists in the United States that have used it. So far, the feedback that we've gotten is very positive. Formulary coverage is developing. In fact, RHOFADE was just added to the formulary at Caremark. Some forms of direct-to-consumer advertising have just started. In fact this week, we're advertising on Facebook, and then we'll, over the next several quarters, begin to ramp up other aspects of the consumer program. And our aim is to produce a multi-hundred-million-dollar dermatology product. That's how we're thinking about it, and so far it looks good, but it's early.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah. And I think, just to be fair, on all of DTC investments, I think Bill and I think about it the same. As you get formulary coverage, that gives you the ability to advertise more broadly. I liken it back to my consumer days: You don't run a lot of advertising until your product's on the shelf, and that's akin to having formulary coverage. So the team's really focused on access, and they're doing a great job. And as that continues to build, you'll see us continue to ramp up promotion.","Next question?","Ken Cacciatore - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Sure. Hope?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein.","Aharon Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. I just want to follow a little bit about Ken's on RESTASIS and then jump over to ubrogepant. So, Bill, great job on maintaining your position in the market. As I talk to payers, they're beginning to talk about lower net pricing for that product in 2018. Should we generally think about that product as net of price increases and rebates and it ending up in a lower net price just for modeling purposes? And then staying with RESTASIS, I mean, my question about it, can this be settled? There are so many folks who can just put in an IPR and go through the process. And even if you have a first-to-file you can identify clearly, can you actually settle this?","And then on ubrogepant. My understanding, David, is that \u2013 have you basically told us that you will not be able to file the product until sometime in the second half of 2019, given the additional trials that you need to do here? I'm just trying to make sure I got that right.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah. Bob, do you want to take the background part of the question first?","A. Robert D. Bailey - Allergan Plc","So on RESTASIS, I think the one thing \u2013 it's a very good question, and it's a question that I think is important in a situation where you have a clear regulatory pathway. I think the complicated regulatory pathway does enable settlements where they might not otherwise be enabled in a clearer situation. And so that's an added wrinkle that I think you need to think about there.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Maybe I would say it \u2013 and, Bob, please correct me if I'm wrong. The other point I would make \u2013 and Rob Stewart can certainly jump in, too \u2013 is that without first-to-file, an unimproved \u2013 no one with an approved ANDA, that's really what generates I think momentum to settle, because no one has anything really to gain in large part. Right?","A. Robert D. Bailey - Allergan Plc","That's exactly right. (1:15:09)","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","There's no leader in the bullpen, right? There's no first-to-filer. And the way we structure the settlement.","Aharon Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","(1:15:19)","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah. So you get it. So there is incentive on both sides, our side and on the generic sides, to create certainty and to create a generic market when it's appropriate for there to be a generic market. And so I think that there's a lot of room for settlement, which is why we've been able to do three of the nine that have filed, and we'll probably continue to make progress on that over time.","Bill, you want to talk about the gross to net and pricing?","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Yeah. Ronny, I think you're right on RESTASIS. We're very pleased at where we are. Our market share and volume is exactly where we wanted it to be a year ago. For modeling purposes, you're right. There's going to be some downward pressure on price. Competition for formulary coverage right now is high. I will tell you that as I sit here right now 2018 for RESTASIS in Part D and commercial is going to look as it did in 2017. And so not all, but some of the discounts that we're providing to obtain formulary coverage will be covered by improved volume or preserved volume in 2018. And, as we both know, I think one of the things Shire did prove is that the category is underdeveloped and that there are more people being treated for dry eye today that there were a year ago. And while the category may not grow at quite the same rate in 2018 that it did through parts of 2016 and 2017, it's still going to expand. And that's how I think about it.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Great. Hope, next \u2013 oh, wait. David, yeah.","C. David Nicholson, Ph.D. - Allergan Plc","Yeah, there was a question about ubrogepant, yeah. So as I said in my remarks, we are finalizing the Phase 3 program with the FDA. Obviously precise timing of filing is dependent on recruitment rates. We're not anticipating any sort of significant delay in that, and we still expect to be able to launch in 2020.","Aharon Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Great. Now, Hope, next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat of Evercore.","Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. Thank you so much for taking my questions. David, you mentioned no safety signals identified for both your oral CGRPs. So I have two very specific questions on that. One, in your chronic dosing study \u2013 this is for the backup molecule in Phase 2\/Phase 3. What percentage of patients, or what number of patients, have had more than 90 days of continuous dosing, first?","And secondly, are you aware of any cases of ALT elevation above three times for any of your oral CGRP trials that are ongoing?","And perhaps one for Bill. Bill, can you break down the 17% year-over-year growth in BOTOX Therapeutic between the percentage that came from migraine versus non-migraine? Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","So I think Bill's question is the easiest one. You want to take it, or I can answer it, Bill? I mean, we don't provide that breakdown. So -","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","(1:18:15) You know that 30% to 40% of our sales is coming from roughly, or a little bit more, from migraine, and that's the fastest-growing part of the business. I don't have the breakdown in front of me, but we could follow up at some time.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","But, David, do you want to take the more complicated \u2013 or complex question, I should say?","C. David Nicholson, Ph.D. - Allergan Plc","Sure, no problem. Yeah, always happy to talk about these compounds. I mean, I would say that atogepant is not a backup compound to ubrogepant. We're developing the two for two different indications. Ubrogepant is for the acute treatment, and atogepant is for migraine prophylaxis. So we're going for two different indications.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Two very different studies.","C. David Nicholson, Ph.D. - Allergan Plc","Two very different studies and very different compounds. So \u2013 and with atogepant, what we've treated as of a couple of weeks ago, we have 460 patients exposed to atogepant for one to three months. And so we've now treated a lot of patients with atogepant for a very significant period of time. And we've only had five patients out of 596 randomized, this is now really getting into the details. And we have to look at randomized patients with atogepant, because this is a double-blind study. So we don't know which of these patients were in the placebo group and which were in the atogepant group. And only five have had elevations greater than three times. Okay?","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","And remember they're on polypharmacy; there were exclusions.","C. David Nicholson, Ph.D. - Allergan Plc","Yeah, they're on polypharmacy, so we don't \u2013 they've got background medication, and these 596 randomized. So I really want to repeat that. We've no idea which of those patients was in placebo.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","But the DSMB...","C. David Nicholson, Ph.D. - Allergan Plc","Yeah, the DSMB look at it blinded, and they've looked at it twice and told us to continue. You remember a bunch of these patients get paracetamol. I'm in danger of going on for too long in answer to your question. So yeah. We really do feel that there is no safety concerns with either of these compounds identified today. Hope that answers your question.","Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC","Right. David, this 1% is consistent with background rate, right? I feel this is going to get a lot of investor attention.","C. David Nicholson, Ph.D. - Allergan Plc","I love talking about this, I get lots of questions, I'm happy about that. Yeah, so to put it bluntly, in my opinion, if this wasn't CGRPs, this wouldn't get any attention at all. You always see low-level elevation of liver enzymes in every trial because of polypharmacy, because of background medication, because people have a drink every so often, so yeah.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Yeah, so I think that, in layman's term, it's background, right? I think we have a lot of confidence in the safety, but as David says, and I steal his British expression, the proof will be in the pudding when we get the final results of all the data. But given what we see in the number of patients treated, the DSMB two check-ins, and the like, our confidence and conviction continues to improve on the safety.","Hope, next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Amsellem with Piper Jaffray.","David A. Amsellem - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thanks. So a question on NAMZARIC \u2013 a couple here, actually. First, any thoughts on how the generic erosion on NAMENDA XR could impact the volume trajectory of NAMZARIC? And then, just thinking of further ahead, what \u2013 realistically, what portion of the overall memantine market do you think you can capture with NAMZARIC?","And then secondly I had a question on sarecycline and just digging deeper into the derm pipeline \u2013 this is a question for Bill \u2013 is do you think that product potentially could be RHOFADE-like in your thinking about peak sales potential? Thanks.","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Yeah. On NAMZARIC, if XR loses exclusivity in 2018, I think as a base case we keep whatever we've moved over to NAMZARIC. The one positive here is that over half of the sales and utilization for NAMZARIC today isn't coming from NAMENDA XR but is coming from ARICEPT 5 and 10 milligrams. And that a unique situation. And I don't want to overestimate what we can do with NAMZARIC in 2018 in the face of memantine XR, but we may be able to at least maintain the business, as I said, and potentially show some increased sales in 2018 given that situation.","And I've always said with these types of line extensions, it's a great product, but it's a line extension. If you can get into that 30% to 50% range \u2013 right now we're trading at the lower end of it \u2013 you have a pretty good product. And I continue to think that about NAMZARIC, and as I said here today and I've mentioned it on other calls, we have coverage for NAMZARIC all the way through the end of 2018.","As it relates to sarecycline, I think you're exactly right, Dave. That is a good analogy, which is it could be a RHOFADE-like product.","C. David Nicholson, Ph.D. - Allergan Plc","Sarecycline.","William J. Meury - Allergan Plc","Yeah, sarecycline could be a \u2013 the RHOFADE analogy. It could be a multi-hundred-million-dollar dermatology product. You have retinoids and antibiotics and anti-inflammatories, and it looks like the tolerability profile of this one looks pretty good, and it's going to be an alternative to doxycycline and minocycline, and that's how we're modeling it.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","I think, Hope, we have time for perhaps two more questions, so let's take the next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Great. Thanks for getting my questions in. So just two. I'm sorry if these were touched on with the other news \u2013 I may have missed this. But one, with the VRAYLAR label expansion for the negative symptoms, it looks like that has not been submitted, but the plan had been for first half of the year. So just curious what the delay is there. Looks like a second-half submission now.","And then the second one is for BOTOX Depression. You spent quite a bit of time on the call last quarter talking about the depression data and your plans to start Phase 3 in that indication next year, but now it looks like based on your supplies this quarter that's not in the plan anymore, at least for 2018. So if you can just talk about what's changed from last quarter till now? Thanks.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Sure. David, do you want to take a shot at it?","C. David Nicholson, Ph.D. - Allergan Plc","Yeah. So, I mean, regarding VRAYLAR, it is our company policy to announce submissions to the agency when they've been accepted for filing, and we want to stick with that policy.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","But I would add, all of our clinical programs are on track. So all of our regulatory programs are on track.","C. David Nicholson, Ph.D. - Allergan Plc","Yeah. I'm not suggesting there's any delay. On the contrary.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Right.","C. David Nicholson, Ph.D. - Allergan Plc","Yeah. Thanks, Brent. And regarding BOTOX Depression, also there I'm not suggesting there's any delay. We remain committed to looking at toxins in depression, and we have a decision to make which toxin to move forward with for this indication.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","And, just to be fair, Vamil, we had, maybe subtlety but I thought clearly, said on the last call and in the press release that we do intend to go forward in 2018 with a toxin for depression, and the timing would depend largely on agreeing to a protocol at the FDA and then, second, agreeing what toxin we want to use. And that could plus or minus several months on the initiation depending on how we see which toxin would be appropriate for that study. That will be the variable. Not the commitment to it.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And then on VRAYLAR, maybe it was more of a acceptance issue, either 1H to 2H change, from last quarter to this quarter?","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","No, nothing's changed. It's just we simply don't do the press release till it's accepted. Some companies press release when they file. Some companies press release when accepted for filing. We have over the last few years always done it on the acceptance of the file, and so we're going to just stick with our policy.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. All right. Thanks.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","Okay. All right. Last question, Hope.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Louise Chen with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. This is Jen (1:26:58) on for Louise. I was just wondering, was there a cash tax payment made this quarter? It looks like historically you make a tax payment in the second quarter, but it doesn't seem to have been made. And if you can quantify that amount, that would be helpful, too.","Maria Teresa Hilado - Allergan Plc","No. There was no tax payment made this quarter. Obviously, we look at our tax liabilities every quarter and assess whether a true-up is necessary. There was none this quarter \u2013 with the exception, obviously, you saw in our cash flow we had a refund related to the gain on sale estimated taxes for Teva.","Unknown Speaker","Thank you.","Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan Plc","So just to wrap up, and \u2013 I'm just going to tease Jen. (1:27:40) It's always exciting to end on a tax question. I would just wrap up by thanking everyone for participating in the call and for the great questions. And just again thank our colleagues at Allergan for a tremendous focus on execution and delivering our pivotal year, driving sales, advancing our pipeline, and managing costs. I think this team has really hit its stride, and we're excited about delivering the back half of the year and 2018 and beyond. Thank you very much for coming, and we look forward to talking to you all soon.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call.

You may access this information on our website at www.allergan.com.","At this point, I would like to turn the call over to David Pyott.","David E. I. Pyott","Great. Thanks, Jim. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Fourth quarter sales increased strongly over Q4 of 2012 by 15.6% in local currencies, and by 14.6% in U.S. dollars, thus making Q4 an even stronger quarter than Q3, and demonstrating continuing strong momentum across almost all of our businesses as we benefit, firstly, from the many regulatory approvals we've received, both from FDA and other agencies around the world since 2010; and secondly, from healthy cash pay markets as the economy picks up steam in many countries.","For the full year 2013, we're pleased that we fulfilled our long-term goal of growing sales double-digits. In fact, sales increased by 11.7% in U.S. dollars, and by 12.4% in local currencies.","Regarding operating performance, we generated in Q4 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.35, an increase of 20.5% over Q4 of 2012, and well above the outlook provided on the last earnings call of $1.31 to $1.33. This strong result was achieved off the healthy increases of expenditure for R&D and sales and marketing. For the full year of 2013, earnings per share on the same basis were $4.77, an increase of 18.1% over 2012, and thus, again, fulfilling our long-term aspirations of mid-teens earnings growth.","For reconciliation of these non-GAAP numbers to U.S. GAAP, kindly consult our press release.","Spending on direct-to-consumer advertising is a good example of how Allergan invests to establish brands and grow markets. In 2013, we spent approximately $180 million worldwide, an increase of approximately 13% over 2012, with larger increases for RESTASIS, for BOTOX, for Chronic Migraine with the new branded TV campaign, and for ACZONE with the first TV and print campaign.","Regarding the RESTASIS TV advertisement, a Nielsen report on the most memorable ads across all product categories placed RESTASIS at #9, and is the only pharmaceutical brand in the top 10. More significantly, RESTASIS was rated as the #1 ad across all categories by females 13 years and older. This corroborates that branded TV has contributed to strong RESTASIS growth in 2013 of 19% in local currencies over 2012.","For Chronic Migraine, a recent survey amongst appropriate patients showed an 89% aided awareness rate after we had run our branded campaign.","Looking forward to 2014, and referring to the outlook we have provided in our press release, you will note that we plan to deliver some leveraging of our SG&A expenses. Regarding regulatory approvals, we made further strong progress since the last earnings call. For BOTOX Cosmetic marketed as VISTABEL in most of Europe for the crow's feet indication, we have now secured the national licenses across 21 countries in the region. The establishment of our global partnership with Medytox outside Korea was cleared by the Korean government.","Regarding LEVADEX, we resubmitted an NDA to the FDA, which we believe addresses the concerns identified in the complete response letter received in the second quarter of 2012.","Enrollment into the third stage of our Phase II trial for the anti-VEGF DARPin was completed in Q4 of 2013, and we expect to provide you an update to the results in the second half of 2014.","In terms of our ability to continue to maintain strong long-term growth, we're pleased to report on some substantive steps for maintaining strong intellectual property positions. Regarding LUMIGAN 0.01%, a District Court in Texas ruled that Allergan's 5 patents are valid until their expiries, the last of which is in 2027.","For RESTASIS, we have so far had 3 new patents issued by the U.S. Patent Office, 2 formulation patents and 1 method of use patent with expiries in 2024, and have submitted all of them to the Orange Book. In addition, we have filed a citizens petition with the Generics Drugs division of FDA. This provides us several legal avenues to vigorously defend RESTASIS, although uncertainty remains as to the status of ANDA filers. Since receipt of a Paragraph IV certification notice from Actavis, we have received no further such notices. So therefore, the situation may become clearer by midyear.","Now commenting on the performance of the businesses, I'll commence with ophthalmic pharmaceuticals, which, after good growth in Q3, again posted strong growth in Q4 of 11.6% in local currencies and 10.8% in dollars. Encouragingly both U.S. and ex-U.S. sales posted double-digit increases in Q4. In the U.S., IMS reported in-market sales growth of 12.7% for Allergan in Q4, and of course, that's in acquisition dollars. The U.S. performance was driven by very strong growth of RESTASIS, OPTIVE and Refresh artificial tears and OZURDEX, offset by single-digit decline in LUMIGAN sales.","As in earlier quarters, LUMIGAN performance in the U.S. is impacted by activities at the pharmacy level, where pharmacists attempt to switch LUMIGAN scripts to generic latanoprost, and were also impacted by heavier rebates to maintain Tier 2 and Tier 3 access in managed care. The results of a Phase IV clinical trial called the drop study showed significantly lower intraocular pressure when patients switch from latanoprost generic to LUMIGAN 0.01%.","Since utilizing the study since the midyear of 2013, we're at least pleased that LUMIGAN trailing prescriptions in the second half of 2013 grew 2% versus the prior part of the year, having declined 0.5% in the first half. Ex-U.S., the bimatoprost franchise, i.e. LUMIGAN and GANFORT, grew double-digit, both in Q4 and for the full year.","In Europe, we are rapidly gaining market share in glaucoma, also due to approvals of our new Unit Dose products. The introduction of LUMIGAN Unit Dose across the European Union is now complete, and we continue to roll out GANFORT Unit Dose across the region. We're pleased that GANFORT became the #1 fixed combination product in Europe, overtaking Xalacom in November. COMBIGAN is now approved in all countries in the European Union.","RESTASIS in the U.S. continues to be driven by strong unit growth, plus the benefit of price increases, based on effective DTC and a strong uptick in optometry, as well as further expansion in the ophthalmologist channel.","Regarding the global ophthalmic market for the IMS Q3 report, the last period for which data is available, IMS shows 9-month growth of the market at a robust 12%, boosted by 28% growth in retinal therapeutics, and Allergan growing in-market at 11%. Allergan is the fastest-growing global full-line branded pharmaceutical company for the year-to-date September.","In Q3, RESTASIS became globally the #1 prescription ophthalmic product.","In the glaucoma market, year-to-date September, Allergan gained considerable share, growing 9% in the global market, increasing only 3% in value, as Pfizer and Merck exit or scale down their activities.","In artificial tears, as we launched OPTIVE Plus and Optive Plus Unit Dose and also OPTIVE Fusion across Europe in new markets outside the United States, we enjoyed double-digit growth in Q4. The IMS Q3 report showed Allergan in the third quarter growing only 3% in the category, which was expanding globally at 8%. Therefore, it is to be expected that Allergan will start to come up, too, and then exceed this global market growth.","OPTIVE Advanced was approved in Mexico, Chile and Turkey, OPTIVE Plus in Kuwait, Unit Dose in Bahrain and OPTIVE Fusion in Turkey.","Regarding the retina market, OZURDEX is performing strongly in the retinal vein occlusion and uveitis submarkets. OZURDEX was approved for retinal vein occlusion and uveitis in the Philippines, and in Korea for uveitis, and was launched in Taiwan.","With physicians already trained on how to use our device, we look forward to receiving approvals in the U.S. for diabetic macular edema later in 2014, and in Europe in early 2015.","In the LUCENTIS so-called RISE and RIDE pivotal study, it was estimated that as many as 35% to 39% of patients with diabetic macular edema had an inadequate response to anti-VEGF therapy alone.","Moving on to BOTOX, sales increased in Q4 by 12.1% in local currencies and by 10.7% in dollars, with full year performance at 13.2% in local currencies and 12.2% in dollars. In terms of the split to therapeutic and aesthetic sales for 2013, therapeutic indications accounted for 54% of the total, and grew 16% in local currencies and 17% in dollars, with aesthetic indications constituting 46% and with 10% growth in local currencies and 8% in dollars.","Regarding the global market for neuro modulators, we estimate that both the therapeutic and aesthetic markets grew double-digit throughout 2013. Up to Q3, the last period for which data is available, our analysis shows the market in Allergan growing at 13%, with share gains for Xeomin coming at the expense of Dysport. BOTOX enjoyed approximately 76% world share in Q3.","Thanks to the new indications of Chronic Migraine and in overactive bladder, BOTOX gained share in therapeutics, offset by minor share loss in aesthetics. Since the last earnings call, we received several BOTOX product approvals. For crow's feet, we now have national licenses in 21 countries across the European region, with only Italy outstanding amongst the major markets. We also received this approval for this indication in Korea.","Regarding Chronic Migraine, we received approvals in Norway and Greece, and now have all the approvals of the European economic area. Regarding BOTOX for overactive bladder, we received approvals in Canada, the U.K., the Netherlands, Switzerland, Slovakia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Hong Kong, and reimbursement by the Australian government.","In the U.K., we also received the additional indication of lower limb spasticity.","In the U.S., we announced a price increase on January 2 for both BOTOX Therapeutic and BOTOX Cosmetics, and it is in such a way to avoid any pull forward of sales into December. The therapeutic business continued on the same trajectory in Q4 of strong growth, driven by an acceleration in Chronic Migraine and the 2 bladder indications.","Regarding Chronic Migraine in the U.S., we have completed the process of securing reimbursement for commercial and Medicare lines, experienced only low levels of denials for prior authorizations, and therefore, now strive to improve the quality of coverage. Training is focused on deepening injector capability and productivity rather than training brand-new physicians.","Our heavy investment in branded and unbranded advertising is driving steady increases in numbers searching our Chronic Migraine websites.","Regarding urology, we're able to secure coverage in December for 81% of commercial lines, for 82% of Medicare lines, and good levels of approvals for prior authorizations. About 4,500 urologists and uro-gynecologists are regular users of BOTOX, out of a universe of about 13,000 physicians, many of whom do not treat incontinence at all.","In Europe, we've invested heavily in medical education and training for Chronic Migraine in neurogenic and overactive bladder in those countries where we have secured reimbursement.","Turning to the aesthetic side of the business. We estimate in the U.S. and based on survey data that the market grew in the high single-digits. BOTOX Cosmetic's share remains high at 79% at December versus 84% in December of 2012, with Dysport at 14% share versus 15% a year ago, with Xeomin at 6.5% versus 1% a year ago as this was when the product was being reintroduced into the market after the lifting of the injunction. A significant amount of Xeomin's current share stems from free samples.","In Western Europe, we estimate that the market is growing mid single-digits with VISTABEL or BOTOX growing slightly in excess of market, despite strong competition from Merck's and Galderma.","Facial aesthetics. The rate of growth picked up with an increase in Q4 of 35.4% in local currencies and 34.0% in dollars versus the same period of the prior year. The contribution of initial sales of VOLUMA in the U.S. was modest as all our efforts were focused on injector training versus selling product.","All regions of the world contributed to the acceleration in growth as each 1 introduces the new products in the bi-cross line. The response to VOLUMA in the U.S. has been enthusiastic. In the U.S., based on survey data, we estimate that the market in Q4 grew around 10% in volume, and of course, we believe that it was be stimulated by the introduction of our category-changing product.","Regarding share, the JUV\u00c9DERM line enjoyed record market share at 44% in December versus 36% in December of 2012, with share gains stemming from Restylane, which stood at 25% share, as well as with [indiscernible].","In Europe, survey data for Q3, the last period for which data is available, shows the market continuing to grow double-digit, even in an economically challenged Southern Europe, and with JUV\u00c9DERM and VOLUMA and the rest of the bi-cross line rapidly gaining market share.","Since last earnings call, VOLBELLA was approved in Mexico, and also in VOLIFT in Mexico, the Philippines and Vietnam.","Breast aesthetic sales as reported declined 2.0% in dollars and local currencies. This was largely due to management decisions to reduce end-market inventories, ahead of going direct in early 2014 rather than selling via distributors in Mexico and Colombia. On an underlying basis, worldwide sales in Q4 actually increased approximately 10%. In the U.S., sales increased double-digit as we benefited from a strong mix shift to the premium-priced 410 shaped anatomical implant and tissue expanders for reconstruction, plus we deemphasized highly priced competitive saline implants. We consciously ceded some market share to Mentor and Sientra as we decided to defend value-added pricing.","In Europe, we returned to growth as we get past the prior year comparisons in the wake of the PIP scandal, and the then resulting surge in our sales as patients underwent revision surgery. Survey data for Q3 shows a small increase in unit volume in the European Union, however, with declines in Italy, Spain and France and the U.K. offset by growth in other countries.","Clearly, breast augmentation as a large expenditure is more affected by consumer spending levels than is the case for facial aesthetics.","Our so-called skin care and other franchise grew over 67% in local currencies and 66% in dollars in Q4, boosted by the acquisition of SkinMedica. In terms of real performance, sales of our U.S. medical dermatology products, led by ACZONE and TAZORAC, grew 48% year-over-year.","Regarding ACZONE, investments in DTC targeted at the adult female patient, focused sales effort and diminished branded competition, has led to an increase of 35% in trailing prescriptions year-to-date November, as reported by IMS.","In 2014, we expect ACZONE to become the #1 acne brand in the U.S. in value. TAZORAC trailing prescriptions for the same period increased 12%. Furthermore, both brands have benefited from net price increases.","Regarding real performance of our topical physician skin care business, SkinMedica continues to gain substantial share as physicians benefit from including SkinMedica line in their overall purchases of Allergan's medical aesthetics products.","Regarding LATISSE, sales declined 5.3% in local currencies and by 6.1% in dollars with ex-U.S. growth in Latin America and Asia offset by a decline in U.S. sales. U.S. situation is primarily explained by the timing of promotions to physicians and a small movement in trade inventory.","I'll now toss over to Jeff Edwards, who will comment on our financial performance. Jeff?","Jeffrey L. Edwards","Thanks, David, and good morning to all of you on the call.","During the quarter, Allergan once again generated high-quality operating results, as we have experienced strong revenue growth across most products and geographies, with particularly strong growth in the U.S. and Europe. The strong growth combined with our continued commitment to thoughtfully managing expenses and carefully targeting higher volume investment opportunities have enabled the company to deliver non-GAAP diluted EPS results above the top end of our earnings per share guidance for the quarter and for the full year.","Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2013 was $1.35, and for the full year, it was $4.77. A reconciliation of all the adjustments to GAAP earnings is set out in our earnings release.","Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments in amortization of acquired intangibles, Allergan's Q4 2013 gross margin of 87.7% increased 30 basis points when compared to Q4 2012, and Allergan once again saw sequential quarterly improvement in both its pharmaceutical and medical device margins. This continuing positive gross margin trend has been primarily -- has been driven primarily by improved year-over-year standard costs, favorable pricing, favorable region and product line mix, lower royalty expense and lower year-over-year inventory provisions.","The non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses to product mix sales ratio for the fourth quarter was 39%, totaling $648 million. The comparable ratio and expense value for the same period in 2012 were 38% and $550 million, respectively. This increase in spend was largely attributable to the launch of JUV\u00c9DERM and VOLUMA in the U.S., the addition of our SkinMedica business, and increased selling and promotional expenses around BOTOX, including both the Chronic Migraine and OAB indications in the U.S.","Our commitment to prudently manage Allergan's cost structure in an effort to maximize efficiency and direct our capital to the highest yielding investments will continue to be resolute. With the focus of meeting our short and long-term aspirations and commitment to maintaining a dynamic high-performance operating environment, Allergan regularly analyzes its organizational structure to ensure we can best serve our customers, generate shareholder value and maximize operational efficiency.","As a result of these analyses, earlier this year, we initiated a restructuring that will impact approximately 300 of our colleagues with the reduction of nearly 150 positions. We estimate that these actions will have an aggregate cost of approximately $45 million, with the majority of this cost recognized in Q1 2014 and reported as a non-GAAP adjustments, and the remainder recognized across the remainder of 2014 and 2015, and reported as non-GAAP adjustments.","Additionally, we estimate that these restructuring activities will have a payback of under 2 years.","Non-GAAP research and development expenses were 16.2% of product net sales for the quarter totaling $269 million, an increase in spend of approximately $29 million over the fourth quarter of 2012, and $18 million over the third quarter of 2013. Allergan's consistent commitment to investment within our R&D process has proven to be a productive one and has resulted in many product approvals around the world over the past several years.","With respect to our balance sheet, consolidated Allergan days sales outstanding was 49 days, while consolidated Allergan inventory days on hand was 127 days. Although our DSO performance was quite strong for both the year and the quarter, it is worth noting that the driver from the 2-day year-over-year increase in the DSO is largely attributable to the challenges our Venezuelan distributor partner, Merck KGaA, German company, has in receiving central bank approval for dollar payments. Allergan generated operating cash flow after CapEx of approximately $441 million in the quarter and just over $1.5 billion for the full year of 2013. This compares to operating cash flow after CapEx of slightly below $1.5 billion for the full year of 2012.","At the end of the fourth quarter, Allergan's cash equivalents and short-term investments and cash and equivalents in short-term investments net of debt positions total approximately $3.6 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively.","For the first quarter of 2014, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $1,525,000,000 to $1,600,000,000. Regarding the full year of 2014, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $6,650,000,000 to $6,950,000,000, which assumes a negative currency impact of approximately 2% on sales growth throughout the year. Please note that product net sales expectations excludes any anticipated revenue from transition service agreements related to the sale of the obesity intervention business.","With respect to SG&A expense, and as is typically the case, our spend as a percent of net sales is expected to be greater in the first half of 2014 than in the second half of 2014. Allergan estimates non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2014 in the range of $1.09 to $1.12.","Regarding the full year 2014, Allergan estimates non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $5.36 to $5.48, representing growth of between 12% and 15%, which is consistent with our aspiration of mid-teens EPS growth.","As a reminder, this EPS expectation assumes that the U.S. R&D tax credit will be renewed in the fourth quarter of 2014, with the full year retroactive benefit impacting Q4 results. This was -- this will result -- this will generate a higher effective tax rate in the first 3 quarters of 2014, and thus lower EPS results in those quarters, while benefiting both the Q4 effective tax rate and reported Q4 EPS.","For your information, expectations for other lines of the income statement and specific product sales expectations are included in our earnings release.","With respect to 2014 capital expenditures, we project capital expenditures of between $200 million and $250 million for the full year. Regarding 2014 cash flow, we again expect to generate operating cash flow after CapEx in excess of $1 billion. We have assumed moderate levels of share repurchase activity of approximately 6 million shares in 2014, with our repurchase objectives limited to approximately match expected employee stock option-based compensation programs.","So with that, operator, I would now like to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Marc Goodman of UBS.","Marc Harold Goodman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Can you talk a about the spending a little bit in the quarter? Obviously, you came in much higher than what we were expecting on the spending and where did you spend and how much of that spend was kind of upfront for launch expenses that may not have to be spent in '14? And if you can just, on that question, talk about DTC and where you're going to be spending your money on DTC in 2014, what's going up, what's coming down?","David E. I. Pyott","Okay. I think, the simplest in terms of new spend, which clearly is bolus, was the launch cost for JUV\u00c9DERM, VOLUMA in the United States. Obviously, we continue to invest in the rollout of Chronic Migraine and OAB, particularly in the area of DTC, where if you look at Q4 2013 and Q4 2012, the upticks in DTC were quite substantial for Chronic Migraine and also RESTASIS. And I'm sure you all noticed that RESTASIS was really growing very, very strongly in Q4. And I don't want to say alone because of DTC, also due to other selling and promotional efforts. Then coming around to answering your question on DTC for 2014, overall, we'll spend more as a company on DTC, although, of course, as you ably point out, some can come down because they are further in their period since launch. But I'd say, in terms of the really big ticket items, we're going to be spending heavily on RESTASIS, BOTOX Chronic Migraine. And later in the year, we'll also start to initiate more modest but a print campaign for BOTOX for bladder as well. And I think that probably answers all of your questions. So very targeted spending and I think you can tell that we have good metrics. We believe we had good returns. And sales are accelerating and that's all very good.","Marc Harold Goodman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","But would you agree with the comment that the fourth quarter spend was higher than it was planned to be because the top line was so strong? Or was it planned to be at that $650 million range the whole time?","David E. I. Pyott","At the margin, of course, we're always adapting the flight path. And if we see opportunities, particularly in the short term, we're not shy about spending them because we see the return. So next questioner, please.","Operator","Our next question is from Seamus Fernandez of Leerink.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","David, can you just talk a little bit about your interest in acquisitions going forward? I guess, particularly, you guys have done a good job of building in-line product portfolios. And I was just interested to get a sense of the appetite for acquisitions going forward, particularly in the context of the relatively modest, I guess, announced share repurchase plans for this year.","David E. I. Pyott","Okay. Well, maybe ending with the easiest part. On share repurchase, over a long period of time, our goal has been to hold the share count roughly flat. We'll go up and down at the margin quarter-to-quarter, so the treasury is on the other side, if you like, of the dilution caused by employees appropriately exercising their stock options. I think, then coming back to the whole M&A question, clearly, you can see our first objective always is to make sure we're growing our markets, we're establishing new product categories and performing well in line. So it's just good old-fashioned getting products approved and executing against those product launches. Now clearly, when I'm being asked many times about what is our order of use of very strong cash flows, Jeff referred to we had record cash flow generation in 2013, roughly $1.5 billion. Always, it will be to acquire new technology, whether it be licenses, a good example of that would have been Vicept for rosacea,even bigger one in terms of monetary outlay, DARPin. And then, of course, bringing the products in and spending R&D on it, and that's in the context of pretty strong increases of R&D, both last year, you can see it in our guidance for 2014. And we stated roughly 5 years from now, we should be spending about $1.5 billion on R&D. So clearly, in addition to internally derived programs, we'll be grafting in new technology. On top of that, of course, we're always looking to see other products or companies that would fit our business model, but also fulfill the very rigorous criteria of providing growth, because, clearly, with our strong internal growth, we would have no interest in buying, and I'll exaggerate, a product or a company that were only growing 2% or 3%, because all we do would be diluting our already really strong internal performance. So I hope that gives you a good framework about how we think about these targets. And obviously, I can't give you the names, that we just can't do.","Operator","Our next question is from Vamil Divan of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Vamil Divan - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Maybe I'll just follow-up on the question an M&A. One area in particular that I just had a question on was around urology, it sounds like you're getting some good traction there with BOTOX. I'm just curious as to what the sales force, if you can just remind me sort of the focus there, what else are they working on, what else are they promoting besides talking to the urologist? And is there any excess capacity there that could be attractive to maybe focusing some of your M&A efforts in boosting the urology portfolio?","David E. I. Pyott","Well, you're quite right because if you look at -- I'll give you sort of a couple of examples of history, when we originally acquired the SANCTURA product line, that was really to provide some scale and a sales force onto which we could graft the launches of the 2 approved, thank goodness, since approved indications for BOTOX. Going forward, we have a partnership with a company called Serenity. They have a very interesting product for nocturia. So that is in the plans that our sales force will -- obviously, we plan to get it approved in the partnership with Serenity to give us the second product. And you're quite right, we'd be very happy to look for other things. Further down the road, of course, we have an internal R&D program for BOTOX for premature ejaculation that would go through the same sales force. And if you look back in history, say it neurology and BOTOX for Chronic Migraine, that was precisely why we acquired MAP Pharmaceuticals to add LEVADEX into the bag. So clearly, in summary, we're always looking to see if we can add other neurology or urology products to our product range where we can leverage the relationships we've created and also leverage the fixed cost of our sales and marketing organizations.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Gilbert of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Gregory B. Gilbert - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","For David and for Jeff, I think, short of a major overhaul on the tax rules in the U.S. seems unlikely to us, do you believe that management should be considering transactions that could level the playing field on your tax structure as long as there are other strategic reasons to consider such a transaction? And Jeff, could you confirm that your tax rate, independent of any deals, should stay in the mid to high 20s over the longer term?","David E. I. Pyott","Well, I think, first of all, at the highest level, I would say we're always looking for the validity and quality of technology. That has to be the highest order of choice versus trading off, and sort go the other way around, low technology juiced up by a tax rate. That would feel very uncomfortable to me. And Jeff will give you some color on the tax rate, which to some degree, of course, is high because we make it high because of the way we also conduct some of our R&D through our Irish entities.","Jeffrey L. Edwards","So Greg, the guidance we provided for tax in 2014 is 27%. But I'm sure you've noted, over the course of, say, the last 5 years, that the rate has moved down gradually, moving towards the mid-20s. So you asked a question mid to high 20s over the expected future, I'd say closer to the mid-20s if you look out 3 to 5 years would be our objective. The opportunities we have to lower that rate will be driven by product mix. So the more BOTOX, obviously, the better off we are. Likewise, the R&D that we conduct out of or through our Irish entities represent a bit of a tax anchor today because we get a very low deduction given the low tax rate that exists in that country today. However, to the extent we are able to generate approvals through those activities in Ireland, we'll have the benefit of that same rate on profits generated through that entity. So we believe we have a sustainable strategy to continue lowering the tax rate. To the effect there's external transaction available to us that is consistent with our strategy, we would consider that as well.","Operator","Our next question is from Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I assume we have Scott on the line today, David?","David E. I. Pyott","Yes, Scott is ready.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Great. So Scott, it would be helpful to hear from you what pipeline data we can expect to see in 2014, and an update of the status of the Medytox liquid formulation.","Scott M. Whitcup","Sure. So some of the key programs that we've talked about, where data would be available, clearly, the DARPin is in the third stage of the Phase II program. That Stage III is fully recruited and so we'll have data in the second half of 2014. We also said that we would present the early Phase IIA data from the bimatoprost hair growth study at dermatology meeting in Hawaii, so that's scheduled, I believe, later this quarter. In addition, we have a very exciting program of sustained relief for bimatoprost or LUMIGAN for glaucoma. Those data will probably come out end of the year, we're looking to present those data. The DME data are out, but, clearly, we expect the next big item would be approval from the U.S., which we expect midyear. And then, as David commented, the LEVADEX file, we responded to the complete response letter. Those data were refiled to FDA, and we're expecting approval on that midyear. Last piece, I don't know if it's new data, but we did announce that our third fairly big indication for BOTOX would be depression and that should go into the clinic midyear. And on the dry eye side, we showed you the clinical trial design at the end of the year, we said in December, you'd see that on clinicaltrials.gov. That will go into the clinic. The plan is first half of this year but the goal is to have multiple shots on go in the dry eye area. And so look at clinicaltrials.gov, we will have another novel NCE for inflammation go into the clinic this year, with the potential use for dry eye. So the goal will be lots of data. But over the course of the next 12 months, more NCEs going into the clinic than in the history of the R&D organization.","Operator","Our next question is from Annabel Samimy of Stifel, Nicolaus.","Annabel Samimy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Well, you just answered the R&D question where you're going to be spending your R&D dollars. And the acquisition question has been asked -- answered -- or asked rather, not necessarily answered. But maybe you can talk about glaucoma because that seems to be an area that's still a little bit of a weak spot. And what are some of the efforts that you're going to be making to essentially bolster that segment given some of the pressures you're seeing from latanoprost? So maybe you can help us out there.","David E. I. Pyott","Yes. Well, I think, as I've said in prior quarters, it really is a world of 2 speeds. We have double-digit Allergan glaucoma growth, ex-U.S. Of course, we have a couple of advantages from a product line point of view where we have GANFORT that doesn't exist in the U.S. And also, more recently, the benefit of the 2 Unit Dose products, LUMIGAN Unit Dose, GANFORT Unit Dose, ex-U.S. So really, the real issue that we have to address is the United States, where I think, very soon, we're getting to the point of kind of lapping ourselves in terms of managed care rebates because the coverage for the glaucoma product line, principally, LUMIGAN in 2014 is this puts and takes always, but at a high level same coverage as in 2013. The rebate pressures continue. But of course, once you granted the rebates and you come around to 12 months later, if you like, the increase in rebates is reduced and therefore, the drag on sales, because, of course, it's all about gross to net sales decreases. On top of that, in my opening remarks, I made comments about the use of a study showing that when you go from latanoprost generic to LUMIGAN 0.01%, you get about 4 millimeters of mercury pressure reduction, which is really very, very significant. And that data is working and we plan to really emphasize that. And then, finally, in the U.S., a greater emphasis in 2014 on COMBIGAN and ALPHAGAN because there is a very strong position for Allergan in the so-called adjunctive position, i.e. when a prostamide or a prostaglandin alone doesn't provide the results the glaucoma specialist requires. Anything to add, Scott?","Scott M. Whitcup","So on the R&D side, we have really looked to change the paradigm of how glaucoma is treated. We know patients don't like drops chronically, and more importantly, they don't use them and lose vision as a result. So we've been working with our NOVADUR biodegradable implant technology to see can we get sustained relief implants for glaucoma. That program is going very well, we presented some of the data and we believe we can get 4-plus months with a micro implant to control pressure. And so we're working to accelerate that program as a paradigm shift for treatment and to gather the data to show payers and physicians and patients that this is a breakthrough technology. In addition, further back, we're working to get some new chemical entities for glaucoma. As you're quite aware, there haven't been really new products, new chemical entities for glaucoma in quite a while since actually LUMIGAN was approved. So we still have an effort there that we could look at either as a drop or sustained-release technology.","Operator","Our next question is from Liav Abraham of Citi.","Liav Abraham - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","My question is for Scott. Scott, I'd be interested in reports on your strategy with respect to RESTASIS X. Would you be looking for label in this asset that includes both the signs and symptoms of dry eye? And what is your confidence in obtaining positive signs and symptoms data given your experience with RESTASIS over a decade ago? And then, just as a follow-on, I was wondering how recruitment is progressing for AGN-195263, which you're investigating for meibomian gland dysfunction?","Scott M. Whitcup","Okay. So I'll start with RESTASIS X question. So what I said from the beginning is that we wanted a very differentiated product. If you look at what we've posted in clinicaltrials.gov, you can get a sense that this is quite differentiated from RESTASIS drops. We will figure out what the exact label will be based on our Phase II data, I tend to be very data-driven. The goal probably will be sign and symptom. But if we can get a validated single endpoint and increase our chance of approval, just like we did for the initial RESTASIS, which was based on tear production alone, we might do that. The other product that you commented, a different Phase II, it's a topical drug for meibomian gland dysfunction or blepharitis, but could also have a potential use in dry eye. Those data, we'll read out probably end of the year. But my goal is to have 3 to 4 potential compounds that could be used in dry eye in the clinic. And so we'll have a third compound, so you have the 1 you mentioned, RESTASIS X. We have a third one going in the clinic midyear, and then early next year, a fourth NCE that could be used in dry eye. So clearly, this is big business for us. It's a tough area, but we probably know more about clinical trial design than anyone. And the goal will be to have at least 4 novel compounds that could progress to Phase III and to get a drug to supplement topical RESTASIS.","Operator","Our next question is from David Maris of BMO Capital Markets.","David W. Maris - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","A couple of questions. First, if we were to look at the BOTOX and filler sales as a proxy for how the consumer is doing, it would seem that the consumer is back in a strong way. Is there anything that you see in the numbers that, as happy as you are, you're still a little bit concerned about how the U.S. consumer is? Is there concentration of the growth among the high end or is it a broadening base? And if there's anything else that you're seeing globally? And separately, Scott, you mentioned you're going to have an update on DARPin in the second half. Specifically, will this update be a decision on whether or not you're moving into Phase III?","David E. I. Pyott","Okay. I'll take the first part. I think, when you look through the transcript carefully, you can see all the market numbers in facial aesthetics are all very good, both in the U.S., and even in Europe, The markets are surprisingly strong. And of course, in both of them, we're in a very good share position, where, clearly, VOLUMA and overseas, with the additions of VOLIFT and VOLBELLA, we're really growing the market, but we're also gaining share at the same time. In the U.S., I think, we have a little bit more share to lose at the margin in BOTOX, but it's pretty small. And of course, given the good market growth, in fact, sales are just doing just fine in volume, as well as we now have the benefit of the 3% price increase we posted. A lot of emerging markets, there, you see huge growth rates as people move into the middle class. They desire this kind of luxury that exists in the United States or Canada or Europe. So when I look across the consumer, all really good. The one little -- the margin watchout that I called out was in breast aesthetics, where you can see in certain markets in Europe, where, clearly, spending by consumers is constrained, we see some weakness. And in France, for instance, they just put out the VAT quite substantially and that has an effect on the market, as one would expect, that's just economics 101. But I think, overall, your conclusion is the right one, worldwide, with just very, very few little exceptions that I watch carefully, the consumers doing really well and that's good for the growth of our product line. So I'll now pass to Scott.","Scott M. Whitcup","So David, on the DARPin, our goals for the Stage III are really to further define how this product is differentiated from the current anti-VEGF treatments and to learn a little bit more on the safety profile. But as you know, we're making improvements and optimization to our manufacturing, and that new product would be the product we'd be using in Phase III. So I think, the Stage III Phase II data will give us conviction and study design to go into Phase III. I think, it will make the decision, yes, we're moving forward. We may do a small Phase IIB with a new material just to make sure it's well-tolerated and that there are no surprises as we gear up getting all the sites for the Phase III ready, but our goal would be that if we had to do a small safety study for the new material to make everyone feel a bit more comfortable, that it wouldn't delay the start of the Phase III, would be gearing that up. So to your question, yes, I think, that the Stage III data will give us a conviction to move into Phase III. It may not mean that the Phase III starts a week later, we'd get there as quickly as possible, but those data will be the ones that will flip the switch to say, yes, we're moving forward.","Operator","Our next question is from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I had a follow-up on that, Scott. So with respect to the DARPin, could you just characterize what differentiation you're hoping for with the DARPin? And could you just walk us through the evolution of the material? I think, it's been adjusted in manufacturing before, and I thought that you had run this latest leg of Phase IIb with new material, but you also mentioned more new material. So if you could just frame that evolution of the new material and the improvements, and then, I guess, your confidence in having the appropriate final material later this year?","Scott M. Whitcup","Sure. So we'll have the chance to go through the data, the Stage III is really designed to figure out how well this works and how long it lasts. So we still think there's an opportunity for this to work more quickly and to last longer, we'll know that better with the Stage III data. And so we're looking for a meaningful product differentiation from both LUCENTIS and [indiscernible]. On the manufacturing side, it's typical to continuously improve manufacturing. So from the initial studies, we did make some improvements. We saw less inflammation, but our goal is to have near 0 inflammation. And so there are a number of improvements in the manufacturing process that are standard in biologics that we're implementing. The current Stage III is being done with the same material that was done with Stage II. So we won't have the brand new what we think will be both Phase III and commercial product ready until probably end of this year. So that would be ready for us to use in the trials following this -- the data that we'll get from the Stage III. So again, if those data are positive we'd move forward to Phase III with the new material, and as I said, before we may do a smaller study with the new material prior to Phase III, just to make sure that it's well-tolerated as we expect it to be.","Operator","Our next question is from Ronny Gal of Bernstein.","Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just a 1 -- 2-part question. First one is just for clarification. I noticed you're guiding COGS next year for 87%. I mean, it seems [indiscernible] so close to 13%. It seems to be going the wrong way. I mean, BOTOX and RESTASIS are both growing most of the higher margin product. Why should 2014 COGS be higher than 2015 as a percentage? And second, still to Scott. Scott, can you just give us a little bit more depth about on the pipeline for the botulinum toxin, if [indiscernible] you guys have now been talking about the osteoarthritis indication. Can you just give us a little bit of a picture where is BOTOX going if you kind of think 5 years ahead? What should we expect from that product in terms of expansion off an indication, expansion of formulations more importantly?","Jeffrey L. Edwards","So Ronny, on the gross margin question, it's an easy answer, we provide a number that is approximate in nature. Our expectation is that it will be a range. There certainly is the potential for gross profit margins to be better. But certainly, at this point in the year, the best approach, we think, is to provide you with a number and allow you to assume that there is a range around that number.","Scott M. Whitcup","So Ronny, on the BOTOX side, we have a pretty exciting pipeline. Just with new indications for BOTOX, we are moving forward with the Phase IIb for osteoarthritis pain. We'll probably present some of the data from the initial Phase II probably late this year as we finish up the analyses, but we're moving forward with that program. We're starting the Phase II for depression. And then, the premature ejaculation Phase II is in progress. We also will have 2 BOTOX X programs. We're not talking a lot about what they are for competitive reasons. But 1 is in the clinic and the goal for a very novel BOTOX X, that should enter the clinic end of this year, early next year. We also have our collaboration with Medytox, so they have a liquid formulation, we've been meeting with them, the collaboration is going very well. And I'm sure David or myself or Jeff will update you on the development plan as soon as we finalize those plans, but a lot of resources going there. And last but not least, we have our TEM program, the targeted exocytosis modulator for pain. We're currently in a Phase II with higher doses. If that works, that's a very exciting program, not quite BOTOX, it's really a novel platform. But potentially in the neuropathic pain market, it's a large unmet need. And so we're excited about that. So you can see we've got multiple prongs on the BOTOX botulinum toxin side with new indications, 2 BOTOX Xs, our Medytox collaboration and TEM. So a lot is going on.","Operator","Our next question is from Ken Cacciatore of Cowen & Co.","Ken Cacciatore - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","David, you indicated on the RESTASIS generic filers that you needed a few more months with -- you could probably get some more clarity. Just wondering though if you could share with us what your internal experts or even external experts are advising you? You're the boss, I'm sure you ask them, give us your best guess if there's anyone else there. I'm sure there's technical reasons why they have to be conservative. But I'd love to hear what they're sharing with you in terms of thought process that, at this point, you would likely know or not know, if there was anyone else there.","David E. I. Pyott","Well, of course, I'd like to always admit that I'm a fully recovered lawyer. So take that with a grain of salt. Clearly, we understand this is a poker game. And we are pleased that at least the first part of the poker game kind of flushed Actavis out of the jungle so we now know what they've said. And you all need to interpret on your own what that means. I also stated in my remarks earlier that we've received no other notices. That doesn't mean, of course, that we won't receive any others. And you can go through then lots of different permutations. But given the timing, it sort of becomes somewhat more probable that it's probably more and more likely that a next step from a generic filer would be a Paragraph IV. But you can go down certain scenarios where you wouldn't get to that conclusion. So that's why I'm just saying things will get clearer the next couple of months because we're obviously engaging in various legal strategies where others will have to respond. And then, we start seeing, back to the jungle analogy, we see the whites of their eyes, what's really going on. So that's the way we should think about it. And I think, at the very high level, it's clearly there's lots of hurdles here. This is far from a trivial product to genericize. And let's remind you that our submission to the FDA on the draft guidance was in excess of 60 pages. We commented, when you follow the generics division's cookbook, you end up with something very different than RESTASIS, and we filed all that data to our NDA with the review division of FDA. So very complicated. And of course, any normal market, there should be alternatives to RESTASIS one day. And as Scott very ably pointed out, let's hope that at least some of them will be from Allergan in the next 7 to 10 years. So clearly, a great opportunity and we plan to be a major player in this with RESTASIS and follow-on products.","Operator","Our final question comes from Jami Rubin of Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","David, apologies for going at this again on M&A, but it's obviously an important topic. Do you view M&A as a high priority this year or less so given the removal, largely removal of the RESTASIS and LUMIGAN overhangs? And do you see a scenario where you could bring down your SG&A ratio to the low 30s from, what, 37%, 38%?","David E. I. Pyott","Okay. First, on M&A, I've always said that I'm not really ruled by what's going on internally at any given time, 6 months ago, I actually felt relatively confident about LUMIGAN and RESTASIS, and I'm glad that I was right. Things have moved very favorably. But we're always looking. And this doesn't change just because other circumstances with the rest of the business change. We're always working hard on how to deploy our capital efficiently and for targets that make a lot of sense. Going back to SG&A leverage, we've always stated that our target in the midterm is the mid-30s, so I'd reiterate that. And clearly, this is not by cutting. It just means the rate of increase for SG&A is lower than the rate of sales growth. So let me just reiterate, the target hasn't changed.","James M.
