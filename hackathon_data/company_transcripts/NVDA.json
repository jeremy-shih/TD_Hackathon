Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Arnab. This quarter we introduced our new family of Pascal-based GPUs, one of our most successful launches ever. We also benefited from both the winding adoption of deep learning and our expanding engagement with hyperscale datacenters around the world as they apply deep learning to all the services they provide. Revenue continued to accelerate, rising 24% to a record $1.43 billion. We saw strong sequential and year-on-year growth across our four platforms, Gaming, Professional Visualization, Datacenter and Automotive.","Our business model based on driving GPU compute platforms into highly targeted markets is clearly succeeding. The GPU business was up 25% to $1.2 billion from a year ago. The Tegra Processor Business increased 30% to $166 million. In Q2 our four platforms contributed nearly 89% of revenue, up from 85% a year earlier, and 87% in the preceding quarter. They collectively increased 29% year-over-year. Let's begin with our Gaming platform. Gaming revenue increased 18% year-on-year to $781 million, reflecting the success of our latest integration of Pascal-based GPUs. Demand was strong in every geographic region. The Pascal architecture offers a number of amazing technological advances, and enables unprecedented performance and efficiencies for playing sophisticated AAA gaming titles and driving rich immersive VR experiences.","In our most successful launch ever we introduced four major products. They are GeForce GTX 1080, 1070 and 1060 for the enthusiast market, and the TITAN X, the world's fastest consumer GPU for deep learning development, digital content creation and extreme gaming. WIRED magazine called the GTX 1080 an unprecedented piece of electronic precision, one that performs Herculean feats of computational strength. Forbes called GTX 1060, which brings a premium VR experience within reach of many, a fantastic product.","And Hardware Canucks described TITAN X as a technological tour de force with frame rates that are simply mind-boggling. The GTX 1080, 1070, 1060 and TITAN X are now in full production and available to consumers worldwide. VR's potential is on vivid display in a new open source game that we released during the quarter. Available on Steam, NVIDIA VR Funhouse is an open source title created with our GamesWorks SDK. It integrates physical simulation into VR along with amazing graphics and precise haptics that you feel like you're actually out at carnival.","Moving to Professional Visualization, Quadro revenue grew to a record $214 million, up 22% year-on-year and up 13% sequentially. Growth came from the high-end of the market for real-time rendering tools and mobile workstations. The M6000 GPU 24 gig, launched earlier this year, is drawing strong interest from a broad range of customers. Digital Domain, a leading special-effects studio, is using Quadro to accelerate productivity for its work on films and commercials, which requires especially tight turnaround times. Engineering giant AECOM and the Yale School of Architecture are using Quadro to accelerate their design and engineering workflows.","Last month at SIGGRAPH conference, we introduced a series of new products that embed photorealistic and immersive experience into workflows, incorporating Iray and VR. We launched the Pascal-based Quadro P6000, the most advanced workstation GPU, enabling designers to manipulate complex designs up to twice as fast as before. We demonstrated how deep learning is being brought to the realm of the industrial design to create better products faster. And we launched eight new and updated software libraries such as VRWorks 360 video SDK which brings panoramic video to VR.","Moving to datacenter; revenue reached a record $151 million, more than doubling year-on-year and up 6% sequentially. This impressive performance reflects strong growth in supercomputing, hyperscale datacenters and grid virtualization. Interest in deep learning is surging as industries increasingly seek to harness this revolutionary technology. Hyperscale companies remain fast adopters of deep learning, both for training and real-time inference, particularly for natural lingual processing, video and image analysis. Among them are Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, Alibaba and Baidu. Major cloud providers are also offering GPU computing for their customers. Microsoft Azure is now using NVIDIA's GPUs to provide computing and graphics virtualization.","During the quarter we began shipping Tesla P100, the world's most advanced GPU accelerator, based on the Pascal architecture. Designed to accelerate deep learning training, it allows application performance to scale up to eight GPUs using our NVLink interconnect. We also announced a variant of P100 based on PCI Express that makes it suitable for a wide range of accelerated servers. At our GPU Technology Conference in April, we introduced DGX-1, the world's first deep learning supercomputer. Equipped with eight P100s in a single box, it provides deep learning performance that is equivalent to 250 traditional servers. It comes loaded with NVIDIA software and AI application developers.","We are seeing strong interest in DGX-1 from AR researchers and developers across academia, government labs and large enterprises. Two days ago, Jen-Hsun hand-delivered the very first DGX-1 production model to the Open AI Institute. They plan to use this system in part to build autonomous agents like chatbots, cars and robots. Broader deliveries will commence later this quarter. We will be talking more about deep learning later this year at regional versions of our GPU Technology Conference set for eight cities around the world, among them, Beijing, Amsterdam, Tokyo and Seoul, as well as Washington D.C.","Our GRID graphics virtualization business more than doubled in the quarter. Adoption is accelerating across a variety of industries, particularly automotive and AEC, among customers out of this quarter was Statoil, a Norwegian oil and gas company.","Finally in automotive, revenue increased to a record $119 million, up 68% year-over-year and up 5% sequentially, driven by premium infotainment and digital cockpit features in mainstream cars. Our effort to help partners develop self-driving cars continues to accelerate. We have started to ship our DRIVE PX 2 automotive supercomputer to the 80-plus companies using both our hardware and DriveWorks software to develop autonomous driving technologies. We remain on track to ship our autopilot solution based on the DRIVE platform. Beyond our four platforms, our OEM and IP business was $163 million, down 6% year-on-year in line with mainstream PC demand.","Now, turning to the rest of the income statement. We had record GAAP gross margin of 57.9%, while non-GAAP gross margin was 58.1%. These reflect the strength of our GeForce gaming GPUs, the success of our platform approach, and strong demand for deep learning. GAAP operating expenses were $509 million, down 9% from a year earlier. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $448 million, up 6% from a year earlier. This reflects increased hiring in R&D and marketing expenses, partially offset by lower legal fees. GAAP operating income for the second quarter was $317 million, compared to $76 million a year earlier. Non-GAAP operating income was $382 million, up 65%. Non-GAAP operating margins improved 680 basis points from a year ago to 26.8%.","Now, turning to the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. We expect revenue to be $1.68 billion plus or minus 2%. Our GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 57.8% and 58% respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $530 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $465 million. And GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 are both expected to be 21% plus or minus 1%. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website.","We will now open the call for questions. Operator, could you please poll for questions? Thank you. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. First question on the datacenter business. Can you help us understand to what extent is the demand being driven by the deep learning applications, versus the classic computationally intense design applications?","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director","Sure, Mark. Our datacenter business is comprised of three basic markets, as you're alluding to; one is high-performance computing, and one could say that or characterize it as a traditional supercomputing market, and very computationally intensive. Our second market is GRID, which is our datacenter virtualization, basically graphics application virtualization. You could stream and serve any PC or any PC application from datacenter to any client device. And the third application is deep learning, and this is largely our hyperscale datacenters applying deep learning to enhance their applications to make them much smarter, much more delightful. The vast majority of the growth comes from deep learning by far, and the reason for that is because high-performance computing is a relatively stable business, it's still growing business, and I expect the high-performance computing to do quite well over the coming years. GRID is a fast-growing business. I think Colette said that it was growing 100% year over-year, but it's from a much smaller base. And deep learning is not only significant in size, it's also growing quite substantially.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","That's very helpful. Thank you. And then last question. On the new \u2013 so you're just starting to ship Pascal now, and I guess my understanding is that, historically, as you're shipping the new product, the yields have opportunity for improvement and the more volume is shipped, the more you climb down the yield curve. What classically happens here on the yield, and does that positively impact gross margins over the next three or four quarters? Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director","Yeah. So we've talked extensively about the way we prepare for new process nodes over the last several years. For long-term NVIDIA followers, you might have recalled that 40-nanometer was a very challenging node for us. And then with all of these challenges it's an opportunity for us to improve our company, and we've implemented a very rigorous process node preparation methodology, and it starts, of course, with some of the world's best process design engineers, circuit design engineers and process readiness teams. And we have a fantastic group dedicated to just getting process ready for us.","And the second part of it is just how that process readiness is integrated throughout the entire company. And so I'm really proud of the way that the company executed on Pascal. 16-nanometer FinFET is no trivial task, not to mention the speed of the memories that we used. It's the world's first G5X. We also ramped the world's first HBM2 memory and 3D memory stacking. So the number of technological challenges that we overcame in the ramp of Pascal is quite extraordinary. I'm super proud of the team. Now, going forward, we're going to continue to refine yields, and that is absolutely the case. However, we came into 16-nanometer with a great deal of preparedness, and so it's too early to guess what's going to happen to yields and margins long term, but we'll guide one quarter at a time.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Thank you for taking my questions and congrats on a very strong quarter. Your Q3 revenue guide implies further acceleration on a year-over-year basis. Are there one or two end markets where you expect outsized growth, or should we expect growth in the quarter to be broad-based?","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director","Yeah, Toshiya. I appreciate it. We're experiencing growth in all of our businesses. Our strategy of focusing on deep learning, self-driving cars, gaming and virtual reality, these are markets where GPU makes a very significant difference, is really paying off. And I think this quarter is really the first quarter where we saw growth across every single one of our businesses. And my expectation is that we're going to see growth across all of our businesses next quarter as well. But it's driven by the focus on these key markets, and away from traditional commodity components businesses. I think the one particular dynamic sticks out, and it's a very significant growth driver of where we have an extraordinary position in, and it's deep learning. Deep learning, you may have heard, is a new computing approach. It's a new computing model, and requires a new computing architecture. And this is where the parallel approach of GPUs is perfectly suited.","And five years ago, we started to invest in deep learning quite substantially. And we made fundamental changes and enhancements for deep learning across our entire stack of technology, from the GPU architecture to the GPU design to the systems that GPUs connect into; for example NVLink to other system software that has been designed for it, like cuDNN and DIGITS, to all of the deep learning experts that we have now in our company. The last five years, we've quietly invested in deep learning because we believe that the future of deep learning is so impactful to the entire software industry, the entire computer industry that we, if you will, pushed it all in. And now we find ourselves at the epicenter of this very important dynamic, and it is probably \u2013 if there is one particular growth factor that is of great significance, it would be deep learning.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on good growth and the execution. Jen-Hsun, the first question is tied to PC gaming; very strong trends. I was curious if you could quantify how much of your base has upgraded to Pascal, and have you noticed any change in the behavior of gamers in this upgrade cycle, whether it's the price or what part of the stack they are buying now, and how quickly they're refreshing versus what you might have seen in the Kepler and the Maxwell cycles.","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director","Sure. Thanks a lot, Vivek. Let's say, on PC gaming there's a few dynamics. Our installed base represents somewhere around 80 million active GeForce users around the world. And in fact, only about a third has even upgraded to Maxwell, and we only started shipping Pascal half of this last quarter. And so that gives you a sense of how much \u2013 and Pascal is unquestionably the biggest leap we've ever made generationally in GPUs ever. It is not only high-performance; it's also energy-efficient, and it includes some really exciting new graphics technologies for VR and others. And so I think Pascal is going to be enormously successful for us.","And it comes at a time when the PC gaming marketplace is also quite different than the PC gaming market five years ago. One dynamic that's really quite powerful is that the production quality, the production content is much, much higher in video games today than ever. And the reason for that, I'd mentioned several times in previous calls, is that the installed base of capable game platforms that are architecturally compatible, meaning that PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and PCs are essentially architecturally compatible. And so the footprint for developers has grown tremendously over previous generations. I mean, this is a dynamic that's relatively new.","And so as a result, the quality of games go up, which means that the consumption of GPU capability goes up with it. And I think we're absolutely seeing that dynamic. I'm super excited about the fact that the next-generation game console, the big boost, the 2x boost is coming just around the corner. That's going to allow game content providers, game developers to aim even higher. And I think that that's going to support long-term expansion of our gross margins and ASPs of PC gaming. I would say that there's some other dynamics that are quite powerful as well, as you know very well, which is, eSports is no longer just an interest, eSports is a full-force global phenomenon and very, very powerful in Asia, in just about every developing country, and of course the Western world as well.","And I think that on top of that, not only is VR off to a great start, we're seeing some right content now, but some of the things that we introduced recently with Pascal, tapping into this grassroots, but rather global interest in using videogame as an art medium, we introduced project NVIDIA Ansel which is the world's first in-game photography system. It allows you to create virtual reality photographs, and it's just really, really amazing. And so you could use your videogame, capture your amazing moments, share it in VR, or in high-res with all your friends.","So there's a lot of different ways to enjoy games now, and the production value just continues to go up, which is great for our platforms. And so I think just to summarize your initial question, how much of the installed base has upgraded to Pascal; very, very small of course because we just started production ramp, but even then only a third has upgraded to Maxwell, And so there's it's a pretty large, pretty significant upgrade opportunity ahead of us.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin.","Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Jen-Hsun, the first one if I could on the datacenter competitive landscape, early this week we saw one of your datacenter competitors make an acquisition of a smaller private company. And I was wondering if you could talk a bit more about how you view your position in the datacenter market as with respect to machine learning, AI, and also kind of how your products are positioned from a high-end or low-end type of machine learning application performance.","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director","Sure. Thanks. Well, as you can imagine we have a good pulse on the state of the industry. We've been in this industry since the very beginning, and deep learning was really ignited when pioneering researchers around the world discovered the use of GPUs to accelerate deep learning and made it practical, made it even practical to use deep learning as an approach for developing software. The GPU was a perfect match because the nature of the GPU is a sea of small processors, not one big processor, but a whole bunch of small processors.","And vitally, they're connected by this connecting tissue, this connecting tissue inside our processor, connecting memory, connecting fabric, that makes it possible for the processors to communicate with each other all simultaneously. That architectural innovation has been the source of our GPU computing initiative some 10 years ago. That invention has really been groundbreaking. And so the GPU was really quite a perfect match for deep learning, where neural nets are communicating neurons essentially inspired by neurons, communicating with each other all simultaneously. And so the GPU was really quite a perfect match.","If you look at deep learning today, five years later, I think it's a foregone conclusion that deep learning has been infused into just about every single Internet service to make them smarter, more intelligent, more delightful to consumers. And so you could see that the hyperscale adoption of deep learning is not only broad, it's large-scale and it's completely global. And this new computing approach we realized was going to be quite significant long-term. And so five years ago we started making quite significant investments across the entire stack of our company. GPU computing is not just the GPU chip, it's GPU architecture, it's the GPU's design, it's the GPU system, all of the algorithms that run on top of it, all of the tools that run on top of it, the frameworks, our collaborations with researchers all over the world.","And so that collaboration and our investment has improved deep learning on GPUs dramatically in the last two generations. When we started this we were in Kepler. Maxwell was some 10 times better than Kepler, and Pascal is some 10 times better than Maxwell. And so in just two generations, just five years time, we've improved deep learning by an enormous amount. And a GPU today is very unlike a GPU back in the good old days because of all the work that we've done to it. Now our strategy, and this is where we're different, not only to focus on the GPU and the expertise in parallel computing, but where we're really different, I would say, is our singular architecture approach to deep learning. We've essentially put all of our investment behind one architecture. We've made this architecture available from hyperscale, to datacenters, to workstations, to notebooks, to PCs, to cars, to embedded computers, to even a brand-new fully integrated high-performance computer in a box we called DGX, the NVIDIA DGX-1.","And so there's so many different ways to gain access to the NVIDIA architecture, the NVIDIA platform for deep learning. They're just literally all over the place, all around you. It's available to you in retail stores, in e-tail stores, from OEMs, in the cloud, or even in universities all over the world just in embedded computer kits. And so our approach is quite singular and quite focused. My sense is that our lead is quite substantial, and our position is very good. But we're not sitting on our laurels, as you can tell, and for the last five years we've been investing quite significantly. And so over the next several years, I think you're going to continue to see quite significant jumps from us as we continue to advance in this area.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Yes, thank you. I had a question on automotive. You mentioned that DRIVE PX is now shipping to 80 car companies. Jen-Hsun, I'm kind of curious, are the wins here sort of similar in size and focused more on prototyping, or are there opportunities here that could ultimately translate into full production wins and drive the automotive business disproportionately?","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director","Well, I appreciate the question. Yeah, we've just started this quarter shipping DRIVE PX 2. And just before I answer your question, let me tell you what DRIVE PX 2 is. DRIVE PX 2, of course, is a processor. It's the DRIVE PX 2 version with just one single processor, with just Parker, and our Tegra processor, and optionally with discrete GPUs, you could literally build \u2013 you can build a car with autopilot capability, or an AI co-pilot capability, all the way to self-driving car capability. And it is able to do sensor fusion. It's able to do SLAM, which is localization and mapping, detection using deep neural nets of the environment in a surround matter, all of the cameras around the car all feeding into the processor, and the DRIVE PX processor doing real-time inferencing of surround cameras, all the way to the actual planning and driving of the car, all done in this one car computer, this one car AI supercomputer. And so this quarter we started shipping them to all of our partners and developers so that they can start developing their software and their systems around our computer and on top of our software stack.","We have the intentions of shipping in volume production many of these, and it's hard to know exactly what everybody's schedule is, but it ranges everything from very soon to the next couple of years. Developing a self-driving car is no \u2013 it's a fairly significant undertaking, and so nobody does it for fun, surely. And the question is, maybe if I could frame the question just slightly differently, do I expect people to be building OEM cars, or do we expect them to be building shuttles that are maybe geofenced, do we expect them to be building trucks, and you know how many trucks are on the road and how much of the world's economy is built around trucking products all over the world, to services of basically taxi as a service. The answer is that we're working with customers and partners across that entire range from cars that are sold to trucks, to vans, to shuttles, to services.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. The first is just a follow up on some of the Gaming strength in the quarter. With the company launching the Founders Edition availability of Gaming products in the quarter, can you talk about how that went, and for those products how gross margins compare to just chip bait chip bait sales that would go into a gaming card OEM?","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director","Well, first of all Founders Edition, I appreciate you asking that. Founders Edition is engineered by NVIDIA, completely built by NVIDIA, and sold directly by NVIDIA and supported by NVIDIA. Now, there are some people that \u2013 some gamers and customers who would prefer to have a direct relationship with our company. Its availability is limited, and it's engineered just at the highest possible level of quality. And we limit the production of it. And the reason for that is because we have a network of partners who are much, much more able to take the NVIDIA architecture to every corner of the world, literally overnight. We have a fair number of partners who blanket every single country on the planet as we know.","And they can provide them in different sizes and shapes, and styles, and different thermal solutions, and different configurations, and different price points. And so I think, we believe that, that diversity is one of the reasons why the NVIDIA GeForce platform is so popular. And it creates a lot of excitement in the marketplace, and a lot of interesting, different diversified designs. And so I think those two strategies are harmonious with each other. But the key point is, we built the Founders Edition really as a way for some customers to be able to purchase directly and have a relationship directly with us. But largely, our strategy is to go to the market with a network of partners. As for gross margins, they are marginally the same.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay.","Matthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you. Jen-Hsun, I wanted to ask a couple of questions again on the datacenter business. The first being, we've done a little bit of work trying to estimate in our team what the long-term server attach rate for accelerators in general could be, and for GPUs within that. So it'd be really interesting to hear your perspectives on that. And then secondly, is there a market there for an APU-type product in the datacenter? I know you guys have Project Denver and some other things going on from the CPU perspective. But is there a deep learning integrated CPU\/GPU play that might open up more TAM long term for your company that you guys are considering pursuing? Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director","Sure. Yeah. First of all, the type of workloads in the datacenter is really changed. Back in the good old days, it largely ran database searches but that has changed so much. It's no longer just about text, it's no longer just about data. The vast majority of what's going through the Internet and what's going through datacenters today, as you guys know very well, are images, there are voice, there an increasingly and probably one of the most important new data formats is live video. Live video, if you think about it for just a moment, it's live video, so it doesn't stay in the server, and it doesn't get recorded, which means that if you want to enjoy that live video, there needs to be a fair amount of artificial intelligence capability in the datacenter that's running real time on their live video, so that the person that might be interested in the video stream that you're streaming knows who to alert, and who to invite to come and watch the live video.","And so if you think about datacenter traffic going forward, my sense is that the workload is going to continue to be increasingly high throughput, increasingly high multimedia content, and increasingly, of course, powered by AI and powered by deep learning. And so I think that's number one. The second is that the architecture of the datacenter is recognizably, understandably changing because the workload is changing. Deep learning is a very different workload than the workload of the past. And so the architecture, it's a new computing model, it recognized it needs a new computing architecture, and accelerators like GPUs are really, well, a good fit.","And so now the question is, how much. It's hard to say, it's hard to say how much, but my sense is that it's going to be a lot, and without any predictions it's going to be a lot more than we currently ship. And so I think the growth opportunity for deep learning is quite significant. I think every hyperscale datacenter will be GPU accelerated. They will be GPU accelerated for training, they will be GPU accelerated for inferencing, there may be other approaches, but I think using GPUs is going to be a very large part of that.","And then lastly, APUs. I guess for datacenters, I guess my sense is for datacenters, energy efficiency is such a vital part. And although the workload is increasingly AI, and increasingly live video and multimedia where GPUs can add a lot of value, there's still a lot of workload that is GPU-centric, and you still want to have an extraordinary CPU. And I don't think anybody would argue that Intel makes the world's best CPUs. It's not even close, there's not even a close second. And so I think the artfulness of, and the craftsmanship of Intel CPUs is pretty hard to deny. And for most datacenters, I think if you have CPU workloads anyways, I think Intel Xeons are hard to beat. And so that's my opinion, anyways.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ian Ing.","Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC","Yes. Thank you. So earlier you talked about taping out all the Pascal products at this point. I mean, are you \u2013 with three products on the market, are you ceding the sub-$250 price point for cards to competition, or is this something you can serve with older Maxwell product or some upcoming product? Thanks.","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director","Yeah, thanks a lot, Ian. We have taped out, we have verified, we have ramped, every Pascal GPU. That's right. However, we have not introduced everyone.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie.","J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thanks a lot for the question. I just wanted to follow up a little bit on virtual reality. You guys have talked a little bit about investments there, and I was just curious what sort of reception you're getting at this point, and what's going to be in your mind the biggest driver getting that going, is it more headsets or more developers working on that? Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director","Yeah, Steve, I think it's all of that. We have to continue to keep pushing VR, and get the head mounts out to the world. I think HTC Vive, they're doing a great job, Oculus of course are doing a great job. And so I think we track very carefully all of the head mounts that are going out there, and it's growing all the time. Second, the content is really cool, and people are really enjoying it, and so we just got to get more content, and developers all over the world are jumping on to VR. It really is a great new experience. But it's not just games as you know. One of the areas where we have a lot of success, and we see a lot of excitement is in enterprise and in industrial design, in medicines, medical imaging, in architectural engineering. We use it ourselves. We're doing a fair amount of design of our workspace, and we render everything using our photorealistic renderer called Iray, fully accelerated by our GPUs, and then we render it into VR, and we enjoy it completely in VR.","And it's something else to be inside an environment that's photorealistically rendered and completely enjoying in VR. So architectural engineering and construction is going to benefit from that. So we see a lot of broad-based adoption of VR. Now, one of the things that we did, which was really spectacular, is the multi-resolution, multi-projection rendering of Pascal. It's the world's first GPU architecture that has the ability to render into multiple projections simultaneously instead of just one. And the reason for that is because the GPU back in the good old days was designed for displaying into one display. You have one keyboard, you have one display. But that mode of computer graphics has really changed as we moved into the world of virtual reality and all kinds of interesting different display configurations and display types. And so multi-projection was a revolutionary approach to graphics and Pascal introduced it and you really benefit it in VR.","The second thing that we did was we integrated real world physics simulation into VR. The benefit is that without the laws of physics, as you know, you can't feel anything. Things don't collide, things don't bounce. When you pick up something, you don't feel the haptics of it. We have made the entire environment physically simulated, and so as a result, you feel the entire environment. When you tip a bottle of water over, it behaves like a bottle of water tipped over, and balls behave the way balls behave, and things don't merge into each other. So that integration with haptics is going to completely revolutionize VR, we believe, and that physics simulation is another thing. And so I think our position in VR is really quite great, and I'm certainly enthusiastic about the development of VR.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh.","Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thanks. Just on the datacenter side, Jen-Hsun you mentioned three key segments, HPC, GRID and deep learning. What percent of mix are those for the datacenter?","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director","I would say, it's about half deep learning at the moment, and probably call it 35%, a third is high-performance computing, maybe more than that, and the rest of it is virtualization. And going forward, which is part of your question, my sense is that deep learning would become a very significant part of that. The other thing to realize is that deep learning is not just for Internet service providers for voice recognition, and image recognition, and face recognition and such. Deep learning is a way of using mathematics, using software to discover insight in a huge amount of data. And the one place where we regenerate a huge amount of data is high-performance computing.","Every single supercomputing center in the world is going to move towards deep learning. And the reason for that is because they generate a huge amount of data that they really have very little ability to comb through, to sort through, and now with deep learning they can discover really, really subtle insights in data that's hyper-dimensional. And so the way to think about deep learning is really mathematics. It's a new form of mathematics that is very, very powerful. It's a new approach to software, but don't think of it as a market. I think every market is going to be a deep learning market. I think every application is going to be deep learning application, and I think software, every piece of software will be infused by AI for long-term.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good afternoon, and solid job on the quarterly execution. You guys had really good growth in Professional Visualization and record revenues. I would've thought that most of the growth was being driven by the upcoming release of the Pascal-based P5000 and P6000 family. So I was sort of pleasantly surprised that most of the demand was driven by your current generation M6000 family, which means obviously that the Pascal demand cycle is kind of still ahead of you. Number one, is that a fair view? And then what's driving the strong adoption of M6000? And if you haven't already released it, when do you expect to launch the Pascal-based P5000 and P6000 family? Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director","Yeah. Thanks, Harlan. I appreciate the question. The team has been working really hard over the years to really change the way that computer-aided design is done. Your observation is absolutely right, and it's coming from several different places. First of all, more and more design is really about product design, industrial design, where the feeling of the product, the aesthetics of the product is just as important as the mechanical design of the product. And whether you're talking about a building, or just a consumer product, or a car, we need to be able to simulate the aesthetics of it in a photorealistic way using real material simulations.","The computational load necessary to do that is just really quite extraordinary. And we're now seeing one design package after another, whether it's Dassault's leading packages, SolidWorks leading packages, Autodesk, Adobe, the amount of GPU use has really, really increased, and it's increasing quite dramatically. I think partly because finally, for all of the ISVs, for all the developers, not only is the market demand for earlier views of photorealistic designs an important decision criteria, they can also rely on the fact that great GPUs are available in just about every computer. And so the pervasiveness of GPUs allows them to take advantage of the GPUs and to really trust that the software capabilities that they've put into their packages, if they rely on GPUs, will have the benefits of GPUs there.","And so I think that, that virtuous cycle you're starting to see in design. And so the investment that we made in the photorealistic rendering several years ago, the GPU acceleration of optics, this layer for path-tracing that is used by just about every software package in the world, our continued evangelism of GPUs and its general purpose use from computer graphics all the way to imaging, is something that I think is starting to see benefits. That's number one. Number two, Maxwell was the most energy-efficient GPU ever made until Pascal. Maxwell was twice the energy efficiency of Kepler. And the amazing thing is that Pascal is twice the energy efficiency of Maxwell.","But Maxwell made it possible for thin and light designs and laptops, and more elegant workstations, and the ability to put more horsepower, more capability into any workstation because of power concerns. Maxwell made it possible for the entire industry to uplift the level of GPU that it uses. And I think that going forward, your last question is, going forward, how do we see Pascal? Pascal is in the process of ramping into workstations all over the world, and so I think in the coming quarters we're going to expect to see Pascal out there.","And my expectation is that the dynamics I just described, which is software developers using more photorealistic capabilities, our invention of GPU-accelerated photorendering, Iray and OptiX, and MDL, Material Description Language, and then lastly the energy efficiency of GPUs, those three factors combined is going to be really healthy for workstations. And then last, VR. VR is coming, and in order to really enjoy the type of applications for design, you're going to need a pretty powerful GPU to support it.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore.","Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Couple for you, Jen-Hsun, on the automotive side. I guess the first part would be, we've seen in the recent months some partnerships being formed with some of your competitors, and some of your customers and we've seen some of those partnerships actually dissolve. So I wondered, how does NVIDIA play in this general ecosystem in forming partnerships or not. And then the second part, if we put even just a rough year on it, when would you think the autonomous driving part of your automotive business would actually exceed the infotainment size of your automotive business? Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director","Yeah. Thanks a lot, Ross. Well, we play in a graceful, friendly and open way, and I mean that, I guess, rather seriously. We believe this, we believe that building a autonomous driving car, a self driving car is a pile of software, and it's really complicated software. It's really, really complicated software. And it's not like one company is going to do it. And it's also not logical that large, great companies who are refining their algorithms and the capabilities of their self-driving cars over the course of the next two decades can outsource to someone the self-driving car stack. We've always felt that self-driving cars is a software problem and that large companies need to be able to own their own destiny. And that's the reason why DRIVE PX 2 is an OpenStack, and it's an open platform, so that every car company can build their self-driving car on top of it, number one.","Number two. The DRIVE PX 2 architecture is scalable, and the reason for that is because automatic braking and autopilot on an highway, and a virtual co-pilot and a completely autonomous self-driving car, a self-driving truck, a geofenced autonomous shuttle, a completely autonomous taxi, all of these platforms cannot be solved by one chip. It's just not even logical. The computation necessary to do it is so diverse. And the more digits of accuracy or the more digits of precision towards safety that you would like to have in dealing with all of the unexpected circumstances, the more nines you would like to have, if you will, the more computation you have to do. Just as voice recognition, the amount of computation necessary for voice recognition over the last just four years or five years has increased by a 100 times, but notice how precise and how accurate voice recognition has become. And image recognition, circumstance recognition, context recognition, all of that is going to require just an enormous amount of computation. And so we believe that scalable platforms is necessary. Number two.","And then number three, detection. Computer vision and detection, object detection, is just one tiny sliver of the entire autonomous driving problem. It's just one tiny sliver. And we've always said that autonomous vehicles, self-driving cars, is really an AI computing problem. It's a computing problem because the processors needs not just detection but also computation. The CPU matters, the GPU matters, the entire system architecture matters. And so the entire computation engine matters. Number two, computing is not just a chip problem, it's largely a software problem. And the body of software necessary for the entire system software stack, if you would, the operating system of a self-driving real-time supercomputer doesn't exist.","Most supercomputers are best-effort supercomputers. They run a job as fast as they can until they're done. But that's not good enough for a self-driving car. This supercomputer has to run in real time and it has to react the moment it sees that there is danger in the way, and best effort doesn't cut it. You need it to be a real-time supercomputer, and the world's never built a real-time supercomputer before. And that's what DRIVE PX 2 is all about, a real-time supercomputer for surround autonomous AI. And so that's the focus that we have, that's the direction that we've taken, and I think what you're seeing is that the market is trying to react to that. But maybe as they go further and further into autonomous driving that they're discovering, that the problems are related to the type of problems that we're seeing, and that's the reason why DRIVE PX is a computer, not a smart camera.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore.","Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you so much. You talked about deep learning in the hyperscale environment, but it seems like you're getting some traction as well in the enterprise environment. I know at least one IT department we've talked to has been doing some implementation. Can you talk a little bit about your progress there, and what does it take for you to sort of build that presence within more traditional enterprises?","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director","Well, as you know, deep learning is not just an Internet service approach. Deep learning is really machine learning supercharged, and deep learning is really about discovering insight in big data, in big unstructured data, in multi-dimensional data. And that's what deep learning \u2013 that's the \u2013 I've called it, it's Thor's hammer that fell from the sky, and it's amazing technology that these researchers discovered. And we were incredibly, incredibly well prepared because GPUs is naturally parallel, and we put us in a position to really be able to contribute to this new computing revolution. But when you think about it in the context that it's just \u2013 it's software development, it's a new method of doing software and it's a new way of discovering insight from data. What company wouldn't need it?","So every life sciences company needs it, every healthcare company needs it, every energy discovery company needs it, every e-tail, retail company needs it. Everybody has lots of data, everybody has lots and lots of data that they own themselves. Every manufacturing company needs it, every company that cares about security, every company that deals with the massive amount of customer data has the benefit of \u2013 can benefit from deep learning. So when you frame it in that context, I think I would say that deep learning's market opportunity is even greater in enterprises than it is in consumer Internet services. And that's exactly the reason why we built the NVIDIA DGX-1 because most of these enterprises don't have the expertise, or simply don't have the willpower to want to build a supercomputing datacenter or high-performance computer. They would just rather buy an appliance, if you will, with all of the software integrated and the performance incredibly well tuned, and it comes out of a box. And that's essentially what NVIDIA DGX-1 is. It's a supercomputer in a box, and it's designed and tuned for high performance computing for deep learning.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Thank you very much for squeezing me in. I had a question, just one question on gross margin Jen-Hsun. Very big top line guidance, but yet gross margin is guided to flat. What is the reason? And I understand it's not always perfectly correlated, margin should be going up that much, but is it pricing, is it yield, because the mix also seems to be moving in the right direction, more ProVis, more HPC and less of the OEM business.","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director","Well, our guidance is our best estimate, and we'll know how everything turns out next quarter when we talk again. But at some high level, I would agree with you that as we move further and further, and more and more into our platform approach of business, where our platform is specialized and rich with software, that increasingly the value of the product that we bring has extraordinary enterprise value, that the benefits of using it is not just measured in frames per second, but real TCO for companies and real cost savings as they reduce the number of server clusters, and real increases and real boosts in their productivity. And so I think there's every reason to believe that long-term this platform approach can derive a greater value. But as for the next quarter, I think let's just wait and see how it goes.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Rajvindra Gill.","Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director","Rajvindra, how are you?","Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC","Sir, exactly. Good. A question, Jen-Hsun, on the DRIVE PX 2, so my understanding as you described it, it's one scalable architecture from the cockpit to ADAS, to mapping, to autonomous driving. But I'm curious to see how that kind of compares to the approach that some of your competitors are taking with respect to providing, I guess, different solutions for different levels of the ADAS systems, whether it's level 1, level 2, level 3, specifically with the V2X communication where for level 4 autonomous driving you're going to need six to 20 different radar units, three to six different cameras, LiDAR. I'm just trying to square how your approach is different from some of your competitors in the semiconductor space.","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director","Yeah. Good question. There's no way to square and there's no reason to square, and you're not going to find one answer. And the reason why you're not going to find one answer is because nobody knows exactly how to get it done. We all have intuitions and we all have beliefs about how we're going to be able to ultimately solve the long-term, fully autonomous vehicle, that wherever I am, the car I step into, the automobile we step into is completely autonomous, and it has AI inside and out. And it's just an incredible experience. But we're not there yet. And all of these companies have slightly \u2013 not all but many companies have slightly different visions of the future. Some people believe that the path to the future is fully autonomous right away in a geofenced area that has been fully mapped in advance.","Some people believe that you can use it just for highway autopilot as a first starting point, and work quickly towards fully autonomy. Some people believe that the best way to do that is through shuttles and trucks. So you see a lot of different visions out there. And I think all of those visions are coming from smart people doing smart things, and they're targeting different aspects of transportation. I think there's a fallacy that transportation in every single country, in every single form is exactly the same. It just doesn't work that way. And so there's technology insight and then there's market insight, and there's a technology vision versus your entry point. And I think that's where all of the squaring doesn't happen. And so you're solving for problems that \u2013 you're solving for a simple equation that won't happen.","However, there's one thing that we believe absolutely will happen. We are absolutely certain that AI is going to be involved in this endeavor, that finally with deep learning and finally with AI that we believe we have the secret sauce necessary to break these puzzles, and to solve these puzzles over the period of time; number one. Number two, we believe unquestionably that depending on the problem you want to solve, you need a different amount of computational capability. We believe unambiguously this is a software problem, and that for the largest of transportation companies, they need to own their own \u2013 they're going to need \u2013 own their own software in collaboration with you, but they're not going to let you do it and keep it as a black box.","We believe unambiguously that this is a computing problem, that this is a real-time supercomputing problem; that it's not just about a special widget, but computation is necessary. Processors, a computer system, system software, enormous amount of operating system capability, is necessary to build something like this. It is a massive software problem. Otherwise, we would have done it already. And so I think that you're going to see this year the beginnings of a lot of those, of some very visionary and really quite exciting introductions. But in the next year and the year after that, I think you're going to see more and more and more. I think this is the beginning, and we're working with some really, really amazing people to get this done.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Mitch Steves.","Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. Thanks for taking my question, guys. So just kind of circling back to the datacenter piece and the deep learning aspect. Is there a change in ASPs you guys are seeing when you enter that market?","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director","No.","Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC","So essentially, there's going to be no margin change from the datacenter sales, and I guess the same question in automotive as well.","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director","Automotive ASPs for self-driving cars will be much higher than infotainment. It's a much tougher problem. Every car in the world has infotainment. With the exception of some pioneering work or early \u2013 the best, the most leading-edge cars today, almost no cars are self-driving. And so I think that the technology necessary for self-driving cars is much, much more complicated than lane keeping, or adaptive cruise control, or first-generation and second-generation ADAS. The problem is much, much more complicated.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Alger.","Brian Alger - ROTH Capital Partners LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. I think this will be the first congrats actually on a pretty darn good quarter and amazing guidance. I want to come back to the difference of Pascal versus what would be otherwise competition from either Intel or AMD. There's been a fair amount of documentation talking about the power requirements or the power draw differences between Pascal versus Polaris. And one would think that while that's important in gaming, and it's gotten a lot of notice, it would actually be more important for these deep learning applications that we've been talking so much about over the past half hour or 45 minutes. Can you maybe talk to that side of the design, not so much the horsepower, but maybe the power efficiency of it, and what that means for when you scale it up into really big problems?","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director","Yeah, Brian. Thank you very much. First of all, I appreciate the comment. The team worked really, really hard, and over the last several years \u2013 the last five years, all of the employees of NVIDIA have been pursuing a strategy that took until today really to show people that it really pays off. And it's a very unique business model. It's a very unique approach, but I just want to congratulate all the employees that have worked so hard to get us here.","I appreciate the comment also about energy efficiency. In fact, energy efficiency is the single most important feature of processors today and going forward. And the reason for that is because every single environment that we're in is power-constrained; every single environment. Even your PC with 750 watts or 1,000 watts is power-constrained, because we can surely put more GPUs in there than 1000 watts. And so that's power-constrained.","We're in environments where we only have one or two watts. It might be a drone. And we need to be \u2013 we're completely power-constrained so energy efficiency is really important. We might be in a datacenter where we're doing deep learning and we're training neural nets or we're inferencing neural nets. And in this particular case, although the datacenter has a lot of power to provision, the number of GPUs that they want to use in it is measured in tens, tens and tens of thousands. And so energy efficiency becomes the predominant issue. Energy efficiency literally is the most important feature of the processor.","Now, from there, their functionality and architectural features. The architectural changes that we've made in Pascal so that we could stay ahead of the deep learning research work and the deep learning progress was groundbreaking. And people were starting to discover the architectural changes that we put into Pascal, and it's going to make a huge difference in the next several years of deep learning, and so that's a feature in architectural innovation.","And then lastly of course, there's all of the software that goes on top of processor (01:12:03); we call it GPU computing instead of just GPUs because GPU computing is about computing. It's about software. It's about systems. It's about the interrelationship of our GPU with the memories and all the memories around the system and the networking and the interconnect and storage, and it's a large-scale computing problem. It is also the highest throughput computing problem on the planet, which is the reason why we've been called upon by our nation to build the world's next two fastest supercomputers. High-throughput computing is our company's expertise. High-throughput computing, from fundamental architecture to chip design to system design to system software to algorithms to computational mathematics, and all the experts in all the various fields of science, that is the great investment that we made in the last five years and I think the results are really starting to show.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in here, and great execution on the quarter. Two related questions. One, I just \u2013 Colette, I was just curious, your view on the return \u2013 use of capital and buybacks obviously an accelerated one, only $9 million in the last quarter. What's your view going forward? And then Jen-Hsun, maybe a bigger question in terms of use of capital, whether you could talk about \u2013 you said CPU is not an area that you would want to go into, but obviously GPUs have legs. I was just curious if you have to look around at other areas, maybe in the datacenter where you could also add value?","Colette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, thanks. Thanks, Blayne. The return of capital continues to be an important part of our shareholder value message, but remember, it is still two parts of it. Part of it is still dividends and part of it has been our purchasing of stock. So as we continue to go forward, the dividend is definitely a long-term perspective and we'll make sure that we can watch the dividend yield there to stay competitive and also looking at our profitability. Our share repurchase, we'll look at the opportunistic time for those repurchases and making sure that we're also doing that carefully as well.","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director","And long-term use of capital, I would say this that, you know what NVIDIA is really rich with is we're rich with vision and creativity and the courage to innovate and that's one of the reasons why we start almost every conversation with anything by gathering our great people around the company and seeing what kind of future we can invent for ourselves and for the world. And so I think our use of capital is nurturing the employees that we have and providing them a platform to innovate and create new conditions by which they can be successful and do their life's work. And so that's philosophically where we start. We're not allergic to acquisitions and purchases and we look all the time and we have the benefit of working with and partnering with companies, large and small, all over the world as we move the industry forward. And so we're surely open to that, but our natural posture is always to invest in our people and invest in our own company's ability to invent the future.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse.","C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI","Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for squeezing me in. I guess two quick questions. The first one, thank you for breaking out deep learning as a percentage of the datacenter. Can you provide what that percentage was for the April quarter? And then the follow-up question is, I look back over the last four quarters and I look at your implied guide, you're looking at roughly 50% incremental operating margin. I'm curious if that's the right kind of number you would underwrite here? Or should we be thinking about improving mix as well as maturing process and manufacturing at your foundry partners such that that could actually be higher as we look ahead? Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director","Deep learning is a software approach, a new computing architecture, a new computing approach that the industry, that researchers have been developing for 20 years. And it was only until five years ago when pioneering work was on deep learning on GPUs that really turbocharged it and gave the industry, if you will, a time machine that brought the future to the present. And the power of deep learning is so great that this capability is expanding and people are discovering more ways to use it and more applications, and new deep learning architectures. And the networks are getting bigger and deeper and more complicated. And so, I think that this area is going to grow quite significantly. It represents a vast majority of our datacenter revenues recently and my sense is that it's going to continue to be a significant part of it.","And so \u2013 what was the second question? Did I miss it? I think that his question was really about datacenters and deep learning, right?","Colette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think your question was regarding deep learning and the percentage of datacenter and how that has moved?","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director","Yeah. And it's vast majority. Roughly its vast majority.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy.","Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks for taking my question. Maybe I go to the other end of the spectrum and speaking of energy efficiency, are you finding new opportunities for Tegra aside from the infotainment in automotive?","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director","Kevin, I appreciate the question. Tegra is at the core of all of our self-driving car initiatives. And so without Tegra, there would be no self-driving cars. And so Tegra is the core of our self-driving car initiative. It is the computing platform for self-driving cars and DRIVE PX 2 includes Tegra as well as discrete GPUs of Pascal, but the core of it, the vast majority of the heavy lifting is done by Tegra and we expect that going forward. And so Tegra is incredibly important to us.","Tegra is also the core of the processor of Jetson. Jetson is a platform that is designed for other embedded autonomous and intelligent machines and so you can imagine what kind of intelligent machines in the future would benefit from deep learning and AI, but robots and drones and embedded applications and embedded applications inside buildings and cities, there're all kinds of applications. I'm very, very optimistic about the future of Jetson, but at the core of that is also Tegra. And so think of Tegra as our computer on a chip and it's our AI computer on a chip.","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director","Okay. May I? I appreciate all the questions. Thank you all for joining us today. Our growth is really driven by several factors. Our focus on deep learning, self-driving cars, Gaming and VR, markets where GPU has been vital is really starting to pay off. The second factor is that Pascal is the most advanced GPU ever created and we're incredibly excited about it and this last quarter we ramped it with enormous success and I'm so proud of the team for all of the preparation and the executions last quarter. And the third is hyperscale adoption of deep learning is now widespread, is large-scale and we're seeing it globally. Those are several growth drivers ahead of us.","As we go forward, we're also looking to sharing our many developments in deep learning AI with you. We're really just in the beginning of seeing the actual growth of deep learning as we scale out into the market. Deep learning adoption is now widespread and is ramping at every hyperscale datacenter. It's a new computing model. It requires a new computing architecture, one that GPU is perfectly suited for, and the thing that we've done that I'm really delighted with is the strategy that started five years ago to optimize our GPU computing platform from end-to-end and optimize it for deep learning at the processor level, at the architecture level, at the chip design level, systems and software and algorithms and a richness of deep learning experts at the company and the collaboration that we have all over the world with researchers and developers has made it possible for us to continue to advance this field in this platform.","And as a result of that, our deep learning platform has improved far more than anybody would've expected. If you just projected it based on semiconductor physics, it would be nowhere near the level of speed up and step up that we got from generation to generation, from Kepler to Maxwell we got 10X, from Maxwell to Pascal we got another 10X and you can surely expect pretty substantial improvements and increases from us over the next several years.","Where we really shine is not only as a fantastic platform for deep learning and the training of the networks but it's also a fantastic platform to scale out. You can enjoy our platform whether it's in cloud or in datacenter or in supercomputers and workstations and desk site PCs and notebook computers to cars to embedded computers, as I mentioned just now with Jetson. This is a one singular architecture approach. So the thoughtfulness and the care of the investment of the developers and the software programmers and researchers is really our preeminent concern. And as we know, computing is about architecture and computing is about platform and mostly computing is about developers. And we've been quite thoughtful about the importance it is to developers. And as a result, developers all over the world, all over the industry can use the singular architecture and get the benefits of their science and their applications as they scale and deploy their work. So that's it. We had a great quarter and I look forward to reporting our progress next quarter. Thank you all for joining us.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO Commentary, which is posted on our website.","With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.","Colette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Arnab. Revenue reached a record in the fourth quarter totaling $1.4 billion, up 12% from a year earlier, up 7% sequentially, and above our outlook of $1.3 billion. Our full year revenue crossed above $5 billion to a record $5.01 billion, which was up 7% from the previous year. Quarterly growth was broad-based with expansion across each of our four market platforms: gaming, professional visualization, datacenter and automotive.","Pacing games were our GTX gaming platform, our datacenter platform powered by deep learning, growing adoption and automotive. Viewed from a reporting segment perspective, Q4 GPU revenue grew 10% to $1.18 billion from an year earlier. Tegra processor revenue was up 40% to $157 million.","NVIDIA's strategy remains sharply focused on creating platforms for our key markets. Our progress stemmed from our success in creating strong products that are targeted at growth markets. In Q4, our four market platforms contributed more than 85% of revenue, up from 78% a year earlier. Our growth platforms collectively increased 23% year-over-year.","First, let's start with our gaming platform. Gaming revenue rose 25% year-on-year to $810 million, with good momentum carrying forward from the previous quarter. Maxwell-based GeForce GTX processers continue to lead our gaming growth, combined with growing anticipation for VR and the launch of holiday blockbuster games.","The GeForce GTX 970 GPU stands as the world's most popular graphics card on the Steam gaming platform, and we continue to get strong traction with our GeForce GTX GPUs that power gaming notebooks. That includes the recently launched GTX 980 for notebooks, which has enabled a new category, enthusiast-class, VR-capable gaming notebooks.","Excitement is growing around VR gaming, a key theme of last month's Consumer Electronics Show. We unveiled there our GeForce GTX VR-ready program to help gamers choose the best hardware for an immersive VR experience; and Oculus, which is now opened pre-orders for the Rift headsets, has exclusively certified GeForce GTX systems as being ready for VR.","GeForce sales are driven by the launch of great gaming titles, and that again proved true this past holiday season. Fallout 4 was among the standout, recording more than $750 million in sales in its first 24 hours. Other major hits were Star Wars: Battlefront, Call of Duty: Black Ops 3, and Rainbow Six. We remain pleased with the continued success of GeForce experience, our gaming platform that automatically optimizes your PC settings for each game and downloads the greatest game-ready drivers. At the end of January, just two-and-a-half years after its introduction, GeForce Experience subscribers stood at 76 million, up 37% on the year.","Moving to professional visualization, Quadro revenue increased 7% both sequentially and year-over-year to $203 million. The refresh cycle of workstations continued to improve during the quarter, driven in part by new workstation configurations in the market.","While VR is often portrayed as a consumer play, we're also excited by its potential in enterprise, particularly in areas such as medicine, architecture, education and product design. Audi now has 20 virtual showrooms, with several hundred expected later this year, that let customers experience new models, customizing them real-time and take them for a virtual spin.","In a very different application, a start-up called Surgical Theater uses flight simulator technology and multiple GPUs to allow surgeons to use VR to fly through a patient's anatomy and rehearse complicated procedures before making the first cut.","In datacenter, inclusive of Tesla and GRID, revenue rose 18% sequentially to a record $97 million, up 10% year-on-year. This reflects the extraordinary rise of deep learning, a field in which we're now engaged with nearly 3,500 companies and organizations, as well as growth in the number of high-performance computing applications that are GPU-accelerated.","During the quarter, we launched key products for this market; and a number of the partners provided updates to their own work in this area that underscores the central role of the accelerated GPU platform.","A key development came during November's Supercomputing 2015 Conference with the release of the latest list of the world's top 500 fastest supercomputers. It showed that more than 100 of these systems are now using accelerators. Two-thirds of these use NVIDIA accelerators, up 50% on the year.","For hyperscale datacenters, we announced a platform that lets web services companies accelerate machine learning. It consists of both the NVIDIA Tesla M40, the most powerful accelerator designed for training deep neural networks; and the NVIDIA Tesla M4, a low-power, small form-factor accelerator for machine learning inference.","Web services companies have enthusiastically embraced this trend. Shortly after our hyperscale announcement, Facebook disclosed that it will use the Tesla M40 to power its next-generation computing system for machine learning applications. And earlier this month, AliCloud, Alibaba's cloud computing business, announced it will work with us to promote China's first GPU-accelerated, cloud-based, high-performance computing platform. They joined other web services giants embracing GPUs for machine learning.","During the quarter, Google outsourced its TensorFlow deep learning framework, which can be accelerated on GPUs. Microsoft Computational Network Toolkit was integrated with Azure's GPU Lab, enabling neural nets for speech recognition that are up to 10x faster than their predecessors. And IBM revealed that its Watson systems are now using GPUs.","Progress continues to be made in our GRID virtualization platform, which enables companies to deliver graphics-rich applications to employees on any device anywhere. More than 100 companies are participating in an accelerated deployment program.","Turning to automotive. Automotive revenue was a record $93 million, up 18% sequentially and up 68% year-over-year. One of the biggest stories at CES was the introduction of our NVIDIA DRIVE PX 2 self-driving car platform, which utilizes artificial intelligence to address the profoundly complex challenge of autonomous driving.","As many of you saw, DRIVE PX 2 is a supercomputing platform the size of a lunch box that processes 24 trillion deep learning operations a second and delivers 8 teraflops of processing power, equivalent to that of 150 MacBook Pros. It is a flexible platform that automotive developers can scale from one to four processors, and it can utilize passive cooling or integrate seamlessly with the water cooling systems of self-driving EVs.","Capable of fusing data from cameras, lidar, radar and ultrasonic sensors, it creates a full 360-degree understanding of what is happening around the vehicle. It localizes the vehicle on an HD map and it determines a safe path forward for using deep learning techniques.","Volvo, well-known for its safety and reliability, will be the first to develop DRIVE PX 2, using it as the brain for its fleet of 100 self-driving cars to be publicly available next year in its hometown of Gothenburg, Sweden. Just a couple of weeks ago, the first autonomous shuttle, the WEpod, incorporating our deep learning platform, took its inaugural trip on public roads in the Netherlands, where it can be summoned with a smartphone app.","The DRIVE PX 2 launch generated enormous interest around the world from car makers, Tier 1 suppliers and others. We're now collaborating with more than 70 companies that are developing self-driving car technologies.","Finally, our OEM and IP business was $198 million, up 3% sequentially, driven by the seasonal demand for notebooks.","Now turning to the rest of the income statement. GAAP quarterly gross margin was 56.5%. Non-GAAP gross margin was a record 57.2%, slightly above our outlook. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins increased from a year ago. GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter was $539 million, inclusive of $34 million of restructuring and other charges. Non-GAAP operating expenses, including litigation charges, were $445 million, in line with our outlook.","For full fiscal 2016, our non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.72 billion, including litigation costs. Our focus on rigorous execution and enhancing efficiencies enabled our core operating expenses to remain flat from fiscal 2015 as we focused on expanding operating margins.","GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter was $252 million. Non-GAAP operating income was $356 million, up 26% from $283 million a year earlier. GAAP net income was $207 million. GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.35, including $0.04 of restructuring and other charges. Non-GAAP net income was $297 million. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.52, an increase of 21% year-over-year.","Now turning to some key balance sheet items. At the end of Q4, our cash and marketable securities balance was just over $5 billion. During the quarter, we paid $62 million in cash dividends and we closed our accelerated repurchasing agreement with an additional 4.3 million shares returned. As a result, we've returned to shareholders an aggregate of $800 million in fiscal 2016, meeting our intention we communicated at the start of the fiscal year.","Over the past four years, we've returned more than $3 billion to shareholders, representing 98% of our free cash flow. As part of our ongoing commitment to deliver shareholder value through capital return, our intention is to return $1 billion in fiscal year of 2017 through quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases.","For fiscal year 2016, revenue reached a record $5 billion, up 7%. Our growth platforms increased 26% year-on-year. Non-GAAP gross margin was a record 56.8%, up 100 basis points on the year. Non-GAAP operating income grew 18% to $1.13 billion, with operating margin expansion of more than 200 basis points to 22.5%. Non-GAAP EPS grew 18%.","Now turning to the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. We remain excited about our business prospects. Gaming remains strong; and eSports, VR and new exciting gamings were lifted further. GPU-accelerated datacenters are expanding in both HPC and cloud, driven by the growth of deep learning. And autonomous driving continues to move forward. We have excellent positions in each of these growth markets.","We expect revenue for the first quarter of 2017 to be $1.26 billion, plus or minus 2%. Our GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 57.2% and 57.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $500 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $445 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 are both expected to be 19%, plus or minus 1%.","Further financial details, including the CFO Commentary and revenue by market platforms, are available on our IR website.","We will now open the call for questions. We ask you that you limit your questions to just two. Ash, would you please poll for questions at this time?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the very good growth and execution. My first question, Jen-Hsun, is on the gaming segment. For the last two years it's grown at over 30% a year. I don't know if many other multi-billion-dollar businesses in semis that are growing at this pace. The question really is how sustainable is this growth? I understand the drivers, but could you help us ballpark that going forward over the next two years, three years, do you think of this as a 10%, 15%, 5% growth opportunity? Any guidance there would be extremely helpful.","Jen-Hsun Huang - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Thanks a lot, Vivek. First of all, I think you captured the essence of it in your question. GeForce is really not a chip business anymore; it's really a gaming platform business. And when you think about it from a gaming platform business, it has to be thought of in the context of the whole gaming ecosystem and the gaming industry. It's $100 billion large. And when you think about it that way and you drive the business that way and you create value that way, I think the prospects for our growth there is still quite significant.","There's several different ways that we can grow with the market. First of all, when we introduced new game platforms and this year \u2013 the last couple of years, we've introduced Maxwell; it's the most successful gaming platform we've ever introduced. The install base of about 100 million GeForce gamers in the world has an opportunity to upgrade to a new platform.","Another reason why we can grow is because the production value continues to increase; the graphics richness continues to increase. And we do that by inspiring the industry, providing a technology that helps it include our technology in a much easier way; and the way that we do that is called GameWorks. All of the physics simulations, all of the visual simulations, all the lighting simulations and all of the things that make games beautiful today are easy to include by just supporting GameWorks; and it's been an enormous success for us.","And, of course, the developing countries are still doing incredibly well. There are many countries around the world that are just starting to get into PC gaming. Southeast Asia is growing incredibly. And then not to mention that gaming is no longer just gaming. Gaming is all about sports now. But we're starting to see a new culture, a new dynamic in gaming even beyond that. It's really becoming a platform by which people could share and a platform by which they could artistically express themselves.","And if you look at some of these games today, it's something that you enjoy well beyond just playing the game. You use the game as an editor to tell stories. And so these games, like GTA 5, it's just fantastic for telling stories. And so you can see now that the gaming platform's going beyond games, it's going beyond sports; and now it's a creative platform. And so there's just all these wonderful ways that the game industry has continued to be vibrant; and my sense is that we're going to continue to grow with it.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And as a follow-up, Jen-Hsun, on your automotive business. As you move from infotainment systems that are graphics-intensive to more advanced computing systems, do you think it changes the competitive environment? And what I'm referring to is we have seen Qualcomm and others enter the segment and they are making the case that they can integrate a lot of different piece parts and tie that to their processor. And I'm trying to draw a parallel with what you had on the smartphone side where you were specializing in one part, but others could integrate other parts and become more successful.","Is there going to be a similar situation in auto? Or do you think that we should read it in a different way as to how your competitive situation can evolve in autos as computing becomes a bigger part of the application?","Jen-Hsun Huang - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we have to be mindful of competition. And there's a lot of different ways to compete, there's a lot of different ways to bring value; and surely what you described is one way to compete. Those aren't really the segments in the market that we'll address. The way that we think about infotainment is there are segments of the infotainment market, surely the parts of the market that we serve incredibly well. The richness of the displays, the number of displays and how the displays are going be used in the coming years are going to continue to expand.","You know the display costs are coming down and OLED displays are become cheaper. There's so many different ways to bring visualization into the car to enhance the driving experience. You can also imagine how artificial intelligence technology could change the way infotainment systems are even used. And one of our strategies, of course, is to bring artificial intelligence technology to enhance how the driver communicates with the car. And so there's all kinds of new technologies that we're going deploy into the infotainment system, leveraging our expertise in deep learning.","The part of the market that you're starting to talk about is the segment of the market that we really introduced into the marketplace, which is the autonomous driving computer. We started talking about it several years ago, I think it was like three years at CES, when I introduced the DRIVE PX, where we imagined that in the future a car would also have a supercomputer inside that is powered by deep learning, that's powered by artificial intelligence. And that takes in the sensor input continuously from the car, what's surrounding the car and infer from it the appropriate thing to do.","That vision three years ago seemed a little bit, if you will, outer space. But I think that it is very clear now that the technology that we're bringing to bear, deep learning, is really the best approach for helping car companies go beyond ADAS, which is going be a commodity in the coming years as you can imagine, go beyond ADAS and move towards assisted driving to full autonomous driving.","And so I think that we can add a lot of value there.","PX 2 was really invented to allow OEMs to scale that entire range from assisted driving, all the way to fully-assisted driving. And that's one of the reasons why we can support one chip all the way up to four chips, from passive cooling all the way up to integrating directly into the self-driving EV water cooling system that's quite available for most EV cars with liquid cooling. And so I think that our strategy there is going to work out quite well. We add a lot of value. It's very algorithm-rich, it's very software-rich; and I think our DRIVE PX platform is really quite state-of-the-art.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. You may proceed with your question.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. First question, on the TDS business \u2013 I'm sorry, the Tegra Development Services \u2013 you noted that that was an important driver of growth. And can you give us a little bit more color on that business? How big is that? What end markets are you working with? What are you helping customers do? Hi. Can you hear me?","Jen-Hsun Huang - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Actually, I'm just trying to figure out what your question was. Let me see. I guess I'd be reluctant to announce anything today, but there are semi-custom businesses that people need our help on. And we're open for business to help select partners develop proprietary systems that leverages the wealth of technologies that we have, whether it's in visual computing or deep learning or supercomputing, so that we can create systems and products and services that the world has never had before. And so that's an area that I think is of interest to us; and it's an area that we'll likely see a lot more success in the future. But there's not much to really announce today.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Fair enough. And the gross margins \u2013 second question on the gross margins \u2013 they've gone over the last three years from the low-50%s and pushing through 57% now. At what point do these asymptote out? How should we be thinking about that? Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So I appreciate that question. There are lot of moving parts in our gross margins business \u2013 gross margins. Of course, our enterprise businesses is richer in gross margins; our consumer business tends to be lower in gross margins. At the highest level, the way I would think of our company's gross margins is really the nature of our business model is changing.","And if you think about our business model a long time ago, it used to be a chip business, but today we're really a differentiated specialty platform business. And what I mean by platform business is it's, of course, the chips, the systems, but it's largely about the differentiated software that's on top of it. And so, increasingly, you're going to find that our businesses is software-rich, it's services rich. And if that's the case, one would think that our business model would become increasingly of that nature; and I think you're just seeing the reflection of that.","As our company continues to move towards our differentiated platforms, which was, call it, 50% just a few years ago and it's now reaching some 80% now; as we move into these specialty differentiated platforms, the software content is just much, much higher. And our customers who work with us are not buying chips for their systems, for their commodity systems, but they're looking for a platform to solve a particular problem. And the problems that we help to solve, the solution that we bring to bear, is so high-valued that I think that increasingly you should expect that \u2013 well, you should hope and I hope myself \u2013 that our gross margins continue to move along with the change in our business model.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James. You may proceed with your question.","Hans C. Mosesmann - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thanks, and congratulations guys. Hey, Jen-Hsun, can you give us an update on the high-performance compute side of the business? How will Pascal compare to the upcoming other solutions in the market and specifically Intel's Knights Landing? And I have a follow-up. Thanks.","Jen-Hsun Huang - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Hans, thank you. Our high-performance computing business uses an architecture we call accelerated computing. Accelerated computing is a model of computing that we invented almost 10 years ago, and it's a very unique way of doing computing and it takes advantage of the strength of the CPU, as well as the advantage of the world's most parallel processor called the GPU. It is very software-intensive, it's very mathematics-intensive, it's very algorithm-intensive.","And it's a problem that when applied to some verticals can accelerate computing dramatically. We see accelerations of 5x, 10x, 20x quite normally, quite regularly. And the way that you translate this benefit to a customer is that it reduces their costs. Instead of building a supercomputer that may cost as much as $500 million, the supercomputer would be the world's best at $100 million. That's a pretty substantial reduction in expenses. The power bill that they would spend on a regular basis would be dramatically reduced. And so datacenters and supercomputing centers save an enormous amount of money. On the other hand, the researchers see a substantial boost in their application throughput.","And so that's one of the reasons why accelerated computing is doing really well. We're seeing a couple of different drivers for accelerated computing and high-performance computing, our datacenter business. Accelerated computing itself for supercomputing applications, whether it's weather simulation or molecular dynamics simulation, continues to grow.","But the big killer app that we're starting to see \u2013 and we've been cultivating this for several years now and it's now really turning the corner and going into turbocharge in growth \u2013 is deep learning. Almost in every field of science, as well as for web services companies, artificial intelligence helps them wade through, comb through just massive mounds and oceans of data to discover insight. And so deep learning and using artificial intelligence technology across all fields of science \u2013 I'm super excited about the work that's going be done in medicine \u2013 it's really going to see some great adoption.","I think we mentioned that in just a couple years ago, we had 100 companies working with us in the area of deep learning and now it's ballooned to 3,500. That's quite a large scale growth. And it's in industries, all the way from life sciences to supercomputing of course, to web services of course, to even industrial. And the application for industrial would be Internet of Things. All of these sensors all around the world collecting data needs artificial intelligence software, deep learning software to reveal insight.","In terms of our positioning relative to the competition, this is an area that we have a real advantage; and we have a real advantage for several reasons. The incremental cost to our company \u2013 the incremental cost of engineering, accelerated computing \u2013 into our normal course of running our GPU business, GeForce business is incremental. And so the system, the entire system, the 10,000 people in our company can quite easily, if you will, continue this rhythm \u2013 and quite a high velocity rhythm \u2013 of bringing on new GPUs that are great for accelerated computing and great for gaming, of course, and great for workstations in its natural course of doing work.","This is not adjunct business to us; this is our core business. And at the core that is our fundamental advantage. It's a singular motion, singular execution, singular investment, singular architecture, incredibly leveraged. And the execution, as a result, is just absolutely flawless. And so I think in the end that's our situation.","Hans C. Mosesmann - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Very helpful. Thanks, Jen-Hsun.","Jen-Hsun Huang - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava of BMO Capital Markets. You may proceed with your question.","Ting Pong Gabriel Ho - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. This is Gabriel Ho calling in for Ambrish. Thanks for taking my question. Just want to follow-up on your Tesla business. I think in the recent earnings call Cray actually iterated its expectation of over 50% of its $825 million revenue in the fourth quarter of this calendar year. And I think they cite its drivers one of the three supercomputers actually has used Pascal. So how should we think about the benefit to your Tesla business?","Jen-Hsun Huang - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, Cray is a very important partner of ours. And the thing that's really exciting for me is to see them transition their business \u2013 not transition, but transform their business from one that is really focused on supercomputing centers to one that is also working on big data. This this an area where we can add a lot of value to them. We have a lot of expertise in this area. And as they continue to evolve their market footprint beyond supercomputing centers and now into large enterprises, I think they could find a lot of success. And so they're seeing a lot of success in this area.","Big data analytics is \u2013 we're square in their bulls eye and I'm quite excited for them in the work that they're doing there. And so they're a good customer for us, a great partner of ours; and I'm excited to see their ongoing success.","The thing that we're all seeing is that big data analytics \u2013 the most powerful weapon for big data analytics has recently been discovered. Deep learning is just a fantastic new computing model. It is able to discover insight that is provably now superhuman. Its dimensionality in thinking through data is unrivaled than any approach that we've learned in the past. And now that's one of the reasons why industries all over the world, from life sciences, to industry, to manufacturing, to supercomputing, are jumping onto deep learning bandwagon. And so I think their adoption of Tesla, the NVIDIA GPU, is going to be quite a successful one.","Ting Pong Gabriel Ho - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thanks. As a follow-up, I think you seem to spend about $90 million in legal expense. And how should we think about in fiscal 2017? And also, can you give us an update where you are in the cases of Qualcomm and Samsung?","Jen-Hsun Huang - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, just as a backdrop, we litigated against Samsung last year and the expenses was what you were referring to. At the core of it, fundamentally philosophically we believe that it is inappropriate and it's wrong for Samsung to use NVIDIA's technology, technology that has cost us billions of dollars to invent, and to use it without compensating us. At the core, I just think that's just wrong. And we think it's wrong; and that's the reason why we decided to litigate \u2013 to sue Samsung.","The ITC has passed its early decisions, and we disagree with them. We're disappointed by them. It is unfortunate that the business courts couldn't see through the obviously complex data associated with the technology. But we're disappointed by it. We've appealed for a review. And hopefully in the near term, we'll discover what the ITC will do. Bu t I still believe that it was the wrong thing to for Samsung to use technology that companies who are specialized in these fields invent and to use it without compensation. And I'm disappointed with the decision from the ITC, but so be it.","Next year, we have plenty of things to go invest in and we have plenty of growth drivers. You know that we have four powerful growth drivers in our company: gaming is one, VR is another, artificial intelligence and self-driving cars. And we have plenty of growth drivers to go focus our company on.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. You may proceed with your question.","C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI","Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question on the auto side. Trying to get my arms around how we should think about growth here in calendar 2016 off the 75% growth in 2015. I guess, if you could kind of parse between your backlog for infotainment, your outlook there, as well as what kind of ramp you see with the product development contracts on the ADAS side?","Jen-Hsun Huang - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So two questions there. First of all, our pipeline. We've talked about our pipeline several times. We've shipped probably 5 million, 6 million cars. We have another 20 million, 25 million cars to ship in our pipeline. And so these are design wins that took quite a few years to have won and quite a few years of engineering to ramp into production. So we have a pretty good visibility of the pipeline and the opportunities that are ahead of us.","Probably there's some market dynamics that's helpful to some of the design wins, the segments that we serve. Of course, at the time, a long time ago, it's hard to tell, but it's very clear now that the computerization of cars is a highly desirable end user feature. And the customers, the partners that we worked with, the car companies we worked with, to computerize their cars, whether it's Audi or Tesla whose cars are heavily computerized, their growth prospects in the coming years are quite good. And so I think that that's one that we have a clear view of the pipeline, and I think the mega trends of the computerization of cars is in our favor.","Now you mentioned \u2013 secondarily, we introduced this platform called DRIVE PX. It's our autonomous driving car computer platform. And the recent success of ADAS has really inspired just about every car company in the world to look beyond ADAS. And what's beyond ADAS is self-driving cars. And it could be partially assisted, it could be mostly assisted and it could be completely assisted. And in each one of those levels of autonomy, a different amount of computation would have to be deployed. And we've created a scalable architecture that allows car companies to develop cars that are partially assisted, all the way to completely assisted.","We're working with quite a large number of customers now, car companies, start-up companies, companies that are largely cloud-based and have an enormous amount of data that they could transform into an automotive service, transportation as a service. And so we're working with a whole lot of different types of companies, and I think this is going to be an area of quite a significant industrial revolution; and arguably quite a gigantic society good in the long-term. So anyways we're working on a lot of projects there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin with UBS. You may proceed with your question.","Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, there. Thanks for taking the questions. Jen-Hsun, the first one for you, if I could. In terms of the deep learning, machine learning opportunity, I was wondering if you could help quantify sort of the longer-term silicon TAM for the opportunity both in datacenter and automotive? And I guess more of near-term, any thoughts on what kind of development revenues could be generated for these machine learning type platforms in the near-term?","Jen-Hsun Huang - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Thanks. I think part of the answer is I'm not sure. Part of the answer is I'm not sure. So with that as a disclaimer, let me tell you why I'm so enthusiastic about it. There are many problems that computer science has been trying to solve, which algorithmically is just impossible to solve. There's no known way of a human-described algorithm that completely captures the noisy and long tail of society. And it could be almost any problem. It could be weather-related product type problems, it could be market-related type problems, it could be all kinds of purchasing-related challenges and all kinds of data.","It could be life sciences, as we know that the human body is not in a perfect condition all the time. There's that randomness that plays a role in understanding molecular science. And so there are so many different types of areas where there is no simple Newtonian physics equation that can describe the nature.","And so in that particular case, using an enormous amount of data to train a neural net, to train software, to rewrite the software, if you will, using an enormous amount of computation is an pretty exciting computation model. I think this is a brand new computing model, one that is going to augment the traditional model of symbolics and computer programming. This is going to be a data-driven type of computing model.","And in this particular case, GPU-accelerated computing is really quite ideal. And the computing model that we've invented some 10 years ago is really quite ideal. How big is it? I think that it could be quite significant. And we're starting to see, of course, the type of companies that are jumping on top of the deep learning bandwagon. They're great companies, from Google, to Facebook, to Baidu, to IBM, to Alibaba, to just about every hyperscale web services company in the world is jumping on this because they have enormous amounts of data and it has very, very long tails. And traditional segmentation is too contrived of a approach to find great insight.","Now the companies with a great deal of web-based data, cloud-based data has already starting to engage in this area. They're starting to implement artificial intelligence into one application after another. And I think we've already heard them announce that it's very likely they'll put artificial intelligence into every single application they have.","We're starting to see this sweep across industries. The automotive industry, of course, has the longest tail as the world is a very noisy place. And in order to create a car that can navigate through it, the long tail of a very complicated world has to be handled somehow. Writing software programs is just not going do it. And so using an ongoing, learning artificial intelligence network could be exactly the solution for it; life sciences, industries, manufacturing, supercomputing, financial services. I mean the list goes on and on and on, and we're seeing a lot of enthusiasm there. Before everybody can use deep learning, they have to train a network. And this is an area where we have a great deal of expertise.","This year, as you know, we also announced our first hyperscale inferencing engine. It's our first end-to-end training-to-inferencing \u2013 inferencing is predictions \u2013 the application of the network. And so from training all the way to inferencing, we now have a complete architecture that is architecturally compatible. The Tesla M40 is for training and the Tesla M4 is for inferencing.","The M4 is a little, tiny credit card-sized GPU, and very low powered, incredibly energy efficient; and you can connect it into just about any hyperscale data center in the world. And we're sampling customers now. The results are quite exciting. Customers are very enthusiastic about it. And I think we could dramatically reduce the cost of datacenters all over the world as they start to ramp up artificial intelligence in their everyday workload.","Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Appreciate that color, Jen-Hsun. And as a quick follow-up, I had one for Colette on the inventory levels. Colette, just given where inventories ended for the quarter \u2013 on a days and dollars basis it's roughly comparable to a number of quarters back when revenues were about 20% to 30% lower than where it is today. Is this a new level that the company can continue operating at just based on supply chain efficiencies? Or is this just sort of the seasonal volatility in this number or any other kind of average ASP of the products that you're carrying? Thanks.","Colette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Stephen, thanks so much for the question. Our inventory levels that we are holding here, they're definitely going to swing a bit in terms of the mix, in terms of our platform. But what we have right now, we do have a very healthy level of inventory. And we have a great team of people managing all of those different pieces, both for the channel, for our partners and definitely for what we need to ship going forward. So I don't think we look at a number to exactly optimize in any single one quarter, as we do make sure that we are prepared for the platforms coming down the pipeline, as well as what customers need. But you're correct, it's probably at a fairly healthy low level at this time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sanjay Chaurasia with Nomura Securities. You may proceed with your question.","Sanjay Chaurasia - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Hi, Jen-Hsun. One question on deep learning. I was wondering if you could talk about relative opportunity sizes in training and inference part of the deep learning? Clearly, you have a strong position on the training side. I would love to hear your thoughts on the inference side. My understanding is there's a lot of custom chips are being built in the industry on the inferencing side. So I would love to get your color on what competition you will see on that front?","Jen-Hsun Huang - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Here's my guess. I think long-term, training will be half of the overall market. And the reason for that is because training is so heavyweight. And in the long-term \u2013 well, not long-term, now, you're training your network constantly. You create a network, you want to improve this network as fast as you can because you have so much valuable data and so much insight that you can go after. And you deploy the network for inferencing which collects brand new data, and the world looks completely different to you. You now collect that data and you use that data to train your network.","I think that network training is going to be a continuous basis and we're seeing that absolutely. Also, there are more types of networks. The types of networks that are being created, the rate of revolution, the rate of innovation of networks, network styles, network types, network configurations, network depths; it's happening every single week. I'm actually not exactly sure how you would design a custom chip for it, which explains why there are only two chips today that are successful in inferencing. One of them is the Intel Xeon and the other one is the Tesla M40 and M4.","And so I think that the ability to adapt to new algorithms quickly is really quite vital as we go through the next several years of this artificial intelligence revolution. And there's just so much algorithms being developed; and I think you guys are reading about it constantly, new breakthroughs in AI, new breakthroughs in network design. At the moment, I just really don't know how someone would settle down and design a custom chip for it.","And so I happen to believe that long-term artificial intelligence is not a chip. Artificial intelligence is a computing model; and computing model needs processors; and processors are programmable; and these programmable processors need to have rich software development environments around it, and these platforms needs to be available all over the world. And, today, the NVIDIA accelerated computing platform is available in a PC, in a workstation, in a laptop, in the cloud, in a car, in robots, in embedded environments. And it's all exactly the same architecture.","I think that that's really one of our advantages that we have the ability to be adaptable, programmable and yet we're available in literally every single computing platform form-factor you can imagine. And the accessibility of NVIDIA's architecture is literally global, worldwide and within reach for anybody.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed with your question.","Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks for letting me ask a question. One for either Jen-Hsun or Colette. In your first quarter guidance it looks like the down 10% has some seasonality to it, but you also have a lot of businesses that have secular trends behind them. So I was hoping that you could provide a little bit of color on kind of seasonality versus secular, or which of the drivers would be better or worse than that 10%, acknowledging also that you lose a week of business guiding into that April quarter.","Jen-Hsun Huang - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. First of all, I appreciate the question. I think, first of all, it's just the guidance; and it's our best view today, it's our most prudent view today. And as we know, although there are many things we know, the worlds' a very uncertain place.","There's a few things that we do know. The gaming market is quite vibrant and it continues to be quite vibrant. We monitor it literally every day, every week; and we monitor it all over the world, and it remains quite vibrant. In the coming months there are some really, really wonderful games that are coming out that we think are going be spectacularly successful, whether it's The Division or Tomb Raider or \u2013 the list goes on. And so I think the gaming market appears to be quite vibrant.","Our automotive business is vibrant. And the work that we're doing in self-driving is really gaining traction and captured the imagination of just about every car company around the world. Our deep learning work and supercomputing work, high-performance computing work is accelerating.","And so in a lot of ways I understand where you're coming from, but we don't want to ignore seasonality. Q1 is Q1. And we recognize that the market is uncertain, and we'll see how it plays out. At the end of the quarter, we'll come and report it again.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. You may proceed with your question.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good afternoon and congratulations on another solid quarter. Jen-Hsun, you talked about the install base and the upgrade opportunity in gaming. I think last call you quantified it as around three-quarters of the install base that really needs a more updated GTX processor. Given the 37% growth in the gaming business last year and the success of Maxwell, it actually does appear that you did drive some meaningful upgrade in the install base. So the question for you is, is there any updates to your views on where the install base sits at from an upgrade opportunity?","And then the second question is do you get a sense that the cadence of these upgrades will be accelerating, given the advancements you and your gaming engine partners are bringing to the market every year?","Jen-Hsun Huang - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Those are really good questions, and we monitor our install base pretty carefully. And currently in the install base, we basically have three architectures still in operation. We have the Maxwell architecture, and we have the Kepler architecture and we have the Tesla architecture. All of those \u2013 excuse me, the Fermi architecture. And those architectures are all running in the install base at the moment.","We've managed to upgrade about a third of the install base. Meanwhile, it is the case that ASPs of our GPUs are going up because the graphics richness and the graphics production value is going up. The quality of games \u2013 because the market for games are so high, game developers can really create much, much more beautiful games and take the risk to do that. The developing markets are growing. The number of genres, like eSports, of games are growing. And so there's a lot of different growing vectors. And meanwhile, all of that is on top of our desire to upgrade our install base so that they can enjoy games the way that it ought to be enjoyed. And so I think there's still a fair amount of growth opportunity ahead of us; and we'll monitor it carefully and report it once a quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Deepon Nag with Macquarie Capital. You may proceed with your question.","Deepon Nag - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Yeah. Thanks a lot, guys. So Quadro grew for the first time I think in several quarters. Can you kind of describe what drove that growth and how we should think about the growth profile for the rest of this year? Is it possible that it could grow in the mid-single digits for all of 2017?","Jen-Hsun Huang - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Deepon, thanks for the question. I was delighted myself. I'll just put that out there. We worked really hard to improve our Quadro business. The team works incredibly hard. We've invented a new technology for rendering called Iray. It's the world's first physically modeled photorealistic renderer that is accelerated by GPU. The result of it is really quite remarkable, and they continue to add new capabilities to it.","We, this last quarter, also benefited from the enthusiasm and excitement around VR, and we have VR SDKs and collaborations with just about every ISV in the world that is working on VR. And so I think there's a lot of good reasons to be enthusiastic about Quadro. We don't believe for a moment that the design quality and design production value of movies, or games, or architecture or manufacturing will continue. We believe absolutely that's going to continue to improve in visual realism and the productivity of the engineers that are involved, the artists that are involved needs to continue to increase. And so we think that this is going to be a vibrant growth area ahead.","I think that what drove recently the uptick are the OEMs refreshing workstation cycle, and I think we should enjoy some of that for the coming quarters. But I still think long-term the real opportunity, surely the market is there. We know that more and more of design and creativity is done digitally. So at the core, the market is there. The opportunity for us is to bring new forms of rendering, new forms of design. And as you could see, Iray is for rendering and VR is for interacting with the design. These types of capabilities require just an enormous amount of GPU capability. And I think at the core that's going to be our long-term growth drivers.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed with your question.","Joe L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. Can you give us some color on what you're seeing in emerging markets, with a lot of macro concern about some of your end markets, notably China, and you guys keep putting up very good numbers. Can you sort of talk about that demand by geography and how you weigh the economic and currency risks over the course of this year?","Jen-Hsun Huang - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. For some reason I still kind of tend to believe that what drives the gaming market is great games. And I think that there's some evidence that the continued release of great games and great production value games \u2013 the vibrancy of eSports, the fact that eSports is really not just for competition, but drives the dynamic of sharing and social. Those kind of factors continue to drive our gaming business.","I'm quite enthusiastic about the developing markets. Southeast Asia, for one, is really starting to adopt PC gaming quite rapidly, and it is a market that is extremely underserved. India is a market that is extremely underserved. They are underserved because broadband Internet hasn't been available to those marketplaces until just recently. And there are surely demographics in these markets that would love to jump onto gaming.","And who doesn't need a PC? And so almost every market develops around PCs quite rapidly. And so I think the way of enjoying games is so affordable by adding a GeForce GTX to a PC that you already own. It is the most affordable form of entertainment if you think about it that way. And most of eSports are free to play, anyhow, and so much of it is, anyhow. And so it's a wonderfully affordable way to enjoy entertainment. And so I think the South \u2013 Southeast Asia, India are really quite exciting developing markets.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Canaccord Genuity. You may proceed with your question.","Matthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Yes. Thank you very much. Jen-Hsun, there's been a lot of, I guess, speculation about how the emergence of VR, headsets in particular, for gaming would drive your GPU business. I guess I'd just like to hear your perspective on a couple of things. One, obviously, it requires high-end and high-ASP GPUs to support some of these applications, so of the early adopters, maybe a sense of which of those folks might already own those type of GPUs and which ones might have to upgrade in the near term. And second, how VR might penetrate the eSports phenomenon over time and drive more of those upgrades into the higher-volume mainstream parts of the gaming market. Thanks.","Jen-Hsun Huang - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Well, there are really two questions in your question. They're both good. And one question is how do I feel about VR and its impact on gaming. The second part is how will VR impact our business. Let me just tell you the second part first. We don't \u2013 we don't \u2013 we're not forecasting and not assuming any upside in VR. However, there is no way, but good, that VR will bring to our business and we'll take it a day at a time and we believe that it's going be an exciting growth driver. We believe that it's going to be helpful to our high-end GPU business. But when the time comes, it'll be a nice bonus.","And so we're going to run our business as if we don't count on it. However, obviously, we care very deeply about it because we think that the experience of VR is quite amazing. Anybody who's tried it is surprised how immersive it is, how it takes you away from where you are and into another world. You're really suspended in disbelief and it's as close to a holodeck as we've ever experienced.","And so we believe strongly that VR is going to be fantastic for entertainment. It's going to be fantastic for games. We also believe that it's going to be fantastic for all of our Pro business. I wouldn't be surprised if the segment of our business that it helps the earliest may very well be our Professional business. And the reason for that is because there are many applications that are mission-critical. And even though the headsets are not free, it's quite affordable. And for people who have powerwalls and who use large displays, VR is actually an incredible cost reduction. And so almost anybody can now have a virtual reality cave which cost tens of thousands of dollars. Anyone can now have a powerwall, which costs tens of thousands of dollars, and now for just a few hundred dollars, have all the benefits of that.","And so I think that you could tell that I'm very enthusiastic about it. We're developing a lot of fresh technology and new enabling technology to make it possible. We're working with all of the market leaders to develop the market and cultivate the market. And then from a financial perspective, we'll just see how it plays out. And my sense is that it's going to be a really nice bonus.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Hemmelgarn with Barclays. You may proceed with your question.","Christopher Hemmelgarn - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks very much for taking my question, and congrats on the good quarter.","Jen-Hsun Huang - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks a lot, Chris.","Christopher Hemmelgarn - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah, I guess, first of all, I wanted to \u2013 we've talked a lot about some of the really exciting businesses that have a lot of great growth prospects for you. I thought we'd look at, as well, some that have been a little more stagnant. And I was curious to your take of, for example, the OEM business. It looks like it may be finally stabilizing after declining. How do you look at that business in the coming fiscal year? Do you think it can even get back to growth or do you expect continued declines?","Jen-Hsun Huang - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, my sense is that it will stabilize, and let me tell you why. Our OEM business is not about gaming because it's our Gaming business. And the OEMs are not about design because that's our Design business. But the thing that some OEMs do is they include our technology to differentiate a mainstream platform from a premium platform. And so by adding NVIDIA's technology, you turn a commodity PC into a premium PC. And the experience is better, the performance is better and everything just works. And so there's a real benefit in using it as a premium multimedia PC, if you will. And so we'll probably see continued interest in doing that. And we're delighted by that. We don't count on it, but we're delighted by it. And so my sense is that it will likely stabilize.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Roland with FBR & Company. You may proceed with your question.","Christopher Adam Jackson Rolland - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Hey, guys, thanks for the question and great quarter. On...","Jen-Hsun Huang - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","How are you, Chris.","Christopher Adam Jackson Rolland - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Great. Thanks. Speaking about your installed base briefly, can you guys share with us your view on GPU replacement rates, kind of how fast are they or how long are they now, and whether they're kind of shrinking or speeding up here? And also perhaps how they might differ by geography?","Jen-Hsun Huang - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I don't know that I have the precise \u2013 precise granularity by geography except for just a few countries, but let me address it overall. The installed base takes a couple of two years, three years to upgrade. And on the lower end, three years to four years. On the higher end, one year to two years. And so overall, I guess \u2013 because the lower end products are higher in volume, it would probably weigh the overall average to call it three-plus years. But the ASP, of course \u2013 if you look at it from an ASP perspective, it's a little bit different, it would probably drift up. The rate of upgrade appears to be increasing. And that might also explain that the ASP of the products can \u2013 the ASP of our overall portfolio increasing.","I think the reason why it's increasing is because the size of the gaming market has now grown to a level that developers can take a fair amount of risk to add a rich content, rich production value in graphics, which they didn't used to be able to do. I mean, they now have the benefit of a large installed base of PlayStation and Xbox, Nintendo and PCs, that they could actually create content that is really, really quite beautiful and technologically rich, which drives up the adoption of higher-end GPUs because you need higher-end GPUs to process it. I think that's quite a significant factor.","I think the other factor is that the game consoles, although nowhere near the performance level of our high-end GPUs, on average is higher in terms of capability than our average install base. That's actually really terrific news for us because a PC gamer who wants to enjoy games that are adapted from game consoles, which all of them are, now would have to upgrade their GPUs to enjoy at least a game console experience.","And so I think that there's a \u2013 that bottom half of our install base has a real opportunity to enjoy at least the game console experience for just $150. I mean, you could \u2013 for a $150 graphics card, you could get an experience that is superior to a game console. I mean, that's quite an amazing value. And so that I think is also another reason to spur adoption.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rajvindra Gill with Needham & Company. You may proceed with your question.","Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC","Yeah, thanks, and congrats as well. Just a follow-up question on the virtual reality market and how you're looking at that. Can you talk a little bit about some of the PC requirements that are going to be necessary to use in a Facebook Oculus Rift headset when it comes out this quarter and the cost that's going to be needed for individual user? And kind of contrast that from the business model that Sony is employing, which is basically \u2013 based on my knowledge \u2013 a bundling strategy with their PlayStation 4, which wouldn't require an upgrade to the graphics card or buying a new desktop. Just wondering how you're thinking about those two different business models.","Jen-Hsun Huang - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, there are two different questions in there. One question is what is the minimum requirement for VR today. Using today's graphics card as an example, the GTX 970, which is the most popular graphics card in the world, is the min spec for the Oculus Rift. And the reason why, of course, is because Oculus and their PC focus wants to have the best possible experience for the early adopters of VR. And I think that's a really prudent strategy. You want to delight all of your early adopters with the best possible experience.","But the way to think about it long term is that as the market continues to grow and more content comes and VR moves into the mainstream, there's no question in my mind that our $100 and $150 GeForce GTX cards will in the future be able to play VR just perfectly. And so \u2013 so this is not a question about the availability of technology or the cost of technology. As we know, technology continues to advance and whatever experience today will continue to get more affordable long term.","Whatever the Sony PlayStation does, I think, is just fantastic either way. What we would like to do is get people excited about VR. And in the final analysis, there are TV gamers and then there are \u2013 there are console gamers and there are PC gamers. And there are different genres and there are different applications and different styles, and very largely different customers. And so I think we're just enthusiastic about VR, period. And over time, the technology will get more and more affordable.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Brian Alger with ROTH Capital Partners. You may proceed with your question.","Brian Alger - ROTH Capital Partners LLC","Thanks for squeezing me in here at the end. I'll be very brief. The opportunity in automotive obviously continues to grow and your unveiling at CES was impressive by anyone's standards. However, there seems to be two approaches to the automotive market. As we move forward, there's obviously the closed system approach that Mobileye seems to be pursuing, and what appears to be more of an open architecture approach that you seem to have. Can you maybe describe how things shape up for you as you look out over the horizon with sensor fusion and the various OEMs and getting things right from a safety standards basis, et cetera? Do we need the control of a closed system or can we get it done with collaboration with others?","Jen-Hsun Huang - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. I appreciate the question. It's really, really a good question. This is really a matter of philosophy. And philosophically, this is how we see the world. We believe that self-driving car is not a solved problem. And I say that as a statement of fact. I don't think anybody would dispute it. I also believe that self-driving cars is a field that's going to require the technological muscle of a very, very large industry and that no one company with a few hundred employees is going to solve it all by themselves. So the idea that a unsolved problem of such incredible, daunting levels that an entire computer industry is in the process of trying to solve could possibly be a closed system tied around a chip seems illogical to me. That's number one.","Number two, I believe that long term, our car company \u2013 the soul of the car company is the driving experience of that car. The soul of the car company is the driving experience of the car. The soul of the company is the safety record of that car. The soul of the company is the functionality of that car. And in the future, the functionality, the safety, the driving experience of the car is going to be largely software defined. It's going to be artificial intelligence network defined.","I just can't imagine great companies like BMW and Mercedes and Audi and all of the world, Toyota and the list goes on, and many great companies that are emerging into this marketplace, I just can't imagine that these companies would somehow outsource the soul of their car to a chip company. That's a second philosophical belief. And so what we've decided to do is to create an automotive autonomous car computing platform and all of the rich software that's necessary to enable this incredibly high-throughput computer to behave in a really energy-efficient way and cost-effective way, and to be able to apply our deep learning expertise so that these cars can benefit from artificial intelligence to solve these really complicated world problems. And that by partnering with every single car company in the world, that together we might be able to solve this incredibly daunting challenge and hopefully bring some society good.","And so that's our approach is the open platform, and it starts really from a philosophical approach. Now, that philosophical approach results in a very substantial technological difference. Notice that our platform is completely programmable. We have rich tools. We know that developers all over the world can very easily buy themselves a GeForce TITAN and write CUDA applications and those CUDA applications will tomorrow run on a DRIVE PX just seamlessly. And so I think that's a really wonderful way for designers all over the world to be able to develop software which is really hard to do right now and then quickly deploy it into the card. And so our strategy is just very, very different and that's our approach. And my sense is that at the moment, it appears to be quite a good approach.","Okay. I really appreciate that question.","Jen-Hsun Huang - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","NVIDIA is the world leader in visual and accelerated computing, which is helping to create exciting growth markets like VR, AI and self-driving cars, which will transform many industries and positively impact the future of society. Our strategy is to leverage one core investment into four growth markets; gaming, professional visualization, datacenter and auto, and it's delivering results and gaining momentum. Our goal is to balance investments to capture the enormous opportunity ahead while maintaining a keen focus on improving near-term financial performance.","I also want to remind everyone that our annual GPU Technology Conference will take place April 4 through 7 in San Jose. We'll be focusing on VR, artificial intelligence and autonomous driving. We'll also be holding Analyst Day there and I look forward to seeing all of you.

After our prepared remarks, we will open up the call to a question-and-answer session. Please limit yourself to one initial question with one follow-up.","Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that today\u2019s call is being webcast live on NVIDIA\u2019s Investor Relations website and is also being recorded. A replay of the conference call will be available via telephone until November 14, 2013 and the webcast will be available for replay until our conference call to discuss our financial results for our fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.

You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our financial release, which is posted on our website.","With that, let\u2019s begin. NVIDIA\u2019s focus on advancing the GPU and targeting specialty segments of the PC and mobile markets were visual computing matters resulted in revenue growth in line with our outlook and near-record gross margins. A strong PC gaining market together with record Quadro and Tesla results and the new type of revenues from Tegra 4 in new Android devices offset declines in mainstream PC units. While the PC market overall declined 9% year-on-year according to Gartner, NVIDIA\u2019s year-to-date overall GT business is up 4% versus the same time period.","PC gaming continues to grow led by PC MMO growth at 14% according to market research firm (indiscernible). PC gaming represents almost 40% of the worldwide gaming market larger than console, phone, tablet, or any other gaming markets. PC gaming is also becoming a huge spectator sport, but more than 8.3 million people watched last year\u2019s League of Legends championship final online, more than the number of people who watched the 2013 Standard Cup hockey final.","This quarter, we launched exciting new products to see the demand of PC gamers and spectators alike. We recently unveiled our fastest gaming GPU ever, the GeForce GTX 780 Ti, which this morning received the following assessment from Maximum PC. \u201cThe GTX 780 Ti is just in the league all by itself.\u201d We launched NVIDIA G-SYNC technology, which for the first time enables near-perfect synchronization between the GPU and the display solving the decades old problem of on-screen tearing, stuttering and lag. And we introduced GeForce ShadowPlay, a software platform that lets gamers record stream and share their best gaming moments. Think of it as a DVR and video shaft [ph] for gaming highlights built in to your GeForce computer. The globe of PC gaming has bolstered our GPU gaming revenues despite changes in the PC market. In video GPU gaming revenues are up 6% year-to-date compared to the same period last year. While mobile GPU gaming revenues have doubled the last two years. While we saw declines in our mainstream PC OEM business consistent with the overall market but decline in mainstream units came out of our lowest gross margins products while the stronger gross margin notebook GTX line grew. The result was favorable revenue and gross margin mix with financial performance better than the overall PC market. Quadro posted record revenues and record gross margins driven by strong sales of our new K6000 product. Tesla revenue also hit a new high driven by steadily ramping demand for Tesla product and high performance computer applications particularly for big data analysis. Evidence of increasing industry compute momentum this quarter included an announcement by IBM that they are working accelerating java with CUDA.","A recent HPC site survey from the Intersect360 Research Group showed that accelerators are now a 44% of high performance computing sites up from 24% two years ago. 85% of the HPC site using accelerators are using in video Tesla GPUs. Our grid platform which virtualizes graphics by the point of GPUs in the data center to accelerate enterprise power applications continues to gain momentum. With 212 grid customer trials now in progress up from a 150 last quarter.","All major server OEMs including Cisco, Dell, Fujitsu, Hitachi, HP, IBM and Lenovo are now promoting grid for enterprise PC virtualization. This quarter VMware announced that VMware Horizon View now supports grid enabling graphics acceleration for uses of their virtual desktop environment. GRID this quarter won the Best of Show Judges Choice Award at VMware\u2019s VMworld Conference. And this week Amazon Web Services announced that they are deploying grid serves delivering GPU acceleration to users running graphics intensive applications and games in the cloud.","Tegra revenue more than doubled this quarter, Tegra 4 shipped in over 15 different mobile devices including Xiaomi, HP, Microsoft, Asus, Toshiba, Acer, and others. Android devices with Tegra this quarter included Asus\u2019s new 2500 by 1600 transformer convertible tablet, three new HP tablets and new Acer all in one PC, ViewSonic\u2019s new Android intelligent display and a number of Android microgame consoles. Tegra in automotive continues to ramp delivering another record revenue quarter. SHIELD is the ultimate portable game console and continues to garner critical acclaim in revenues. Last week we launched a game string technology which allows screening of GeForce PC games to SHIELD and Gamepad Mapper which allows 100s of android games to take advance of the SHIELD\u2019s physical control.","More than 10 worldwide partners had announced Tegra Note products to ship this year and finally Xiaomi the hot smartphone maker from China which recently surpassed Apple\u2019s share in that region launched with a Chinese press has referred to as the fastest super phone in the world. The MI3 super phone powered by Tegra 4. The first 100,000 units sold out in 86 seconds. Subsequent production builds of 200,000 also sold out within minutes.","In summary visual computing in gaming, professional graphics, compute and the data center drove solid financial results this quarter despite a changing PC market while positioning us to capitalize on growth opportunities in the coming year. With that I would like to hand the call over to Jen-Hsun.","","Jen-Hsun Huang","Thanks Rob. Hello everyone. I\u2019m very pleased to introduce Colette Kress who took over the role of the Video CFO in September Colette has nearly 25 years of finance experience at major technology companies. She previously served for three years as Senior Vice President and CFO at Cisco\u2019s Business Technology and Operations Finance Organization where she was responsible for financial strategy, planning, reporting, and business development for all business segments, engineering and operations. Prior to that Colette spent 13 years at Microsoft including four years as CFO of the Server and Tools division and held senior roles in Corporate Planning and Finance. She had also earlier served at Texas Instruments in a variety of finance positions. She is already making a big impact and we are thrilled to have her at NVIDIA.","I want to take this opportunity to thank Karen Burns for her tremendous contributions to NVIDIA while acting as our Interim CFO during our search. During her tenure as Interim CFO, NVIDIA\u2019s financial performance grew and prospered highlighted by consistent gross margin growth and the initiation of our capital return programs to shareholders. With a solid foundation provided by Karen and her team, we had the ability to search for the right candidate for this critical position. Karen will continue in her role as Vice President of Finance reporting to Colette.","With that, let me turn the call over to NVIDIA\u2019s new Chief Financial Officer, Colette Kress.","","Colette Kress","Thank you very much, Jen-Hsun Huang. It\u2019s a pleasure to be here. Hello everyone. I want to highlight some key points before we open up for Q&A. Overall results for the third quarter were in line with our overall expectation for the quarter as continued demand for high-end desktop GPUs, Tegra, Quadro and Tesla platforms drove our results. Revenue for the quarter was $1.064 billion slightly below or slightly above our outlook and up 8% sequentially. We delivered EPS of $0.20 and on a GAAP basis and $0.26 on a non-GAAP basis. These results compared to Street consensus estimates of $0.19 for GAAP and $0.26 for non-GAAP.","Revenue for the quarter reflected solid results in our GPU business. The GPU business grew $18 million or 2% quarter-over-quarter and was down 2% year-over-year. Desktop GeForce GPU revenue grew slightly compared to last quarter due to a stronger mix of the mainstream segment in addition to price repositioning of our high end GeForce product. The year ago quarter the desktop GPU revenue was particularly strong as the increased available supply of Kepler high-end GPUs drove results. Our notebook GPU revenue declined as volumes in our low end networks decreased. However, high end gaming notebooks had strong growth as mentioned earlier.","In our gaming segment, inclusive of our GeForce gaming GPUs and high-end notebook GPUs, our revenue has grown 6% year-to-date driven by healthy gaming market. Quadro enterprise revenue increased 5% quarter-over-quarter and 24% year-over-year setting another record quarter fueled by a strong demand for Kepler-based Quadro products. Our Tesla revenue increased 6% quarter-over-quarter and 43% year-to-date also setting another record quarter has accelerated computing games momentum.","Revenue for the Tegra business more than doubled sequentially as our Tegra 4 shipments in mobile storage. Our growth in Tegra including strong revenue from new smartphone releases by Xiaomi and growth in our tablet products across several platforms. Additionally, our Tegra sales benefited from Microsoft Surface 2 shipments and our new and NVIDIA branded shield gaming and entertainment portables. As we move to Q4, we expect our Tegra revenue will further grow compared to Q3 and we continue to ramp these devices into market. And our customers introduced new designs.","GAAP gross margins in Q3 were 55.4% and our non-GAAP gross margins were 55.7% influenced by our success in our Tegra processor business revenue for the quarter and by the most recent price changes in our high-end GeForce desktop products. GAAP operating expenses this quarter was $443 million, which was $17 million below our outlook as we worked on optimizing our resources and spending. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses were $405 million.","Moving to Q4 outlook. We expect total revenue to be approximately $1.060 billion about flat with Q3 with continued success in our GPU business offset a decline in mainstream GPUs. We expect strong sequential growth in Tegra. We anticipate GPU business gross margins to remain stable and to experience continued strong growth in Tegra sales. Thus we expect our GAAP gross margins to be approximately 64.2% and non-GAAP gross margins to be approximately 54.5% in the fourth quarter. On a GAAP basis operating expenses should be about 450 million in the fourth quarter, our non-GAAP operating expenses in Q4 should be about 410 million. The slight increase in Q3 reflecting growth in headcount related expenses. The full year should come in slightly over 1.6 billion non-GAAP. Moving to our capital return strategies, our $750 million accelerated stock repurchase was complete on October 22nd with a return of an additional 14.6 million shares. In total we have repurchased 59.5 million shares year-to-date. For the quarter our dividend was 43 million. Year-to-date we have returned to total of $983 million through capital return allocation to shareholders consisting of a 133 million in quarterly dividend payments and 850 million through share repurchases reflecting continued confidence in the company\u2019s outlook and the focus on providing a strong, consistent return to shareholders. We\u2019re pleased to announce a 13% increase in our quarterly dividend from $7.015 per share to $8.015 per share. This dividend increase will be effective in the current Q4 of fiscal year 2014.","Our Board has also authorized an additional $1 billion of common stock repurchases for total authorization of $1.286 billion available through the end of fiscal year 2016. We plan to continue our capital return to shareholders and with the increase in regular dividends and stock repurchase authorization we\u2019re pleased to announce that we intend to return upto $1 billion of capital to shareholders within fiscal year \u201915.","Turning to other balance sheet items, our overall financial position remains very strong. For the quarter we generated $162 million in cash from operations and a $124 million in cash from free cash flows. Year-to-date we have generated 434 million in cash from operations and 246 million in free cash flow.","Cash inclusive of marketable securities at the end of the quarter was 3 billion. With that let me turn the call back over to Rob.","","Rob Csongor","Thanks Colette. That concludes our prepared remarks. At this time we would like to open up the call to take questions. Again please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up so we can accommodate as many questions as possible. Thank you.","","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura. Please proceed.","","Romit Shah - Nomura","Jen-Hsun license revenue was 66 million in the quarter; it's still a meaningful portion of operating profit. I know the agreement with Intel is set to expire in 2017 but I was wondering if that still the right way to look at it, should we assume that the revenue stream goes away in 2017 or is it potential for Intel to reup that agreement?","","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well you know that technology licensing is an important part of our company\u2019s strategy. We licensed our technology to Sony for the PlayStation. We licensed our technology to Intel for their integrated graphics products. In the time that we have done these agreements we have increased our activities around technology licensing. In July as you probably remembered we announced that we would license our GPU core which is at the heart of the Project Logan which is a next generation tablet processor and there is a market that sure is based on the world\u2019s best GPU called Kepler. Our intentions are to continue to invest in technology licensing and make this an important part of our business going forward. So whether it's Intel or others this is an opportunity that\u2019s very important to us. As one of the most important innovators around the GPU and as you know that GPU is more important than ever. The GPU, when we started the industry was available only on PCs and workstations and now it\u2019s available on mobile devices and tablets and cars and cloud and servers. And so this is an area that we are going to continue to invest in and this is an area that we are going to trying to modify in a lot of different ways, because business models change and business models are different in all these different segments. Sometimes, it makes sense for us to sell chips, sometimes it makes sense for us to offer systems and sometimes it makes sense for us to license cores in our technology. And so I think the way you should think about our technology licensing is that Intel is one of the opportunities for us, but this is a much larger opportunity for us than never before. And this is an area that we have a lot of activity area.","","Romit Shah - Nomura","Alright, thanks for the color on that. As a follow up, you mentioned that automotive generated record amount of revenue for that segment could you give us a sense of how big automotive is now as a percentage of Tegra?","","Jen-Hsun Huang","I would say that is totaling about 25% of Tegra and accelerating, but the way to think about automotive is the automotive, the modern car is a connected car and so digital computing matters more than ever. And instead of using traditional mechanical instrumentation, our digital clusters provide them the opportunity to modernize the driving experience. The GPU because of the GPGPU, the programmable GPU inside our processors make possible all kinds of new driver assistance capability, because of computer vision, because of driver assistance, artificial intelligence, type of capabilities, but we make cars safer and we make cars fun to drive. And so from digital clusters to infotainment systems to in the future driver assistance, the car is going to be an opportunity for more than just one GPU. And as we see the success of the Tesla electric car, I think you are going to see more and more car companies follow soon and be much more aggressive in adding mobile computing into the car. This is an area that we have invested quite a lot of effort over the years and our expectation is to see continued success here. The design wins\u2026.","","Romit Shah - Nomura","Alright, thank you.","","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James. Please proceed.","","Hans Mosesmann \u2013 Raymond James","Thanks and congrats on a good quarter. My first question, Jen-Hsun, can you give us an update on the Tegra 4i and that roadmap as the certification we see from the sales in the next several quarters and I have a follow up?","","Jen-Hsun Huang","Thanks Hans. I appreciate that. Let\u2019s see we have said earlier previously that Tegra 4i projects are in development and that we expect unlikely to be announced in Q1 and ship no later than Q2. I appreciate you asking and we didn\u2019t announce it, but Tegra 4i has now been certified through AT&T. And we are really excited about that. And so we are going to continue to wait to announce the prices, but has some certain type of voice and data.","","Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James","Okay, that\u2019s great to hear. And then as a follow-up, because the Tegra 4i is implementing the software-defined approach in terms of the modem, what do you suppose would be the implications of this type of in the cars compared to some of your potential rivals that are struggling with using this traditional hardware approaches? Thanks.","","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, the benefit of software-defined radios is to be able to reuse that processor or maybe different protocols. And if the processor is designed with enough headroom, we will be able to support higher bid leads in an ever changing landscape of protocols. And so if you look at our progress, our progress with respect to getting Tegra 4i certified and the i500 has also by the way been certified for voice and data. Our speed of getting, our share of modem certified certainly is an indication of the flexibility of the SDR. Now one of the historical challenges of SDR is thought to be power consumption but those are not fundamental problems, they are architectural technology challenges and with the right technology and architecture and a lot of great care we have been able to make Tegra 4i and the i500 modems fit within very aggressive and competitive power envelopes and so we\u2019re in pretty great shape there and I\u2019m looking forward to launching cautiously [ph].","","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank Securities. Please proceed.","","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities","I was just wondering for a little bit more color for the fourth quarter, Colette you mentioned a little bit about Tegra being up strongly. On the GPU side can you say again what you expect that to do and anymore color underneath the surface there and on the professional side versus desktop, notebook et cetera would be appreciated. Thank you.","","Colette Kress","So we\u2019re indicating in our guidance for Q4 that we will essentially flat in Q4 versus Q3. We did articulate that our Tegra business would be up sequentially so therefore our overall GPU business will be slightly down from Q3 in total. We still believe strong growth in terms of the overall gaming, side of that we will continuously go into Q4 but overall the PC market and our low end PC GPUs are probably expected to continue what we have been seen in Q3.","","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities","And can you give any color on within the GPU segment what percent you talk about is gaming? I think you said that overall is up about 6% year-to-date, year-over-year which is impressive growth but just to give us an idea of how much of your GPU segment that represents?","","Colette Kress","It represents about 400 give or take on the individual quarter, our overall gaming segment.","","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities","And then my last question very quickly. What sort of seasonality should we expect in your Tegra business? I know you have a multitude of things ramping and even with the Tegra 4i coming. How should we think about the launches of new products offsetting seasonality and whatever that seasonality maybe, any color on that will be great and then I\u2019ll go away. Thank you.","","Colette Kress","I\u2019m not sure there is a seasonality on the Tegra business that we could point to at this stage. I think it's going to take a little while to better understand that and even all the way through fiscal year \u201915, some us we can add any color at this time in terms of when those volumes each of the designs would come through.","","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of JoAnne Feeney with ABR Investment Strategy. Please proceed.","","JoAnne Feeney - ABR Investment Strategy","Just a question about the graphics situation on the Quadro side. You had nice growth last quarter, I\u2019m wondering what you see for an outlook for that product line so longer term and what you think is a positive drivers have been to-date?","","Jen-Hsun Huang","Let\u2019s see the Quadro growth drivers are fundamentally related to the fact that more and more companies are using digital design approaches for every aspect of their product design. You know there is so many companies who still use mechanical prototype, actual prototyping and but today unless you know if you really want to be able to stay with the art, create devices that has exquisite as what we see in the marketplace today or it is that you like to do more 3D virtual prototyping. All that is going to require you to invest in designing in 3D. We\u2019re just seeing great and great adoption of 3D design in all aspects of product design. Now the second growth factor has to do with the fact that we\u2019re able to now because of our rendering techniques able to be we\u2019re able to add value to our larger part of their workflow whereas before we were used for design, we\u2019re now used largely \u2013 we are also used largely for style, because our digitalization on rendering is total realistic now. We can capture real materials, some of the results and actually render using computers, the ability to prototype devices that are total realistic. We are also increasingly being used in product lifetime management and so PLM. And that\u2019s just an increase in the number of people inside companies that we need to use 3D access, whether it\u2019s in training or documentation or managing their supply chain, managing their subcontractors, inventory management, parts repairs. So more and more of the entire product lifetime includes 3D, where Quadro could be useful. And then lastly, more and more countries are continuing to adopt manufacturing not just for \u2013 not just in the supply chain level, but at the design level. And so Quadro continues to surprise us with the signs of the overall market. And I think when we innovate and we discover that the market is larger than people had ever expected.","","JoAnne Feeney - ABR Investment Strategy","Okay. And so right, all good drivers and in the past you have been talking about Quadro as sort of growing at the rate of GDP and then we saw that very sharp pickup. So I am wondering if you think the increase in sequential growth that we have seen in the last few quarters is sustainable or if we have perhaps obtain a new adoption rate that\u2019s likely to settle down, how do you view this feature in this?","","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, I guess I don\u2019t know that I could be particularly precise about it, but the thing that I do know is our market share in Quadro is very high. I really don\u2019t know of any car company or movie studio or digital broadcast station or oil or gas company that doesn\u2019t use Quadro in a large part of their internal workflow. And so I think that the real opportunity for us is of course continue to expand globally and work with OEMs around the world to see their work stations be adopted by the various industries. That\u2019s a deliberate effort on our part and we have OEM partnerships in every geography to extend their reach and their understanding of workstations in the local industries. And as secondarily to continue to create new ways for workstation to be useful, to more people, to more professionals inside a company expanding our reach of good workflow, in those two dimensions we continue to innovate and then we continue to drive hard, I think we are going to \u2013 we have every opportunity to outgrow the GDP and so we will see how it turns out but that\u2019s our deliberate strategy anyhow.","","JoAnne Feeney - ABR Investment Strategy","Okay, great that\u2019s helpful. And then if I could ask a question on the gross margin, so this quarter, it looks like a fairly notable decline in the gross margin and I am wondering about the drivers, especially since what you are seeing? And the notebook graphics side you said is decline in your lowest margin business would suggest that the gross margin also be moving higher, so is it the price cuts recently that\u2019s driving those gross margins down this quarter or is it more broadly a shift in mix?","","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, there is three components that were notable this quarter. We made pricing changes that were planned at the end of the quarter, but it affected our pricing for the entire quarter, that\u2019s one which is our GTX\u2026","","JoAnne Feeney - ABR Investment Strategy","Jen-Hsun, I am talking about the out quarter actually for the January quarter, the decline that we are anticipating I am wondering what\u2019s driving that?","","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, I guess it was number one be Tegra. We are expecting to be successful \u2013 more successful with Tegra and Tegra\u2019s gross margins are below the corporate average and the success there is good. The success there is good and it\u2019s welcomed and so it will have an impact on our gross margins.","","JoAnne Feeney - ABR Investment Strategy","Okay, that makes a lot of sense. And then on the pricing front, those price cuts that you have sent through just recently, is there any need that you will have at some point to offer rebates to your card partners for them to sell those products they bought GPUs from you at the older prices. I\u2019m wondering if there is any kind of concern that there might be an inventory problem or a rebate that you will need to give the card partners at home [ph].","","Jim Fish","We planned for this move for quite some time and we\u2019ve been thoughtful about this move for quite some time and everything that we have announced and everything that is out in the marketplace has been the planned and with our partners and so I think we\u2019re in pretty good shape.","","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alex Gauna with JMP Securities. Please proceed.","","Alex Gauna - JMP Securities","Jen-Hsun if I heard you correctly earlier you said that automotive is about 25% of Tegra. Can you give us an idea of percentage exposure perhaps to Windows, to Android, to also Chrome and then maybe can you give us an idea of how you see your Android and even Windows ecosystem expanding beyond tablets here in the HP 21 inch all-in-one a pretty amazing machine, at a pretty amazing price. What\u2019s the outlook there getting beyond phones, beyond tablets with Tegra? Thank you.","","Jen-Hsun Huang","Almost vastly everything else is Android. We have some for WinRT or Surface but our focus is that going forward the vast majority of Windows on ARM will be surface and the vast majority of everything else in Tegra is Android. Now with respect to Android you\u2019re absolutely right, that Android is not just about phones. Android is the most disruptive operating system that we have seen in a few decades, in a couple of decades and this time because of the open source nature of Android it could be adapted to all kinds of devices. You see that all of a sudden not only is Android and smartphones it was in tablets, it's now in all-in-one PCs, I think three all-in-one PCs based on Tegra was announced this last quarter. You\u2019re going to see more of them. It's quite delightful to be able to buy a monitor, bring it home and plug it in and it's already a computer and if you like you could still connect it to HDMI to a PC and use it as PC. You\u2019re going to see Android in all kinds of other computing devices including set top box and others and so Android is probably the most versatile operating system that we have ever known and has the benefit of also being connected to the cloud and so the day that you turn it on it's incredibly useful with all kinds of applications already on it. And so that\u2019s Android.","And Chrome we have no exposure to Chrome today, but it's proven to be quite an important operating system. We have known all along that technologically it's incredibly robust, resilient and high quality and now we\u2019re seeing quite strong adoptions all over the world and so this is an area that warrants focus on our part and we will put some energy around it to go see we can make a contribution in this phase as well.","","Alex Gauna - JMP Securities","Two part follow-up if I could Jen-Hsun.","","Rob Csongor","I\u2019m sorry, let\u2019s keep it at two if we can all right, let\u2019s keep it two per person we\u2019re starting spread on that. Can we let\u2019s move on to the next caller. Sorry, Alex we will pick it up next time, we will follow-up with you.","","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan","Just on the GRID, 2012 weeks [ph] out I think that\u2019s about a 40% increase on the prior quarter. Off that incremental growth what types of customers and applications did you bring on and when you guys expect these trials to start materialize into significant revenues?","","Jen-Hsun Huang","We announced GRID, I mean that is it is probably one of the most successful product launches for enterprise that we have ever had and you could argue that this is really the NVIDIA first\u2019s enterprise product because we\u2019re stationed in this sweet spot of enterprise computing, it's a specialized part of enterprise computing and Tesla is for high performance computing which is not in this sweet spot of enterprise computing, this is the first time that we have been in a sweet spot of enterprise computing and had the benefit of the sales force of every major OEM in the world supporting its launch from Cisco to Dell to HP to IBM, Fujitsu, Hitachi, I don\u2019t know any global enterprise IT company who isn\u2019t supporting grid and taking it to market, the type of applications that \u2013 and we have to support the Citrix with VMware, Citrix, we announced in Q2, I think it was and VMware this last quarter. And so we have sales force, we have the largest extended sales force obtaining product that we have ever had. The type of applications that people are using it for are really essentially taking their PC and virtualizing and putting into the datacenter and the power of doing that is now you can access your PC from anywhere on any device. With a Citrix receiver client with a VMware receiver client, you can now have your PC literally anywhere.","Now, there are several powerful benefits to that. For the people who are designing and working on large datasets, the benefit is that you move your computer closer to the data. So instead of moving the data to the computer, you are moving the computer to the data. And so for big data problems, large datasets, data or projects where you are collaborating with a whole lot of other people, you now don\u2019t have a whole lot of different copies of the data. You also have the benefit of mobility. People are using more and more mobile devices and people are working from customer sites and working from home or giving demos, the benefit of having mobility is really incredible. So there is a lot of different benefits associated with it. And then now with the cost of storage continuing to reduce and the cost of networking continue to reduce you can now make these virtualized PC environments much more cost effectively. So I think our timing is good. Your question about the options about trial to ramp, these are enterprise trials and my sense is that somewhere six months to nine months is what we are experiencing. And so we will see how it turns out, but the trouble we have going around the world are large important customers who have significant deployment to do as the early response has been really fantastic.","","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan","Thanks for that, Jen-Hsun. And then just a quick housekeeping question, so historically the team has seen about a $25 million, $30 million increase in OpEx in fiscal Q1 due to kind of the fringe benefit step up, is that how we should be thinking about it for Q1 of next year?","","Colette Kress","We are not necessarily here to talk about our Q1. In Q1, primarily it\u2019s regarding our payroll taxes that can drive an increase, but this time we are not giving a full look in terms of fiscal year \u201815.","","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan","Okay, thank you.","","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yes, thanks a lot.","","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Amir with Lazard Capital Markets. Please proceed.","","Daniel Amir - Lazard Capital Markets","Yes, thanks a lot. Thank you for taking my call. A couple of questions here. So on the Tegra, what type of milestones should we be looking at here in the next few quarters in terms of really seeing how successful the 4 and 4i is going to be compared to the 3 when that launched and the traction that you had initially with that product?","","Jen-Hsun Huang","I would look at several things. I think at this time the strategy that I have laid out for you guys is 4 basically shows several things. One, we believe that Tegra 4, we delayed Tegra 4 so that we could pull in our Logan Project and also our motives. I am delighted with that decision. It put a trough in this year. However, we have bounced out [ph] from that. I think that what you will see is several points. One, there will be more devices ramped with Tegra 4. Tegra 4 should continue to contribute to our momentum recovering in Tegra. You should see that Tegra is adopted in more than just phones, that there will be phones and tablets and other devices, automotive and other devices. And then third and you should see our modems come to market with important devices that I think people will love using and then lastly the gap between Tegra 4 and our next generation processor Project Logan should be a lot shorter than one year. And so I think all of that is on track and we will keep an eye on it. But those will be the major differences between Tegra 4, Tegra 4i and Logan versus Tegra 3.","","Daniel Amir - Lazard Capital Markets","And just one follow-up on the OpEx I know that you\u2019re not giving full of guidance on the next year by just understanding in terms of the Tegra spending I mean how should we be looking at that on a year-over-year because I guess that does have an impact in terms of how we should look at next year's R&D expenses to some extent. Thanks.","","Jen-Hsun Huang","In the beginning of the year we said that we are targeting 1.6 billion for our total OpEx for the year and based on what Colette just described we\u2019re right on target on 1.6 billion. If you looked at the growth quarter-to-quarter by and large I think we\u2019re and we have said before that when the pickup in investment to support our modem projects and our modem projects has two different pieces, one piece is data modem which I don't think anyone disputes is important in many of our market segments, nor does anybody particularly concerned that FDR is a great platform for data modem there was a question about a voice modem and we have picked up our investment this quarter as it's too famous [ph]. I think we\u2019re at those levels and when the time comes for Q1 on guidance we will tell sure more but you know we\u2019re invested into the markets that we believe we want to be invested in.","","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets","Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of Tegra? You got a few different go to market strategies there with your SHIELD and the Note Project. Can you give us an update on how both of those are doing and maybe what percentage of Tegra revs are coming from each?","","Jen-Hsun Huang","Tegra Note is a reference platform. Tegra Note is a reference platform, albeit very complete. It has the additional qualities that the software is very polished and that includes features like stylus, the world's first high-performance passive stylus that is unique. It has the world's first always on HDR that is unique, so it has the capabilities that no other tablets have. No other devices have and has the benefit of having software that\u2019s completely polished and refined.","But otherwise it's a reference platform and we direct our partners particularly local brand around the world who don't have the ability to invest in building such a great device at the audience at that we partner with to have these devices built. But in the end our business model there is to sell a chip and we partner with local brand (indiscernible) on the world to take these devices to market.","With respect to SHIELD it is our initiative to cultivate the gaming marketplace for Android. We believe that Android is going to be a very important platform for gaming in the future and to do so we have to create devices that enable great gaming to happen on Android. Our investment there is modest, our expectations are modest, and our distribution is modest. We built these devices that are in the hands of every developer in the world now. And the reviews have been fantastic and we are going to let the market tell us how they like it and then we will take it from there. And so for Tegra, we know the business model ultimately is to sell chips partnered with partners like we do with GeForce. In the case of SHIELD, it is an NVIDIA branded product, but we are pushing it modestly and carefully.","","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets","Great. If you could maybe offer us a little bit of insight into the progress you are having with 4i, it\u2019s great to hear that it\u2019s been certified what type of launch and how big a breadth of launch do you expect 4i to have on the business for Tegra?","","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, it\u2019s our first voice modem product. And so my expectations are that the devices will be quite terrific and I think people will be delighted by the OEM that it comes from. It will likely be global, but not U.S. You really need to have CDMA in the U.S. to be successful. And so we are not targeting U.S. with respect to phones, we are targeting outside the U.S. And so let\u2019s go then wait and see until Q2 timeframe \u2013 Q1 timeframe when it gets launched in Q2 timeframe when it gets shipped. But my expectation is that it should be really wonderful. Okay?","","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets","Great, thank you.","","Jen-Hsun Huang","Thanks a lot, Doug.","","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rajvindra Gill with Needham & Company. Please proceed.","","Rajvindra Gill - Needham & Company","Yes, thanks for taking my question. Jen-Hsun, just on the competitive landscape in the handset market and to a lesser extent the tablet market for Tegra going forward, as you know the competition is intensified from players like Mediatek and Spreadtrum on low end, but also other players and you have kind of seen Broadcom face a lot of challenges trying to break into this market. So I just wonder if you could speak to that a little bit and how do you think about the competitive landscape going forward? Thank you.","","Jen-Hsun Huang","I appreciate the question Rajv. First of all, Tegra is not just about phones. Although we have found success with (indiscernible) we have found success with others and we participated in building some of the most exciting super phones in the marketplace and we will continue to do that. Tegra is not just about phones. Unlike the companies that use names, NVIDIA\u2019s application processors can be successful and very successful without motives. However, there are many segments of our market going forward where a data modem is important to have. And Icera gives us a platform to build the data modems, which we are very successful at already. I think the risk of our data modem success is not at all a concern. And in fact, we are incredibly proud of the performance of our data modem. It\u2019s a piece of technology and a companion part of our technology offering that\u2019s really important for us to have.","If you look at Tegra therefore whether it\u2019s in phones or tablets or cars, setup boxes, gaming devices, all-in-one PCs, home PCs, they all require the same application processor. And so Tegra is more than just phones. And in many of those segments, our data modem is very important to have. And in one segment, a voice modem is very important to have. And so the way to think about our position \u2013 the way to think about our position, you have to think about the whole Android, the whole mobile technology market, you can\u2019t just think about phones, which is very unlikely to companies that you mentioned earlier. They tend to be very phone centric. We are just simply not. Now, I understand that last couple of years that the only conversation has been around phones, but we all know that the conversation around Android is going to expand far beyond phones and this is an area that we can add a lot to the conversation.","","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Glen Yeung with Citi. Please proceed.","","Unidentified Analyst","This is (indiscernible) on behalf of Glen Yeung. Another question about automotive perhaps longer term in nature, are you still on track to reach a stated goal of 450 million sales contribution by fiscal \u201916?","","Jen-Hsun Huang","We\u2019re still on in fact doubling that business every year and so the answer to your question is yes. And we continue to capture design wins and computing an automotive is increasing in importance every year.","","Unidentified Analyst","And can you speak on the design wins at automotive OEMs that\u2019s needed to get that current business from 30 million a quarter currently to that 450 million target.","","Jen-Hsun Huang","We already have it. You know design wins are shipping as many years as you know in the car. And so it's multi-years, yet to work on a project for couple two, three years before you ship it. So we already have it.","","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Jen-Hsun how should we conceptually think about videos growth drivers in 2014 if the PC market stays somewhat weak the smartphone market remains embedded and I think you mentioned it could take some time for it to run. So how would you rank order your growth drivers for next year?","","Jen-Hsun Huang","I would say in terms of absolute dollars number one would be Tegra. In terms of so that\u2019s number one, number two would be Tesla. Number three would be PC gaming which is GeForce GTX. Number four although the buildup of potential is likely the greatest with GRID you\u2019re right that is off of a small base today. And so I would say number four to GRID but the following years GRID could very well being the largest growth driver.","","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then maybe as follow-up to Colette your onshore cash is about 600 million, it used to be about 1.5 billion before. I\u2019m wondering what is the minimum that you need to maintain to run the business, and off the quarterly free cash flow that you generate how much is domestic so we can think about what is the coverage of dividends and whatever is left in terms of the buybacks that you\u2019ve announced.","","Colette Kress","Yes you\u2019re correct in terms of the amount of cash that we have in the overall U.S. basis which is generally about what we need for our overall dividend. So with our intent going forward to return a bit more to shareholders 1 billion in fiscal year \u201915 that will emphasize that we will come back with the options in terms of how we will do that going forward but at this time we\u2019re not here to really kind of breakdown the cash flow between U.S. base and international base, or those pieces but we will come back to you in about a quarter and give you a little bit more detail on those plan.","","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","But off the quarterly cash flow that you generate Colette just looking at the last four quarters, how much was onshore just as a percentage. Is it 25%, 30% any number would be helpful. Thank you.","","Colette Kress","Not something we talk about I think it's something that\u2019s not necessarily overly consistent in terms of every single quarter. So just looking at the last quarter is not necessarily a clear indicator given where our capital expenditures are and\/or where some of the new revenue pieces come in. So we will just come back to you in a quarter with a little bit more detail, okay?","","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay.

Good afternoon everyone and welcome to NVIDIA's conference call for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. With me on the call today from NVIDIA are Jen-Hsun Huang, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Colette Kress, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","I'd like to remind you that our call is being webcast live on NVIDIA's Investor Relations website. It is also being recorded. You can hear a replay by telephone until February 16, 2018. The webcast will be available for replay up until next quarter's conference call to discuss our fiscal first quarter financial results.","The contents of today's call is NVIDIA's property, it can't be reproduced or transcribed without our prior written consent.","During this call, we may make forward-looking statements based on current expectations.

You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO Commentary, which is posted on our website.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Colette.","Colette Kress","Thanks, Simona. We had an excellent quarter and fiscal 2018 led by strong growth in our Gaming and Data Center businesses.","Q4 revenue reached $2.91 billion, up 34% year-on-year, up 10% sequentially and well above our outlook of $2.65 billion. All measures of profitability set records. They also hit important milestones. For the first time, gross margins strongly exceeded 60%, non-GAAP operating margins exceeded 40% and net income exceeded $1 billion.","Fiscal 2018 revenue was $9.71 billion, up 41% or $2.8 billion above the previous year. These short platforms posted record full year revenue with data center growing triple digit. From a reporting segment perspective, Q4 GPU revenue grew 33% from last year to 2.46 billion. Tegra Processor revenue rose 75% to $450 million.","Let\u2019s start with our Gaming business. Q4 revenue was $1.74 billion, up 29% year-on-year and up 11% sequentially with growth across all regions, driving GPU demand for a number of great titles during the holiday season, including Players Battleground, PUBG, Destiny 2, Call of Duty, World War II, Star Wars: Battlefront 2. PUBG continued its remarkable run reaching almost 30 million players and recording more than 3 million concurrent players.","These games delivered stunning, visible effects that requires strong graphics performance, which is driven a shift toward the higher end of our gaming portfolio and adoption of our Pascal architecture. eSports continues to grow, expanding the overall industry and our business. And one sign of their popularity Activision Overwatch League launched in January and reached 10 million viewers globally in its first week.","We had a busy start to the year with a number of announcements at the Annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. We introduced NVIDIA BFGDs, Big Format Gaming Displays in a partnership with ACER, ASUS and HP. The high-end 65-inch 4K displays enable ultralow latency gaming and interrogate our shield streaming devices, offering popular apps such Netflix, Gaming Video, YouTube and Hulu, the BFGD 19 best of show awards from various publications.","We expanded the free beta of GeForce now beyond Macs to Window based PCs and we enhanced GeForce's experience with new features, including NVIDIA Freestyle for customizing gameplay with various filters and updated NVIDIA Ansel photo mode and support for new titles with ShadowPlay Highlights for capturing gaming achievements.","Additionally, the Nintendo Switch gaming console contributed to our growth, as it became the fastest selling console of all time in the U.S. Strong demand in the cryptocurrency market exceeded our expectations. We met some of this demand with a dedicated board in our OEM business and some was not with our gaming GPUs.","This contributed to lower than historical channel inventory levels of our gaming GPUs throughout the quarter. While the overall contribution of cryptocurrency to our business remains difficult to quantify, we believe it was a higher percentage of revenue than the prior quarter. That said, our main focus remains on our core gaming market, as cryptocurrency trends will likely remain volatile.","Moving to data center, revenue of $606 million was up 105% year-on-year and up 20% sequentially. This excellent performance reflected strong adoption of Tesla V100 GPUs based on our Volta architecture, which began shipping in Q2 and continued to ramp in Q3 and Q4. V100 are available through every major computer maker and have been chosen by every major cloud provider to deliver AI and high performance computing.","Hyperscale and cloud customers adopting the V100 include Alibaba, Amazon Web Services, Baidu, Google, IBM, Microsoft Azure, Oracle and Samsung. We continued our leadership in AI training markets where our GPUs remain the platform of choice for training, learning networks.","During the quarter, Japan's preferred networks trends ResNet-503 network for image classification in a record of 15 minute by using 1,024 Tesla P100 GPUs. Our newer generation V100 delivered even higher performance with the Volta architecture offering 10 times the deep learning performance of Pascal.","We also saw a growing traction in the AI inference market where NVIDIA's platform can improve performance and efficiency by orders of magnitude over CPUs. We continue to view AI inference as a significant new opportunity for our data center GPUs. Hyperscale inference applications that runs on GPUs includes speech recognition, image and video analytics, recommender system, translations, search and a natural language processing.","The data center business also benefited from strong growth and high performance computing. The HPC community has increasingly moved to accelerated computing in recent years as Moore\u2019s law has begun to level off indeed more than 500 HPC applications are now GPU accelerated including all of the top 15.","NVIDIA added a record 34 new GPU accelerated system to the latest top 500 supercomputer lift, bringing our total to 87 systems. We increased our total petaflops of list by 28% and we captured 14 of the top 20 slots on the Green500 list of the world\u2019s most energy efficient supercomputers.","During the quarter, we continue to support the build out of major next generation supercomputers among them that the U.S. Department of Energy's Summit System expected to be the world\u2019s most powerful supercomputer when it comes online later this year. We also announced new wins such as Japan\u2019s fastest AI supercomputer, the ABCI system, which leverages more than 4,000 Tesla V100 GPUs.","Importantly, we are starting to see the conversions of HPC and AI as scientists embrace AI to solve problems faster. Modern supercomputers will need to support multiprocessing computation for applying deep learning together with simulation and testing. By combining AI with HPC, supercomputers can deliver increased performance that is orders of magnitude greater in computations ranging from particle physics to drug discovery to astrophysics.","We are also seeing traction for AI in a growing number of vertical industries such as transportation, energy, manufacturing, smart cities, and healthcare. We announced engagements with GE Health and Nuance in medical imaging, Baker Hughes, a GE company in oil and gas and Japan Komatsu in construction and mining.","Moving to professional visualization, fourth quarter revenue grew to a record 254 million, up 13% from a year ago, up 6% sequentially, driven by demand for real-time rendering as well as emerging applications like AI and VR. These emerging applications now represent approximately 30% of pro visualization sales.","We saw strength across several key industries including defense, manufacturing, energy, healthcare and internet service providers among key customers high end quality products are being used by GlaxoSmithKline for AI and by Pemex oil and gas for seismic processing and visualization.","Turning to automotive. In automotive for fourth quarter, revenue grew 3% on year to 132 million and was down 8% sequentially. The sequential decline reflects our condition from infotainment which is becoming commoditized to next generation AI cockpits systems and complete top to bottom self-driving vehicle platforms built on NVIDIA hardware and software.","At CES, we demonstrated our leadership position in autonomous vehicles with several key milestones and new partnership that point to AI self-driving cars, moving from deployment to production. In a scanning room only key note that drew nearly 8,000 attendees, Jensen announced that DRIVE Xavier the world's first autonomous machine processor will be available to customers this quarter with more than 9 billion transistors DRIVE Xavier is the most complex system on ever created.","We also announced in NVIDIA Drive is the world's first functionally saved AI self-driving platform, enabling automakers to create autonomous vehicles they can operate safely and necessary ingredient for going to market. Additionally, we announced a number of collaboration of CES including with Uber, which has been using in video technology for the AI continuing system and its fleet of self-driving cars and freight trucks.","We announced that ZF and Baidu are using NVIDIA Drive self-driving technology to create a production ready AI autonomous vehicle platform for China, the world's largest automotive market. Production vehicles utilizing this technology including those from chariots expected on the road by 2020. We also announced partnership with Aurora which is working to create a modular scalable Level 4 and Level 5 self-driving hardware platform incorporating the NVIDIA Drive Xavier processor.","Jen-Hsun Huang joined on stage by Volkswagen CEO, Herbert Diess, they announced the new generation of intelligently VW vehicles for using NVIDIA Drive intelligent experience or drive IX, platform to create the new AI infused cockpit experiences and improved safety. Later CES, Mercedes-Benz announced that MBUX its new AI based smart cockpit uses NVIDIA graphics in the AI technologies. The MBUX user experience which includes beautiful touch screen displays and a new voice activated assistant, they viewed it last week at Mercedes-Benz A-Class compact car and we will shift this frame. And earlier this week, we announced a partnership with Continental to build AI self-driving vehicle systems from enhanced Level 2 to Level 5 for production in 2021.","There are now more than 320 companies and research institutions using the NVIDIA Drive platform that\u2019s up 50% from a year ago and encompasses virtually every car marker, truck maker, robo-taxi company, mapping company, center manufacture and self starter in the autonomous vehicle ecosystem. With this growing momentum, we remain excited about the inter-meet to long-term opportunities for autonomous driving.","Now turning to the rest of the P&L. Q4 GAAP gross margins was 61.9% and non-GAAP was 62.1%, record that reflect continued growth in our value-added platforms. GAAP operating expenses were $728 million and non-GAAP operating expenses were $607 million up 28% and 22% year-over-year respectively. We continue to invest in the key platforms driving our long-term growth including Gaming, AI and automotive.","GAAP EPS was $1.78, up 80% from a year earlier, some of the upside was driven by a lower than expected tax rate, as a result of U.S. tax reform and excess tax benefits related to stock based compensation. Our fourth quarter GAAP effective tax rate was a benefit of 3.7% compared with our expectation of a tax rate of 17.5%. Non-GAAP EPS was a $1.72, up 52% from a year ago, reflecting a quarterly tax rate of 10.5% compared with our expectation of 17.5%.","We returned $1.25 billion to shareholders in the fiscal year through a combination of quarterly dividends and share repurchases. Our quarterly cash from operations reached record levels at $1.36 billion, bringing our fiscal year total to a record $3.5 billion. Capital expenditures were $469 million for the four quarter, inclusive of $335 million associated with the purchase of our previously financed Santa Clara campus building.","Let me take a moment to provide a bit more detail on the impact of U.S. corporate tax reform on the quarter and our go forward financials. In Q4, we reported a GAAP only one-time net tax benefit of $133 million or $0.21 per diluted share. This is primarily related to provisional tax amounts for the transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and re-measurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We previously accrued for taxes on a portion of foreign earnings in excess of the provisional tax amount recorded for the transition tax hence the one-time benefit.","For fiscal 2019, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be around 12% which is down from approximately 17% previously. This does not take into effect the excess tax benefit from stock based compensation, which depending stock price investing schedule could increase or decrease our tax rate in GAAP in a given quarter.","In terms of our capital allocation priorities, we continue to focus first and foremost on investing in our business as we see significant opportunities ahead. Our lower tax rate strengthens our ability to invest in both OpEx such as adding engineering talent as well as CapEx such as investing in supercomputers for internal AI development. In addition, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders, with our plan remaining at $1.25 billion for fiscal 2019.","With that, let me turn to the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2019. We expect revenue to be $2.9 billion plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 62.7% and 63% respectively plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $770 million and $645 million respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP OI&Es are both expected to be nominal. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 12% plus or minus 1% excluding discrete items.","For the full fiscal year 2019, we expect our operating expenses to grow at a similar pace as in Q1. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website.","In closing, I like to highlight a few upcoming events for the financial community will be presenting at the Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet Conference on February 13th and at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media and Telecom Conference on February 26th. We will also be hosting our Annual Investor Day on March 27th in Sam Hose on the sidelines of our annual GPU Technology Conference, which we are very excited about.","We will now open the call for questions. Operator, will you pole for questions please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of C. J. Muse from Evercore.","C. J. Muse","I guess first question when I think about normal seasonality for gaming that would imply data center potentially more than $700 million plus into the coming quarter. And so, curious if I am thinking about that right whether crypto has been modeled more conservatively by you guys, and so would love to hear your thoughts there?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Which way is more conservatively?","C. J. Muse","Yes, sorry.","Jen-Hsun Huang","When you say conservatively, which direction are you saying was are you implying up or down?","C. J. Muse","Well curiously to your thoughts there.","Jen-Hsun Huang","We model crypto approximately flat.","C. J. Muse","Okay. And then I guess as part of the larger question. How are you thinking about seasonality for gaming into the quarter?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, there are a lot of dynamics going on in gaming, what dynamic of course is that there is a fairly sizable pent up demand going into this quarter. But I think a larger dynamics that are happening relate to just a really amazing games that are out right now. PUBG is doing incredibly well as you might have known and it\u2019s become a global phenomenon and whether it\u2019s here in United States or Europe or in China, in Asia. PUBG is just doing incredibly well and we expect other developers that come with up similar genre like PUBG that can become in the near future and I am super excited about these games.","And there is of course Call of Duty, there is Star Wars that, there are just only so many great games around the market like today. Overwatch and League of Legends are still doing well. They just catalyst number of great franchises that are out in the marketplace and the gaming market is growing and production valley is going up and that's driving increased unit sales of GPUs as well as APSs of GPUs. And so, I think those are that\u2019s probably the larger dynamic of gaming.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Lopasif with Jefferies.","Q - Mark Lopasif","The first question, the checks we've done indicate that the Tensor Core you put into Volta give it a huge advantage in neural network applications in the data center. I am wondering whether the Tensor Core might also have a similar kind of utility in the gaming market?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yes, first of all I appreciate you are asking a Tensor Core question. It is probably the single biggest innovation we had last year in data centers. Our GPU the equivalent performance to one of our GPUs, and one of our multi-GPUs would take something along the lines of 20 plus GPUs or 10 plus notes. And so one GPU alone would do deep learning so fast that it would 10 plus CPU powered server notes to keep it with. And then Tensor Core comes along last year and we increased the throughput of deep learning, increased the computation throughput deep learning by another factor of eight. And so Tensor Core really illustrates the power of GPU, it's very unlike a CPU when the instruction sets remain locked for a long-term and its hard, it's difficult to advance.","In the case of our GPUs and with could that\u2019s one of its fundamental advantages, we can continue to year in and year out, continue to add new facilities to it. And so Tensor Core boost of the original great performance of our GPU is really raised the bar last year. And as ColetteI said earlier, our Volta GPU has now been adopted all over the world whether it's in China with Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu, iFlytek too. Here in United States Amazon and Facebook and Google and Microsoft and IBM and Oracle. And in Europe and Japan, the number of cloud service provides that have adopted Volta has been terrific.","And I think I already really appreciated the work that we did with Tensor Core and although the updates they are now coming out from the frameworks, Tensor Core is the new instruction fit and new architecture and the deep learning developers have really jumped on it and almost every deep learning frame work is being optimized to take advantage of Tensor Core. On the inference side, on the inference side and that\u2019s where it would play a role in video games. You could use deep learning now to synthesize and to generate new art, and we been demonstrating some of that as you could see, if you could you seen some of that whether it improve the quality of textures, generating artificial, characters, animating characters, whether its facial animation with for speech or body animation.","The type of work that you could do with deep learning for video games is growing. And that\u2019s where Tensor Core to take up could be a real advantage. If you take a look at the computational that we have in Tensor Core compare to a non optimized GPU or even a CPU, it's now to plus orders of magnitude on greater competition of throughput. And that allows us to do things like synthesize images in real time and synthesize virtual world and make characters and make faces, bringing a new level of virtual reality and artificial intelligence to the video games.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America.","Vivek Arya","Jen-Hsun just a near and longer term question on the data center. Near-term you would have a number of strong quarters in data center, how is the utilization of these GPU? And how do you measure whether you're over or under from a supply prospective? And then longer them, there seems to be a lot of money going into startup developing silicon for deep learning. Is there any advantage they\u2019ve been taking a clean sheet approach? Or is GPU the most optimal answer? Like, if you were starting a new company looking at AI today, would you make another GPU or would you make another ASIC or some other format? Just any color would be helpful?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Sure. In the near-term, the best way to measure customers that are already using our GPUs for deep learning is repeat customers. When they come back another quarter, another quarter and they continue to buy GPUs that would suggest that the workflows continue to increase. The -- with existing customers that already have a very deep penetration, another opportunity for us would be using our GPUs for inference and that\u2019s an untapped growth opportunity for our company that's really, really exciting, we're traction there.","For companies that are not at the forefront, the absolute forefront of deep learning, which -- with the exception of one or two or three hyperscalers, almost everybody else I\u2019ll put in this category. And their deployment, their adoption of deep learning, applying deep learning to all of their applications, is still ongoing. And so I think the second wave of our customers is just showing up. And then there is a third wave of customer which is, they're not hyperscalers, they are internet service -- service applications, internet applications for consumers. They have enormous customer basis and that they could apply to artificial intelligence to, but they run their application in hyperscale clouds.","That third phase of growth is now really spiking and I'm excited about that. And so that's kind of the way to think about it. The pioneers and the first phase are the training customers. Then there is the second phase that\u2019s now ramping. The third phase, that\u2019s now ramping. And then for everybody, we have an opportunity to apply our GPUs for inference. If I had all the money in the world, and I had for example billions and billions of dollars of R&D, I would give it to NVIDIA\u2019s GPU team, which is exactly what I do.","And the reason for that is because GPU was already inherently the world's best high throughput computational processor. A high throughput processor is a lot more complicated than a linear algebra done that you instantiate from a synopsys tool stores. It's not quite that easy. The computation throughput keeping everything moving through your chip with supreme levels of energy efficiency, with all of the software that is -- that\u2019s needed to keep the data flowing with all of the optimizations and you do with each and every one of the frameworks. The amount of complexity there is just really enormous.","The networks are changing all the time, it started out with just basically CNNs and then all kinds of versions of CNNs, now it started out with RNNs and simple RNNs and now there is kinds of LSTMs and gated RNNs and all kinds of interesting networks they're growing. It\u2019s started out with just eight layers and now its 152 layers, going to a 1,000 layers. It started with mostly recognition and now it\u2019s moving to synthesis with GANs. And there's, so many versions of GANs. And so, all of these different types of networks are really, really hard to nail down and we're still at the beginning of AI. So, the ability for our GPUs to be programmable to all of these different architectures and networks, it's just an enormous advantage.","You don't ever have to guess whether NVIDIA GPUs. It could be used for one particular network and other. And so you can buy our GPUs at well and know that every single GPU that you buy gives an opportunity to reduce the number of servers and you data center by 22 nodes, by 10 nodes, 22 CPUs. And so the more GPU you buy, the more money you save. So, I think that capability is really quite unique and like I just give one example from last year or from previous year, we introduced a 16-bit mixed precision, we introduced 8-bit imager, we introduced -- the year before this last year.","This last year, we introduced Tensor core which increased by another factor of nearly 10. Meanwhile our GPUs get more complex, imager efficiency gets better and better every single year and the software origin gets more amazing. And so, it\u2019s a much harder problem than just a multiply accumulator. Artificial intelligence is the single most complex mono software that world is ever known that\u2019s the reason why it\u2019s taken so long to get here, and these high performance supercomputers is an essential ingredient, an essential instrument in advancing AI. And so, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s nearly as simple as liner algebra. But you might have all the money in the world, I would invest it in the team that we have.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.","Stacy Rasgon","I have a question for Colette. So if I correct for the switch revenue growth in the quarter, it means that the gaming business X which was at maybe $140 million or $150 million. In your Q3 commentary, you did not call out crypto was a driver. You are calling out it in Q4. Is it fair to say that like that incremental growth is all crypto? And I guess going forward, you mentioned pent up demand, normally your seasonality for gaming will be down probably double digit. Do you think that pent up demand is enough to reverse that normal seasonal pattern or normally down? And frankly, do you think gamers can even find GPU at retail at this point to buy in order to satisfy that pent up demand?","Colette Kress","So, let me comment on first one. We did talk about our overall crypto business last quarter as well. We indicated how much we had in OEM boards and we also indicated that there was definitely some with our GTX business. Keep in mind that\u2019s very difficult for us to quantify down to the end customers view. But yes, there is also some in our Q3 and we did comment all that. So here, we are commenting in terms of what we saw in terms of Q4. It\u2019s up a bit from what we saw in Q3 and we do again expect probably going forward. Although, Jen-Hsun answered regarding the demand for gamers as we move forward.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yes, so one way to think about the Tensor demand as we typically have somewhere between six to eight weeks for inventory in the channel, and I think you would ascertain that globally right now the channels relatively lean. We're working really hard to get GPU down to the marketplace for the gamers and we\u2019re doing everything to advise retailers and system builders to serve the gamers. And so, we\u2019re doing everything we can, but I think the most important thing is we just got to catching for supply.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mitch Steves with RBC.","Mitch Steves","And I just want to circle back with autos and so with at CES, so it's kind of on track for towards calendar year '19 in that what we see the autonomous kind of ASP uplift. And just the clarify the expected ASP uplift, all around $1,000, is that all right?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yes, it just depends on mix. I think for autonomous vehicle that still have drivers passenger cars, branded cars, ASP anywhere from $500 to $1,000 makes sense. For robot taxies where they are driverless, they are not autonomous vehicles they are actually drivers less vehicles, the ASP will be several $1,000. And in terms of timing, I think that you\u2019re going to see a larger and larger deployment starting this year, and I'm going through next year for sure especially with robust taxies. And then with autonomous vehicles, cars that have autonomous driving capability, automotive driving capability start late 2019, you could see a lot more in 2020 and just almost every creating car by 2022 will have autonomous automatic driving capabilities.","Operator","Your next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.","Toshiya Hari","Jen-Hsun, I was hoping to ask a little bit about inferencing. How big was inferencing within data center in Q4 or fiscal '18? And more importantly, how do you expect that the trend over the next 12 to 18 months?","Jen-Hsun Huang","First of all just the comment about inference, the way that it works as you take the output of these frameworks and the output of these frameworks is a really complex large computational graph. And when you think about these neural networks and they have millions of parameters, millions of parameters, millions of anything is very complex. And these parameters are ways in activation layers and activation functions and they are millions of them. And it's million of them composes consist of this computational graph. And this computational graph has all kind of interesting and complicated layers.","And so you take this computation graphic that comes out of each one of these frameworks and they all are different, they're in different formats, they're in different styles, they're different architectures and they are all different. And you take these computational graphs and you have to find a way to compile it, to optimize this graph, to rationalize all of the things that you could combine and fold, reduce the amount of conflict across all of the recourses that are in your GPU or your processor. And these conflicts could be on to memory and register follows, data paths and it could be the fabric, it could be the framework of interface, it could be the amount of memory.","But you got this computers are really complicated across all these different processors, and the interconnect between GPU, the network connects multiple notes, and so you kind figure out what all these different complex are, resources are and compile and optimize to take advantage of to keep it moving all the time. And so, TensorRT is basically a very sophisticated optimizing graph compilation, graph complier. And it targets each one of our processors, the way it targets Xavier is different than way it targets Volta and the way it targets our inference, the way it targets for low energy for different precisions. Now, all of that targeting is a little bit is different. And so first of all TensorRT, the software of inference that's really where the magic is.","Then, the second thing that we do, we optimize our GPUs for extremely high throughput and to support different precisions because some networks afford to have 8 bit imager or even less, some really can barely get by with 16 bit floating point and some you really would like to keep it at 32 bit floating point. So, that you don't have to expect and guess about any precisions that you lost along the way. And so, we created an architecture that consists of this optimizing graph, computational graph complier to processors that are very high throughout that makes precision. Okay. So that\u2019s kind of the background. We start -- we've been sampling our Tesla P4, which is our data center inference processor.","And we\u2019re seeing just really existing response. And this quarter, we started shipping, we\u2019re looking outwards. My sense is that the inference market is probably about as large in the data centers as training, and the wonderful thing is everything that you train our processor will inference wonderfully in our processors as well. And the data centers are really awakening to the observation that the more GPUs they buy for uploading inference and training, the more money they save.","And the amount of money they save is not 20% or 50%, its factors of 10%. The money savings for all these data centers that are becoming increasingly capital constrained is really quite dramatic. And then the other inference opportunity for us is autonomous machines, which is self-driving cars. TensorRT also targets Xavier, TensorRT targets our Pegasus, a robot taxi computer and they all have to inference incredibly efficiently, so that we can sustain real-time, keeping energy level low and keep the cost low, keep the cost low for core companies. Okay. So I think inference is a very important work for us. It is very complicated work and we\u2019re making great progress.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays.","Blayne Curtis","Just kind of curious as you look at the gaming business, I have kind of lost track with seasonality as you really have a big ramp ahead. And I\u2019m just kind of curious as we think about Pascal of our seasonality ahead of Volta, if you could just kind of extrapolate as you look out into April and maybe July?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, we don't -- we haven\u2019t announced 2018 for April or July. And so the best way to think about that is, Pascal is the best gaming platform on the planet. It is the most future feature rich software. The most energy efficient and from $99 to $1,000 you can buy the world\u2019s best GPU, the most advanced GPUs and you buy Pascal you know you got the best. Seasonality is a good question and increasingly because gaming is a global market and because people play games every day. It\u2019s just part of their life.","There is no -- I don\u2019t think there is much seasonality in the TV or books or music, people just whenever new titles comes out that\u2019s when the new season starts. And so in China, there is iCafes and there is Singles' Day November 11, there is Back to School in the United States, there is Christmas, there is Chinese New Year. Boy, that there are so many seasons that is kind of hard to imagine what exactly seasonality is anymore. So hopefully overtime, it becomes most of a matter. But most appointing is that, we expect Pascal to continue to be world\u2019s best gaming platform for foreseeable future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JP Morgan.","Harlan Sur","I know somebody asked a question about inferencing for the data center market, but on inferencing embedded in Edge application on the software and firmware side. You talked about TensorRT framework, on the hardware side you got the Jetson TX platform embedded and Edge inferencing applications things like drones and factory automation and transportation. What else is the team doing in the embedded market to capture more of the same opportunities that are going forward?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Thanks a lot, Harlan. The video Tensor RT is really the only optimizing inference compiler in the world today and it targets all our platforms. And we do inference in the data center that I mentioned earlier. In the embedded world, the first embedded platform we\u2019re targeting is self-driving cars. In order to drive the cars, you are basically inference or try to predict your perceive what's around you all the time and that\u2019s a very complicated inference matter. It could be extremely easy like taking the car in front of you and applying the breaks or could be critically hard which is trying to figure out whether you should stop in intersection or not. If you look at most intersections, you can't just look at the lights to determine and where do you stop there were few lines.","And so using scene understanding than using deep learning, we have the ability to recognize where to stop and where not to stop. And then for Jetson, we have a platform called Metropolis and Metropolis is used for a very large scale smart cities where cameras are deployed all over to keep city safe. We\u2019ve been very successful in smart cities just about every major smart city provider and what's called intelligent video analysis company whether almost all over the world as using NVIDIA\u2019s video platform to do inference at the Edge, AI at the edge.","And then we\u2019ve announced recently success with FANUC, the largest manufacturing robotics company in the world, Komatsu, one of the largest constructions equipments company in the world to apply AI at the Edge for autonomous machines. Drones, we\u2019ve several industrial drones that are inspecting pipelines and expecting power lines, flying over large spans of farms to figure out where to spay insecticides more accurately. There is all kinds of applications. So, you're absolutely right that inference at the Edge or AI at the edge is a very large market opportunity for us and that\u2019s exactly why TensorRT was created.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.","Joe Moore","You mentioned how lean the channel is in terms of gaming cards. There has been an absorbable increase in prices at retail. And I am just curious, is that a broad-based phenomenal? And is there any economic ramification to you? Or is that just sort of retailers bringing prices up in a shortage environment?","Jen-Hsun Huang","We don\u2019t set prices at the end of the market, and the best way for us to solve this problem is, work and supply. The demand is great and it's very likely the demand will remain great as we look through this quarter. And so, we just have to keep working on increasingly supply. We have our suppliers are world best and a largest semiconductor manufacturers in the world and they\u2019re responding incorrectly and I'm really grateful for everything they are doing, we dot got a catch up to that demand, which is such really great.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Rolland with Susquehanna.","Chris Rolland","Just to clarify in terms of pent up demand, one of your GPU competitors basically said that constraints was memory. I just want to make sure that was correct? And then in the CFO commentary, you mentioned opportunities for professional biz, like AI and deep learning. Can you talk about that in more kind of application you would use Quadro versus Volta or GeForce Specs?","Jen-Hsun Huang","We\u2019re just constraints. Obviously, we're ten times larges of a GPU supplier than the competition and so we have a lot more suppliers supporting us and a lot more distributors taking approach to market and lot more partners distributing our products all over the world. And so, I don\u2019t know how to explain this right from demand is just really great. And so we just got to keep our nose to it and catch up the demand.","With respect to Quadro, Quadro is a work station processor. The entire software stack is designed for all of the applications that the work station industry uses. And it\u2019s the quality of the rendering is of course world-class because NVIDIA, but the entire software stack has been designed so that mission critical applications or long-life industrial applications and companies that are enormous and gigantic manufacturing and industrial companies in the world could rely on an entire platform, which consist of processors and systems and software and middleware and all the integrations into all of the CAD tools in the world.","To know that that the supplier is going to be here and can be trusted for the entire life of the use of that product which could be several years, but the data that is generated from it, has to be accountable for a couple of decades. You need to be able to pull up an entire design of a plane or train or a car, a couple decades after it was sent to production to make sure that is still on complaint, and if there is question about it that it could be pulled up. NVIDIA's entire platform was designed to be professional class, professional grade low-lived.","Now, the thing that's really exciting about some artificial intelligence is, we now can use AI to improve images. For example, you could fix a photograph using AI. You could fill in on damaged parts of a photograph or parts of the image that hasn't been rendered yet. You want to use AI to fill in the dots, predict the future, rendering results, which we announced and which we demonstrated at GTC recently. You can use that to generate designs. You sketch up a few strokes of what you want to car to look like, and based on the inventory, safety, physics, you could -- it has learned how to fill in the rest of it.","Okay. Design the rest of chasse on your behalf. It\u2019s called generative design. We\u2019re going to see generative design in product design and building design and just like everything. The last, if you will, 90% of the work is after the initial installation network, the conceptual design has done. That part of it could be highly automated through AI. And so, Quadro can be used as a platform that designs as well as generatively designs. And then lastly a lot of people are using our workstations to also train their neural networks for the generative designs. And so you could train and develop your own networks and then apply it in the applications.","Okay. So, AI, think of AI really as, in the final analysis, the future way of developing software is a brand new capability where computers can write its own software and the software that's written is so complex and so capable that no humans could write it ourselves. And so, you can teach, you can use data to teach a software to figure out how to write the software by itself. And then when you're done developing the software, you can use it to do all kinds of stuff, including design products. And so for work stations that\u2019s how it\u2019s used.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis with B. Riley.","Q - Craig Ellis","A lot of near-term items here on gaming. So, I\u2019ll switch it to longer term. Jen-Hsun at CES, I think you said that there are now 200 million GeForce users globally, and if my math is correct then that would be up about 2X over the last three to four years. So the question is, is there anything that you can see that would preclude that kind of growth over a similar period? And given the recent demand dynamics, I think we've seen that INVIDIA\u2019s direct channels have been very good sources for GPUs of the prices that you intend. So as we look ahead, should we expect any change in channel management from the Company?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yes. Thanks a lot, Craig. In the last several years, several dynamics happened at the same time. And all of that were the favorable contributions to today. First of all, gaming became global market and China became one of the largest gaming markets in the world. The second, because the market became so big, developers could invest extraordinary amounts into the production value of the videogame. They could invest a few hundred million dollars and though they are going to get return on. Back when the videogame industry was quite small or PC game was small, it was too risky for developer to invest that much.","And so now, an investor a developer could invest hundreds of millions of dollars and create something that is just completely for the realistic and emerged that just beautiful. And so when the production value goes up, the GPU technology that\u2019s needed to run it well goes up, it\u2019s very different than music, it\u2019s very different than watching movies, everything in videogames is emphasized in real time. And so when the production value goes up, the ASP with a technology has to go up.","And then lastly, the size of the market and people wonder how big the videogame market is going to be and I am always believe that videogame market is going to be literally everyone. In 10 years time, 15 years time, there can be another billion people on earth and those people are going to be gamers, we see more and more gamers. And not to mention that almost every single sport could be the virtual reality sport. So videogame is every sport so this sport can be any sport and every sport and every type of sport. And so I think when you consider this and put that in your mind I think the opportunity for videogames is going to be quite large and that\u2019s essentially what we\u2019re seeing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of William Stein with SunTrust.","William Stein","I am hoping we can touch on automotive a little bit more. In particular, I think in the past you\u2019ve talked about expecting sort of a low in revenue growth in this market and till roughly the 2020 timeframe when autonomous driving kicks in more meaningful way. But of course you have the AI co-pilot that seems to be potentially ramping sooner, and you have at least one marquee customer that is ramping now I guess that volumes aren\u2019t quite that large on the autonomous driving side. So any guidance as to when we might see these two factors start to accelerate revenue in that end market?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yes, thanks a lot Will. I wish I have more precision for you, but here some of the dynamics that I believe in. I believe that autonomous capability, autonomous driving is the single greatest dynamic next to EVs in the automotive industry. And transportation is a $10 trillion industry between cars and shuttles and buses, delivery vehicles. I mean it just an extraordinary market and everything that\u2019s kind of move in the future will be autonomous that\u2019s for sure, and it will be autonomous fully or it will be autonomous partly. The size of this marketplace is quite large.","In the near term, our path to that future which I believe starts in 2019 and 2020, but starts very strongly in 2022. I believe the path to that in our case has several elements. The first element is that in work for all these companies, whether they are Tier 1s or start up or OEMs or taxi companies or ride hailing companies or tractor companies or shuttle companies or piece of delivery on the shuttles. In order to deliver -- in order to create there autonomous driving capability, the first thing I have to do is train in your network. And we created a platform we called the NVIDIA GTX that allows everybody to train a neural networks as quickly as possible.","So that first, it\u2019s the development of the AI requires GPU, and we benefit first from that. And the second is, which will start this year and next year is development platforms for the cars themselves, for the vehicles themselves. And finally, Xavier here, we have a first kind of Xavier, the most complex SoC that the world ever made. And we\u2019re super excited about the state of Xavier and we're going to be sampling in Q1. And so now, we will be able to help everybody create development systems and will be 1000s and 10,000s of quite expensive development systems based on Xavier and based on that Pegasus that world is going to need.","And so that\u2019s the second element, the third element in the near-term will be development agreements, each one of these projects are engineering intensive. And there is a development agreement that goes along way with it. And so these three elements, these three components are in the near-term, and then hopefully starting from 2019 going forward and very strongly going from 2022 and beyond at the actual car revenues and economics will show up.","I appreciate the question and I think this is our last question. Well, we have a record quarter ramping up with record year. We've strong momentum and our gaming, AI, data center and self-driving car businesses. It's great to see adoption of the NVIDIA's GPU computing platform increasing in so many industries. We accomplished a great deal this last year and we have big plans for this coming year. Next month, the brightest minds and AI and scientific world will come together at our GPU technology conference at San Jose.","GTC has grown tenfold in the last five years. This year we expect more than 8,000 attendees. GTC has a place to be if you're an AI researchers or doing any field of science where computing is your essential instrument, there will be over 500 powers of talks of recent breakthroughs and discoveries by leaders in the field just Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft and many others. Developers from industries ranging from healthcare to transportation to manufacturing entertainment will come together and share state-of-the-art and AI. This is going to be a big GTC. I hope to see all of you there.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Thank you for your participation."],"16224":["NVIDIA Corp.

My name is Victoria, and I'm your conference operator for today. Welcome to NVIDIA's financial results conference call. [Operator Instructions] I'll now turn the call over to Simona Jankowski, Vice President of Investor Relations, to begin your conference.","Simona Jankowski","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to NVIDIA's Conference Call for the Third Quarter of Fiscal 2018. With me on the call today from NVIDIA are Jen-Hsun Huang, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Colette Kress, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","I'd like to remind you that our call is being webcast live on NVIDIA's Investor Relations website. It is also being recorded. You can hear a replay by telephone until November 16, 2017. The webcast will be available for replay up until next quarter's conference call to discuss Q4 and full year fiscal 2018 financial results. ","The contents of today's call is NVIDIA's property, it can't be reproduced or transcribed without our prior written consent.","During this call, we may make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. These are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of factors that could affect our future financial results and business, please refer to the disclosure in today's earnings release, our most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q and the reports that we may file on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All our statements are made as of today, November 9, 2017, based on information currently available to us. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements.","During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO Commentary, which is posted on our website.","With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.","Colette Kress","Thanks, Simona. We had an excellent quarter with record revenue in each of our four market platforms. And every measure of profit hit record levels, reflecting the leverage of our model.","Data center revenue of $501 million more than doubled from a year ago and the strong adoption of our Volta platform and early traction with our inferencing portfolio. Q3 revenue reached $2.64 billion, up 32% from a year earlier, up 18% sequentially and well above our outlook of $2.35 billion. From a reporting segment perspective, GPU revenue grew 31% from last year to $2.22 billion. Tegra processor revenue rose 74% to $419 million. ","Let's start with our Gaming business. Gaming revenue was $1.56 billion, up 25% year-on-year and up 32% sequentially. We saw robust demand across all regions and form factors. Our Pascal-based GPUs remained the platform of choice for gamers as evidenced by our strong demand for GeForce GTX 10-Series products. We introduced the GeForce GTX 1070 Ti which became available last week. It complements our strong holiday lineup, ranging from the entry-level GTX 1050 to flagship GTX 1080 Ti. A wave of great titles is arriving for the holidays, driving enthusiasm in the market.","We collaborated with Activision to bring Destiny 2 to the PC early in the month. PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds popularly known as [indiscernible], continues to be one of the year's most successful titles. We are closely aligned with PUB G to ensure that GeForce is the best way to play the game, including bringing shadow play highlights to its 20 million players. Last weekend, Call of Duty: World War II had a strong debut. And Star Wars Battlefront 2 will be [indiscernible]. E-sports remains one of the most important secular growth drivers in the Gaming market with a fan base that now exceeds 350 million.","Last weekend, the League of Legends World Championship was held in Beijing's National Stadium, The Bird's Nest where the 2008 Olympic Games were held. More than 40,000 fans attended live. And online viewers were said to break last year's record of 43 million following in 18 languages. ","GPU sales also benefited from continued cryptocurrency money. We met some of this demand with a dedicated board in our OEM business and a portion with GeForce GTX boards, though it's difficult to quantify. We remain nimble in our approach to the cryptocurrency market. It is volatile, does not and will not distract us from focusing on our core Gaming market. Lastly, Nintendo Switch console continues to gain momentum since launching in March and also contributed to growth.","Moving to data center; our data center business had an outstanding quarter. Revenue of $501 million more than doubled from last year and rose 20% on the quarter and its strong traction of the new Volta architecture. Shipments of the Tesla V100 GPU began in Q2 and ramped significantly in Q3, driven primarily by demand from cloud service providers and high-performance computing.","As we have noted before, Volta delivers 10x the deep learning performance of our Pascal architecture, which has been introduced just a year earlier, far outpacing Moore's Law. The V100 is being broadly adopted with every major server OEM and cloud provider. In China, Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent announced that they are incorporating V100 in their datacenters and cloud server, service infrastructures. In the U.S., Amazon Web Services announced that V100 inferences are now available in four of its regions. Oracle Cloud has just added Tesla P100 GPUs to its infrastructure offerings and plans to expand to the V100 GPUs. We expect support from V100 from other major cloud providers as well. ","In addition, all major server OEMs announced support for the V100, [indiscernible], Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, IBM and Supermicro are incorporating it in servers. And China's top server OEMs, Huawei, Insper and Lenovo have adopted our HGX server architecture to build a new generation of accelerated datacenters with V100 GPUs.","Our new offerings for the AI inference market are also gaining momentum. The recently launched TensorRT programmable inference acceleration platform opened a new market opportunity for us, improving the performance and reducing the cost of AI inferencing in order -- by orders of magnitude compared with CPUs. It supports every major deep learning framework, every network architecture and any level of network complexity. More than 1,200 companies are already using our inference platform, including Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Alibaba, Baidu, JD.com, [indiscernible], Hi Vision and Tencent.","During the quarter, we announced that the NVIDIA GPU Cloud container registry or NGC is now available through Amazon's cloud and will be supported soon by other cloud platforms. NGC helps developers get started with deep learning development through no-cost access to a comprehensive easy-to-use, fully optimized deep learning software stack. It enables instant access to the most widely used GPU-accelerated frameworks. We also continued to see robust growth in our HPC business. Next-generation supercomputers such as the U.S. Department of Energy's CRM Summit Systems expected to come online next year, leverage Volta's industry-leading performance and our pipeline is strong.","The past weeks have been exceptionally busy for us. We have hosted five major GPU Technology Conferences in Beijing, Munich, Taipei, Tel Aviv and Washington, with another next month in Tokyo.","In a strong indication of the growing importance of GPU-accelerated computing, more than 22,000 developers, data scientists and others will come this year to our GTCs, including the main event in Silicon Valley, that's up 10x in just five years. Other key metrics show similar gains. Over the same period, the number of NVIDIA GPU developers has grown 15x to 645,000; and the number of CUDA downloads this year are up 5x to 1.8 million. ","Moving to Professional Visualization; third quarter revenue grew to $239 million, up 15% from a year ago and up 2% sequentially, driven by demand for high-end real-time rendering, simulation and more powerful mobile workstations. The defense and automotive industries grew strongly as the demand for professional VR solutions driven by Quadro P5000 and P6000 GPUs. Among key customers, Audi and BMW are deploying VR in auto showrooms. And the U.S. Army, Navy and Homeland Security are using VR for mission training.","Last month, we announced early access to NVIDIA Holodeck, the intelligent VR collaboration platform. Holodeck enables designers, developers and their customers to come together virtually from anywhere in the world in a highly realistic, collaborated and physically simulated environment. Future updates will address the growing demand for the development of deep learning techniques and virtual environments. In automotive, revenue grew to $144 million, up 13% year-over-year and up slightly from last quarter.","Among key developments this quarter, we announced DRIVE PX Pegasus, the world's first AI computer for enabling Level 5 driverless vehicles. Pegasus will deliver over 320 trillion operations per second, more than 10x its predecessor. It's powered by four high-performance AI processors in a supercomputer that is a size of a license plate. NVIDIA DRIVE is being used by over 25 companies to develop fully autonomous robotaxis and DRIVE PX Pegasus will become the path to production. It is designed for [indiscernible] Certification, the industry's highest safety level and will be available in the second half of 2018. ","We also introduced the DRIVE Ix SDK for delivering intelligence experiences inside the vehicle. DRIVE Ix provides a platform for car companies to create and always engage AI Co-Pilot. It uses deep learning networks to track head movement and gauge and it will have a conversation with the driver using advanced speech recognition, lip-reading and natural language understanding. We believe this will set the standard for the next generation of infotainment systems, a market that is just beginning to develop.","Finally, we announced that DHL, the world's largest mail and package delivery service, and [indiscernible], one of the world's leading automotive suppliers, will deploy a test lead of autonomous delivery trucks next year using the NVIDIA DRIVE PX platform. DHL will outfit electric light trucks with the ZF Pro AI self-driving system based on our technology.","Now turning to the rest of the income statement; Q3 GAAP gross margins was 59.5% and non-GAAP was 59.7%, both up sequentially and year-over-year, reflecting continued growth in value-added platforms. GAAP operating expenses were $674 million and non-GAAP operating expenses were $570 million, consistent with our outlook and up 19% year-on-year. Investing in our key market opportunities is essential to our future, including Gaming, AI and self-driving cars.","GAAP operating income was a record $895 million, up 40% from a year ago. Non-GAAP operating income was $1.01 billion, up 42% from a year ago. GAAP net income was a record $838 million and EPS was $1.33, up 55% and 60%, respectively, from a year earlier. Non-GAAP net income was $833 million and EPS was $1.33, up 46% and 41%, respectively from a year earlier, reflecting revenue strength as well as gross margin and operating margin expansion. We've returned $1.16 billion to shareholders so far this fiscal year through a combination of quarterly dividends and share repurchases.","We have announced an increase to our quarterly dividend of $0.01 to an annualized $0.60, effective with our Q4 fiscal year '18 dividend. We are also pleased to announce that we intend to return another $1.25 billion to shareholders for fiscal 2019 through quarterly dividends and share repurchases. Our quarterly cash flow from operations reached record levels, surpassing $1 billion for the first time to $1.16 billion. ","Now turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018; we expect revenue to be $2.65 billion plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 59.7% and 60% respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $722 million and $600 million, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP OI&E are both expected to be nominal. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 17.5%, plus or minus 1% excluding discrete items. Other financial details are included in the CFO Commentary and other information available on our website. ","We will now open the call for questions. Please limit your question to one. Operator, we will -- would you please pool for questions? Thank you","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.","Toshiya Hari","Jen-Hsun, three months ago, you described the July quarter as a transition quarter for your data center business. And clearly, you guys have ramped very well into October. But if you can talk a little bit about the outlook for the next couple of quarters in data center? And particularly on the inferencing side. I know you guys are really excited about that opportunity. So if you can share customer feedback and what your expectations are into the next year in inferencing, that will be great.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yes. As you know, we started ramping very strongly Volta this last quarter. And we started the ramp the quarter before. And since then, every major cloud provider from Amazon, Microsoft, Google to Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent and even recently, Oracle, has announced support for Volta and we'll be providing Volta for their internal use of deep learning as well as external public cloud services. We also announced that every major server computer maker in the world has now supported Volta and in the process of taking Volta out to market. HP and Dell and IBM and Cisco and Huawei in China, Insper in China, Lenovo, have all announced that they will be building service -- families of servers around the Volta GPU.","So I think we -- this ramp is just the first part of supporting the build out of GPU-accelerated service from our company for data centers all over the world as well as cloud service providers all over the world. The applications for these GPU servers has now grown to many markets. I've spoken about the primary segments of our Tesla GPUs. There are five of them that I talk about regularly.","The first one is high-performance computing where the market is $11 billion or so. It is one of the faster growing parts of the IT industry because more and more people are using high-performance computing for doing their product development or looking for insights or predicting the market or whatever it is. And today, we represent about 15% of the world's top 500 supercomputers. And I've repeatedly said, and I believe this completely, and I think it's becoming increasingly true, that every single supercomputer in the future will be accelerated somehow. So this is a fairly significant growth opportunity for us.","The second is deep learning training, which is very, very much like high-performance computing. And you need to do computing at a very large scale. You're performing trillions and trillions of iterations. The models are getting larger and larger. Every single year, the amount of data that we're training with it is increasing. And the difference between a computing platform that's fast versus not could mean the difference between building a $20 million data center or high-performance computing servers for training to $200 million. And so the money that we save and the capability we provide is really, the value's incredible.","The third segment and this is the segment that you just mentioned, has to do with inference, which is when you're done with developing this network, you had to put it down to the hyperscale datacenters to support the billions and billions of queries that consumers make to the Internet every day. And this is a brand-new market for us. 100% of the world's inference is done on CPUs today. We announced very recently, this last quarter in fact, that TensorRT 3 inference acceleration platform and in combination with our Tensor Core GPU instruction set architecture, we are able to speed up networks by a factor of 100.","Now the way to think about that is, imagine whatever amount of workload that you got, if you can speed up using our platform by a factor of 100, how much you can save.","The other way to think about that is because the amount of -- the networks are getting larger and larger and they're so complex now. And we know that every network on the planet will run on an architecture because they were trained on our architecture today. And so whether it's CNNs or RNNs or GANs or auto encoders or all of the variations of those, irrespective of the precision that you need to support. The size of the network, we have the ability to support them; and so you could either scale out your hyperscale datacenters to support more traffic or you can reduce your cost tremendously or simultaneously, both.","The fourth segment of our data center is providing all of that capability, what I just mentioned, whether it's HPC, training or inference and turning it inside out and making it available in the public cloud. There are thousands of startups now that are in -- are startup because of AI. Everybody recognizes the importance of this new computing model. And as a result of this new tool, this new capability, all these unsolvable problems in the past are now interestingly solvable. And so you can see startups cropping up all over the west, all over the east and there's just -- there are thousands of them.","And these companies don't either -- would rather not use their scarce financial resources to go build high-performance computing centers or they don't have the skill to be able to build out a high-performance platform the way these Internet companies can. And so these cloud providers, cloud platforms are just a fantastic resource for them. So it get rented by the hour. We created in conjunction with that, and I mentioned that all the service providers have taken it to market. In conjunction with that, we created a registry in the cloud that containerizes these really complicated software stacks. Every one of these soft -- frameworks with the different versions of our GPUs and different acceleration of layers and different optimization techniques, we've containerized all of that for every single version and every single type of framework in the marketplace.","And we put that up in the registry -- cloud registry called the [indiscernible] GPU Cloud. And so all you had to do was download that into the cloud service provider that we've got certified in Tesla 4. And with just one click, you are doing deep learning. And then, the last -- and so that's the cloud service providers. If you -- the way to guess that -- estimate that is there are obviously tens of billions of dollars being invested in these AI startups. And some large proportion of their investment fund raiser will ultimately had to go towards high-performance computing, whether they build it themselves or they rented it in the clouds. And so I think that's a multibillion opportunity for us.","And then lastly, this is probably the largest of all the opportunities which is the vertical industries. Whether it's automotive companies that are developing their supercomputers to get ready for self-driving cars or in healthcare companies that are now taking advantage of artificial intelligence to do better diagnostics of -- diagnosis of disease, to manufacturing companies to -- for in-line inspection, to robotics, large logistics companies, Colette mentioned earlier DHL. But the way to think about that is all of these planning -- all of these companies doing planning to deliver products to you through this large network of delivery systems, it is the world's largest plane [indiscernible] and whether it's Uber or DD or Lyft or Amazon or DHL or UPS or FedEx, they all have high-performance computing problems that are now moving to deep learning.","And so those are really exciting opportunities for us, and so the last one is just the vertical industries. I mean, all of these segments were now in a position to start addressing because we've put our GPUs in the cloud, all of our OEMs are in the process of taking these platforms out to market. And we have the ability now to address high-performance computing and deep learning training as well as inference using one common platform. And so I think the -- we've been steadfast with the excitement of accelerated computing for data centers. And I think this is just the beginning of it all.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.","Stacy Rasgon","I had a question on your Gaming seasonality into Q4. It's usually up a bit. I was wondering, do you see, I guess, drivers that would drive the lack of normal seasonal trends given how strong it's been sequentially and year-over-year? And I guess as a related question, do you see your Volta volumes in Q4 exceeding Q3?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Let's see. There's -- I'll answer the last one first and then work towards the first one. I think the guidance that we provided, we feel comfortable with. But if you think about Volta, it is just in the beginning of the ramp and it's going to ramp into the market opportunities I talked about. And so my hope is that we continue to grow. And there's every evidence that the markets that we serve, that we're addressing with Volta is -- are very large markets. And so there's a lot of reasons to be hopeful about the future growth opportunities for Volta. We've primed the pump. So cloud service providers are either announce the availability of Volta or they announce the soon availability of Volta. They're all racing to get Volta through cloud because customers are clamoring for it. The OEMs are -- we've primed the pump with OEMs and some of them are sampling now and some of them are racing to get Volta into production in the marketplace. And so I think the foundation, the demand is there.","The urgent need for accelerated computing is there because Moore's Law is not scaling anymore. And then we've primed the pump. So the demand is there, there is a need, the need is there; and the foundations for getting Volta to market is primed. With respect to Gaming, what drives our Gaming business? Remember, our Gaming business is sold one at a time to millions and millions of people. And what drives our Gaming business is several things. As you know, e-sports is incredibly, incredibly vibrant and what drives -- the reason why e-sports is so unique is because people want to win and having better gear helps. The latency that they expect is incredibly low and performance drives down latency and they want to be able to react as fast as they can. People want to win and they want to make sure that the gear that they use is not the reason why they didn't win.","The second growth driver for us this content, the quality of content. And boy, if you look at Call of Duty or Destiny 2 or PUB G, the content just looks amazing. The AAA content just looks amazing. And one of the things that's really unique about video games is that in order to enjoy the content and the fidelity of the content, the quality of the production value at its fullest, you need the best gear. It's very different than streaming video, it's very different than watching movies where streaming videos, it is what it is. But for video games, of course, it is not. And so when AAA titles comes out in the later part of the year, it helps to drive platform adoption. And then lastly, increasingly, social is becoming a huge part of the growth dynamics of Gaming. People are -- they recognize how beautiful these video games are.","And so they want to share their brightest moments with people, they want to share the levels they discover, they want to take pictures of the amazing graphics that's inside. And it is one of the primary drivers, the leading driver, in fact, of YouTube and people watching other people play video games, these broadcasters. And now, with our Ansel, the world's first in-game virtual reality and surround and digital camera, we have the ability to take pictures and show that with people. And so I think all of these different drivers are helping our Gaming business. And I'm optimistic about Q4. It looks like it's going to be a great quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore.","C.J. Muse","I was hoping to speak in a near-term and a longer-term question. On the near term, you talked about the health on demand side for Volta. Curious if you're seeing any sort of restrictions on the supply side, whether it's wafers or access to high-bandwidth memory, et cetera. And then the longer-term question really revolves around CUDA. You've talked about that as being a sustainable competitive advantage for you guys entering the year. And now that we've moved beyond HPC and hyperscale training to more into inference and GPU as a service and you've posted GTC around the world, curious if you could extrapolate on how you're seeing that advantage and how you've seen it evolve over the year and how you're thinking about CUDA as the AI standard?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yes, thanks a lot, C.J. Well, everything that we build is complicated. Volta is the single largest processor that humanity has ever made, at 21 billion transistors, 3D packaging, the fastest memories on the planet and all of that in a couple of hundred watts which basically says it's the most energy-efficient form of computing that the world has ever known. And one single Volta replaces hundreds of CPUs. And so it's energy-efficient, it saves an enormous amount of money and it gets this job done really, really fast which is just one of the reasons why GPU-accelerated computing is so popular now. With respect to the outlook for our architecture. As you know, we are a one architecture company. And it's so vitally important. And the reason for that is because there are so much software and so much tools created on top of this one architecture.","On the inference side -- on the training side, we have a whole stack of software and optimizing compilers and numeric libraries that are completely optimized for one architecture called CUDA. On the inference side, the optimizing compilers that takes these large, huge computational graphs that come out of all of these frameworks, and these computational graphs are getting larger and larger and their numerical precision differs from one type of network to another -- from one type of application to another. Your numerical precision requirements for a self-driving car where lives are at stake to detecting where counting the number of people crossing the street, counting something versus trying to track -- detect and track something very subtle in all the weather conditions, is a very, very different problem.","And so the numeric -- the types of networks are changing all the time, they're getting larger all the time. The numerical precision is different for different applications. And we have different computing -- compute performance levels as well as energy availability levels that these inference compilers are likely to be some of the most complex software in the world. And so the fact that we have one singular architecture to optimize for, whether it's HPC for numeric, molecular dynamics and computational chemistry and biology and astrophysics, all the way to training to inference gives us just enormous leverage. And that's the reason why NVIDIA could be an 11,000 people company.","And arguably, performing at a level that is 10x that. And the reason for that is because we have one singular architecture that's -- that is accruing benefits over time instead of three, four, five different architectures where your software organization is broken up into all these different, small subcritical mass pieces. And so it's a huge advantage for us. And it's a huge advantage for the industry.","So people who support CUDA know that the next-generation architecture will just get a benefit and go for the ride that technology advancement provides them and affords them, okay? So I think it's an advantage that is growing exponentially, frankly. And I'm excited about it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America.","Vivek Arya","Congratulations on the strong results and the consistent execution. Jen-Hsun, in the last few months, we have seen a lot of announcements from Intel, from Xylinx and others describing other approaches to the AI market. My question is how does the customer make that decision, whether to use a GPUs or an SPGA or an ASIC, right? What is -- what can remain a competitive differentiator over the longer term? And does your position in the trail market also then maybe give you a leg up when they consider solution for the inference part of the problem?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yes, thank you, Vivek. So first of all, we have one architecture and people know that our commitment to our GPUs, our commitment to CUDA, our commitment to all of the software stacks that run on top of our GPUs, every single one of the 500 applications, every numerical solver, every CUDA compiler, every tool chain across every single operating system in every single computing platform, we are completely dedicated to it. We support the software first long as we shall live. And as a result of that the benefits to their investment in CUDA just continues to accrue. I -- you have no idea how many people send me notes about how they literally take out their old GPU, put in a new GPU. And without lifting a finger, things got 2x, 3x, 4x faster than what they were doing before, incredible value to customers. The fact that we are singularly focused and completely dedicated to this one architecture in an unwavering way allows everybody to trust us and know that we will support it for as long as we shall live, and that is the benefit of an architectural strategy.","When you have four or five different architectures to support that you offer to your customers and you ask them to pick the one that they like the best, you're essentially saying that you're not sure which one is the best. And we all know that nobody's going to be able to support five architectures forever. And as a result, something has to give and it would be really unfortunate for a customer to have chosen the wrong one. And if there's five architectures, surely, over time, 80% of them will be wrong. And so I think that our advantage is that we are singularly focused. With respect to FPGAs. I think FPGAs have their place. And we use FPGAs here at NVIDIA to prototype things and -- but FPGAs is a chip design. It's able to be a chip for -- it's incredibly good at being a flexible substrate to be any chip, and so that's it's advantage.","Our advantage is that we have a programming environment. And writing software is a lot easier than designing chips. And if it's within the domain that we focus on, like for example, we're not focused on network packet processing but we are very focused on deep learning. We are very focused on high performance and parallel numeric analysis. If we're focused on those domains, our platform is really quite unbeatable. And so that's how you think through that. I hope that was helpful.","Operator","Your next question comes from Atif Malik with Citi.","Atif Malik","Colette, on the last call, you mentioned that crypto was $150 million in the OEM line in the July quarter. Can you quantify how much crypto was in the October quarter? And expectations in the January quarter directionally? And just longer-term, why should we think that crypto won't impact the gaming demand in the future? If you can just talk about the steps anybody has taken with respect to having the different mode and all that?","Colette Kress","So in our results, in the OEM results, our specific crypto boards equated to about $70 million of revenue, which is the comparable to the $150 million that we saw last quarter.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yes. Our longer term, Atif -- well, first of all, thank you for that. The longer-term way to think about that is crypto is small for us but not 0. And I believe that crypto will be around for some time, kind of like today. There will be new currencies emerging, existing currencies would grow in value. The interest in mining these new emerging currency crypto algorithms that emerge are going to continue to happen. And so I think for some time, we're going to see that crypto will be a small but not 0, small but not 0 part of our business. The -- when you think about crypto in the context of our company overall, the thing to remember is that we're the largest GPU computing company in the world.","And our overall GPU business is really sizable and we have multiple segments. And there's data center and I've already talked about the five different segments within data center. There's [indiscernible] and even that has multiple segments within it, whether it's rendering or computed design or broadcast, in a workstation, in a laptop or in a data center, the architecture is rather different. And of course, you know that we have high performance computing, you know that we have autonomous machine business, self-driving cars and robotics.","And you know of course that we have gaming; and so these different segments are all quite large and growing. And so my sense is that as although crypto will be here to stay, it will remain small not zero.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.","Joseph Moore","Just following up on that last question. You mentioned that some of the crypto market had moved to traditional gaming. What drives that? Is there a lack of availability of the specialized crypto product? Or is it just that there's a preference driven for the gaming oriented crypto solutions?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yes, Joe, I appreciate you asking that. Here's the reason why. So what happens is when a crypto -- when a currency -- digital currency market becomes very large, it entices somebody to build a custom ASIC for it. And of course, Bitcoin is the perfect example of that. Bitcoin is incredibly easy to design in its specialized chip form. But then what happens is a couple of different players starts to monopolize the marketplace. As a result, it chases everybody out of the mining market and it encourages a new currency to evolve, to emerge. And the new currency, the only way to get people to mine is if it's hard to mine, okay? You got to put some effort into it. However, you want a lot of people to try to mine it.","And so therefore, the platform that is perfect for it, the ideal platform for digital, new emerging digital currencies turns out to be a CUDA GPU. And the reason for that is because there are several hundred million NVIDIA GPUs in the marketplace. If you want to create a new cryptocurrency algorithm, optimizing for our GPUs is really quite ideal. It's hard to do. It's hard to do, therefore, you need a lot of computation to do it. And yet there is enough GPUs in the marketplace, it's such an open platform that the ability for somebody to get in and start mining is very low barriers to entry.","And so that's the cycles of these digital currencies, and that's the reason why I say that digital currency crypto usage of GPUs, crypto usage of GPUs will be small but not 0 for some time. And it's small because when it gets big, somebody will be able to build custom ASIC. But if somebody builds a custom ASIC, there will be a new emerging cryptocurrency. So ebbs and flows.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis with B. Riley.","Craig Ellis","Jen-Hsun, congratulations on data center annualizing $2 billion, it's a huge milestone. I wanted to follow-up with a question on some of your comments regarding data center partners. Because as I look back over the last five years, I just don't see any precedent for the momentum that you have in the market place right now between your server partners, white box partners, hyperscale partners that are deploying it, hosted, et cetera. And so my question is, relative to the doubling that we've seen year-on-year in each of the last two years, what does that partner expansion mean for datacenters growth? And then if I could sneak one more in, two new products just announced in the Gaming platform, the 1070 Ti and a Collector's Edition on Titan Xp. What does that mean for the gaming platform?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yes, Craig, thanks a lot. Let's see. We have never created a product that is as broadly supported by the industries and has grown nine consecutive quarters. It has doubled year-over-year and with partnerships of the scale that we're looking at. We have just never created a product like that before. And I think the reason for that is several folds. The first is that it is true that CPU scaling has come to an end. That's just laws of physics. The end of Moore's Law is just laws of physics. And yet, the world for software development and the world -- the problems that computing can help solve is growing faster than any time before.","Nobody's ever seen a large-scale planning problem like Amazon before. Nobody's ever seen a large planning problem like DD before, the number of millions of taxi rides per week is just staggering. And so nobody's ever seen large problems like these before, large-scale problems like these before; and so high performance computing and accelerated computing using GPUs has become recognized as the path forward. And so I think that that's at the highest level of the most important parameter.","Second is artificial intelligence and its emergence and applications to solving problems that we historically thought were unsolvable. Solving the unsolvable problems is a real realization. I mean, this is happening across just about every industry we know, whether it's Internet service providers to healthcare, to manufacturing, to transportation, logistics. You just name it, financial services. And so I think artificial intelligence is a real tool. Deep learning is a real tool that can help solve some of the world's unsolvable problems.","And I think that our dedication to high performance computing and this one singular architecture, our seven year headstart, if you will, in deep learning and our early recognition of the importance of this new computing approach, both the timing of it, the fact that it was naturally a perfect fit for the skills that we have and then the incredibly -- the incredible effectiveness of this approach, I think has really created the perfect conditions for our architecture.","And so I think I really appreciate you noticing that. But this is definitely the most successful product line in the history of our company.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Caso with Raymond James.","Christopher Caso","I have a question on the automotive market and the outlook there. And interestingly, with the other segments growing as quickly as they are, auto is becoming a smaller percentage of revenue now. And certainly, the design traction seems very positive. Can you talk about the ramp in terms of when the auto revenue, when we could see that as getting back to a similar percentage of revenue? Is that growing more quickly? Do you think that is likely to happen over the next year with some of these design wins coming out? Or is that something we should be waiting for over several years?","Jen-Hsun Huang","I appreciate that, Chris. So the way to think about that is, as you know, we've really, really reduced our emphasis on infotainment even though that's the primary part of our revenues so that we could take, literally, hundreds of engineers and including the processors that we're building now, a couple of 2,000, 3,000 engineers, working on our autonomous machine and artificial intelligence platform for this marketplace to take advantage of the position we have and to go after this amazing revolution that's about to happen. I happen to believe that everything that moves will be autonomous someday. And it could be a bus, a truck, a shuttle, a car. Everything that moves will be autonomous someday; it could be a delivery vehicle, it could be little robots that are moving around warehouses, it could be delivering a pizza to you. And we felt that those -- this was such an incredibly great challenge and such a great compute problem that we decided to dedicate ourselves to it.","Over the next several years, and if you look at our DRIVE PX platform today, there's over 200 companies that are working on it. 125 startups are working on it. And these companies are mapping companies, they're Tier 1s, they're OEMs, they're shuttle companies, car companies, trucking companies, taxi companies. And this last quarter, we announced an extension of our DRIVE PX platform to include DRIVE PX Pegasus which is now the world's first auto grade full [indiscernible] platform for robotaxis. And so I think our position is really excellent and the investment has proven to be one of the best ever. And so I think in terms of revenues, my expectation is that this coming year, we'll enjoy revenues as a result of the supercomputers that customers will have to buy for training their networks, for simulating the -- all these autonomous vehicles driving and developing their self-driving cars.","And we'll see fairly large quantities of development systems being sold this coming year. The year after that, I think is the year when you're going to see the robotaxis ramping and our economics in every robotaxi is several thousand dollars. And then starting, I would say, late 2022, 2021, you're going to start to see the first fully automatic autonomous cars, what people call level 4 cars, starting to hit the road. And so that's kind of how I see it. Just next year is simulation environments, development systems, supercomputers. And then the year after that is robotaxis. And then a year or two after that will be all the self-driving cars.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsey with Canaccord Genuity.","Matthew Ramsay","I have, I guess, a two-part question on gross margin. Colette, I remember, I don't know if maybe 3 years ago, 3.5 years ago at Analyst Day, you guys were talking about gross margins in the mid-50s and that was inclusive of the Intel payment. And now you're hitting numbers at 60% excluding that. I want to -- if you could talk a little bit about how mix of the data center business and some others drives gross margin going forward? And maybe Jen-Hsun you could talk a little bit about, you mentioned both are being such a huge chip in terms of transistor count. How you're thinking about taking costs out of that product as you ramp in into gaming next year and the effects on gross margins.","Colette Kress","Thanks, Matt, for the question. Yes, we've been on a steady stream of increasing the gross margins over the years. But this is the evolution of the entire model. The model of the value-added platforms that we sell and inclusive of the entire ecosystem of work that we do, the software that we enable in so many of these platforms that we bring to market. Datacenter is one of them; our ProVis, another one. And if you think about all of our work that we have in terms of gaming, that overall expansion of the ecosystem. So this has been continuing to increase our gross margin. Mix is more of a statement in terms of each quarter, we have a different mix in terms of our products and some of them have a little bit of seasonality.","And depending on when some of those platforms come to market, we can have a mix change within some of those subsets. It's still going to be our focus as we go forward in terms of growing gross margins as best as we can. You can see in terms of our guidance into Q4 which we feel comfortable with that guidance that we will increase it as well.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yes. With respect to yield enhancement, the way to think about that is we do it in several ways. The first thing is I'm just incredibly proud of the technology group that we have in VLSI and they get us ready for these brand new nodes, whether it's in the process readiness, through all the circuit readiness, the packaging, the memory readiness. The readiness is so incredible -- incredibly important for us because these processors that we're creating are really, really hard. They're the largest things in the world. And so we get one shot at it. And so the team does everything they can to essentially prepare us. And by the time that we take off a product for real, we know for certain that we can build it. And so the technology team in our company is just world-class. Absolutely world-class, there's nothing like it. Then once we go into production, we get the benefit of ramping up the products. And as yields improve, we'll surely benefit from the cost.","But that's not really where the focus is. I mean, in the final analysis, the real focus for us is continue to improve the software stack on top of our processors. And the reason for that is each one of our processors carry with it an enormous amount of memory and systems and networking and the whole data center. Most of our data center products, if we can improve the throughput of a data center by another 50%, or in our case, often times, we'll improve something from 2x to 4x, the way to think about that is that billion-dollar data center just improved this productivity by a factor of two.","And all of the software work that we do on top of CUDA and the incredible work that we do with optimizing compilers and graph analytics, all of that stuff then all of a sudden translates to a value to our customers, not measured by dollars but measured by hundreds of millions of dollars. And that's really the leverage of accelerated computing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann with Rosenblatt.","Hans Mosesmann","Jen-Hsun, can you comment on some of the issues this week regarding Intel and their renewed interest in getting into the graphic space and their relationship at the chip level with AMD?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yes, thanks, Hans. There's a lot of news out there. I guess some of the things I take away, first of all, Raj leaving AMD is a great loss for AMD. And it's a recognition by Intel probably that the GPU is just incredibly, incredibly important now. And the modern GPU is not a graphics accelerator. The modern GPU, we just left the word G -- the letter G in there. But these processors are domain specific parallel accelerators. And they're enormously complex. They're the most complex processes built by anybody on the planet today. And that's the reason why IBM uses our processors for the world's largest supercomputers, that's the reason why every single cloud, every single -- every major cloud, every major server maker in the world has adopted NVIDIA GPUs. It's just incredibly hard to do. The amount of software engineer that goes on top of it is significant as well.","So if you look at the way we do things, we plan a roadmap about five years out. It takes about three years to build a new generation and we build multiple GPUs at the same time. And on top of that, there's some 5,000 engineers working on system software and numeric libraries and solvers and compilers and graph analytics and cloud platforms and virtualization stacks in order to make this computing architecture useful to all of the people that we serve. And so when you think about it from that perspective, it's just an enormous undertaking. Arguably, the most significant undertaking of any processor in the world today. And that's the reason why we are able to speed up applications by a factor of 100. You don't walk in and have a new widget and a few transistors and all of a sudden, speed up applications by a factor of 100 or 50 or 20. That's just something that's inconceivable unless you do the type of innovation that we do.","And then lastly, with respect to the chip that they built together, I think it goes without saying now that the energy efficiency of Pascal GeForce and the Max-Q design technology and all of the software that we created has really set a new design point for the industry. It is now possible to build a state-of-the-art gaming notebook with the most leading-edge GeForce processors and be able to deliver gaming experiences that are many times greater than a console in 4K and had that be in a laptop that's 18 millimeters thin. The combination of Pascal at Max-Q has really raised the bar. And I think that that's really the essence of it.","Operator","Unfortunately, we have run out of time. I'll now turn the call over to you for closing remarks.","Jen-Hsun Huang","We have another great quarter. Gaming is one of the fastest-growing entertainment industries and we're well-positioned for the holidays. AI is becoming increasingly widespread in many industries throughout the world and we're hoping to lead the way with all major cloud providers and computer makers moving to deploy Volta and we're building the future of autonomous driving. We expect robotaxis using our technology to hit the road in just a couple of years. We look forward to seeing many of you at the SE 17 this weekend. Thank you for joining us.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions].","I'll now turn the call over to Simona Jankowski, Vice President of Investor Relations, to begin your conference.","Simona Jankowski","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to NVIDIA's conference call for the third quarter of fiscal 2019. With me on the call today from NVIDIA are Jen-Hsun Huang, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Colette Kress, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to remind you that our call is being webcast live on NVIDIA's Investor Relations website. It's also being recorded. You can hear a replay by telephone until November 22, 2018. The webcast will be available for replay until the conference call to discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. The content of today's call is NVIDIA's property. It can't be reproduced or transcribed without our prior written consent.","During this call, we may make forward-looking statements based on current expectations.

Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements.","During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO commentary, which is posted on our website.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Colette.","Colette Kress","Thanks, Simona. Q3 revenue reached $3.18 billion, up 21% from a year earlier, with all 4 of our market platforms growing double digits. Data center, professional visualization and automotive all hit record levels. However, gaming was short of expectations as post crypto channel inventory took longer than expected to sell through. Gaming card prices, which were elevated following the sharp crypto falloff, took longer than expected to normalize. ","Our Q4 outlook for gaming reflects very little shipment in the midrange Pascal [segment] [ph] to allow channel inventory to normalize. In Q4, we also expect minimal sales of Tegra chips for game consoles due to the normal seasonal build cycle. While channel inventory situation presents a near-term headwind, it does not change our long-term fundamentals. Our competitive position is as strong as ever, and we have expanded our addressable market with Turing and our recent software announcement. We remain excited about the growth opportunities in ray-traced gaming, rendering, high-performance computing, AI and self-driving cars.","GAAP gross margins grew 90 basis points year-on-year and non-GAAP gross margins rose 130 basis points. This reflects our continued shift toward higher-value platforms but also included a $57 million charge for prior architecture components and chips following the sharp falloff of crypto mining demand. Both GAAP and non-GAAP net income exceeded $1 million for the fourth consecutive quarter. ","From a reporting segment perspective, GPU revenue grew 25% from a year ago to $2.77 billion. Tegra processor revenue was down 3% to $407 million.","Let's continue with our gaming business. Revenue of $1.76 billion was up 13% year-on-year and down 2% sequentially. Year-on-year growth was driven by initial sales of our new Turing-based GPUs as well as strong notebook sales, which more than offset gaming console declines. In mid-September, we began shipping GeForce RTX series, the first gaming GPUs based on our Turing architecture. Turing RTX technology delivers up to 2x the performance of its predecessor, Pascal, and 6x more for ray-traced graphics. These are the biggest generational jumps we have ever delivered in gaming GPUs.","The first two GeForce RTX gaming cards to hit the shelves were the 2080 Ti and the 2080, delivering 4K HDR gaming and 60 frames per second on even the most advanced AAA titles, a major milestone for gamers. This is quickly becoming the new performance baseline as 4K displays are now reaching affordable price points. These two high-end cards were quickly followed by the rollout of the GeForce 27D. NVIDIA RTX technology brings games to life like never before. The highly anticipated Battlefield V launched this week with the first release of RTX ray-tracing, enabling lifelike reflections on GeForce RTX GPUs. With a pipeline of upcoming games supporting NVIDIA RTX features, RTX is well on its way to establishing itself as a game-changing architecture.","Although the cryptocurrency wave has ended, the channel has taken longer than expected to normalize. Pascal high-end cards have largely sold through ahead of RTX. However, on midrange Pascal gaming cards, both channel prices and inventory levels remained higher than expected. Pascal is well positioned as the GPU of choice in the midrange for the holidays, and we expect to work down channel inventories over the next quarter or 2.","Moving to data center. We had another strong quarter with revenue of $792 million, up 58% year-on-year and up 4% sequentially. Demand remains strong for both the architecture products, including Tesla V100 and DGX systems, and our inference business continued to grow, benefiting from the launch of the Turing T4 Cloud GPU during the quarter. Just 2 months after its launch, the T4 has received the fastest adoption of any server GPU. It is integrated into 57 server designs and it is already on the Google Cloud Platform, its first cloud availability. The T4 delivers world record performance for deep learning inference and accelerates diverse cloud workloads, including high-performance computing, deep learning training and inference, machine learning, data analytics and graphics.","We also announced an updated TensorRT software stack and NVIDIA TensorRT Hyperscale Platform. This new software includes two critically important capabilities that can drive deployment of the NVIDIA inference platform at scale in hyperscale data centers. First, it enables multiple models and multiple frameworks to run on the same GPU at the same time. This can drive higher data center utilization, directly translating to significant savings. Second, it integrates with Kubernetes, the leading orchestration layer for hyperscale data centers.","Completing our inference platform, the new T4 GPU delivers 12x the peak inference performance of its T4 predecessor. All told, our inference platform delivers 40x faster performance in CPUs. And with the TensorRT software stack, it is ideally suited for hyperscale data centers. With this launch, NVIDIA is poised to take the data center inference market, targeting every server node in the hyperscale data centers.","Another important launch for the quarter was the NVIDIA RTX Server reference architecture, which incorporates up to 8 Turing-based RTX 8000. With this product, Turing opens a new market to GPOs, photoreal rendering or the creation of computer-generated images that look real. Rendering is instrumental to large industries, such as media and entertainment, retail, product designs, manufacturing and architecture. Yet prior to Turing and its ray-tracing capabilities, GPUs were not able to address this workload. So most rendering at -- up to this point has been done on CPUs. An RTX-accelerated render farm compared with an equivalent performance of CPU render farm is 1\/4 the cost, 1\/10 the space and 1\/11 the power. NVIDIA's RTX platform has garnered major industry support, including from key developers such as Adobe, ANSYS, Autodesk, Dassault and many others.","Lastly, NVIDIA announced a GPU acceleration platform for data science and machine learning called RAPIDS, which enables companies to analyze massive amounts of data and make accurate business predictions at unprecedented speed. Up until now, data analytics and machine learning has been the largest high-performance computing applications not to have been accelerated. Virtually all enterprise use data analytics to extract insight from big data for a wide range of use cases, such as predicting credit card fraud, forecasting retail inventory and understanding customer buying behavior. RAPIDS is an open source suite of libraries for GPU-accelerated analytics, machine learning and, soon, data visualization. With RAPIDS, NVIDIA GPUs can now accelerate machine learning, as we have done with deep learning, with performance up to 50x faster than CPUs. The RAPIDS launch opens up a $20 billion server market used for data analytics and machine learning workloads to GPUs, and it's received broad industry support, including from Oracle, IBM, SAP, Dell EMC, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Microsoft Azure machine learning, Google, Q-Flow as well as the open source community.","With one unified architecture and ecosystem, NVIDIA GPUs can address the redefined high-performance computing market, including scientific computing, deep learning and machine learning. Our GPUs and software stack accelerate a broad and diverse set of workloads, ranging from scale-up software in supercomputers to scale out deployments in hyperscale data centers. Just earlier this week, this capability was on display at Supercomputing Conference in Dallas, where the number of systems on the TOP500 supercomputer list using NVIDIA GPUs jumped 48% from last year, including the #1 and #2 systems in the world.","Moving to pro visualization. Revenue reached a record $305 million, up 28% versus the prior year and up 9% sequentially. Strength extended across the desktop and mobile as well as several key industries, including the public sector, manufacturing and architecture, engineering and construction. ","At SIGGRAPH in August, we announced our Quadro RTX 8000, 6000 and 5000 GPUs based on the Turing architecture. And earlier this week, we introduced the Quadro RTX 4000, the most advanced professional GPU priced under $1,000. These GPUs will revolutionize the work of 50 million designers and artists by enabling them to render photorealistic scenes in real-time and leveraging AI in their workflows. The Quadro RTX series started shipping in Q3, with the server-grade, high-end products recognized in data center. We already engaged with a range of customers on RTX, including the major movie studios and game developers, and the reaction has been very positive.","Finally, turning to automotive. Automotive sales in Q3 reached $172 million, up 19% from a year ago and up 7% sequentially. This reflects growth in our autonomous vehicle production and development engagement in addition to the ramp of next-generation, AI-based cockpit infotainment systems.","At GTC Europe, we announced that Volvo Cars selected NVIDIA's DRIVE AGX Xavier next-generation -- for next-generation Volvo Cars. The initial production release slated for the early 2020s will deliver Level 2+ assisted driving features, integrating 360-degree surround perception and a driver monitoring system. This is our first Level 2 mass-market car design win. In addition to Volvo, global automotive suppliers, Continental and Veoneer, announced that they have selected NVIDIA DRIVE AGX for their autonomous driving systems. Lastly, our DRIVE AGX Xavier development kit started shipping in this quarter. This is the world's first autonomous driving platform, and it can run our NVIDIA DRIVE software for autonomous driving, including data collection, 360-degree surround perception, advanced driver monitoring and in-vehicle visualization. With this platform, customers have developed and test their autonomous driving solutions and then easily move into production. We are excited about the AV opportunity as we look into next year and beyond.","Moving to the rest of the P&L and the balance sheet. Q3 gross margins was 60.4% and non-GAAP was 61%, below our outlook due to the $57 million charge for prior architecture components and chips following the sharp falloff in crypto demand. GAAP operating expenses were $863 million and non-GAAP operating expenses were $730 million, up 28% year-on-year. We continue to invest in the key platforms driving our long-term growth, including gaming, data center and automotive. ","GAAP net income was $1.23 billion, and EPS was $1.97, up 48% from a year earlier. GAAP net income benefited from the reduction of $138 million in our U.S. tax reform transition tax amount as well as other discrete tax items. Non-GAAP net income was $1.15 billion and EPS was $1.84, up 38% from a year ago, reflecting revenue growth and gross margin expansion as well as lower income tax expense. ","Accounts receivable was $2.22 billion compared to $1.66 billion in the prior quarter as Turing's RTX shipments began in the latter part of the quarter. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $1.42 billion compared to $1.09 billion in the prior quarter, reflecting the ramp in production of Turing products.","Quarterly cash flow from operations was $487 million. Capital expenditures were $150 million. This fiscal year, we have returned $1.13 billion to shareholders through the end of Q3. We've announced a $0.01 increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.16 effective in Q4 of fiscal 2019. We are also pleased to announce an increase of $7 billion to our share repurchase authorization and that we intend to return an additional $3 billion to shareholders by the end of fiscal 2020.","With that, let me turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. As noted earlier, our revenue outlook is impacted by the expected work-down of Pascal midrange gaming card inventory in the channel. In addition, we expect a decline in our gaming console revenue given seasonal build patterns. Keep in mind that the midrange desktop portfolio is typically about 1\/3 of our gaming business. Our outlook assumes that channel inventory weeks approach normal levels exiting Q4 and that gaming and demand increases in Q4 compared with Q3.","Now in total, we expect revenue to be $2.7 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 62.3% and 62.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $915 million and $755 million, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP OI&E are both expected to be income of $21 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 8%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $190 million to $210 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. ","In closing, I'd like to highlight some upcoming events for the financial community. We'll be presenting at the Barclays Global Technology, Media and Telecommunications Conference on December 6, and we will be meeting with the financial community at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas from January 8 through 11. And our next earnings call to discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 will take place on February 14.","With that, we will now open the call for questions. Operator, will you please poll for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur","Within your guidance for the January quarter, is the team anticipating continued sequential growth in your data center business? There seems to be some concern around the near-term slowdown in cloud spending. But on the flip side, we're hearing that the NVIDIA team is actually seeing pretty strong demand, near term, from some of your China cloud customers for your Tesla-based products. So I just wanted to get your views on cloud data center dynamics and the trajectory into the January quarter.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yes, we expect to continue to do well in data centers. The -- if you look at the background of what's happening, we know that Moore's Law has ended. And while demand for computing continues to grow and more and more of the data center is running machine learning algorithms, which is computational and really intensive, the only way to increase computational demand or computational resource is to buy more computers, buy more CPUs because each one of those CPUs aren't getting much faster. And so as a result of that, the data center CapEx would have to go up. The alternative, which is the alternative that we offer and is one of the reasons why the adoption of NVIDIA's accelerated computing platform is growing so fast, is because the approach that we provide allows for a path forward beyond Moore's Law. There are several things that we have done this last quarter that I think is really fantastic. ","The first is the introduction of a new computing platform, new accelerated platform called RAPIDS. And as you know very well that the vast majority of the industry today, although are super excited about deep learning, deep learning as a method for artificial intelligence is very data-intensive. And in areas where there's a lot of domain expertise, where there's -- whether it's in retail or whether it's in financial services or health care, logistics, there's a fair amount of domain expertise, and the amount of data that they have to fuse together to train a model is quite high. The approach using traditional machine learning is quite successful. That has never been accelerated before. And we worked with the open source community over the course of the last several years to pull together an entire stack that starts from Apache Arrow, the Dask parallel distributed computing engine, and then all of our CUDA and all of our algorithms that run on top of that. We now have an accelerated machine learning platform. That's a brand-new platform, and the excitement around that is really quite incredible. The second thing is the Turing architecture allows us to do film rendering at a much, much more affordable way than Moore's Law would have allowed. And then the third, which we just announced recently, is our first Turing-based T4 Cloud GPU. And along with all of the software stack that we've put on top of it, Kubernetes, the Docker, the TRT inference engine, our second-generation Tensor Core, AI accelerator, all of that together has created a lot of excitement in data center. So I'm expecting our data center business to be -- to continue to do quite well.","Harlan Sur","Great. And then just on the high-end Turing products that the team started rolling out in October, early demand actually seems to be quite strong. And I think part of it is just the lineup of AAA-rated games. eSports continue to be strong as well, obviously a big motivator for your enthusiast-class gamers. I know the team is, near term, kind of working down midrange Pascal cards, but do you anticipate your Turing-based RTX product families to drive sequential growth in the January quarter just what appears to be pretty strong demand pull for these products?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yes, the Turing launch happened towards the end of the quarter, and it's the biggest generational leap we've ever had. It introduced real-time ray-tracing. It's the first GPU to -- gaming GPU to include artificial intelligence. At every single price point it serves, it is substantially higher performance than the last and it's the highest performance GPU in the world. And all the great content are coming. Today, I think it is -- or yesterday, I think it was, the Battlefield V was released with real-time ray-tracing, the world's first application to support real-time ray-tracing. So I -- we expect Turing to do really well. As we go on, surely, we'll bring Turing deeper into the mainstream. And so we don't have anything to announce today, but as usual, we want to bring a brand-new architecture to as many gamers as possible.","Operator","Your next question is from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.","Toshiya Hari","I had a question on the gaming outlook and as it relates to channel inventory. Colette, you mentioned that typically, the midrange is about 1\/3 of gaming. How much was it in the October quarter? And are you effectively assuming close to 0 in the January quarter? And related to that, I think with your game console business, I'm estimating you did something around $200 million to $250 million in October. Again, is that coming down pretty hard into January?","Colette Kress","Yes. So I commented about the overall size of what we have traditionally seen in terms of the midrange over a fairly large period of time because keep in mind, the launches of products quarter-to-quarter have changed that. So it has been about 1\/3 consistently over, let's say, about an 8-quarter period of time. And we think that's a good number for you to use as we look at our guidance in terms of Q4. From an overall console perspective, we again have seen about -- in the hundreds and sometimes more than that in prior quarters. What we're seeing is just a normal where they build ahead of the holidays in Q3, and that slows down as we move into Q4 when we're in the middle of the holidays.","Toshiya Hari","Great. And then as a follow-up, you saw nice acceleration in growth in your ProVis business this quarter. Jen-Hsun, I think you've talked extensively about the RTX and the long-term opportunity there. What are your expectations going into 2019 for that segment?","Jen-Hsun Huang","I expect ProVis to grow. The ProVis platform, more -- there's more content ever being created that is digitally created. And most photographs -- what appears to be photographs are rendered in software. Almost every catalog, every video, every movie, every TV show now has a great deal of digital rendering in it. And until now, it's not been possible to do the rendering in an accelerated way. So RTX is the world's first accelerated ray-tracing GPU, and the enthusiasm from the digital content creation market is really, really great. I surely expect that -- and as I was mentioning earlier, that it's been close to a decade that the workstation industry has not had a fundamental platform architecture change. And so RTX is the first one. So I'm expecting ProVis to do really well.","Operator","Your next question is from Vivek Arya with Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya","I'm curious, Jen-Hsun, what needs to happen to work down this midrange Pascal inventory? Is it pricing? Is it something else? Because the thinking was that this could be cleared within the October quarter, but it hasn't. Do you think people were waiting for Turing to come out and maybe that created some kind of pause? And then as part of -- part B of that question, maybe Colette, how should we think about seasonality in the April quarter given that you mentioned it could take 1 or 2 quarters to work down this inventory?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yes, well, we came into Q3 with excess channel inventory post the crypto hangover. We expected the pricing in the marketplace to decline and decline slower than we expected and -- but while it was declining, we were expecting sales volume to grow, demand to grow and for pricing to be -- for volume to be elastic with pricing. I think it just took longer than -- the pricing took longer than we expected, and the volume increase took longer than we expected. At this point, most of the pricing has come down to its -- and slightly below its prelaunch levels. And so I'm hoping that -- I'm hopeful that now that pricing has stabilized, that customers will come back and buy. I guess when pricing is volatile in the channel, it probably freezes some people waiting for prices to stabilize, and that took longer than we expected frankly. But now that it's at the right levels, our expectation is that the market will return to normal. 1060 is the #1 selling graphics card in the world, and we decided not to sell anymore into the channel for the upcoming quarter to get the channel an opportunity to sell through the inventory it has. And so we'll keep our eyes on it, but our expectation is that inventory levels will come back to normal by the end of the quarter.","Colette Kress","Okay. Vivek, to answer your question also regarding Q1 in terms of what we're going to see in terms of the expectation, as the channel inventory normalizes at the end of Q4, we do believe going into Q1, we will be probably up from where we end in terms of Q4. So we won't follow that normal seasonality between Q1 and Q4. We do expect to be up as we go into Q1.","Operator","You have a question from C.J. Muse with Evercore.","Christopher Muse","I guess, a follow-up question on the channel inventory side. It looks like it's roughly $600 million kind of a drawdown here. And just curious, does that sound right? Number one. Number two, does that fit with what you are hearing from your channel partners in terms of what's excess? And then as part of that, are you drawing down inventory in the current quarter ahead of Turing architecture launch into the mainstream?","Jen-Hsun Huang","The last question, I'm not sure I understand. The -- I think the answer to your first question is yes. You framed it nicely. It's -- the answer is yes. The last question was what again?","Colette Kress","The last question was regarding our midrange. Is there any statement about future Turing products that were taken into account?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yes, we haven't announced our future Turing product, but it would be expected for us to create a Turing GPU that serves the mainstream parts of the marketplace. And so we're not announcing anything, but it would be conventional of us to do that.","Christopher Muse","I guess, the question was whether you were drawing down inventory perhaps below normalized levels in the current quarter.","Jen-Hsun Huang","No, we're really not shipping into the midrange segment of Pascal so that we get the channel an opportunity to sell through the product that has. And we would like to see channel inventory get normalized by the end of Q4, and then we'll get back to doing our work.","Operator","Your next question is from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.","Stacy Rasgon","My first one is for Colette. I just wanted to be a little more explicit. If I think about your business split into sort of gaming and non-gaming, are you looking for the non-gaming pieces in aggregate to grow sequentially into Q4?","Colette Kress","Stacy, yes. I think the answer to that is yes. In aggregate, yes, we do believe the rest of the business will grow sequentially.","Stacy Rasgon","Got it. I guess that fits with the kind of 1\/3 you're talking because that implies the gaming down 30%-plus. So that is what your kind of a magnitude that you're thinking about at this point.","Colette Kress","That is correct.","Stacy Rasgon","Got it. For my second question, I just wanted to -- for the last several quarters, the idea that the channel could be getting full is not necessarily a new worry. And yet the last several quarters, you've been saying, like on this call, that you guys felt like you had a really good handle on the channel, and yet it seems like maybe that wasn't exactly the case. Can you give us a feeling, maybe a better feeling for what changed and when you saw it in the quarter? Was this something that happened kind of like late in the quarter that you realized it? Or did you go into the quarter knowing that the inventories were high and needed to be corrected? Like what happened? Because this tone is a little different from what we've heard over the last few earnings calls from you.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Let's see. We were surprised, obviously. I mean, we're surprised by it, as anybody else. The crypto hangover lasted longer than we expected. Prices started to drift down, and we expected to come down much more quickly than it did and -- but -- and when it went down, we expected demand to come up much more quickly than it did. And so I think the channel wanted to protect its price. People were uncertain about crypto, and demand was uncertain about when the price will be stabilized. And so all of that uncertainty, I think, froze the market a little longer than we expected. Pricing is now down to below prelaunch normal levels. And so I am hopeful that we're going to see demand come back and the sell-through will happen through the holidays. And we're seeing that. And so that's -- the first one is that we -- just we didn't expect it either and we didn't realize the magnitude of it until towards the end of the quarter. What was the other question? Was there another question? I think that, that was it.","Operator","Your next question is from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.","Joseph Moore","With regards to Turing ramp, I guess, how is that going relative to your expectations? It seems like availability is quite a bit better now. And where do you stand with DLSS support? I know you've announced a number of games that will have DLSS support by year-end. Like how many of those are already supporting that technology?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yes, the ramp is going great, and I think this is the biggest generational leap we've ever had. This is the most substantial new technology that computer graphics has seen in a decade. Real-time ray-tracing is something that everybody had dreamed about for a long time. It's never seen before. And today with Battlefield V, people are enjoying real-time ray-tracing for the very, very first time. And the images are beautiful. So the ramp is great. Of course, Turing ramped into -- towards the end of the quarter and into a much more different situation than any GPU of the past. But nonetheless, the demand on the high-end products are fantastic. The 2080 Tis are largely sold out. I think it's still sold out everywhere. And so I think that the demand is great. I'm expecting it to be just a fantastic new generation. In terms of the content, you saw the first one. FINAL FANTASY is also out. And we have a pipeline, about 30 of them. We're working hard on that. And so when they -- when these games get released, RTX will be enabled. But I will say one last thing, which is content aside, RTX is higher performing at the same price point than any graphics card on the planet. And so at every single graphics -- every single price point, it is the highest performing graphics card. So it is unambiguously the highest performance GPU in the world and then -- and of course, all of these great new features will be coming.","Operator","Your next question is from Pierre Ferragu with New Street Research.","Pierre Ferragu","I'm still trying to put my head around the magnitude of this channel inventory drawdown because if you don't ship like the midrange cards for a full quarter, that means your inventory today is more than a quarter, more than 12 weeks of sales. And so my first question would be, am I right thinking that? Are you available a full quarter of sales in inventories? And then my second question is while you are bringing down these inventories, I would have expected to see, like, the Turing high-end card, the 2080 and the 2080 Ti ramping in Q4. And it looks like, excluding the inventory, the rest of the business -- the rest of the GPU business in gaming would be more like flattish sequentially.","Jen-Hsun Huang","I'm trying to figure out what the first part of the question was.","Simona Jankowski","The first question was whether the midrange of Pascal had more than 12 weeks of inventory, if it's going to take more than a quarter to bring it down.","Jen-Hsun Huang","I think the channel has more than 12 weeks of inventory between us and the other brand. One of the things that is hard to estimate is how much inventory the other brands have. And our quarter is 1 month later. And so whatever action we take, whatever we see in the channel is 1 month after their end of the quarter. The amount of inventory is not just us. It's also the other brands. And our ability to see the other brand's inventory is just much harder. We try our best to estimate it, but obviously, we didn't estimate it well enough. And so the answer to your question is yes, I think there's about -- from our perspective, about 12 weeks of our inventory to sell through at this point.","Operator","Your next question is from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.","Mark Lipacis","I was hoping you could contrast this product cycle transition to Turing to the product transition you had to Pascal. And is the only -- or is the main difference the crypto hangover? Is there something else impacting the transition, do you think? I mean, you've described Turing as the greatest generational leap, and I'm wondering if that larger delta has an impact to the transition as well.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Turing is the highest performance GPU at every single price point. And so it played no role in its transition. It's all about crypto hangover. This is the new experience as we made this transition. If you look at Turing on -- just on the basis of Turing, it had a great launch. We ramped it at the end of the quarter, as we expected. It was back-end loaded, as we expected, and the ramp was great. Everybody did a great job. And the performance is fantastic, and the excitement is great. And so I think Turing's ramp was a big success. It's -- underneath Turing was choppy, as we're talking about. And we really didn't see that until towards the end of the quarter. And as we looked out into this quarter, this coming quarter, we came to the conclusion that the best thing to do is just not to ship any more products into this segment of the marketplace because there's a fair amount of inventory and let the channel sell through the midrange Pascals. And then a quarter's time, we'll get back to business. And so I think -- I knew this is surely a setback, and I wish we had seen it earlier, in the final analysis can't exactly sure what we would have done different. But between the unexpected, unanticipated slow decline of pricing in the channel and even after the prices came down, it took a little longer than we expected for volume to kick up. And the other brand's inventory in the marketplace, those factors kind of compounded and made it a lot worse than we expected.","Operator","You have a question from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.","Aaron Rakers","Maybe I can ask the question a little bit differently on the gaming business. If I look back over the past several quarters, let's say you've been running at roughly a $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion revenue level since the October '17 quarter. Prior to that, you were at $1.1 billion, $1.2 billion. We look like we're now going back to that level. I guess, the question is, do we build off of that level? Do we bring back half of the inventory burn? How do I think about the return of year-over-year growth in that gaming piece of the business as we start to look into fiscal 2020? And then a quick second question. Over the past few years, you've had really strong seasonal sequential growth in the data center business, in Q4, about 20% sequentially. I'm just curious, how is your guide factoring in the sequential growth in that piece of the business into this current quarter?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Okay. Let me take the second one first. Our data center business is doing great. I mean, the fundamental dynamics of accelerated computing is spot on. And with Moore's Law coming to an end, it's the path forward. Take a look at the number of systems in the TOP500, 127 systems, I think, this year was, a growth of nearly 50% year-over-year. We're the #1 system in United States and the world, in Europe, in Japan. We're 22 out of the top 25 most energy-efficient computers in the world. And then this quarter, we announced three new initiatives that's going to expand us into a broader part of the high-performance computing market with machine learning, which is -- as we know, is on the largest part of artificial intelligence today, which has not been accelerated and now it is. The second is the ability to do rendering fulfillment, photorealistic rendering for the first time. And then the third is a brand-new cloud GPU, we call T4, that the enthusiasm around it is just incredible. And from the time that we went to production to the time that Google put it in their cloud was literally 30 days. It's just an incredible speed of adoption. And so I expect T4 to do quite well. So I think our data center business dynamics are really quite great. In terms of forecast, we'll just see how it turns out. But I think the fundamental dynamics are great. Back to your question about gaming.","Colette Kress","So the statement came in regarding -- you've bumped up the overall gaming somewhere in mid of the year to about a $1.7 billion gaming business, where maybe if you look back 2 years, you were at about $1.1 billion. At this stage, when you come out of the setback that we have here to get through the overall channel inventory, where will you come out after that? And what type of growth could we expect?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yes, I'm going to let you guys do the modeling, but let me just take those. There's nothing fundamentally different about the gaming market that we know. Cryptocurrency is an extraordinary factor that we all have to just internalize that it is. And we thought we had done a better job managing the cryptocurrency dynamics. But when the prices came down, started to come down and we hoped the demand would start to reflect the declining price, it just took longer than we expected. And that's what we're experiencing. In terms of the gaming marketplace, if you take a look at some of the dynamics, our notebook gaming, which is not affected by crypto, grew 50% year-over-year in China. And so the gaming market seems quite robust. RTX is going to unquestionably redefine gaming computer graphics. And so I think that the dynamics are good. We have to work through the channel inventories. This quarter, of course, we had the simultaneous decision of not shipping any more midrange products into the channel as well as seasonal -- normal seasonal console build plans. And they tend to build out a quarter before the holiday season. So you have these 2 simultaneous effects. But there's nothing about the gaming marketplace or the gaming business that we see that's fundamentally different.","Colette Kress","Yes. To kind of add to that, think about our gaming business in several pieces that we talked about in terms of the tremendous strength that is also continuing. In terms of our success in terms of Turing, our notebooks for gaming are growing extremely strong, and our overall console business is also extremely healthy as well. So to think about all of the different components, we just have a piece of channel inventory at the midrange, but overall, as you can see, gaming is also growing quite well.","Operator","Your next question is from Chris Caso with Raymond James.","Christopher Caso","A question with regard to inferencing and what we can expect from that for both Q4 and going forward. And perhaps I don't know if it's a valid comparison to compare what we might expect from inferencing after the new Quadro launches to what happened in training after the Volta launches. Is there any comparison there in terms of magnitude for how the ramp goes?","Jen-Hsun Huang","The ramp of T4 is completely related to customers porting their model on top of our platform. And the inference model is really complicated. This is one of the things that I've talked about in the past that on the one hand, people think that inference appears to be simple because there are so many ASICs built being talked about. The vast majority of the complexity of inference is actually in the optimizing compiler on top. The TensorRT, fifth-generation optimizing compiler that we announced just recently took 3, 4 years to build. And then on top of that, in order to get it to scale as quickly as what people saw in Google -- Google's cloud requires us to build something called a TRT server, an inference server that allows multiple models to run on top of Kubernetes in the cloud. That piece of software is also super complicated to write. And so the pieces of technology that we're putting together have come together. And now we're engaged with Internet companies around the world to port their most heavy workload applications on top -- or the models on top of T4. And so we're working hard on that.","And when that happens, it comes down to their decision of how many they would like to buy, and that tells us about our adoption rate. I think from a high-level perspective, if we step back for a second, the high-level -- the way to look at it is this: that we know for a fact that Moore's Law has come to an end, and at the same time, we also know that more and more data centers are deploying deep learning models and machine learning models into their data center. And it's computationally really intensive. And at this time and as we look out into the horizon, the T4 Cloud GPU is just unquestionably the most effective. It can run models, whether it's an image model or a recommendation model or a speech synthesis model. It is the highest throughput processor in the world at 70 watts, which fits into a hyperscale data center OCP server. It is also the lowest latency of any processor at inferencing in the world at less than 1 millisecond. And so between the architecture, all of the software technology and all of the software capabilities we put in place and the fact that the conditions would suggest that Internet companies need an accelerated path forward, I think T4 is really well positioned. And I look forward to coming back and telling you guys about success.","Operator","You have a question from Will Stein with SunTrust.","William Stein","First, Jen-Hsun, I appreciate all the details on the T4 for inference in the data center. Could you likewise highlight the current traction you're seeing and the long-term growth expectations for the Jetson product that's designed for really, I think, a different market? It's inference at the edge, right?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yes, Jetson is designed for edge AI. One version of Jetson, which is a functional save, high-performance with a lot of complicated software, one version of that, you could say, is self-driving cars. And this quarter, we announced winning our first mass-market Level 2. We've been really successful in robot taxis and Level 4s and trucks and shuttles and high-end systems, where the number of processors, the number of sensors, the combination of LiDARs and surround cameras requires a lot of computation and -- but we've never been successful until now. We're taking the DRIVE platform all the way down to Level 2 mass-market cars. Volvo is our first announcement, our first win in high-volume, early 2020s production ramp. And I'm expecting many more. And I think we've positioned and created a solution that is both highly useful and easy to use as well as could deliver Level 2 capability in a single chip for the very first time. And Xavier is in production. It is the only single-chip, autonomous vehicle processor in production today. Then you take that same platform and you could apply to all kinds of other edge AI devices. It could be manufacturing picking robots. It could be autonomous retail, basically AI retail, and autonomous warehouses. So -- or medical instruments, medical imaging instruments that, in the device itself, recognizes and identifies anomalies. And so all of this type of applications are leaning towards AI, and that's the reason why we built Jetson.","Operator","Your next question is from Craig Ellis with B. Riley.","Craig Ellis","I'll ask a clarification and then a question. The clarification is just on the inventory issue, and thanks for all the color. But one, are Pascal 1070s and 1080s and then Ti flavors still selling? And if so, could they present any kind of inventory risk either later this year or in early fiscal '20? And then the question really, Jen-Hsun, is trying to get a better understanding of how you see the intermediate-term growth rate of the data center business. You had spectacular high-performance compute TOP500 accelerator penetration performance up 50-plus percent. That about matches the growth in the data center business. Those may be somewhat coincidental, but can you just talk about where you see penetration across key end markets like HPC, like cloud and hyperscale and like enterprise? Which offer you the best growth from here? And where do you feel like your penetration may be more mature? I'm just trying to get a sense if there's an acceleration coming off of the 50% year-on-year growth that we're seeing now or if, consistent with the recent trend, we might be moderating potentially down into the 40% or 30% range as we go into the next calendar year.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Our high-end Pascal GPUs are largely sold. And we did a fairly good job making sure that -- with that transition before we ramped up the high-end Turing products. The -- our data center business, I would say that Q2 -- or excuse me, Q3, this last quarter, the inventory setback aside, I actually have to say that it's one of the best quarter we've ever experienced. And the reason for that is because our data center position, our accelerated computing position as a company, which is the foundation of this company, the accelerated computing focus of our company expanded in really several ways. For the first part of our journey into accelerated computing, it was really following scientific computing, simulating first principle laws of physics for scientific computing and high-performance computing codes. About 5 years ago, deep learning came into the fore, and we were alert and agile to have invested a great deal and mobilized the company to go help the world put deep learning into software developers' hands all over the world. The area where I'm super excited about right now are the three that I've mentioned that we've opened up in this last quarter with the launch of ","Turing and with the launch of RAPIDS. The first is our film rendering opportunity is -- we think that there's about 10 million CPU nodes around the world that are used for film rendering. They can now benefit from accelerated computing as Moore's Law comes to an end. The second is opening up inference. The hyperscale data center marketplace is something along the lines of 15 million CPUs sold this year. And it was growing -- let's call it, growing at about 15% per year and -- the number of CPUs. And we know for a fact that Moore's Law has come to an end and those servers are going to have to be accelerated going forward. And so I think that T4 is just ideal for that. It was designed from the ground up to deliver computing in a very, very compressed and very condensed and power-sensitive environment, which these hyperscale data centers tend to be. And the software stack from Kubernetes to containers, to a TRT compiler, to the TRT inference server and our NGC cloud with all of the stacks fully accelerated and containerized in the cloud, certifying all of the major cloud providers around the world for our containers, that process took us several years and it's put us in a really great place. So T4 is really fantastic.","And so that's -- the second segment of high-performance computing is deep learning. The third and potentially the largest currently is machine learning. This is where Hadoop goes. This is where Spark goes. This is where scikit-learn, Python, pandas. All of the data scientists around the world in retail, in transportation and logistics, in health care, in financial services that are using algorithms like random forest and XGBoost and k-nearest and k-means and PCA and all of these different buzzwords have never had the opportunity to have accelerated computing until now. And this took a couple -- 2, 3 years for us to pull together. RAPIDS has been open sourced. You can go into the NGC cloud, download it. IBM is going to integrate it into their machine learning platform. SaaS, SAP, Oracle, the cloud providers are all integrating the RAPIDS open source SDK into their machine learning platform. And so this is a new segment for us. The answer about our growth rate is, I believe, that our accelerated computing, our data center opportunity has significantly expanded during the quarter. Between the T4 hyperscale cloud GPU and RAPIDS machine learning platform, it has -- and our RTX server film rendering, we surely have expanded our data center opportunity. And so I fully expect us to continue to do well in accelerated computing for data centers.","Operator","Unfortunately, we have run out of time. I will now turn the call back over to Jen-Hsun for any closing remarks.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Thanks, everyone. To sum up, the crypto hangover has left the industry with excess inventory -- excess channel inventory. It will take 1 or 2 quarters to work through it. This is an unexpected near-term setback and doesn't change the fundamental dynamics of our company. The end of Moore's Law has cleared a way for NVIDIA accelerated computing as a great path forward. Turing opens up 3 exciting markets for us with ray-tracing games, film rendering and hyperscale inference. And with our first win in mainstream Level 2 self-driving cars with Volvo, our DRIVE AV platform is gearing up for the mass market, and our competitive position has never been stronger. We look forward to updating you on our progress. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect."],"16345":["NVIDIA Corp.

Q3 revenue was $3.01 billion, down 5% year-on-year and up 17% sequentially. Starting with our gaming business. Revenue of $1.66 billion was down 6% year-on-year and up 26% sequentially. Results exceeded our expectations driven by strength in both desktop and notebook gaming. Our GeForce RTX lineup features the most advanced GPU for every price point and uniquely offers hardware-based ray tracing for cinematic graphics. While ray tracing launched a little more than a year ago, two dozen top titles have shipped with it or are on the way. Ray tracing is supported by all the major publishers, including all-star titles and franchise such as Minecraft, Call of Duty, Battlefield, Watch Dogs, Tomb Raider, Doom, Wolfenstein and Cyberpunk. Of note, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, had a record-breaking launch in late October that came on the heels of CONTROL, an action adventure game with multiple ray trace features. Reviews have praised both for their ray tracing implementation and game-play performance. With last week's PC release of Red Dead Redemption 2 as a strong gaming lineup for the holiday season, our business reflects this growing excitement. RTX GPUs now drive more than 2\/3 of our desktop gaming GPU revenue.","Gaming laptops were a standout, driving strong sequential and year-on-year growth. This holiday season, our partners are addressing the growing demand for high-performance laptops for gamers, students and prosumers by bringing more than 130 NVIDIA-powered gaming and studio laptop models to market. This includes many thin and light form factors enabled by our Max-Q technology, triple the number of Max-Q laptops last year.","In late October, we announced the GeForce GTX 1660 Super and the 1650 Super, which refresh our mainstream desktop GPUs with more performance, faster memory and new features. The 1660 Super delivers 50% more performance than our prior-generation Pascal-based 1060, the best-selling gaming GPU of all time. It began shipping on October 29, priced at just $229. PC World called it the best GPU you can buy for 1080p gaming.","We also announced the next generation of our streaming media player with 2 new models, Shield TV and Shield TV Pro, which launched on October 28. These bring AI to the streaming market for the first time with the ability to upscale video real time from high definition to 4K using NVIDIA-trained deep neural networks. Shield TV has been widely recognized as the best streamer on the market.","Finally, we made progress in building out our cloud gaming business. Two global service providers, Taiwan Mobile and Russia's Rostelecom with GFN.ru joined SoftBank and Korea's LG as partners for our GeForce NOW game-streaming service. Additionally, Telef\u00f3nica will kick off a cloud gaming proof-of-concept in Spain.","Moving to data center. Revenue was $726 million, down 8% year-on-year and up 11% sequentially. Our hyperscale revenue grew both sequentially and year-on-year, and we believe our visibility is improving. Hyperscale activity is being driven by conversational AI, the ability for computers to engage in human-like dialogue, capturing context and providing intelligent responses. Google's breakthrough, introduction of the BERT model, with its superhuman levels of natural language understanding, is driving a way of neural networks for the language understanding. That, in turn, is driving demand for our GPUs on 2 fronts. First, these models are massive and highly complex. They have 10 to 20x, in some cases 100x, more parameters than image-based models. As a result, training these models requires V100-based compute infrastructure that, in orders of magnitude, beyond what is needed in the past. Model complexity is expected to grow significantly from here.","Second, real-time conversational AI requires very low latency and multiple neural networks running in quick succession from de-noising to speech recognition, language understanding, text-to-speech and voice encoding. While conventional approaches fail at these tasks, NVIDIA's GPUs can handle the entire inference chain, in less than 30 milliseconds. This is the first AI application where inference requires acceleration. Conversational AI is a major driver for GPU-accelerated inference.","In addition to this type of internal hyperscale activity, our T4 GPU continue to gain adoption in public clouds. In September, Amazon AWS announced general availability of the T4 globally, following the T4 rollout on Google Cloud platform earlier in the year. We shipped a higher volume of T4 inference GPU this quarter with V100 training GPUs, and both were records. Inference revenue more than doubled from last year and continued a solid double-digit percentage of total data center revenue.","Last week, the results of the first industry benchmark for AI inference, MLPerf inference, were announced. We won. In addition to demonstrating the best performance among commercially available solutions for both data center and edge applications, NVIDIA accelerators were the only ones that completed in all 5 MLPerf benchmarks. This demonstrates the programmability and performance of our computing platform across diverse AI workloads, which is critical for wide-scale data center deployment and is a key differentiator for us.","Several product announcements this quarter helped extend our AI computing platform into new markets, the enterprise edge. At Mobile World Congress, Los Angeles, we announced a software-defined 5G wireless RAN solution accelerated by GPUs in collaboration with Ericsson. This opens up the wireless RAN market to NVIDIA GPUs. It enables new AI applications as well as AR, VR and gaming to be more accessible to the telco edge.","We announced the NVIDIA EGX Intelligent Edge Computing Platform. With an ecosystem of more than 100 technology companies worldwide, early adopters include Walmart, BMW, Procter & Gamble, Samsung Electronics, NTT East and the cities of San Francisco and Las Vegas. Additionally, we announced a collaboration with Microsoft on intelligent edge computing. This will help industries better manage and gain insights from the growing flood of data created by retail stores, warehouses, manufacturing facilities and urban infrastructure.","Finally, last week, we held our GPU Technology Conference in Washington, D.C., which was sold out with more than 3,500 registered developers, CIOs and federal employees. At the event, we announced that the U.S. Postal Service, the world's largest delivery service with almost 150 billion pieces of mail delivered annually, is adopting AI technology from NVIDIA, enabling 10x faster processing of package data and with higher accuracy.","Moving to ProVis. Revenue reached a record $324 million, up 6% from the prior year and up 11% sequentially driven primarily by mobile workstations. NVIDIA RTX graphic and Max-Q technology have enabled a new wave of mobile workstations that are powerful enough for design applications yet thin and light enough to carry. We expect this to become a major new category with exciting growth opportunities.","Over 40 top creative design applications are being accelerated with RTX GPUs. Just last week, at the Adobe Max Conference, RTX accelerated capabilities were added to 3 Adobe Creative apps. RTX-accelerated apps are now available to tens of millions of artists and designers, driving demand for our RTX GPUs. We also continue to see growing customer deployment of data science, AI and VR applications. Strong demand this quarter came from manufacturing, public sector, higher education and health care customers.","Finally, turning to automotive. Revenue was $162 million, down 6% from a year ago and down 22% sequentially. The sequential decline was driven by a onetime nonreoccurring development services contract recognized in Q2. Additionally, we saw a roll-off of legacy infotainment revenue and general industry weakness. Our AI cockpit business grew driven by the continued ramp of the Daimler as they deploy their AI-based infotainment systems across their fleet of Mercedes-Benz vehicles.","In August, Optimus Ride launched New York City's first autonomous driving pilot program powered by NVIDIA DRIVE. Urban settings pose unique challenges for autonomous vehicles given the number of density of objects that need to be perceived and comprehended in real time. Our DRIVE computer and software stack allows these shuttles to safely and effectively provide first- and last-mile transit services. We remain excited about the long-term opportunity in auto. Our offering is -- consists of in-car AV computing platforms as well as GPU servers for all AI development and simulation. We believe we are well positioned in the industry with leading end-to-end platform that enables customers to develop, test and safely operate autonomous vehicles, ranging from cars and trucks to shuttles and robo-taxis.","Moving to the rest of the P&L. Q3 GAAP gross margins was 63.6%, and non-GAAP was 64.1%, up sequentially, reflecting a benefit from sales of previously written-off inventory, higher GeForce GPUs average selling prices and lower component costs. GAAP operating expenses were $989 million, and non-GAAP operating expenses were $774 million, up 15% and 6% year-on-year, respectively. GAAP EPS was $1.45, down 26% from a year earlier. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.78, down 3% from a year ago. Cash flow from operations was a record $1.6 billion.","With that, let me turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, which does not include any contribution from the pending acquisition of Mellanox.","We expect revenue to be $2.95 billion, plus or minus 2%. This reflects expectations for strong sequential growth in data center, offset by a seasonal decline in notebook GPUs for gaming and Switch-related revenue. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 64.1% and 64.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.02 billion and $805 million, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP OI&E are both expected to be income of approximately $25 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 9%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $130 million to $150 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website.","In closing, let me highlight the upcoming events for the financial community. We will be at the Cr\u00e9dit Suisse Annual Technology Conference on December 3, Deutsche Bank's Auto Tech Conference on December 10 and Barclays Global Technology, Media and Telecommunications Conference on December 11.","We will now open the call for questions. Operator, would you please poll for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya","For my first one, you mentioned that you were seeing strong sequential growth in the data center going into Q4. Jensen, I was wondering if you could give us some color on what's driving that and just how you think about the sustainability of data center growth going into next year and what markets do you think will drive that. Is it more enterprise, more hyperscale, more HPC? Just some color on near and longer term on data center. And then I have a follow-up for Colette.","Jensen Huang","Yes. Thanks a lot, Vivek. We had a strong Q3 in hyperscale data centers. As Colette mentioned earlier, we shipped a record number of V100s and T4s. And for the very first time, we shipped more T4s than V100. And most of the T4s are driven by inference. In fact, our inference business is now a solid double-digit, and it doubled year-over-year. And all -- most -- that is really driven by several factors. The -- as you know, we've been working on deep learning for some time, and people have been developing deep learning models. It started with computer vision. But image recognition doesn't really take that much of the data center capacity.","Over the last couple of years, a couple of very important developments have happened. One development is a breakthrough in using deep learning for recommendation systems. As you know, recommendation systems is the backbone of the Internet. Whenever you do shopping, whenever you're watching movies, looking at news, doing search, all of the personalized web pages, all of just about your entire experience on the Internet is made possible by recommendation systems because there is just so much data out there putting the right data in front of you based on your social profile or your personal use patterns or your interest or your connections, all of that is vitally important. For the very first time, we're seeing recommendation system based on deep learning throughout the world. And so increasingly, you're going to see people roll this out. And the backbone of the Internet is now going to be based on deep learning.","The second part is conversational AI. Conversational AI has been coming together in pieces; at first, speech recognition, which requires some amount of noise processing or beam forming. Then you go into speech recognition. Then it goes to natural language understanding, which then gets connected to a recommendation system, which then gets connected to text-to-speech and a speech encoder. And then that has to be done very, very quickly. Whereas images could be done off-line, conversation has to be done in real time. And without acceleration and without NVIDIA's accelerators, it's really not possible to do it in real time. It takes seconds to process all of the handful of deep learning models, and now we're able to do that all on an accelerator and do it in real time.","And so the combination of these various breakthroughs from deep learning-based recommenders, the speech stack as well as natural language understanding breakthrough in what is called a bidirectional encoded transformer, that breakthrough is really quite significant. And since then, derivative works have come from that approach. And natural language understanding is really, really working incredibly well. And so what we're seeing people do is -- the hyperscalers across the world, we work with just about everybody, this area of work is really complicated. The models are very, very large. There's a whole bunch of models that has to work together, and they're getting larger. And so that's one large category, which is the hyperscalers.","The second, which we introduced this quarter, is really about taking AI out to the edge. And the reason for that is because there are many applications, whether it's based on video or other types of sensors of all kinds where there's a vibration sensor, temperature sensors, barometric sensor, there's all kinds of sensors that are used in industries to monitor the health of equipment, monitor the conditions of various situations. And you want to do the processing at the point of action. This way, you don't have to screen the data, which is continuous back into the cloud, which costs a lot of money. You want to take the action at the point of action because latency matters. Maybe you're controlling gates or vehicles or robots or drones or whatnot.","And then lastly, one major issue is data sovereignty. Maybe your company doesn't own all of the data that you are processing and, therefore, you have to do that processing at the edge, and you can't afford to put that into the cloud. And so these various industries: retail, warehouse, logistics, smart cities, we're just seeing so much enthusiasm there around that. And this -- so we built a platform called the EGX, which basically is a cloud native, completely secure, takes advantage of NVIDIA's full stack of every single model. And it's managed with Kubernetes remotely, and you could deploy these services at the edge in faraway places because IT departments can't afford to go out there to manage them. And we've seen some really great adoption. We announced this last quarter. Walmart is using our platform. BMW is using it for logistics, Procter & Gamble for manufacturing, Samsung Electronics for manufacturing, visual inspection. And then last week, we announced probably the largest logistics operation in the world, the United States Postal Service.","And so those are -- I would say that intelligent edge will likely be the largest AI industry in the world for rather clear reasons. If you just kind of estimated the size of retail, it's nearly $30 trillion. And if retail stores could be made a little bit more convenient, it could save the industry a lot of money: warehouses, logistics, transportation, farming. I think there's like 0.5 million farms in the world, covers 1\/3 of the world's land mass. And so there's a lot of places where AI could be put at the edge and could make a big difference. And I think this is going to be the grand adventure that we started this last quarter with the announcement of NVIDIA EGX.","Vivek Arya","Right. And Jensen, as quick follow-up, on PC gaming, how are you looking at growth going forward in that you had a very good quarter in October? I think in January, you're probably guiding to some seasonal declines, but I imagine a lot more of that is due to console decline. Just how are you looking at PC gaming growth going into October -- into January and then next year as you get competition from 2 new consoles that are also supposed to come out?","Jensen Huang","Yes. During Q4 and Q1, we see normal seasonal declines of console builds, and we also see a normal seasonal decline of notebook builds. And the reason for that is because the notebook vendors have to line up all their manufacturing in Q3 so that they could meet the hot selling season in Q4. And so we're seeing -- what we see in the Q4 and Q1 time frame are just normal seasonal declines of these systems. Overall, for PC gaming -- and RTX is doing fantastic. Let me tell you why it's so important. I would say that at this point, I think it's fairly clear that ray tracing is the future and that RTX is a home run. Just about every major game developer has signed on to ray tracing. Even the next-generation consoles had to stutter step and include ray tracing in their next-generation consoles. The effects -- the photorealistic look is just so compelling, it's not possible to really go back anymore. And so I think that it's fairly clear now that RTX ray tracing is the future. And there are several hundred million PC gamers in the world that don't have the benefits of it, and I'm looking forward to upgrading them.","Second, and this is a combination of RTX and Max-Q, we really created a brand-new game platform, notebook PC gaming. Notebook PC gaming really didn't exist until Max-Q came along. And our second-generation Max-Q, this last season, really turbocharged this segment. Over 100 laptops now are available for PC gaming. And my sense is that this is likely going to be the largest gaming platform, new gaming platform that emerges. And we're just in the beginning innings of that. And so the combination of upgrading the entire installed base of PC gamers to RTX and ray tracing and this new gaming segment called notebook PC gaming is really quite exciting, and it's going to drive our continued growth for some time. And so I'm excited about that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.","Aaron Rakers","I have a follow-up if I can as well. Just thinking about the trajectory of gross margin here, solid gross margin upside in the quarter, you also noted that you had the benefit of selling through some written-off components. So I guess first question is what was that impact in this most recent reported quarter. And how do we think about the trajectory of gross margin here even beyond the January quarter? What should we be thinking about in terms of that gross margin trend? And again, I have a quick follow-up.","Colette Kress","Sure. Thanks for the question. In the current quarter, the net benefit, as we refer to as the net release of our inventory provisions primarily associated with our components, was about 1 percentage point to our overall gross margin. As you know, going forward, mix is still the largest driver of our gross margin over time. Over the long term, we do expect gross margins to improve, and we'll continue to see, outside of the benefit that we received, gross margin improvement for the long term.","Jensen Huang","Yes. As you know, just to add to that, as you know, NVIDIA's really become a software company. If you take a look at almost all of our products, the GPU -- having the world's best GPU, of course, is the starting point. But almost everything that we do, whether it's in artificial intelligence or data analytics or health care or robotics or self-driving cars, almost all of these platforms: gaming, rendering, cloud graphics, all of these platforms start from a really rich stack of software. And you can't just put a chip in these scenarios and they work. And so most of our businesses are now highly software-rich, and they address verticals that we focus on. And then secondarily, we're a platform company. And so our platform is available from all the OEMs and cloud providers. And as a platform company that has a great deal of software intensity, it's natural that the margins would be higher over time.","Aaron Rakers","Yes. Very helpful. And then you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you've seen hyperscale -- your hyperscale business within data center grow both on a quarter-over-quarter as well as year-over-year basis in this last print. You also mentioned that your visibility is improving. Can you just help us understand what exactly you're seeing in the hyperscale guys because it feels like there's some mixed data points out there? What underpins your improved visibility? Or what are you seeing in that piece of your business?","Jensen Huang","Yes. We had a strong Q3. We're going to see a much stronger Q4. And the foundation of that is AI, it's deep learning inference. That is -- this deep learning inference is understandably going to be one of the largest computer industry opportunities. And the reason for that is because the computation intensity is so high. And for the very first time, aside from computer graphics, this mode of software is not really practical without accelerators. And so I mentioned earlier about the large-scale movement to deep learning recommendation systems. Those models are really, really hard to train.","I mentioned earlier about conversational AI. Because conversation requires real-time processing, several seconds is really not practical. And so you have to do it in milliseconds, tens of milliseconds. And our accelerator makes that possible. What makes it really complicated and the reason why -- although so many people talk about it, only we demonstrated -- we submitted all 5 results -- all 5 tests for the MLPerf inference benchmark, and we won them. And the reason for that is because it's far more than just a chip. The software stack that sits on top of the chip and the compilers that sits on top of the chip are so complicated. And it's understandably complicated because a supercomputer wrote the software, and this body of software is really, really large. And if you have to make it both accurate as well as performant, it's really quite a great challenge. And it's one of the great computer science challenges. This is one of those problems that hasn't been solved, and we've been working hard at it for the last 6, 7 years now.","And so this is really the great opportunity. We've been talking about inference for some time now. Finally, the workloads and a very large diverse set of workloads are now moving into production. And so I'm hoping -- I'm enthusiastic about the progress and seeing the trends and the visibility that inference should be a large market opportunity for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI.","Christopher Muse","I guess I'd love to follow on, on that last question. So clearly, your commentary, Jensen, here is much more bullish than I've heard you, I think, before on inference, particularly as it relates to this first benchmark. And so I guess can you talk a bit about how you see mix within data center looking out over the next 12, 24 months as you see kind of training versus inference as well as cloud versus enterprise, considering, I would think, inference over time could be -- could grow into a large opportunity there as well?","Jensen Huang","Yes. C.J., that's really good. Let me break it down. So when we think about hyperscale, there are three parts: training, inference and public cloud.","Training, you might have seen the work that was done at open AI recently where they've been measuring and monitoring the amount of computation necessary to train these large models. These large models are now only getting larger. The amount of data necessary, therefore, has to scale as well. The computation is now growing and doubling every 3 months. And the reason for that is because of recent breakthroughs in natural language understanding. And all of a sudden, a whole wave of problems are now able to be solved. And just as AlexNet 7 years ago kind of was the watershed event for a lot of computer vision-oriented AI work, now the transformer-based natural language understanding model and the work that Google did with BERT really is a watershed event also for natural language understanding. This is, of course, a much, much harder problem. And so the scale of the training has grown tremendously. I think what we're going to see this year is a fair number of very sizable installations of GPU systems to do this very thing, training.","The second part is an untapped market for us, and this untapped market is really inference. The reason why I haven't really spoken about it until now is because we've never really been able to validate our intuition that inference is going to be a large market opportunity for us, that it's going to be very complicated. The models are very large. They're very diverse. They require large amount of computation, large amount of memory bandwidth and large amounts of memory and large and significant capabilities of programmability. And so I've talked about this before, but I've never been able to validate it. And of course, with MLPerf and sweeping the benchmarks and, frankly, only -- the only one although so many have attempted, they submitted results and some of them resented it, that this benchmark is just really, really hard. Inference is hard. And then finally, our business results also validated the -- our intuition. And so our engagement now with CSPs are now global. We're working across natural language understanding, recommendation systems, conversational AI, just a whole bunch of really, really interesting problems.","Now the cloud is the third piece. And the reason why cloud is growing so well and represents about half almost of many of our CSPs, particularly the ones with the public cloud, the reason for that is because the number of AI start-ups in the world is still growing so incredibly. I think we're tracking something close to 10,000 and more AI start-ups around the world. In health care, in transportation, in retail, in consumer Internet, in Fintech, the number of AI companies out there is just extraordinary. I think over the last 3 or 4, 5 years, some $20 billion, $30 billion have been invested into start-ups. And these start-ups, of course, use cloud service providers so that they don't have to invest in their own infrastructure because it's fairly complicated. And so we're seeing a lot of growth there.","And so that's just the hyperscalers. The hyperscalers give us 3 points of growth -- 3 areas of growth: training, inference and public cloud. And the public cloud is primarily AI start-ups. Then there's the intelligent edge, which we recently ventured into, and we've been building this platform called EGX for some time. And it's cloud native. It's incredibly secure. You can manage it from afar. It's -- the stack is complicated. It's performant. And we saw some -- we've been working with some early adopters. And this last quarter, we announced some of them: Walmart and BMW and Procter & Gamble and the largest logistics company in the world, USPS. And so this new platform, I think, long term, will likely be the largest opportunity. And the reason for that is because of the industries that it serves.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur","There are a lot of concerns around China trade tensions, economic slowdown. But history has shown that gamers tend to be less sensitive to these macro trends and, in fact, also somewhat insensitive to price changes, at least at the enthusiast level. So given that China is such a big part of the gaming segment, can you just discuss the gaming demand trends out of this geography?","Jensen Huang","Gaming is solid in China, and it is also the fastest adopter of our gaming notebooks. This gaming RTX notebooks or GeForce notebooks is really a brand new category. This category never existed before because we couldn't get the technology in there so that it's both delightful to own as well as powerful to enjoy. And so we saw really great success with RTX notebooks and GeForce notebooks in China, and RTX adoption has been fast.","Your comments make sense because most of the games are free-to-play these days. The primary games that people play are esports, which you want the best gear, but you could -- after you buy the gear, you pretty much enjoy it forever; and mobile, which is largely free-to-play. You invest in some of your own personal outfits. And after that, I think you can enjoy it for quite a long time. And so the gear is really important. One of the areas where we've done really great work, particularly in China, has to do with social. We have this platform called GeForCe Experience. And as an extension of that, there's a new feature called RTX Broadcast Engine. And it basically applies AI to broadcasting your content to share it. You could make movies. You could capture your favorite scenes and turn it into art, applying AI. And one of the coolest features is that you could overlay yourself on top of the game and share it with all the social networks without a green screen behind you. We use AI to stitch you out, basically, to cut you out of the background and irrespective of what noisy background you've got.","And so as you know, China has really a super hyper social community -- communities back there and they have all kinds of really cool social platforms to share games and user-generated content and short videos and all kinds of things like that. And so GeForce has that one additional feature that really makes it successful.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.","Toshiya Hari","I wanted to ask on automotive. Colette, in your prepared remarks, you talked about your legacy infotainment business being down in the quarter. Just curious, what percentage of automotive revenue at this point is legacy infotainment versus the newer AI\/ADAS solutions? And more importantly, Jensen, if you can speak to the growth trajectory in automotive over the next 1.5 years, maybe 2, that would be appreciated. And I do ask the question because it feels like we've heard many, many announcements, customer announcements, collaborative work that you're doing with your customers, yet we haven't quite seen sort of a hockey-stick inflection that some of us were expecting a couple of years ago. So just kind of curious when we should -- how we should set our expectations going forward.","Colette Kress","Yes. Toshiya, let me address the first question regarding our legacy infotainment systems for our automotive business. It is still representing maybe about half or more of our overall revenue in the automotive business. We have our AI cockpit continuing to grow and grow quite well, both sequentially as well as year-over-year, as well as our autonomous vehicle solutions that we may be doing, including development services.","Jensen Huang","Let's see. The -- we're the first -- probably the first AV car that's going to be passenger-owned on the road, and I think we've talked about it before, is Volvo. And we're expecting them to be in the late 2020, early 2021 time frame. And I'm still expecting so. And then there's the 2022, 2023 generations. Most -- I would say most of the passenger-owned vehicle developments are going quite well. The industry, as you know, is under some amount of pressure, and so a lot of them have slipped it out a couple of years or so. And this is something that I think we've already spoken about in the past.","Our focus, our strategy consists of several areas. One area, of course, is passenger-owned vehicles. The second part is robot taxis. We have developments going with just about every major robot taxi company that we know of. And they're here in the states. They're in Europe. They're in China. And when you hear news of them, we're delighted to see their progress. And then the third part has to do with trucks, shuttles and increasingly a large number of vehicles that don't carry people, they carry goods. And so we have a major development with Volvo. That was Volvo Trucks. Volvo Cars and Volvo Trucks, as you know, are 2 different companies. One of them belongs to Geely, Volvo Cars. Volvo Trucks is the heritage Volvo. And we have a major program going with them to automate the delivery of goods.","You also see us during various GTCs, I'll mention companies that we're working with on grocery delivery or goods delivery or within a warehouse product delivery. You're going to see a whole bunch of things like that because the technology is very similar, and it's starting to -- the development -- the technology we develop for passenger-owned vehicles has started to propagate down into logistics vehicles. I continue to believe that everything that moves eventually will have autonomous capability or be fully autonomous. And that, I think, is, at this point, fairly certain.","Now our strategy is both in developing the in-car AV computing system, and it's software-defined, it's scalable, as well as the AI development and simulation systems. And so when somebody's working on AV and they're using AI, and most of them are, there's a great opportunity for us. And when they start ramping up and they're collecting miles of data, it becomes a very large market opportunity for us. And so I'm anxious to see every single car company be as progressive and aggressive in developing AV. And they will be. They will be. This is a foregone conclusion.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein.","Stacy Rasgon","I have two data center questions for Colette. The first question, I want to return to your kind of outlook for strong sequential data center growth in Q4. Now this business grew 11% sequentially in Q3. And you didn't actually call out strong growth as we were going into the quarter. You are calling it out for Q4. Does that suggest to me that you expect sequential growth in Q4 to be stronger than Q3 given you're calling it out in Q4 and you didn't call it out in Q3? Or would you define like what you saw in Q3 as well as already being strong sequential growth? Like how do we think about the wording of that in relation to what we've seen in Q3 and what you expect for Q4?","Colette Kress","Sure, Stacy. When we had provided guidance in Q3 and how we finished the quarter in Q3, we had indicated that our growth would stem from both gaming and data center. We completed that. And we also had stronger than expected from guidance from both gaming and data center in our Q3 results. Moving to Q4, Q4 is a sequential decrease in totality versus Q3. We have reminded the teams about our overall seasonality that we sometimes have in gaming associated with our consoles as well as also with our notebooks that seem to be primarily in Q2 and Q3 being our strongest quarters and likely, therefore, a seasonal downtick as it move to Q4. What we wanted to do was, if we have in totality overall decline associated with that, we did want to emphasize what we are expecting in terms of data center with the overall strong growth sequentially.","Stacy Rasgon","So I guess to ask the question again, would you define what you saw in Q3 as being strong growth as well?","Colette Kress","I would believe our growth of 17% was higher than we expected to Q3. Again, when we get into Q4, we'll see how the quarter ends in terms of data center, but we are expecting strong growth. Thanks, Stacy.","Stacy Rasgon","Okay. And for my second question, hyperscale you said was up year-over-year. Now -- and that's after, off of last year, where it was the peak. Inference doubled year-over-year. And this suggests to me -- I know you said enterprise was down year-over-year. But this suggests to me that it wasn't just down year-over-year, it was down a lot year-over-year. How do we think about that in the context of like the growth that we've seen very strongly over the last few quarters in enterprise. And going back to your commentary at the Analyst Day, which was almost entirely about the opportunity coming from enterprise growth, what's going on there? What drove that? And what should we expect going forward?","Colette Kress","Sure. Our enterprise business has been beginning to ramp from over a year ago at a very, very, very small base. We've continued to see great traction in there with a lot of the things that we've announced throughout. But keep in mind in our year ago quarter, we also had very strong systems and a very large deal associated with our DGX. So when we look from a quarter-over-quarter period or just looking at 1 quarter, we can have a little bit of lumpiness. So that year-over-year impact is really just due to an extremely large deal in the prior year Q3.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mitch Steves with RBC.","Mitchell Steves","I apologize for any background noise, but I just have one question, just for Jensen. So in 2018, can you give us a rough update on what the GPU utilization was for deep learning application? What it is today? I'm just wondering how the -- how that's advanced over the last couple of year or two.","Jensen Huang","Let's see. I would say 2018, it was nearly all related to training. And this year, we started to see the growth of inference to the point where we now -- we have now sold more -- this last quarter, we sold more T4 GPUs for inference than we sold V100s that's used for training, and both of them were record highs. And so the comment that Colette just made, comparing to year-over-year, we had a large DGX system sale a year ago that we didn't have this year. But if you excluded that, the V100 and the T4 is doing great. They're at record levels. And T4 didn't hardly existed a year ago, now it's selling more than V100s, and both of them are record highs. And so that kind of gives you a feeling for it. I think that's really the major difference that inference is really kicking into gear, and my sense is that it's going to continue to grow quite nicely.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.","Joseph Moore","I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about the 5G opportunity that you announced at Mobile World. And I guess you talked a lot about AI and IoT services in a C-RAN environment. But is there -- how big is that opportunity? And can you address kind of the core compute aspect to C-RAN with the GPU?","Jensen Huang","Yes. If you look at the world of mobile today, there are players that are building DRAMs and their radio heads in the BBU, basically the baseband units. In the data center where people would like to move the software for radio networks, it's really an untapped market. And the reason for that is because the CPU is just not able to support the level of performance that's necessary for 5G. And ASICs are too rigid to be able to put into a data center. And so the data center needs a programmable solution that is data center-ready that can support all of the software richness that goes along with the data center, whether it's a VM environment like VMware. And we -- recently, during the quarter, we announced another partnership with VMware. They recognize that increasingly, our GPUs are becoming a core part of data centers and cloud. We had a partner -- we announced a partnership with Red Hat. They realize the momentum that they're seeing us in, in telcos, and they would like to adapt their entire stack from open stack to OpenShift on top of our GPUs. And so now with VMware, with Red Hat, we're going to have a world-class telco enterprise stack that ranges all the way from hypervisors and virtual machines all the way to Kubernetes.","And so our strategy is to -- our goal is to really create this new world of C-RAN, vRAN centralized data centers and software-defined networking. And the software-defined networking will, of course, include things like in the data center networking as well as firewalls. But the computationally-intensive stuff is really the 5G radio. And so we're going to create a software stack for 5G and basically exactly the same way that we've done for creating a -- excuse me, a software stack for deep learning. And we call it Aerial. Aerial is to 5G essentially what Cuda-NN is for deep learning and essentially what optics is for ray tracing. And this software stack is going to allow us to run the whole software -- run the whole 5G stack in software and deliver the highest performance, the incredible flexibility and scale to as many layers of MIMO as customers need and to be able to put all of it in the data center.","The power of putting it into data center, as you know, is flexibility and fungibility. With the low latency capability of 5G, you could put a data center somewhere in the regional hub. And depending on where the traffic is going, you could shift the traffic computation from 1 data center to another data center, something that you can't do in basebands, in baseband units in the cell towers, but you can do that in the data center. And that helps them reduce the cost. The second benefit is that the telcos would love to be a service provider for a data center's computation at the edge. And the edge applications are things like smart cities and whether it's warehouses or retail stores or whatever it is because they're geographically located and is distributed all over the world. And so to be able to use their data center to also be able to use AI in combination with IoT is really exciting to them. And so I think that that's really -- this is really the future that we're going to see a lot more service providers at the edge. And these edge data centers will have to run the data center, the networking, including the mobile network and software as well as run 5G and IoT -- AI and IoT applications","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of Harsh Kumar with Piper Jaffray.","Harsh Kumar","I apologize for the background noise. But Colette, maybe you could give us an idea of gaming. In the guidance, it's down. And I was wondering, could you maybe give us the impact of the console business versus the laptop and give us an idea of what might be the bigger driver there?","Colette Kress","I would say, for our Q4, both of them are expected to be seasonally down. In the case of the consoles, we do wait for Nintendo to assist in terms of what they need. So we will have to see how the quarter ends on that. But in both cases, in totality, these businesses have ranged, maybe in totality of the 2, of about $500 million a quarter. And we'll see both of them sequentially decline. Thank you.","Operator","I'll now turn the call back over to Jensen for any closing remarks.","Jensen Huang","Thanks, everyone. We had a good quarter driven by strong gaming growth and hyperscale demand. We're making great strides in 3 big impact initiatives. The world of computer graphics is moving to ray tracing, and our business reflects that. Some of the biggest blockbuster games this holiday season and beyond are RTX-enabled, including Call of Duty: Modern Warfare; and the best-selling game of all-time, Minecraft. Design applications used by millions of artists and creators are rapidly adopting RTX ray tracing. We're reinventing computer graphics and look forward to upgrading the hundreds of millions of PC gamers to RTX.","Hyperscale demand was strong this quarter, and our visibility continues to improve. The race is on for conversational AI, which will be a powerful catalyst for us in both training and inference. And lastly, we have extended our computing platform beyond the cloud to the edge, where GPU-accelerated 5G, AI and IoT, will revolutionize the world's largest industries. We look forward to updating you on our progress in February.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the NVIDIA Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Rob Csongor, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Rob Csongor","Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to NVIDIA's conference call on annual and fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 results. ","With me on the call today from NVIDIA are Jen-Hsun Huang, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Burns, Interim Chief Financial Officer. After our prepared remarks, we will open up the call to a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that today's call is being webcast live on NVIDIA's Investor Relations website and is also being recorded. A replay of the conference call will be available via telephone until February 22, 2012, and the webcast will be available for replay until our conference call to discuss our financial results for our first quarter of fiscal 2013. The content of today's conference call is NVIDIA's property and cannot be reproduced or transcribed without our prior written consent.","During the course of this call, we may make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of factors that could affect our future financial results and business, please refer to the disclosure in today's earnings release, our Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended October 30, 2011, and the reports we may file from time to time on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","All our statements are made as of today, February 15, 2012, based on information available to us as of today, and except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements. Unless or otherwise noted, all references to market research and market share numbers throughout the call come from Mercury Research or Jon Peddie Research.","During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our financial release, which is posted on our website or in the case of our fiscal year 2013 outlook, the reconciliation is posted on our Investor Relations website.","With that, let's begin. After 5 consecutive quarters of sequential revenue growth, fourth quarter revenue was negatively impacted by the global disk drive shortage caused by the flooding in Thailand, which affected the mainstream GPU segment more than anticipated. Shipments by some PC OEMs were reduced, and higher disk drive prices constrained the ability of some PC OEMs to include a GPU in their systems.  Additionally, the Tegra 2 mobile business declined more rapidly than expected ahead of devices based on the Tegra 3 processor ramping into production in the first quarter of calendar year 2012. ","However, despite tough economic conditions and the exiting of our chipset business, NVIDIA recorded very good results for our full fiscal year 2012.  First, our overall GP -- our overall business grew 33%, excluding the chipset business we've been exiting. Discrete GPUs, including GeForce, Quadro and Tesla grew sharply over the year. GPU attach rates remained strong at 53% of consumer PCs and 36% overall, according to Mercury Research data.","A resurgent PC gaming market saw games like Battlefield 3 and Modern Warfare 3 record over $1  billion in sales in their first week on the shelves. At the time of the launch of Battlefield 3, over 80% of gamers were below the recommended hardware specification to play the game, driving a significant increase in gamer GPU revenues over the year.","Our Professional Solutions Business had a record revenue year driven by large adoption of the Fermi generation of Quadro workstation products, as well as growth in emerging design economies such as India and China. Our Tesla products were selected to power the world's fastest supercomputers, including Oak Ridge National Laboratory's upcoming Titan supercomputer. In addition, we made major strides in speeding up GPU computing applications support and code porting through our open HPC and directives initiatives.","And in one of our most important achievements for the year, we established a position in the mobile market. Tegra products captured share in Tier 1 tablets and smartphones. Over the course of the year, Tegra products shipped in 14 phones, 34 tablets and in 18 of the top 20 carriers. We designed and shipped 3 generations of Android devices. With Tegra 2, we were the first to ship dual-core mobile processors. And now with Tegra 3, we are the first to ship quad-core processors. The Tegra mobile processor has grown into a multi-hundred million dollar business.","Looking ahead, while we anticipate continued negative effects from the hard drive shortage, we believe gaming demand will continue to be robust, driven by the combination of our next-generation Kepler architecture and new hit games, such as Mass Effect 3 and Diablo III, both highly anticipated PC games coming in early calendar year 2012.","We believe that tax rates will continue to be stable, and that we are well positioned to grow notebook share with significant new notebook wins in the upcoming Ivy Bridge design cycle.","We are excited about a number of recent announcements we made in the professional space, which we believe will transform the workstation.  First, yesterday, we announced that NVIDIA has joined forces with HP to introduce the world's first of all-in-one workstation, the Quadro-based HP Z1 Workstation. The Z1 features a 27-inch display that snaps open like the hood of the car, so users can easily swap out parts and make upgrades without any tools required. This is the first and an entirely new category of professional workstation that we believe will tap market segments where space is a premium and users are unwilling to compromise performance. ","Second, we announced Maximus, a breakthrough for the workstation industry. Maximus enables for the first time a single workstation to simultaneously handle real-time visualization and compute-intensive simulation, functions which previously required separate steps or separate systems. Design and creative professionals have longed for machine that could perform these functions simultaneously. Maximus includes a combination of Quadro and Tesla, unifying software technology and a rigorous certification process for professional applications. We believe Maximus will redefine the workflow in several segments and that workstations will increasingly shift with multiple GPUs.","Meanwhile, Tesla continued to make headlines in computational science. In addition to a number of new supercomputer deployment announcements, we announced breakthroughs in research. Two of the most important supercomputers in the world were recently announced in Oak Ridge National Labs' Titan and the NCSA's Blue Waters, both Tesla-based. China -- Chinese researchers announced they had achieved a major breakthrough in the race to battle influenza by using NVIDIA Tesla GPUs to create the world's first computer simulation of a whole H1N1 influenza virus at the atomic level.","With Tegra 3, we believe our mobile business is poised for renewed growth. In addition to the launch of the world's first quad-core tablet, the ASUS Transformer Prime, we announced tablets based on Tegra 3 from a number of key OEMs, including Lenovo, ZTE, Fujitsu and Acer. We also announced, together with ASUS, the world's first quad-core tablet priced at $249, the ASUS 7-inch MeMO ME370T. Next up, our Tegra 3 phones. We're looking forward to announcing some of the first ones at Mobile World Congress.  ","With innovating, exciting new tablets at the high end, quad-core tablets at lowered price points for consumers, the world's first quad-core smartphones coming soon and Windows 8 devices later in the year, we remain confident that Tegra 3 will drive a new phase of growth for our mobile business.","With that, let me hand the call over to Karen.","Karen Burns","Thanks, Rob. For the fiscal year 2012, revenue was $4 billion, up 12.8% from the prior year. GAAP net interest -- net income grew 129.5%, resulting in earnings of $0.94 per diluted share, an increase of 118.6% over the prior fiscal year of $0.43. Non-GAAP net income grew 54.2%, resulting in earnings of $1.19 per diluted share, an increase of 46.9% over the prior fiscal year of $0.81.","For the fourth quarter, revenue was $953.2 million, down 10.6% from the prior quarter. As Rob discussed, the hard disk drive shortage had more impact on our mainstream GPU segments than originally anticipated, and our Tegra 2 products declined more rapidly than expected. GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 51.4%, 0.8% lower than the prior quarter and our original expectations due to an additional charge in the quarter to settle a patent dispute with Rambus. Non-GAAP gross margin, which excluded this charge, was 52.5%, consistent with the record gross margins we achieved in Q3. These results contributed to a GAAP net income of $116 million for the quarter or $0.19 per diluted share, and non-GAAP net income worth $158.1 million or $0.26 per diluted share.","Revenue results by business segment were as follows: Our GPU business was down 3.6% quarter on quarter, due to the impact of the disk drive shortage on our mainstream GPU desktop and notebook businesses. Our professional business was down 3.6% from the record level achieved in the third quarter. Our Consumer business was down 42.5% sequentially. As mentioned previously, this primarily related to the sharp decline in our Tegra 2 products ahead of the ramp of Tegra 3, as well as the seasonal decline in our game console revenues.","For GAAP, our outlook for the first quarter is as follows: Revenue at $900 million to $930 million; gross margin of 49.2%, plus or minus 1%; OpEx at $383 million; and a tax at approximately 20%. For non-GAAP, we expect the following differences from our gap outlook: gross margin of 49.5%, plus or minus 1%; and OpEx at $340 million. Depreciation and amortization are expected in the range of $52 million to $56 million, and capital expenditures in the range of $35 million to $45 million. Diluted shares are expected to be 622.5 million.","As for the FY '13 outlook, our view of the market has changed and the outlook we gave in Q3 should no longer be relied upon. We are updating our FY '13 outlook as follows: we expect the overall PC market to experience continued headwind from the disk drive shortage. We expect our GPU business to gain share. Our Professional Solutions Business is expected to have another record year. Maximus enables us to sell more than 1 GPU on to a workstation, and new supercomputer centers around the world are anticipating the shipment of Kepler.","Tegra this year was $360 million, and we expect it to grow at least 50%. We expect gross margins to exit FY '13 at around 52%. We expect our OpEx investments in FY '13 to be approximately $1.56 billion on a GAAP basis and $1.4 billion for non-GAAP. ","That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of JoAnne Feeney.","JoAnne Feeney - Longbow Research LLC","I just wish you could give us a little bit more clarity on the outlook, in particular which segments do you see driving the reduction quarter-over-quarter? And why are you expecting the decline in the gross margin? Is it purely volume or is it mix or some of both?","Jen-Hsun Huang","The top line decline for Q1 is expected to be due to the hard disk drive shortage continuing, as well as a shortage of 28-nanometer wafers. We're ramping our Kepler generation very hard, and we could use more wafers. The gross margin decline is contributed almost entirely to the yields of 28-nanometer being lower than expected. And that is, I guess, unsurprising at this point. And because we have -- we use wafer-based pricing now, when the yield is lower, our cost is higher. And so we've transitioned to a wafer-based pricing for some time. And our expectation, of course, is that the yields will improve as they have in the previous generation nodes, and as the yields improve, our output would increase and our costs will decline. And that's why we expect to exit the year at 52% or about.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Chris Caso with Susquehanna Financial.","Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","With regard to the Tegra business, and you gave some outlook for fiscal '13 in general, could you give us some indication as to how that looks as you go through the year? When do the Tegra 3 wins come up? And then perhaps talk about the impact of Windows on ARM and you talked about that having some potential impact later this year. If you could expand on that.","Jen-Hsun Huang","We're expecting to -- Tegra 3 -- as you know, Tegra 3 tablets are starting to ramp in the marketplace. But this quarter, we are expecting to announce and ship Tegra 3-based superphones. And they -- rumors of them are starting to -- and excitement about it is starting to leak, but at Mobile World Congress is when we expect to announce these devices. And we expect to announce and ship them this quarter. And so we're expecting Q1 to be a sharp uptick in Tegra sales and shipments. Our expectation is Windows 8 is later in the year. And Microsoft has given their estimates about Windows 8, and our expectation is that there will be meaningful contributions from Windows 8 later in the year, starting probably in Q3.","Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","All right. And just as a follow-up, with respect to kind of what you're seeing in the PC market and specifically, the impact of hard drives, maybe give a little more color that. Obviously, we've heard from some of your competitors on that and it sounded like that the hard drive availability is getting somewhat better depending on who you talk to. How do you see that playing out kind of over the next 2 quarters or so as it impacts your business?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, almost everybody has guided down. I think PC-centric semiconductor companies have guided down on average, I think about 8% Q1. And so I think everybody is expecting hard drive headwind to continue through Q1 and potentially through Q2. As far as what we see, Q4 started out with less shortage than we -- than people have predicted, and the reason for that was because there was a lot of channel inventory and people consumed the channel inventories. The channel inventory dried up. Prices of disk drives in the channels started to spike. And, as you know, channel business is a large part of the discrete GPU business. And China is particularly a large region for us, where a large amount of the PCs are built in channel, and they are built -- what we call DIY. And so design it yourself or build it yourself or design it for you. And so you spec the parts and you go to on IT mall and they build a PC right there for you. And so in those part of the regions where -- in countries, regions and countries where people build PCs like that, the spot price of disk drives have increased quite a bit. And so our sense is that that's going to continue through Q1 and potentially through Q2.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Sterne Agee.","Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I was just wondering on the F'13 guide, what is your guide for Tegra? And also, I mean, look at Tegra 3, what is the ASP -- what are the ballpark ASPs for Tegra 3 versus Tegra 2?","Jen-Hsun Huang","We're -- we did about $360 million this year in Tegra 2 sales. We're expecting at least 50% growth year-over-year. The vast majority of that will be based on Tegra 3. ASPs of Tegra 3 is higher than Tegra 2, and our expectation is that it would stay that way through the year.","Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Got it. And on the gross margin line, I think you guys mentioned 49% year, 49.5% year exiting at 52%. Where do you see the margin improvement coming? When do you see it coming?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Our margin drag is almost nearly entirely related to 28-nanometer. And so the margin improvement will come entirely from 28-nanometer. And TSMC is doing fabulously with 28, and this year, with 28 relative to 40, it's surely a huge improvement. But during transition years, because we have so much of our business tied to the leading edge nodes and because when we transition GPUs, we transition so much of it at once. And this year -- particularly unique this year is that the number of notebook design wins that we have and the number of 28-nanometer GPU design wins that we have is, at OEMs, is much, much higher than our previous generation. And so all of the transition of 28 is going to be very fast. And so we're just going to have to continue to work with TSMC and get the yields of 28-nanometer up as fast as possible. And we surely expect that by the end of the year, we're going to be in a pretty good place. We're in a pretty decent place now, but we just need to get the yields up.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Maybe along the lines of the 28-nanometer yield. Have you got categorized what the problem is and is there a fix in place? And also, I just -- if you got all the product you needed, do you know what kind of gross margins would have come in?","Jen-Hsun Huang","There's no particular problem. This is the first major quarter of 28-nanometer shipments. There have been some shipments. There've been some shipments in previous quarters but very, very small. And so for TSMC, this is probably the first large quarter of shipments, and we're going to continue to improve yields from here. So there's nothing particularly wrong. This is just early in the learning cycle of a new node. And so we'll improve it with every single outs [ph]. And also this isn't a problem that we can solve. Everybody's using the same 28-nanometer. And so this affects all of us, anybody who uses 28-nanometer. So I think with everybody ramping production, there's going to be a lot more learning cycles both from us and from other people. But TMSC is in a good place now and we just have to keep improving it.","Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And just as follow-up. Over on the professional services group, can you say what the trend towards mobile workstations is and how does that affect your revenues for 2013?","Jen-Hsun Huang","The Professional Solutions group has -- includes notebook workstations. And so whether it's HP workstations or mobile workstations or Dell mobile workstations or Fujitsu mobile workstations, Lenovo mobile workstations, Quadro is a standard in all of those workstations. So we're delighted when people go mobile because oftentimes they have a mobile workstation as well as a desktop workstation. And so this is a good trend.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis with Caris & Company.","Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","There were a couple of mentions of notebook share gain. Can you give us a better understanding of how broadly those might exist across different OEMs? And when would we expect to see those more, mid-year or more towards the holiday selling season?","Jen-Hsun Huang","In the Ivy Bridge generation, also lined up with the 28-nanometer GPU generation, and this is really toe-to-toe competition between the best GPUs in the marketplace. And our Kepler generation, which we hope to tell you more about soon, won design wins at virtually every single PC OEM in the world. And so this is probably the best GPU we've ever built, and the performance and power efficiency is surely the best that we've ever created. And as a result, our notebook penetration -- our notebook design win this year is expected to be very, very high.","Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","And so you're saying that we should expect to see those right away as Ivy Bridge comes out. As a follow-up, on the mobile side of the business, with Tegra, you've mentioned a 50% growth for this year. How would the notebook side -- or the smartphone, superphone side of that business compare to the tablet side of the business? Are they both growing about equally or one significantly more than the other?","Jen-Hsun Huang","My guess is that this -- and of course, this is just an estimate and just a guess at this at this point, but my guess is that we'll ship more in phones this year as we did last year in terms of units. And in terms of ASPs, it'll probably be close.","Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then lastly from me, and this one might be more for Karen. When the target model was initially established, I think the gross margin was 52%. It looks like it will -- from the guidance that's been provided on where we start the year, it's going to come in, I think, closer to 50.5%. So what's changed since September? I doubt there's been much of a change in terms of the plan for 28-nanometer, but is it just volume? Or what's the delta as we look where the gross margin target was and where it is now?","Karen Burns","It's yield. It's yields on 28-nanometer that have come in worse than we originally anticipated.","Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","And the yield improvement, do you think that is kind of steady through the year, or is that back-end loaded more in the back half of the fiscal year?","Jen-Hsun Huang","It will be stemmed through the year. And this -- yield improvement is a function of the number of cycles of learning. And now the cycles of learnings as we -- as we've ramped up at TSMC, the cycle of the learning has really gone up. And so my expectation is that the yield improvement will steadily improve through the year.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James.","Brian C. Peterson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","This is Brian Peterson stepping in for Hans. I just wanted to follow-up on this 28-nanometer issue. Just to be clear, this is specific to 28-nanometers for GPUs for NVIDIA? Or is this across the industry for TSMC?","Jen-Hsun Huang","I think this is -- I guess, the rest of the industry will have to speak for themselves. Well, my guess is that this is across the industry. This 28-nanometer is still early and it's maturing. There aren't that many 28-nanometer products in the marketplace as of now, and the number of cycles of learning is not very significant and the amount of volume is surely not very significant. At this point, we've -- we're ramping very hard all of our 28-nanometer products. And the yield is much better than 40-nanometer when it first came up, but it's not as good as we had expected in our previous projections. And so we're going to have to work hard with TSMC and support them and encourage them and wish them well and to get the 28-nanometer yield up as fast as possible.","Brian C. Peterson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And just a follow-up. You indicated that you expected tax rates to remain stable going forward. How do they trend in the January quarter?","Karen Burns","We gave that guidance at 20% for Q1, if that's what you're asking.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shawn Webster with Macquarie.","Deepon Nag - Macquarie Research","This is Deepon for Shawn. I had a question about pricing going into this quarter and then maybe into the next if you tie with desktops, notebook GPU in particular.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Pricing is expected to be stable and healthy this year. The amount of 28-nanometer capacity in the world is not enough. And so I think we're expecting 28-nanometer to be constrained through the entire year. New generations of smartphones, new generations of GPUs are going to drive the demand for 28-nanometer capacity -- or drive the demand for 28-nanometer devices. And so I think you're going to find that this year is going to continue to be tight. We could use more 28-nanometer wafers, and TSMC's management team is working very hard on [indiscernible] us with our demand and they're driving cycle times hard and trying to improve yield. And so all of that is going to improve throughout the year and very steadily throughout the year. And if previous generations have been an indication, TSMC will improve their performance incredibly fast.","Deepon Nag - Macquarie Research","And also, if you talk about channel inventories going into this quarter. Do you think this a lot of buildup maybe at the low end because of the HD [ph] issue and maybe about channel inventory in Tegra as well?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Channel inventory is actually okay, and there's no -- the channel is being very cautious in loading up, as you can imagine. And whether it's because of currency volatility in Europe or because of shortage of disk drives, nobody in the channel is being too heroic with respect to loading up inventory. So I think you're going to find that channel inventory is relatively lean across the board. And on the high ends, extremely short.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","With respect to the attach rates. I think you talked about that being driven lower by the hard drive shortages, so the upward price in hard drives being compensated by finding bill [ph] materials share someplace else. Can you talk about, as the hard drive shortage mitigates and those prices come back down, whether you expect the attach rate to go back up?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, the attach rate of GPUs is driven not by anything but consumer demand. And I think that there are fewer PCs sold in Q4 than there was -- that we -- that the industry had expected. The attach rate of those PCs that were sold were stable and relatively consistent with our model. And so your premise is -- it's -- I don't think it's correct. And attach rates seems to be stable. The number of PCs sold has reduced. Some people think it's cannibalization from smartphone and tablets and other devices, but disk drive has surely played a role in that as well. And so when the disk drive supply resumes, my sense is that consumers' demand will return to what they were and GPU attach will remain stable.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Understand. And then as a follow-up. In terms of the OpEx, I think the $1.56 billion you guided to for the year implies a little bit of an uptick as we move throughout the year. Can you talk about where the incremental spending is being allocated towards?","Karen Burns","Just one clarification. That's on a GAAP basis, the $1.56 billion. It's $1.4 billion on a non-GAAP.","Jen-Hsun Huang","It's unchanged from our previous guidance. And what we've told you guys before, the increase in investment relative to last year on an absolute basis has to do with the fact that we're investing a lot more in mobile devices. This last year was a big year for us. It was a big year because GPUs grew quite significantly despite the shortage of disk drives and softness in the market towards the end of the year. But it was a particularly big year for us because this was the first year that we really engaged the mobile market and our mobile position really became established. At this time this last year, no one thought that we would really be as successful in the mobile market as we ended up being. And so I think that today, we have now 3 generations of Android operating systems and devices behind us. We have tens and tens of smartphones and tens of tablets. We have engagements with nearly every single Tier 1 OEM in the world on the mobile side, as well as on the computing side. And so I think that this was a pretty big year from that perspective. And because of that traction and because of that -- the success we've seen, we think it's really -- it makes sense for us to double down on mobile computing and go after it in a big way. And so we're going to have a lot more products this year than last, and you're going to see that we're going to have tablet devices, as well as tablet processors, as well as integrated processors with modems. And so this is an aggressive investment surely but it's a very big, big market opportunity, as you know.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Gauna with JMP Securities.","Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","I was wondering within the 50% growth you're expecting for Tegra, are you factoring in contribution from Windows 8, or -- and if so, how big a contribution might that be?","Jen-Hsun Huang","We are expecting at least 50% growth, and we are expecting Windows 8 contribution but not nearly the vast majority of it.","Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","And then I was wondering, if you're going to be seeing Tegra 3 ramping in your July quarter, is the early ramp going to be enough to, perhaps, help the gross margin line given that it's not going to be, if I'm understanding correctly, on the 28-nanometer node?","Jen-Hsun Huang","We are going to be ramping Tegra 3 -- we're ramping Tegra 3 now. And so this quarter, Tegra 3 will make a large contribution. We're expecting Tegra to be up quarter-to-quarter about 50% as well. And so Tegra 3 is ramping significantly even into the April quarter. And you're right that the gross margins for Tegra 3 is better than our 28-nanometer gross margins in the first quarter. And hopefully, 28-nanometer yields will improve and by second or third quarter time frame, it won't make any difference.","Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","Okay. And last one if I could on the GPU business, excluding the professionals set, you gave a mix of expecting a down PC market because of the hard disk drive constraints but market share gains. Any ballparking on the net of that? Do you expect on a revenue basis, the year to be down, flat, up? Can you say at this juncture?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Our expectation is that on the net, our discrete GPU business will be up. And in Q3 time frame, we were expecting, using industry analyst models of PC industry growth of 4% to 5%. I think the -- our estimates now are much lower than that and so we assume something lower than that. And so we'll see how it turns out in the final analysis, but we're assuming relatively no growth in the overall PC market. But because we\u2019re gaining share, because of continue to grow our professionals business, our discrete GPU business year-over-year will grow.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Wang with Evercore.","Patrick Wang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Jen-Hsun, can you talk a little bit about the competitive dynamics you see as you go in and compete for Tegra 3 wins? I mean, we're hearing about a lot of competition on pricing and a lot of a guerrilla tactics out there. Can you talk about what you're seeing?","Jen-Hsun Huang","We haven't met too many gorillas yet, but elephants maybe. Let's see, we compete primarily today with Qualcomm. And the reason for that is because -- there are 3 major opportunities in the smartphone marketplace this year that are really exciting. In the United States, of course, LTE is very important. Outside of United -- and they have a very -- they have the only real integrated solution today and, in fact, they have the only shipping solution today. And so they have a very good position on LTE in the United States. Outside of United States, where LTE adoption is much further behind, the next major upgrade is quad-core. Today's dual-core phones needs to be upgraded. And so the next major upgrade, the next major superphone, the next major big thing is quad-core. And so Tegra 3 is incredibly well positioned there. So outside the United States, in Europe particularly, in China, you're going to see quad-core Tegra 3 phones coming on throughout the year.  ","The third growth opportunity is the 999 or what some people call 1000RMB phone. And this is an affordable, very affordable smartphone with dual-core capability and the way that they describe it, the way the marketplace internalized it is it's a phone that has the capability of an iPhone 4 but is extremely affordable. That's a great opportunity for us because Tegra 2 is a fabulous dual core and with a 3G modem, you could achieve RMB 1,000 in China in the near future. And so that's a pretty exciting opportunity for us, and we're just about to enter into that market opportunity. And so those are kind of the market opportunities and the competitive dynamics. It's really primarily the 2 of us. I think the highest level -- the reason for that has to do with the fact that in order to be successful in the leading edge in the Tier 1 phones, you need to have a great application processor and a great application processor road map. You need to have a world-class software stack because the software part of these phones has become the most complicated part. And the third, going forward, is the ability to integrate a modem. And we were fortunate to have purchased Icera last year and our integrated road map is going to be pretty exciting.","Patrick Wang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Got you. That's helpful. So it sounds like your quad-core features are compelling enough that pricing is -- you're able to maintain kind of strict pricing with your customers.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yes, we're able to get fair pricing on our Tegra 3.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Jen-Hsun, I wanted to address this competitive issue from a different angle, which is from the handset vendor side. So increasingly, Apple and Samsung are taking more share in the market versus say, HTC, Motorola and others. So even though Tegra 3 could be a great product, how are new ensuring that you're engaging with the right set of customers? And what real underlying drivers are going into this expectation of 50% growth for this year?","Jen-Hsun Huang","We're expecting to grow at least 50% this year, and it comes from 3 different -- maybe 4 different sources, if I can break it down. One is Tegra 3 phones. One is Tegra 2 phones for the 1000RMB market, which is the fastest-growing segment in smartphones today. The third is Android tablets. And as you know, we finally were able to put together a tablet that is both exciting, as well -- tablet architecture that's both exciting with Tegra 3 and Ice Cream Sandwich, as well as affordable. We've been able to reach the $249 price level for retail. And the fourth is Windows 8 on ARM. And so these 4 growth drivers, frankly, this last year, what really -- the only thing that really worked super-well for us, in even on Tegra 2, was smartphones, and that contributed to $360 million in revenues. And so this year, we're expecting smartphones from Tegra 3, from Tegra 2, from Tegra 3 Ice Cream Sandwich tablets and as well as Tegra 3 Windows on ARM tablets. And so there's a lot more opportunities for us. But you're right that Samsung and Apple are very, very strong. And so our strategy is actually very simple. By teaming up with the best partners in the world, we would like to bring great technology to them and partner with them to build exquisite devices. And also to move faster. I mean, we, as an industry, have to move a lot faster in bringing competitive solutions to the marketplace more rapidly. And so by partnering with HTC -- and they are a fantastic company. I'm not suggesting we announce any products here, but surely, a partner like HTC would be fabulous for NVIDIA to partner with.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And if I could just perhaps push back on some of those drivers. So for instance, the 1000RMB market. There, we have seen integration with base land and connectivity being an attractive feature. So how do you address that? And then on Android tablets, you have some things are getting better but outside of the Kindle Fire, we have not seen sales pick up as much, or perhaps that's just my perception of the market. So if you could address those 2 issues also.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, the 1000RMB market has a lot of segments underneath that. And at RMB 1,000, you really need to have a world-class phone. And right now there just isn't a very good solution for a world-class, high-performance dual-core processor with integrated 3G modem. And surely, there's RMB 500 phones and they have low-end integrated solutions with 3G. But nothing sufficiently good at the RMB 1,000 to be able to claim that it's as good as an iPhone 4 but at a much affordable price. And so that segment, where you need to have a world-class high-performance dual-core processor like Tegra 2 and a great software stack, along with 3G modems are, as you know, quite affordable and quite abundant and they've been around for many years. Integrating those together on a bill [ph] material is not too difficult. And so that's one. ","With respect to the tablets, Amazon Fire is a really interesting product and it's great e-reader. But our belief is that there's a marketplace for tablets that are much more general-purpose. I think the ASUS Transformer Prime is a first example of a tablet that can really demonstrate differentiation, and people love it, and it's, frankly, my favorite computer now and it's a lot of other people's favorite computers. It is a tablet sometimes, it's a full Notebook PC sometimes and the performance is really terrific. And so I think Ice Cream Sandwich addressed a lot of the challenges that the tablet industry had, Android had last year with fragmentation. But now with Ice Cream Sandwich, your phone is Ice Cream Sandwich, your tablet is Ice Cream Sandwich, all the applications that come off at the marketplace can work on both. And so I think that unification, it is the only operating system that allows that today. And so that's -- that, I think, is a great advance for the tablet market. And then lastly, at $249, if we can bring a quad-core -- if we can bring Tegra 3 to $249, and for those people who have seen and touched it, that tablet's going -- it's going to sell like hot cakes, we believe. Because it's the right price point, it's completely general-purpose and it's state-of-the-art. So we have reasons to believe that this tablet market is far from over, and there's a lot of interesting opportunities and differentiation to be brought to this market yet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glen Yeung with Citi.","Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Two questions. The first one is maybe just some clarification from you, Jen-Hsun. I think I'm hearing that GPU demand is being impacted by a combination of lower PC demand from hard drive shortages, hard drive ASPs squeezing out GPUs for the bill of materials and then a shortage of capacity from 28-nanometer. Can you just give us a sense -- maybe rank those in terms of what's most impactful to sales and diverse lease [ph]?","Jen-Hsun Huang","28-nanometer shortage. I could use more 28-nanometer wafers today.","Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So that's the most impactful?","Jen-Hsun Huang","My estimate for the year for top line and gross margins would be 28-nanometer. That's where all of our new GPUs are going.","Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Well, I'm asking just specifically for first quarter, for the April quarter, though, where you think the impact is greater. From that shortage, from ASPs and hard drives or from shortages of PCs because of hard drives?","Jen-Hsun Huang","About the same. I mean, it's -- I haven't thought of it that way but it's about the same. But from a gross margin perspective, obviously, much more from 28-nanometer. Those are problems that are going to get solved for the whole industry. I think as the industry -- as TSMC ramps more and more 28-nanometers, their capacity would increase and their yields would increase and their cycle times will reduce. And this is a world-class company. And Morris and the management team are all over it, and they're doing everything in their power, and if history is any indication and it tends to be, they're going to work their way into a fabulous node here any time. And so we have just started ramping in the last several months. And so the Q1 is kind of a bit of a transition quarter for us. But I'm very confident that we'll work through the 28-nanometer yield issues.","Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And as a follow up, I hear you when you say at least 50% growth in Tegra. But your guidance there is nonetheless substantially lower than what your original guidance was. Can you just kind of walk through the delta here? Is it that you're pushing forward your expectation? Or do you think there's some lost business that you simply can't gain back?","Jen-Hsun Huang","There is one major delta. I'm glad you asked. There's one major delta from last - from our previous guidance. About, I would say, a couple of quarters ago, I would have thought that on balance, that Samsung was one of our largest customers as they were last year. But looking forward, my sense is on balance, Samsung will use their own application processors. They'll dabble outside probably and they'll use outside application processors like ours whenever their own can't serve their needs. But on balance, they're going to try to use their own. And so that's the big delta that I've taken off of my guidance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Berger with FBR Capital Markets.","Craig Berger - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Jen-Hsun, so with the hard drive impacting GPU shipments now, what do you think revenues would be in the first quarter if there were no shortages? And do you expect that to come back as good news and met pent-up demand later this year?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Gosh, we just didn't really do that analysis. But if you think along the lines of where we currently guided versus a typical Q1 -- and some of that, we call it -- we're $100 million-plus short and call some of that -- some of that resulted from 28-nanometer yield and shortage, and some of that resulting from disk drives shortage. And call it half-and-half. So if you were just to take a swag at it, about $50 million.","Craig Berger - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then just as a follow-up, can you update us on the CFO search? And can you also update us on Icera? You talked about it briefly with the roadmap. When might we expect an integrated product and also, do you expect to ship base bands in the phones in calendar '12?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Sure. We are doing a CFO search. We have many interesting candidates. I haven't decided on one yet and the reason for that is because I think Karen and the financial team are doing a fabulous job and I have a very -- it allows me to be very choosy and to set a very, very high bar. And so if you do know of someone, ask them to call me, but we have a lot of very interesting candidates. Icera. Icera is going to prove to be one of the smartest and one of the best acquisitions in our history. We are -- we will have shipping modems this year for sure. And hopefully sooner than later. And then our plan is to integrate our application processor, which, as you know, is already one of best in the world, and the Icera modem into an integrated product for the mainstream LTE market. And so we're doing that as quickly as can. And that's one of the reasons why we're investing heavily in OpEx is so that we could build this class of products for a much larger marketplace and a much larger market opportunity for us.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Raji Gill with Needham & Company.","Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Sorry if I missed it, but did you actually provide a revised annual guidance in terms of the number, in actual number range?","Jen-Hsun Huang","We did provide new guidance. We did not give you a specific number. And the reason for that is because it ultimately depends on your estimates of the PC market and the disk drive -- how long the disk drive shortages is going to the last. We're not better predictors at that than other analysts, and we've taken it to a more conservative range ourselves. But if you applied that, your estimates of that, to some of the comments that Karen made earlier, you can come up with some estimates. Okay? Thank you.","Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","I guess, last question, real quick. In terms of the percentage of your GPU portfolio that's on kind of 28-nanometer, any guesstimation there? And then kind of what are the projections to go -- going forward?","Jen-Hsun Huang","It depends on the capacity that gets freed up. We would like to put as much of it as possible to 28-nanometer. But if we don't have enough capacity as we currently do not have, we would keep some of our GPUs in 40-nanometer. So it just depends on capacity.","Operator","Your next question, your final question comes from the line of Raj Seth with Cowen & Company.","Simran Brar","This is Simran Brar calling in for Raj Seth. I have a couple of quick ones. Firstly, given that your Tegra business has some scale now, how are you thinking about margins in that business going forward? And secondly, what are the key growth opportunities for your professional services -- workstation business in 2012? And is 10% to 15% sort of still the right range to think about annual growth for that business?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Thank you, Simran. Let's see. The first question with respect to Tegra. We expect our gross margins to be in the range of the corporate average. And our estimates are that it would be around that area, plus or minus, okay? Nothing dramatically different. Second is growth opportunities for PSG. In the area of workstations, we introduced a concept called Maximus -- not a concept, a platform technology called Maximus. And it allows for the workstation to not only visualize but it also allows it to compute. So you could do simultaneous simulation of fluid dynamics while seeing the fluid flow over a structure like a car or motorcycle or whatever in real time. And so Maximus has been received fantastically, and our hope is that more and more workstations will have not just 1 GPU inside for visualization but 2 GPUs, 1 for visualization and 1 for simulation. Next year -- this year is also the year of Kepler. It's been 2.5 years since firming and supercomputers and supercomputing centers around the world are waiting anxiously for Kepler to launch so that they can upgrade their supercomputers. So that's a growth opportunity for us. In the area of high performance computing as well, we're hoping that the work that we've done to make Tesla much easier to program for -- it's called OpenACC. It's a technique called directives, making it super easy for software programmers to take advantage of GPU computing and we've worked with industry on that. It's an open standard. So we're excited about the developments of that. The response has been fabulous. And hopefully that making GPUs easier to program will also increase its adoption. And so those are some of the growth initiatives that we have going in. And our expectation is that Quadro and Tesla in combination would PSG, will deliver a record year again this year.","Rob Csongor","Okay. Thank you, Simran. I think we're out of time for today.

Kress - NVIDIA Corp.","Thanks, Arnab. We had a stellar Q4 and fiscal 2017 with records in all of our financial metrics; revenue, gross margin, operating margins and EPS. Growth was driven primarily by Datacenter tripling with a rapid adoption of AI worldwide. Quarterly revenue reached $2.17 billion, up 55% from a year earlier, and up 8% sequentially, and above our outlook of $2.1 billion. Fiscal 2017 revenue was just over $6.9 billion, up 38% and nearly $2 billion more than fiscal 2016. Growth for the quarter and fiscal year was broad based with record revenue in each of our four platforms, Gaming, Professional Visualization, Datacenter and Automotive. Our full year performance demonstrates the success of our GPU platform-based business model. From a reporting segment perspective, Q4 GPU revenue grew 57% to $1.85 billion from a year earlier. Tegra Processor revenue was up 64% to $257 million.","Let's start with our Gaming platform. Q4 Gaming revenue was a record $1.35 billion, rising 66% year-on-year and up 8% from Q3. Gamers continued to upgrade to our new Pascal-based GPUs. Adding to our gaming lineup we launched GTX 1050 class GPUs for notebooks, bringing eSports and VR capabilities to mobile at great value. The GTX 1050 and 1050 Ti were featured in more than 30 new models launched at last month's Consumer Electronics Show.","To enhance the gaming experience, we announced G-SYNC HDR, a technology that enables displays which are brighter and more vibrant than any other gaming monitor. Our partners have launched more than 60 G-SYNC-capable monitors and laptops, enabling smooth play without screen tear artifact. eSports too continues to attract new gamers. Major tournaments with multi-million dollar purses are drawing enormous audiences. This last quarter, Dota 2 held its first major tournament of the season in Boston. Tickets sold out in minutes. The prize pool reached $3 million, and millions of gamers watched online.","Moving to Professional Visualization, Quadro revenue grew 11% from a year ago to a record $225 million, driven by demand for high-end, real-time rendering and mobile workstations. We recently launched a family of Pascal-based GPUs designed for mobile workstations which leading OEMs are embracing. Earlier this week, we introduced Quadro GP100, which creates a new supercomputing workstation. This new type of workstation enables engineers, designers and artists to take advantage of new technologies of photorealism, fluid simulation and deep learning.","Next, Datacenter; revenue more than tripled from a year ago, and was up 23% sequentially to $296 million. Growth was driven by AI, cloud service providers deploying GPU instances, High Performance Computing, GRID graphics virtualization, and our DGX AI supercomputing appliance. AI is transforming industries worldwide. The first adopters were hyperscale companies like Microsoft, Facebook and Google, which use deep learning to provide billions to customers with AI services that utilizes image recognition and voice processing. The next area of growth will occur as enterprise in such fields as health care, retail, transportation and finance embrace deep learning on GPUs.","At November's SC 2016 Supercomputing Conference, Microsoft announced that its GPU-accelerated Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit is available both in Azure cloud and on premises with our DGX-1 AI supercomputer. In a series of related announcements at SG 2016, we described our plans to join the Cancer Moonshot project in conjunction with the National Cancer Institute, the U.S. Department of Energy and several national labs, to help build predictive models and guide treatment under this project. We are collaborating on a new AI framework called, CANDLE, the Cancer Distributed Learning Environment. And to support this work, we unveiled our new own supercomputer, the NVIDIA DGX SATURNV, which joins together 124 DGX-1 systems. It's currently the world's 28th fastest supercomputer, and the number one system in energy efficiency.","Our GRID, graphics, virtualization business doubled year-on-year, driven by strong growth in the education, automotive, and energy sectors. We are excited to be hosting our eighth annual GPU Technology Conference here in Silicon Valley from May 8 to May 11. This will be the year's most important event for AI and accelerated computing. And we expect it to be our largest GTC yet, attended by thousands of application developers, scientists and academics, as well as entrepreneurs and corporate executives.","Finally, in Automotive, revenue grew to a record $128 million, up 38% year-over-year. At Jen-Hsun's CES opening keynote, we demonstrated our leadership position in self-driving vehicles. With a growing list of industry players adopting our AI car platform, we also showcased AI co-pilot, a technology that will recognize a driver and their preferences, monitor their alertness, understand natural spoken language, and provide alerts in dangerous situations. One of the highlights at CES was the demonstration of our own autonomous car, dubbed BB8. More than 500 passengers took rides in the back seat without a driver behind the wheel.","We announced a number of new partnerships at the show. Among them were collaborations with Bosch, the world's largest automotive supplier and ZF, Europe's leading supplier for the truck industry, both centered on developing AI car computers with DRIVE PX 2 technology. We also announced that we're working on cloud-to-car mapping collaboration with HERE, focused on the U.S. and Europe, and ZENRIN, focused on Japan. These complement partnerships announced in Q3 with Europe's TomTom and China's Baidu. Our mapping partnerships spanned all geographies.","Jen-Hsun was joined on the CES stage by Audi of America's President, Scott Keogh. They announced the extension of our decade-long partnership to deliver cars with Level 4 autonomy starting in 2020, powered by DRIVE PX technology. Audi will deliver Level 3 autonomy in its A8 luxury sedan later this year through its zFAS system powered by NVIDIA. We also shared news at CES of our partnership with Mercedes-Benz to collaborate on a car that will be available by year's end. During the quarter, Tesla began delivering a new autopilot system powered by the NVIDIA DRIVE PX 2 platform in every new Model S and Model X, to be followed by the Model 3.","Tesla's cars will be capable of fully autonomous operation via future software updates. In addition, Volvo started turning over the keys to initial customers of its Drive Me program. Its XC90 SUVs equipped with DRIVE PX 2 are capable of fully autonomous operation on designated roads in Volvo's hometown of Gothenburg, Sweden. With NVIDIAs powering the market's only self-driving cars and partnerships with leading automakers, Tier 1 suppliers, and mapping companies, we feel very confident in our position as the transportation industry moves to autonomous vehicles.","Next, our OEM and IP business was $176 million, down 11% year-on-year.","Now, turning to the rest of the income statement for Q4. Gross margins were at record levels with GAAP gross margins at 60%, and non-GAAP at 60.2%. These reflect the success of our platform approach, as well as strong demand for GeForce gaming GPUs and deep learning. GAAP operating expenses were $570 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $498 million, up 12% from a year earlier, reflecting head count-related costs for our AI growth initiatives, as well as investments in sales and marketing. We are investing into huge market opportunities, AI, self-driving cars, cloud computing and gaming. Thus, we expect our operating expense growth rate to be in the high teens over the next several quarters.","GAAP operating income was $733 million, and non-GAAP operating income was $809 million, both more than doubled from a year earlier. Our GAAP tax rate was 10%, and our non-GAAP was 13%. These rates were lower than expected, primarily due to a decrease in the amount of earnings subject to U.S. tax. GAAP EPS was $0.99. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.13.","In fiscal year 2017, we returned $1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, in line with our intention. For fiscal year 2018, we intend to return $1.25 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","Now, turning to the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. We expect revenue to be $1.9 billion, plus or minus 2%. At the mid-point, this represents 46% growth over the prior year. We expect Datacenter to grow sequentially. Our GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 59.5% and 59.7%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. This guidance assumes that our licensing agreement with Intel ends at March and does not renew. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $603 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $520 million.","GAAP OI&E is expected to be an expense of approximately $20 million, including additional charges from the early conversions of convertible notes. Non-GAAP OI&E is expected to be an expense of approximately $4 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 are both expected to be 17%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items.","With that, I'm going to turn it back for the operator so we can open up for questions. Please limit your questions to just one. Operator, let's start with the questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Your first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore. C.J., your line is open.","C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC","Can you hear me? Yeah, my apologies. Stuck on a plane here. Great, great, great results. I guess, was hoping to get a little more color on the Datacenter side. Now, that we've completed a full fiscal year 2017, would love to get some clarity on the different moving parts and contributions there. And then I guess, looking into 2018 how you see the growth unfolding thereafter? Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","Yeah, C.J. first of all, thanks a lot. Well, the single biggest mover would have to be Datacenter. I mean, when you look back on last year and we look forward, there's a lot of reasons why Datacenter business overall grew 3x, grew by a factor of three. And so I would expect that to happen, to continue. There's several elements of our Datacenter business. There's the high performance computing part. There's the AI part. There's GRID, which is graphics virtualization. There's cloud computing, which is providing our GPU platform up in the cloud for startups and enterprises and all kinds of external customers to be able to access in the cloud, as well as a brand new AI supercomputing appliance that we created last year for anybody who would like to engage deep learning and AI, but don't have the skills or don't have the resources or don't have the desire to build their own high performance computing cluster.","And so we integrated all of that with all of the complicated software stacks into an appliance that we maintain over the cloud. We call that DGX-1. And so these pieces, AI, high performance computing, cloud computing, GRID and DGX all in contribution, contributed to our growth in Datacenter quite substantially. And so my sense is that, that as we look forward to next year, we're going to continue to see that major trend.","Of course, gaming was a very large and important factor. And my expectation is that gaming is going to continue to do that. And then longer-term, longer-term our position in self-driving cars, I think, is becoming more and more clear to people over time. And I expect that self-driving cars will be available on the road starting this year with early movers, and no later than 2020 for Level 4 by the majors, and you might even see some of them pull into 2019. And so those are some of the things that we're looking forward to.","Operator","Your next question is from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. I actually had one question for Jen-Hsun, and one sort of clarification for Colette. So Jen-Hsun, where are we in the gaming cycle? It's been very strong the last few years. What proportion of your base do you think has upgraded to Pascal, and where does that usually peak before you launch your next-generation products? And then for Colette, just inventory dollars in days picked up. If you could give us some comment on that. And then just on OpEx productivity, you did a very good job last year, but this time you're saying OpEx will go up mid-teen. Do you still think there is operating leverage in the model? Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","Well, let's say we typically assume that we have an installed base of a couple of 100 million GeForce gamers, and we've upgraded about two quarters of them, as in two operating quarters out of four years. It takes about three to four years to upgrade the entire installed base. And we started ramping Pascal, as you know, a few quarters ago. And our data would suggest that the upgrade cycle is going well, and we have plenty to go.","Colette M. Kress - NVIDIA Corp.","Thanks, Vivek. On your question on inventory, as you know, in many of our businesses, we are still carrying a significant architecture, and a broad list of different products for those architectures across. We feel comfortable with our level of inventory as we look forward into fiscal year 2018 and our sales going forward. Your second question was regarding OpEx and comparing it to where we finished in 2017 and moving into fiscal year 2018. We do have some great opportunities, large businesses, for us to go capture the overall TAMs for, and we are going to be continuing to invest in the Datacenter, specifically in AI, self-driving cars, as well as gaming. And so rather than a focus on what the specific operating margin is, we're going to focus primarily just on growing the overall TAM, and capturing that TAM on the top line.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis from Jefferies.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","Thanks for taking my question. Question back on the Datacenter, the growth was impressive. And I'm wondering, you mentioned that the hyperscale players really have embraced the products first, and I'm wondering if you could share with us to the extent that you think that they're embracing it for their own use, or to the extent that they're deploying it for services such as machine learning as a service and enterprises, are really kind of tapping into this also through the hyperscale guys. And I'm wondering, if you could help, you mentioned that the enterprise is where you expect to see embracing the technology next and healthcare, retail, transport, finance, and I'm wondering if you could share with us how you feel about that visibility, where you're getting that visibility from. Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","Well, on hyperscale, you're absolutely right, that there's internal, what we call, internal use for deep learning, and then there's the hosting GPU in the cloud for external high-performance computing use, which includes deep learning. Inside the hyperscalers, the early adopters are moving obviously very, very fast. But everybody has to follow. Everybody has to follow. Deep learning has proven to be too effective, and you guys, everybody knows now that every hyperscaler in the world is investing very heavily in deep learning. And so my expectation is that, over the next coming years, deep learning and AI will become the essential tool by which they do their computing.","Now, when they host it in the cloud, people out in the cloud use it for a variety of applications, and one of the reasons why the NVIDIA GPU is such a great platform is because of its broad utility. We've been working on GPU computing now for coming up on 12 years, and industry-after-industry, our GPU computing architecture has been embraced for high-performance computing, for data processing, for deep learning and such. And so when somebody hosts it up in the cloud, for example, Amazon putting our GPUs up in the cloud, that instance has the ability to do molecular dynamics, to deep learning training, to deep learning inferencing. Companies could use it for offloading their computation to start-ups being able to build their company and build their application, and then host it for hundreds of millions of people to use.","And so I think the hyperscalers are going to continue to adopt GPU both for internal consumption, and cloud hosting for some time to come. And we're just in the beginning of that cycle, and that's one of the reasons why we have quite a fair amount of enthusiasm around the growth here. You mentioned Enterprise, and enterprise, it has all woken to the power of AI, and everybody understands that they have a treasure trove of data that they would like to find a way to discover insight from. In the case of real applications that we're engaging now, you could just imagine that in the transportation industry, car companies creating self-driving cars, one car company after another needs to take all of their row data and start to train their neural networks for their future self-driving cars. And so they use our DGX or Tesla GPUs to train the networks, which is then used to run their cars running on DRIVE PX.","So that's one application example. Another application example, which is quite significant, is going to be the future of processing all of the HD maps in the world. You guys might have seen that, we announced that GTC, this API SDK called MapWorks. MapWorks takes video information, video information that is recorded from a car, and reconstructs the three-dimensional terrain information from that live video. And so it has to do computer vision, 3D reconstruction. It has to determine and detect where the lanes are, the signs are, the lights are, and even some interesting 3D features, maybe buildings and curbs and such. And it will do that automatically. And we need to process that for the world, for the planet.","And you can just imagine how much video is being recorded today, and how much data is being generated, and how much inferencing, computer vision and 3D reconstruction that has to be done, and our GPUs are really quite perfect for it. And so MapWorks runs on top of our GPUs, and we're working with just about every mapping company in the world today to adopt MapWorks, and to do HD processing for their maps. So that's another example. Medical imaging companies all over the world have recognized the importance of deep learning, and their ability to detect cancer and retinopathy, and the list of examples goes on and on. And so all the different modalities have now recognized the importance of deep learning, and you're going to start to see one medical imaging company after another. The list of examples just keep on going. I mean, the fact of the matter is, at this point deep learning and AI has really become how future software development is going to be done for a large number of industries. And that's the enthusiasm that we're seeing around the world.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik with Citigroup.","Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking my question, and congratulations to the team on great results and guide. My first question is for Jen-Hsun. Jen-Hsun, on the adoption of VR for gaming, if I look at the price points of the headset and the PC, a little bit high for a wider adoption. Could the use of GPU in the cloud, like you guys are introducing the GeForce NOW, be a way for the price points on VR to come down? And then I have a follow up for Colette.","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","The first year of VR has sold several hundred thousand units, and many hundreds of thousands of units. And our VR works, SDK, which allows us to process graphics in very low latency, dealing with all of the computer vision processing, whether it's lens warping and such, it has delivered really excellent results. The early VR is really targeted at early adopters. And I think the focus of ensuring an excellent experience that surprises people, that delight people, by Oculus and by Valve and by Epic and by Vive, by ourselves, by the industry, has really been a good focus. And I think that we've delivered on the promise of a great experience.","The thing that we have to do now is that we have to make the headsets easier-to-use, with fewer cables. We have to make it lighter, we have to make it cheaper. And so those are all things that the industry is working on, and as the applications continue to come online, you're going to see that they're going to meet themselves and find success. I think the experience is very, very clear that VR is exciting. However, remember that we are also in the VR \u2013 we also brought VR to computer-aided design and to professional applications. In this particular area, the cost is just simply not an issue. And in fact, many of the applications previously were power walls or caves, VR caves that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. And now you could put that same experience, if not even better, on the desk of designers and creators.","And so I think that you're going to find that creative use and professional use of VR is going to grow quite rapidly. And just recently, we announced a brand new Quadro 5000, P5000 with VR, the world's first VR notebook that went to market with HP and Dell. And they're doing terrifically. And so I would think about VR in the context of both professional applications as well as consumer applications, but I think the first year was absolutely a great success.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura.","Romit Shah - Instinet, LLC","Yes. Thank you, and first of all, congratulations on a strong fiscal 2017. If I may, Jen-Hsun, the revenue beat this quarter wasn't as big as we've seen the last several periods, and most of it came from Datacenter. I totally understand that when the Gaming business expands as much as it has, it becomes harder to beat expectations by the same margin. But I was wondering if you could just spend some time talking about gaming demand, and how you think it was during the holiday season.","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","Well, the global PC gaming market is still vibrant and growing. And the number of eSports gamers around the world is growing. You guys know that Overwatch is a home run. Activision Blizzard's Overwatch is raging all over Asia and eSports fans all over the world are picking it up, and it's graphically very intensive. Without a 1050 class and above, it's simply a non-starter and to really enjoy it, you need at least a 1060. And so this last quarter we launched a 1050 and a 1050 Ti all over the world, and we're seeing terrific success out of that. And my expectation going into next year is that Overwatch is going to continue to spread all over the world. It's really basically just started. It started in the West and it's now moving into the East where the largest eSports markets are.","And so Overwatch is going to be a huge success. League of Legends is going to continue to be a huge success. And my expectation is that the eSports along with AAA titles that are coming out this year is going to keep PC gaming continue to grow. And so I quite frankly thought Q4 was pretty terrific, and we had a record quarter. We had a record year, and I don't remember the last time that a large business the size of ours, and surely the size of a Datacenter business, grew by a factor of three. And so I think we're in a great position going into next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Raji Gill with Needham & Company.","Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC","Yeah, thanks. Jen-Hsun, can you talk a little bit about the evolution of artificial intelligence, and kind of make a distinction between artificial intelligence versus machine learning versus deep learning? They're different kind of categorizations and implementations of those different sub-segments. So I wanted to get a sense from you how NVIDIA's end-to-end computing platform kind of dominates machine learning relative to, say, the competition. Then I have a question on the gross margins, if I could.","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","Yes. First of all thanks, thanks for the question. The way to think about that is deep learning is a breakthrough technique in the category of machine learning, and machine learning is an essential tool to enable AI, to achieve AI. If a computer can't learn, and if it can't learn continuously and adapt with the environment, there's no way to ever achieve artificial intelligence. Learning, as you know, is a foundational part of intelligence, and deep learning is a breakthrough technique where the software can write software by itself by learning from a large quantity of data. Prior to deep learning, other techniques like expert systems and rule-based systems and hand-engineered features, where engineers would write algorithms to figure out how to detect a cat, and then they would figure out how to write another algorithm to detect a car. You could imagine how difficult that is and how imperfect that is. It basically kind of works, but it doesn't work good enough, well enough to be useful.","And then deep learning came along. The reason why deep learning took a long time to come along is because its singular handicap is that it requires an enormous amount of data to train the network, and it requires an enormous amount of computation. And that's why a lot of people credit the work that we've done with our programmable GPUs and our GPU computing platform and the early collaboration with deep learning. AI researchers as the big bang, if you will, the catalyst that made modern AI possible. We made it possible to crunch through an enormous amount of data to train these very deep neural networks. Now, the reason why deep learning has just swept the world, it started with a convolution of neural networks, but reinforcement networks and time sequence networks and all kinds of interesting adversarial networks. And the list of types of networks, I mean, there are 100 networks being created a week, and papers are coming out of everywhere.","The reason why is because deep learning has proven to be quite robust. It is incredibly useful, and this tool has at the moment found no boundaries of problems that it's figured out how to solve. And I think that the traditional methods of machine learning are still going to be useful if the absolute precision of the prediction or classification is not necessarily super important. For example, if you wanted to understand the sentiment of consumers on a particular new product that you sent, whether the sentiment is exactly right, so long as you understand the basic trend, and you largely understand the sentiment, I think people would consider that information to be useful. However, if you're using machine learning for cancer detection, obviously we need to have a little precision that is quite high. And so whether it's in health care or financial services or high-performance computing and in some areas where, for example, ad supported Internet search, small differences in accuracy could make a very large difference in the financial results for the advertiser and for the people hosting the service. And so in all these cases, deep learning has found a great utility, and that's one of the reasons why we're seeing so much growth. And obviously for self-driving cars, being kind of right is not a good idea, and we like to be exactly right.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Canaccord.","Matthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Thank you very much. Jen-Hsun, you guys obviously have won some business with your automotive supercomputer at Tesla in recent periods. And I was curious if you could comment on some of the application porting, and moving features from the previous architecture onto your architecture? And I guess how that's gone, and what you guys have learned through that process, and how it might be applied to some of your future partnerships. Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","Sure. First of all, you know that we are a full stack platform. The way we think about all of our platforms is from the application all the way back to the fundamental architecture in a semiconductor device. And so in the case of DRIVE PX, we created the architecture, optimized for neural net, for sensor fusion, for high-speed processing. The semiconductor design, in the case of DRIVE PX 2 called Tegra Parker, the system software for high-speed sensor fusion and moving data all the way around the car, the better you do that, the lower cost the system will be. The neural networks on top of that, that sits on top of our deep learning SDK, called cuDNN and TensorRT, basically frameworks of AI, and then on top of that, the actual algorithms for figuring out how to use that information from perception to localization to action planning.","And then on top of that, we have an API and an SDK that is integrated into map makers, and we integrate into every single map, HD map service in the world, from HERE to TomTom to ZENRIN in Japan, to Baidu in China. So this entire stack is a ton of software. But your question specifically has to do with the perception layer. And that perception layer quite frankly is just a small part of the self-driving car problem. And the reason for that is because in the final analysis, you want to detect lanes. You've got video coming in, you want to detect lanes, you have video coming in, you want to detect the car in front of you. And all we have to do, it's not trivial, but it's also not monumental, we have to detect and sense the lanes and the cars and we train our networks to do so.","And as you know very well now, that deep neural net has the ability to detect objects far better than any human engineer computer vision algorithms prior to deep learning. And that's one of the reasons why Tesla and others have jumped on top of the deep learning approach and abandoned traditional hand featured computer vision approaches. And so anyways, the answer to your question is that by working on self-driving cars, and we realized that this is a much more than computer vision, that the self-driving car platform is a stack of software and algorithms that's quite complex, and now we've had a lot of experience doing so.","And then recently at CES, we announced partnerships with Audi, which we announced that we will have Level 4 self-driving cars on the road by 2020. We announced a partnership with Daimler, we announced a partnership with ZF and Bosch, two of the world's top Tier 1 suppliers. We also announced partnerships with all of the mapping companies. And so if you put all that stuff together, we have the processor, we have the tier one partnerships for the integration of the systems, we have all the software on top of it, the deep learning networks, the car partnerships of course, and integrated into maps around the world. And all that entire stack when you put them all together should allow us to have self-driving cars on the road.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.","Joe L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you for taking the question. I wondered if you could talk a little bit about the inference market. Where are you in terms of hyperscale adoption for specialized inference type solutions, and how big you think that market can ultimately be? Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","Yes. The inference market is going to be very large. And as you know very well, in the future almost every computing device will have inferencing on it. A thermostat will have inferencing on it, a bicycle lock will have inferencing on it, cameras will have inferencing on it, and self-driving cars would have a large amount of inferencing on it. Robots, vacuum cleaners, you name it, smart microphones, smart speakers, all the way into the data center. And so I believe that long-term there will be a trillion devices that has inferencing connected to edge computing devices near them, connected to cloud computing devices, cloud computing servers. So that's basically the architecture.","And so the largest inferencing platform will likely be arm devices. I think that that goes without saying. Arm will likely be running inferencing networks, 1-bit XNOR, 8-bit, and even some floating-point. It just depends on what level of accuracy do you want to achieve, what level of perception do you want to achieve, and how fast do you want to perceive it? And so the inferencing market is going to be quite large. We're going to focus in markets where the inferencing precision, the inferencing, the perception scenario and the performance by which you have to do is mission-critical. And of course, self-driving cars is a perfect example of that. Robots, manufacturing robots, will be another example of that.","In the future you're going to see in our GTC, if you have a chance to see that, we're working with AI City partners all over the world for end-to-end video analytics, and that requires very high throughput, a lot of computation. And so the examples go on and on, all the way back into the data center. In the data center, there are several areas where inferencing is quite vital. I mentioned one number earlier, just mapping the earth, mapping the earth at the street level, mapping the earth in HD, in three-dimensional level for self-driving cars. Now, that process is going to require, well, just a pile of GPUs running continuously as we continuously update the information that needs to be mapped.","There's inferencing, which is called offline inferencing where you have to retrain a network after you deployed it, and you would likely retrain and re-categorize, reclassify the data using the same servers that you used for training. And so even the training servers will be used for inferencing. And then lastly, all of the nodes in cloud will be inferencing nodes in the future. I've said before that I believe that every single node in the cloud data center will have inferencing capability and accelerated inferencing capability in the future. I continue to believe that and these are all opportunities for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charles Long from Goldman Sachs.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hello. Can you hear me?","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","Sure.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. This is Toshiya from Goldman. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on the results. I had a question on gross margins. I think you're guiding Q1 gross margins only mildly below levels you saw in fiscal Q4, despite the royalty stream from Intel rolling over. And I'm guessing improvement of mix in Datacenter and parts of Gaming are driving this. But A, is that kind of the right way to think about the puts and takes going into Q1? And B, if that is indeed the case, should we expect gross margins to edge higher in future quarters and future years as data center becomes a bigger percentage of your business?","Colette M. Kress - NVIDIA Corp.","Yeah, this is Colette. Let me see if I can help answer that. So you're correct in terms of how to look at that in Q1. The delta from Q4 to Q1 is, we only have a partial part of recognition from the Intel, and that stops in the middle of March. So as we move forward as well, going into Q2, we will also have the absence of what we had in Q1 moving to Q2. I'm not here to give guidance on Q2 because we just give guidance out one quarter, but keep that in mind, there's a partial amount of Intel still left in Q1 and then it depletes in Q2. If you think about our overall model, our overall business model, it has moved to higher and value-added platforms, and that's what we're selling. So our goal is absolutely to continue to concentrate on providing those higher-value platforms, that gives us the opportunity for gross margin as we make those investments in terms of an OpEx. We'll see what that kind of mix looks like as we go into Q2, but just to leave you with a understanding of Intel is probably what we can do here. Okay?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin from UBS.","Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. First one is on the Datacenter tightening, just given the expected sequential growth in that business during the April quarter, can you talk about what products are helping to drive that? Is it possibly the DGX-1 computer box or is it more GPUs for training purposes at the hyperscale cloud datacenter?","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","It would have to be Tesla processors using in the cloud. There are several SKUs of Tesla processors. There's the Tesla processors used for high-performance computing, and it has FP64, FP32, ECC, it's designed, and has CUDA of course, and it has been optimized for molecular dynamics, astrophysics, quantum chemistry, fluid dynamics, the list goes on and on. The vast majority of the world's high-performance supercomputing applications, imaging applications, 3D reconstruction application, it has been ported onto our GPUs over the course of the last decade and some, and that's a very large part of our Tesla business.","Then of course, we introduced on top of the architecture our deep learning stack. Our deep learning stack starts with cuDNN, the numerics kernels, a lot of algorithms inside them to be optimized for numerical processing of all kinds of different precisions. It's integrated into frameworks of different kinds. There's so many different frameworks, from TensorRT to Caffe to Torch to Theano to MXnet to CNTK, the work that we did with Microsoft, which is really excellent, scaling it up from one GPU to many GPUs across multiple racks, and that's our deep learning stack, and that's also very important.","And then the third is GRID. GRID is a completely different stack. It's the world's first graphics virtualization stack, fully integrated into Citrix, integrated into VMware. Every single workstation and PC application has been verified, tested and has the ability to be streamed from a datacenter. And then last year, I think we announced it in \u2013 we started shipping it in August, our DGX-1, the world's first AI supercomputer appliance, which integrates a whole bunch more software of all different types, and has the ability to \u2013 we introduced our first NVIDIA docker. It containerizes applications. It makes it possible for you to have a whole bunch of users use one DGX. They could all be running different frameworks because most environments are heterogeneous.","And so that's DGX-1. And it's got an exciting pipeline ahead of it, and it's really designed for companies and workgroups who don't want to build their own supercomputer like the hyperscalers, and aren't quite ready to move into the cloud because they have too much data to move to the cloud. And so everybody basically can easily buy a DGX-1. It's fully integrated, fully supported, and get to work on deep learning right away. And so each one of these are all part of our Datacenter business. But the largest, because it's been around the longest since our Tesla business, but they're all growing, every single one of them.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie with Raymond James.","J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James Financial, Inc.","Great. Thanks a lot for the time. Just a quick question in the auto market. At CES, you had some solutions you were demonstrating. It showed in pretty significant decline in terms of the size and what was being offered. You really shrunk it down a lot, yet still having great performance. If you think out to sort of the Level 4 solution that you talked about for 2020, how small can you ultimately make that? It seems like you could be sort of relative to the size of the car pretty small. So just curious to hear your comment on that, and what impact having this system in the car makes on it.","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","We currently have DRIVE PX. DRIVE PX today is a one-chip solution for Level 3. And with two chips, two processors, you can achieve Level 4. And with many processors, you could achieve Level 5 today. And some people are using many processors to develop their Level 5, and some people are using a couple of processors to develop their Level 4. Our next generation, so that's all based on the Pascal generation. That's all based on the Pascal generation. Our next generation, the processor is called Xavier. We announced that recently. Xavier basically takes four processors and shrink it into one. And so we'll be able to achieve Level 4 with one processor. That's the easiest way to think about it. So we'll achieve Level 3 with one processor today. Next year, we'll achieve Level 4 with one processor, and with several processors, you could achieve Level 5.","But I think that the number of processors is really interesting because we need to do the processing of sensor fusion, and we got to do perception. We have to do localization. We have to do driving. There's a lot of functional safety aspects to it, failover functionality. There are all kinds of black box recorders, all kinds of different functionality that goes into the processor. And I think it's really quite interesting. But in the final analysis, what's really, really hard, and this is one of the reasons why our positioning in the autonomous driving market is becoming more and more clear, is that in the final analysis, there's really a software problem. And it's an end-to-end software problem. It goes all the way from processing, in the perception processing in the car to AI processing to helping you drive, connected to HD clouds for HD map processing all over the world.","And so this end-to-end stack of software is really quite a large undertaking. I don't know where anybody else is currently doing that with the exception of one or two companies. And so I think that that's really where the great complexity is. We have the ability to see and optimize across the entire range. Now, the other thing that we announced at CES that's worth mentioning is that we believe in a future, Level 4 means that you will have autopilot capability, hands-free autopilot capability in many scenarios. However, it's unlikely to ensure and to guarantee that in every scenario that you can achieve Level 4. It's just not practical for some time.","However, during those circumstances, we believe that the car should still have an AI, that the car should be monitoring what's happening outside and it should be monitoring the driver. And when it's not driving for you, it's looking out for you. And we call that the AI co-pilot. Whereas AI autopilot achieves Level 4 driving, AI co-pilot looks out for you in the event that it doesn't have the confidence to drive on your behalf. And so I believe that that's a really big breakthrough, and we're just seeing incredible excitement about it around the industry because I think it just makes a lot of sense. And the combination of the two systems allows us to achieve, build a better car.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis with B. Riley & Company.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Thanks for sneaking me in, and congratulations on the very good execution. Jen-Hsun, I wanted to come back to the Gaming platform. You've now got the business running at a $5 billion annualized run rate. So congratulations on the growth there. I think investors look at that as a business that's been built on the strength of a vibrant enthusiast market. But at CES, you announced the GeForce NOW offering, which really allows you to tap into the more casual potential gamer. So the question is, what will GeForce NOW do incrementally for the opportunity that you have with your Gaming platform?","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","Yeah, I appreciate that. I think, first of all, the PC gaming market is growing because of a dynamic that nobody ever expected, a dynamic that nobody ever expected 20 years ago. And that's basically how video games went from being a game to becoming a sport. And not only is it a sport, it's a social sport. And in order to play some of these modern eSports games, it's a five-on-five. and so you kind of need four other friends. And so as a result, in order to enjoy, to be part of this phenomenon that's sweeping the world, that it's rather sticky. And that's one of the reasons why Activision Blizzard is doing so well, that's one of the reasons why Tencent is doing so well. These two companies have benefited tremendously from the eSport dynamic, and we're seeing it all over the world.","And although it's free to play for some people, of course, you need to have a reasonably good computer to run it. And that's one of the reasons why you need GeForce in your PC so that you can enjoy these sports. When it's also a sport, nobody likes to lose, and surely nobody likes to blame their equipment when they do lose. And so having GeForce, it gives you confidence and it gives you an edge, and for a lot of gamers it's just the gold standard. And so I think that number one, eSports is one the reasons why gaming continues to grow. And I think at this point it's fair to say that even though it's now the second most-watched spectator sport on the planet behind Super Bowl, it is also the second highest paid winning sport behind football. It will soon be the largest sport in the world, and I can't imagine too many young people long term not coming into this sport somehow and as this sport continues to expand in genres. And so that's one of the core reasons.","Now, you asked a question about GeForce NOW, which I really appreciate. Now, the simple way to think about that is that there are many computers in the world that simply don't have the ability to enjoy video games, whether it's extremely thin and light notebooks, Apple Macs, Chromebooks, the integrated graphics that don't have very good capabilities, I think that the reasonable thing to do is to put the technology in the cloud, and it took us some five years to make this possible, to put the technology in the cloud and stream the video game experience with very low latency to the computer like Netflix does. And so we're basically turning the PC into a virtualized gaming experience and putting that into cloud. So I don't know exactly how big it's going to be yet, but our aspiration is that, that we would reach the parts of the markets where they're casual, or they just want to have another way, another device where they can game or somebody would like to come into the gaming world, and isn't quite ready to invest the time in building a computer or buying into a GeForce PC yet. So I'm anxious to learn from it, and when I learn more about GeForce, then I'll be more than happy to share it.","Operator","Unfortunately, that is all the time we have for questions. Do you have any closing remarks?","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","I want to thank all of you guys for following us. We had a record year, a record quarter. And most importantly, we're at the beginning of the AI computing revolution. This is a new form of computing, new way of computing, where parallel data processing is vital to success, and GPU computing that we've been nurturing for the last decade and some is really the perfect computing approach. We're seeing tremendous growth and exciting growth in the data center market. Datacenter now represents, had grew 3x over year-over-year, and it's on its way to become a very significant business for us. Gaming is a significant business for us, and longer term, self-driving cars is going to be a really exciting growth opportunity.","The thing that has really changed our company, what really defines how our company goes to market today, is really the platform approach, that instead of just building a chip that is industry standard, we created software stacks on top of it to serve vertical markets that we believe will be exciting long term that we can serve. And we find ourselves incredibly well positioned now in gaming, in AI and in self-driving cars.","I want to thank all of you guys for following NVIDIA, and have a great year.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

Thank you.","I'll now turn the call over to Simona Jankowski, Vice President of Investor Relations to begin your conference.","Simona Jankowski","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. And welcome to NVIDIA's conference call for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. With me on the call today from NVIDIA are Jen-Hsun Huang, President and Chief Executive Officer and Colette Kress, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to remind you that our call is being webcast live on NVIDIA's Investor Relations Web site.","The webcast will be available for replay until the conference call to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2020. The content of today's call is NVIDIA's property. It can't be reproduced or transcribed without our prior written consent.","During this call, we may make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. These are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of factors that could affect our future financial results and business, please refer to the disclosure in today's earnings release, our most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q and the reports that we may file on Form 8-K into Securities and Exchange Commission.","All our statements are made as of today, February 14, 2019, based on information currently available to us. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements. During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO commentary, which is posted on our Web site.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Colette.","Colette Kress","Thanks, Simona. As you know we lowered fourth quarter guidance for January 28th and the results are in line with our pre-announcement. Q4 revenue was $2.21 billion, down 24% from a year earlier, driven primarily by 45% year-on-year decline in gaming. Full year revenue was $11.72 billion, up 21% from the previous year.","Starting with our gaming business. Revenue of $954 million was down 45% year-on-year and down 46% sequentially, weaker than our expectations heading into the quarter. Full year revenue was up 13% to $6.25 billion. Three factors contributed to the Q4 gaming revenue decline. First, post crypto inventory of GPUs in the channel caused us to reduce shipments in order to allow excess channel inventory to sell through. We expect channel inventory to normalize in Q1 in line with one to two quarter timeline we had outlined on our previous earnings call.","Second, deteriorating macro economic conditions, particularly in China, impacted consumer demand for our GPUs; and third, sales of certain high end GPUs using our new Turing architecture, including the GeForce RTX 2080 and 2070 were lower than we expected for the launch of a new architecture. These products deliver a revolutionary leap in performance and innovation with real time ray-tracing and AI, but some customers may have delayed their purchase while waiting for lower price points or further demonstrations of the RTX technology and actual gains. The significant volatility in our gaming business over the last few quarters has been challenging to model.","Crypto mining demand and its after effects have distorted the quarter-to-quarter trends in the gaming business and obscured its underlying trend line. Let me try to give you some visibility into what we believe the long live business looks like. As you know, our gaming business consists of desktop gaming, notebook gaming and gaming console products. To get a sense of the underlying run rate in our gaming business last year, it is helpful to look at desktop gaming revenue across the period that doesn't include crypto demand.","Let's look at the four quarters starting from Q2 of last year to the current quarter or Q1 of this year. In Q2 and Q3 of last year with the benefit of hindsight, we shipped a higher amount of desktop gaming products relative to where end demand turned out to be. To allow the channel to work down that excess channel inventory, we shipped a lower amount relative to end demand in Q4 and will do so again in Q1. Therefore, exiting Q1, we expect channel inventories to be at normal levels. On average, our desktop gaming revenue across these four quarters is about $900 million. We believe this represents the normalized level of desktop gaming for this period. Notebook gaming and gaming consoles have averaged close to $500 million per quarter over these same four quarters, such in total we believe are normalized [indiscernible] gaming business revenue run rate is approximately $1.4 billion.","As we look past Q1, we expect the channel inventory correction to be behind us and our business to have bottomed. On a full year basis, we expect our gaming business to be down slightly given the tough first half compares with growth in Turing and notebook gaming. At CES last month, we launched into the recovery of our gaming business. We announced the GeForce RTX 2060 at the mid range price point of [$349] [ph]. The 2060 delivers a 60% performance improvement over the GTX 1060 while also bringing Turing's real time ray tracing and AI features to the mass market for the first time. The 2060 has received rave reviews and is off to a great start.","In addition, we announced a record of 40 plus new Turing based gaming laptops, which became available on January 29th.This is more than double the number of GeForce powered notebooks in the market last year. Featuring the energy efficiency of the Turing architecture [indiscernible] the laptops are able to deliver the performance of desktop gaming PCs. We expect GeForce laptops to continue to be the fastest growing segment of gaming.","We're also pleased to see growing momentum in the RTX ecosystem. As more game developers are creating content to take advantage of the Turing architectures' amazing capabilities. Just this week, DLSS technology is becoming available in two blockbuster games, Battlefield 5 and Metro Exodus, and Anthem coming soon. In addition at CES, Justice and Atomic Heart showed demos featuring ray tracing and DLSS, and the large pipelines of games plan to integrate RTX technology.","Pairing DLSS with ray tracing can provide comparable frame rates to traditional restorization but also much more beautiful cinematic visual, the best of both worlds. This is the next generation of gaming. While this was a challenging quarter in our gaming business we look forward to putting the channel inventory correction behind us and building on the solid foundation of our Turing architecture.","Moving to data center. Revenue was $679 million, up 12% year-on-year and down 14% sequentially. Full year data center revenue was $2.93 billion, up a strong 52%. The Q4 sales decline was broad based across verticals and markets and geographies. As the quarter progressed, customers around the world became increasingly cautious due to rising economic uncertainty and the number of deals did not close in January.","In addition, hyperscale and cloud purchases declined both sequentially and year-on-year as several customers paused at the end of the year. We believe the pause is temporary. The strength of NVIDIA's accelerated computing platform remains intact. We continue to lead the industry in performance for scientific computing and deep learning. And with CUDA's programability, we can continue to expand the value of our platform.","For example, we recently announced RAPIDS, our CUDA acceleration stack for data analytics and machine learning. In December, the first objective third-party AI benchmark called MLPerf became available. And NVIDIA captured the top spots in the six test categories for training deep learning models that we competed in. And in January, Google Cloud announced that NVIDIA T4 Tensor Core GPUs are now available in beta in its data centers in the U.S., Europe, Brazil, India, Singapore and Tokyo. The T4 is a universal cloud GPU that accelerates a variety of workloads, including high-performance computing, deep learning training and inference, broader machine learning, data analytics and graphics.","Our visibility remains low in the current cautious spending environment, and we don't forecast a meaningful recovery in the data center segment until later in the year. However, we are working closely with hyperscales around the world to integrate NVIDIA TensorRT software and Tensor Core GPUs into their inference production flow. Inference currently drives less than 10% of our data center business, while represents a significant expansion of our addressable market opportunity going forward.","We have also strengthened our product portfolio and go-to-market capabilities to address vertical industries that have an enormous data and analytics requirement, such as automotive, financial services, retail, healthcare and consumer Internet services. With our RAPIDS software stack, NVIDIA can accelerate data analytics and machine learning and as we have done in deep learning. And we made it easier for customers to adopt our technology by partnering with Cisco, IBM, NetApp and Pure Storage to create pre-integrated systems that can be sold through their global IT channels.","Moving to pro visualization, revenue reached $293 million, up 15% from the prior year and down 4% sequentially. Full year revenue was $1.13 billion, up 21% year-on-year. New applications like data science, AI and VR, as well as the need for thin and light mobile workstations remain key growth drivers for the business. We had key wins in the quarter, including Boeing, Google, LinkedIn and Toyota for applications including AI and robotics. This past week with our partners HP, Dell, Lenovo, we announced the availability of Quadro RTX workstation. Quadro RTX is the most significant workstation GPU upgrade in 10 years. It will enable millions of designers and creative artists for the first time to work interactively with super high resolution media and photorealistic 3D rendering, enabling them to be creative with dramatically improved productivity.","Finally, turning to automotive. Q4 revenue was $163 million, up 23% from a year ago and down 5% sequentially. Full year revenue reached $641 million, up 15%. The sequential decline was largely seasonal. The year-on-year growth was driven by the increasingly adoption of next generation AI cockpit solutions and autonomous vehicle development deals, partially offset by declines in legacy infotainment. Last month at CES, we announced DRIVE AutoPilot, the world's first commercially available level two plus self driving car computer. This system offers sophisticated automated driving features that far surpassed today's ADAS offerings, increasing the vehicles' performance, functionality and road safety, while the driver remains in control.","To deliver these capabilities, DRIVE AutoPilot uses multiple deep neural networks surround camera perception both in and outside of the car and significant AI processing capability. Systems from our Tier 1 partners, including Bosch, Continental, Veoneer, and ZF were all on-display at our booths. Although, as announced back in October, it was our first level two plus design win with cars slated for production in the early 2020s.","Mercedes-Benz has also chosen NVIDIA for its next generation autonomous vehicle and cockpit computer. This centralized AI computing system replaces dozens of smaller processors inside current cars. DRIVE AutoPilot is a major milestone for NVIDIA, and takes our high functioning self-driving capabilities into the mass market. This will be an important year for robo-taxi pilots and initial level two design wins.","Moving to the rest of the P&L and balance sheet. Q4 GAAP gross margins was 54.7% and non-GAAP was 56%, down sequentially and year-on-year, primarily due to $128 million charge for DRAM [port] and other components associated with our lower than expected Q4 revenue and current market conditions. GAAP operating expenses were $913 million and non-GAAP operating expenses were $755 million, up 25% and 24% year-on-year respectively. The GAAP EPS was $0.92, down 48% from a year earlier. Full year GAAP EPS was $6.63, up 38% from the prior year. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.80, down 53% from a year ago. Full year non-GAAP EPS was $6.64, up 35% from the prior year. We returned $1.95 billion to shareholders in the fiscal year through a combination of quarterly dividends and share repurchases. As we announced last quarter, we plan to return $3 billion to shareholders through the end of fiscal 2020 in the form of dividends and buybacks. We repurchased $700 million during the fourth quarter fiscal 2019.","With that, let me turn to the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2020; we expect revenue to be $2.2 billion plus or minus 2%; GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 58.8% and 59% respectively plus or minus 50 basis points; GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $930 million and $755 million respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP OI&E are both expected to be an income of $20 million; GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 10% plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items; capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $150 million to $170 million.","For fiscal 2020, we expect Q1 to mark the bottom as we passed the inventory correction in gaming. We expect total revenue for the year to be flat to down slightly with growth in our four end markets, compensating for the absence of crypto revenue and the excess selling for most year. We plan to grow OpEx in the high single digits this year, and we continue to invest in our focus growth areas of graphics, AI and self-driving cars. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary, and other information is available on our IR Web site.","In closing, I'd like to highlight upcoming events for the financial community; we will be presenting at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media and Telecom conference on February 26; and our next earnings call to discuss our financial results for the quarter of fiscal 2020 take place on May 15th.","We will now open the call for customers. Operator, would you please poll for questions? Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.","Toshiya Hari","I had two questions. First, Colette, you talked about the weakness you saw in the 2070 and the 2080 in the quarter. I guess this question is more for Jen-Hsun. Are you concerned at all about your ability to convince and incentivize gamer [indiscernible] as Colette pointed out, it's more of a timing thing. And the second question is inventory was up on the balance sheet. Colette, if you can just provide some color there and expectations going forward. Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang","When we launched the 2070 and 2080, it was the first time we've ever launched a new generation where the only available SKUs were very high end. And in addition to that, the early boards that came out into the marketplace were the special edition and the over clocked versions. And the MSRP versions didn't show up for some short time after, couple of months after. And so the conditions weren't ideal, if you will. We weren't able to launch into the mainstream segment with 2060 for all the reasons that I think everybody understands now. And so I think that the situ wasn't ideal. When you take a look at our situation now, every single graphics card had the best performance at its price point and it remains so today.","And I think that right out of the box, it delivered excellent performance. It is true that everybody was hoping to see more games with RTX on day one. But it's such a new technology with ray-tracing and AI for image processing that it's only really possible to make available with new games, which is tied to the schedules of new games. And now they're starting to come out. Battlefield 5, Metro Exodus, I think that the reviews from this week are just spectacular, people are finally realizing what it is that we were talking about and that it's possible with RTX technology, the combination of applying ray-tracing and AI for us to deliver much more beautiful images without sacrificing performance and so I think people are starting to understand now the benefits of the RTX technology and we just needed some time to demonstrate it and I think the takeaway is simply this RTX is the best graphics card at every single price point without using ray tracing technology and for new games that are coming out each one of the new games that come out in the future will apply ray tracing work with developers to apply ray tracing technology; I think everybody agrees that it is the surely the next generation. And then probably one of the biggest stories that came out just last week is a Unreal Engine and Unity both of the game engines are going to incorporate RTX and ray-tracing technology in the engine itself. And so all future games in the future will be able to take advantage of that, so that's a really big news and I'm excited about that.","Colette Kress","So Toshiya to answer your second question regarding our inventory balance. Our inventory dollars at the end of Q4 rose just due to the weaker than expected finish to Q4. Inventory right now is primarily related to Turing, Volta and DGX. And we don't expect any further write-downs as we have incorporated approximately 128 million of write-downs within the current Q4.","Operator","Your next question is from C.J. Muse with Evercore.","C.J. Muse","I guess on the commentary regarding a pause in spending in data center and a handful of deals that got delayed. Can you give a little bit more color in terms of I guess what you're seeing across enterprise cloud, high performance compute, and I guess within that, how you're seeing the ramp of T4? And I guess if you can then speak to I'm sure embedded in the fiscal '20 guidance is a pretty nice ramp into the second half. What are the key drivers, key milestones that you're looking for to see that business reaccelerate higher as we go through the year?","Jen-Hsun Huang","The slowdown is broad based. We saw it across every vertical, every geography. There was just a level of cautiousness across all of the enterprise customers and the cloud service providers that we've not experienced in a while. And I think that it has to be temporary. The computing needs of Earth is, it's not certainly been satisfied with what was shipped last quarter. And so I think that the demand will return and customers will return. Our situation in data centers is dramatically better year-over-year. And if you take a look at where we are, our deep learning solution is unquestionably the best in the world. We introduced T4 with inference capability, it's the world's first universal cloud GPU and it does everything that NVIDIA does, all in one GPU and 75 watts. And so it fits into every hyperscale data center.","We're engaged with Internet Service Providers all around the world, optimizing and porting their high production models networks so that we could deploy it into production. So we now have four different new growth drivers for our data center in addition to deep learning and scientific computing; we have inference that we're actively working on; we have data analytics that\u2019s called rapids, some people call it Big Data, but data analytics and machine learning; the third is rendering. And because of the partnerships that we've developed and the excitement that people see around enterprises around the world, we've developed partnerships with large IT companies to pre-configure systems that make it easier for enterprises to be able to adopt our technology. So we have four new ways for us to grow our enterprise business. And so we're looking forward to when the pause releases and we'll get back to growing.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya","I just had a clarification and a question. On the clarification, gross margins. Colette, what is the normalized run rate for gross margins? As you get to your sales back to normalized levels, how should we think about the trajectory of gross margins? And will there be any impact from the balance sheet inventory? And then on the question Jen-Hsun, can you give us more reassurance that gaming is still a growth business? I understand that over the last year, there's been a lot of confusion, there's been macro issues. But if you look at the number of gamers and the mix of product that they are buying so essentially to sell through to gamers, has that been on an upward trajectory? And as part of that, when do you think we could see Turing exceed the demand you saw for Pascal? Thank you.","Colette Kress","On gross margin, our gross margin, the largest contributor to our absolute gross margin is really just the mix of our product. The mix of our products based on our market platforms, but also the mix of our products within data center, as well as within gaming. We provided guidance for Q1, which has a good level of confidence from us and we'll see how it goes from there.","Jen-Hsun Huang","The fundamentals of gaming has not changed, there more gamers than ever. Games are better than ever. There's been a recent shift in the popularity of multiplayer competitive e-sports like games, that's good for hardware. It lowers the barrier to entry, because it's free to play with the exception of downloadable content. And so the barriers to entry is lower but you could see that the excitement around Fortnight and recently with Apex Legend, PUBG is still popular, League of Legends is still popular. And so this genre of games is both competitive, requires great hardware, it attracts a lot more players, because it's social and you want to play with your friends and it's much stickier, because it happens to be social, it happens to be a game where you have to play with a whole bunch of other people. And so I think that gaming is vibrant as ever before.","If you take the methodology that Colette described earlier and you averaged out our underlying gaming business and you compare that to a year before, surely it grew. If you compare that -- if you compare also the rate at which our gaming notebook is growing, I think that's pretty exciting. I think last year and we had mentioned it before that our gaming notebook business grew 50% year-over-year. And just at CES the number of new notebook designs that came out with Turing, because of an invention that we created called Max-Q and because of the energy efficiency of the Turing architecture, you can now make notebooks that are really wonderful and also high performing at the same time. And so I think the dynamics are the same and gaming is going to continue to be a growth business.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line and John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John Pitzer","Colette, I appreciate all the data you gave us on trying to size normalized demand for gaming. What I have to ask though is if you\u2019re going through channel inventory worked out in fiscal first quarter, it seems like to hit your full year guide the expectation is for gaming revenue to accelerate well above that normalized level you talked about. What am I doing the math right? And if I am, what gives you confidence throughout the year that you can see that gaming growth off of these numbers?","Colette Kress","I\u2019ll start and I\u2019ll let Jen-Hsun finish that question. So along the lines of Jen-Hsun's response in terms of what we do believe are the key drivers of gaming. And everything's still intact in terms of gaming, both with our Turing architecture, the growth expected with our Turing architecture, as well as the green from the notebook, we do believe will be great drivers as we head into the rest of the year. We'll have to wait and see in terms of how that plays out but that is really the underlying reason why the growth will continue.","Jen-Hsun Huang","I think your math isn't wrong. The part that you probably didn't consider is notebook. Our GeForce notebook business is quite large.","John Pitzer","And then maybe as a follow-up just on the data center side. Clearly, you\u2019ve talked about new applications that should help grow your TAM inside of data center. I\u2019m just curious the calendar fourth quarter of last year, I think marked the first time that a competitor had some meaningful volumes in GPU in the data center. There's always talk about the [ITCM] guys wanting to do their own ASICs. What anecdotal evidence can you give us to help us get more comfortable that what\u2019s going on here is more macro and not share loss either to competition and\/or architectural differences between GPUs and ASICs?","Jen-Hsun Huang","We don't see them in high performance computing. And so I haven't found where -- we haven't met them in high performance computing and deep learning, and in the areas that we serve. And so competitively, really we don't see it. But the bigger picture I think is this that the market segments that we serve, whether it's in deep learning, machine learning, data analytics, those segments are really quite large. And I think that it is unquestionably the future of high performance computing is going to be highly data driven, both computational methods, algorithmic methods, as well as data driven methods. And so I think the fundamental trend has not changed.","We have four new growth drivers, four new ways to grow in the data center. The first one of course is inference. We're making a lot of progress there, T4 is doing great. I think we're going to be quite successful with T4s. You just got to keep saying that has second generation Tensor Core, 75 watts and you can use it for training, you can use it for inference, you could use it for remote graphics, you could use it for high performance computing. And it fits literally into any hyperscale data center.","The second way is data analytics. This is a brand new thing for us. You must know that Big Data and using data to predict dynamics in the marketplaces is really important in retail and e-tail, and healthcare, and financial services. And there's never been accelerated approach to solve this problem for people. And because of the flexibility of CUDA and because the performance of architecture, over the course of last year, we reengineered the entire data analytics stack. So that we can accelerate, it's called RAPIDS. That work is really, really important and I hope to give you guys updates on that on a regular basis. Rendering is a brand new market for us, because of Turing, finally we can we can render photo realistic images in accelerated way. There are millions of servers in the world that are driving render farms and they're getting upgraded on a regular basis.","And then lastly, we've been successful with CSPs, because they're easy for us to reach. But the world's enterprises are far and many and they're giant industries. And our company's sales coverage doesn't allow us to reach every single healthcare company and every single insurance company and retail company. And that's where our network of partners really come in. We have great partnerships with HP. We have great partnerships with Dell and Cisco and IBM. And now we've developed relationships with the storage vendors. And the reason for that is because most of these big data problems require great deal of storage. And they all see -- they see the opportunities that we created. And we came together to create pre-configured systems that are optimized attuned. And these high performance systems that you can just bring into the company prop up and install, and we're seeing a lot of great success with that.","And so we have four different ways to grow our data center business and we're enthusiastic about it. I'm optimistic about it.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS.","Tim Arcuri","First, I had a clarification. Colette, I just wanted to clarify what the mix is assumed for the fiscal Q1 guidance. So you assuming that data center and gaming are both flat sequentially. And then I guess my question was. Can you help us shape the revenue through the year? To get to your full year guidance, you have to add roughly, maybe $1.3 billion, $1.5 billion from where you are in fiscal Q1. How does that shape through the year? Thanks.","Colette Kress","Our guidance for the next quarter is a make-up of many different types of options across our market segment. We feel confident in terms of that rollout as we provided the guidance today and we'll just have to see how that pans out. With the expectation that we will be flat or slightly down for the full year, you are correct in some case that we're going to have to build up to that over the course of the several next quarters. Likely, the second half of the year will definitely be stronger than the first half of the year, and that is our expectation at this time.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Tim, one of the things to keep in mind is that we have four growth drivers. We have four growth businesses. Our data center business is growing. It's unquestionably that our footprint is larger than ever. Our ProVis business is growing. Our workstation business now has three ways to grow. One is rendering. The second is data scientists are now a workstation customer that has never happened before. And our software stack with Turing in terms of workstation into an ideal data science workstation. And the third is finally we're able to make workstations into notebooks and they're delightfully thin, using all the same technologies that talked about for gaming notebooks and so workstations is a growth business. And then lastly, our automotive is going to be a gross growth business.","We've been investing, as you know, in self-driving cars. And this year we announced entry into level two plus, our first foot into the mainstream marketplace of autonomous vehicles. And the first design win is Volvo and we have others to announce. And so I think this is going to be a good year for self driving cars as well. So we have four growth businesses, our four core businesses are all growing.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.","Stacy Rasgon","First, I wanted to get the mix, this is question Colette. You had said that mix was going to be the primary driver of your gross margins. And I know that sequentially, they're up. But if I correct for the inventory write down in Q4, the normalized gross margin this quarter was 61.7. And so you're guiding it to 59, so it's down 270 basis points sequentially on flat revenues. So do I take from that guidance if that's an indicator of the mix between the businesses is the primary driver of that gross margin degradation, or is there's something else going on that we should be aware of?","Colette Kress","We'll start with that first question on gross margin. You're correct mix is still the primary driver of our gross margin every single quarter. You've correctly reduced or changed our Q4 numbers to remove the overall inventory write down. So when you look at Q1, there is a mix around our products that we plan on shipping by platforms. But also within our gaming business and within our data center business, we also have different gross margins that would influence. These are our best estimates of what we have at this time and we'll see as we move through the year.","Stacy Rasgon","So what do you think the bigger between those two, whether it's intra business mix or inter business mix, between the businesses or within the businesses. Which one of those is the biggest driver of the gross margin degradation sequentially into Q1?","Colette Kress","I think it's more on the inter pieces. Now keep in mind our Q4 had a very low percentage of gaming as a total in terms of there and then different mix within there as we moved in the next quarter as well.","Stacy Rasgon","So you think it's the mix between the businesses within, like you said, inter. Is that mix between the businesses that you think is the bigger drive there?","Colette Kress","The mix of the intra, both within the segment as well as between the segments.","Stacy Rasgon","For my follow-up, Jen-Hsun you and Colette, you mentioned the data center was growing. But if I've got full year revenues for the flat to down slightly and I've got gaming revenues down a bit like you said, and I have ProVis and auto growing. It's really hard within the envelope that guidance to get data centers growing much if at all. I mean, it could even be down within that. I mean how are you thinking about the idea of data center growing within the context of the full year guidance that you're given?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, in the short-term, in the near-term, we have relatively limited visibility. We don't think it's going to remain this way. And with a little bit of tailwind, I think we could have a fairly good year. And so we'll just see how it turns out. This is our year guidance for now and we'll update you as we go. The fundamental dynamics doesn't change. The fact of the matter is that world needs more computing. And a lot of that computing is related to machine learning, data analytics, deep learning. It's related to the things that we're working on. And we have four new ways to grow our data center business. I think our deep learning position is as good as ever. Our scientific computing position is as good as ever. And we have four new ways to grow; we have inference, we have data analytics and machine learning, we have rendering and now we're taking that entire stack to the enterprise. And so I think we have the right strategy, we have the best platform and the utilization, the utility of it is really fantastic. And so with a little bit of tailwind, I think we could have a fairly good year and we\u2019ll just report it as we go.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.","Joe Moore","I wanted to ask about again competition and data center. AMD on their call had talked about graphics in their data center business being, biggest server which is worth north of $100 million a quarter, which surprised me. My sense is they're doing quite a bit different applications than you guys are. But maybe just give us some context around what they're doing and how you see the competition coming from within other graphics vendors?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Our data center business is really focused on computing and we don't see anybody. Our primary competitor is CPUs. That's really the starting of it and the ending of it. And it's very clear. The vast majority of the world's data center only runs on CPUs today. But the advance of technology has slowed and it's creeping along at a few percent a year and unfortunately, that's just not good enough. And so either data centers are going to continue to increase in CapEx, or they're going to have to find a new approach. And I think people are fairly enthusiastic about university, about accelerated computing. And I think our position is really quite good. And so I would say that those are largely the positions.","If you think about competitively comparing our GPU to a competitor's latest GPU, I think the expectation was really high and didn't turn out quite that way. I think we've established -- the Turing energy efficiency is much better. I think we've established that NVIDIA\u2019s tensor core architecture as a result allows our Volta to be four times the performance of the highest end of the alternative. And the T4 is one fourth the power at the same performance. And so the benefit of having great architectural advantage, a really rich software stack and an engineering that resulted in the energy efficiency that we've achieved generation in and generation out, I think those are those are really great advantages.","And then lastly, because of the broad reach of our architecture, an OEM or a cloud service provider can adopt to our architecture and the utility of it's going to be greater, because there's just a lot more applications. And the best way to reduce costs for any utility is to increase its utility. And I think that our position there is really strong as you could imagine.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen.","Matt Ramsay","I have just a couple of questions. The first one Jen-Hsun, it seemed like the Turing platform is delivering some amazing results but as you talked about relying on some new software features to do it. I wonder if you might talk about any steps you're taking in the roadmap to really upgrade performance for the installed base of games, and given the time that it might take for some of those software features to rollout? And then secondly, you noted in the pre-announcement something about the write down having to do with DRAM. I mean obviously that commodity pricing has been volatile. Colette, is there anything you can talk about how big of an effect that might have on the business and on pricing overall? Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang","First of all, the Turing architecture is the highest performing architecture at every single price point. And it's a big jump from our last generation in every single way. Without ray-tracing the Turing architecture is the first GPU to do concurrent floating point and image your operations at the same time. The instruction per clock of the Turing processor is so much better than our last generation, so much better than what's available in the marketplace.","The cash architecture is a big improvement, and you can just see it in all of the existing games. So just measure the existing games without touching anything, Turing gives you a big boost and that's before we talked about ray-tracing. And we've already spoken about ray-tracing earlier Matt and we know that every single game that are coming out, we're working with the developers to incorporate RTX technology and a very, very big deal, both Epic with Unreal Engine and Unity Engine are going to incorporate ray-tracing. It is very, very clear that the next generation of computer graphics is ray-tracing. And all of the work that we've done with RTX to move the industry forward is well worth it. But remember that's just the graphics part of Turing.","Turing comes with its several new opportunities for growth for us; the first is of course, advancing games; advancing games for notebooks; advancing computer graphics photorealistic rendering for film; all the work that we've done with Tensor Core that we just talked about. It's our second generation Tensor Core making it great for training, as well as inference, a big leap for us for inference. And then lastly all the work that we're doing for data analytics and machine learning will take advantage of all of the capabilities of Turing. And so Turing is a big deal for us. And that's one of the reasons why last year was so busy for us. As we put Turing into workstations, into data centers, into clouds, into rendering, into video games. And so Turing is really a gigantic leap for us architecturally, we're really excited by it. I think the turbulent Q4 overshadowed all of it but in the final analysis, I think Turing was a home run for us.","Colette Kress","And to also answer your question regarding DRAM prices, yes, they have definitely been volatile over the historical period. It is great to see them coming down in price. Over the long-term, yes, that is beneficial to us from a gross margin perspective. So as we look out to the quarters or later, we will probably be able to incorporate that into our gross margin.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.","Aaron Rakers","Building on the discussion around the Turing platform and particularly to the gaming market, I'm curious you mentioned in your prepared comments pricing of these new solutions is a bit of an inhibitor. Has the company invoked any changes in your pricing strategy around Turing? And then also I'd be interested is, can you help us frame how important China is to the gaming segment and whether or not you're assuming that the China market rebounds in your annual assumptions?","Jen-Hsun Huang","First of all, on the pricing part, the biggest inhibitor was that we couldn't launch our mid range segment. The ability to launch 2060 was a big inhibitor for us, but we did so at CES. The launch is a great success. The reviews are fantastic. People love 2060, the price point is great. And so now we have great stack from the mid range all the way to enthusiasts. The other part, which because it turned out better is at the time of the launch, there were so many special additions and there were so many over clocked versions that the price point appeared high. But now we have MSRP pricing for all of our segments. And so that's terrific. China's an important market and it's an important gaming market. And I very confidence this is going to rebound.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.","Mark Lipacis","Could you just -- a clarification. Could you repeat what you said you thought the OpEx would grow in this fiscal year? And what is the focus of that investment, to what extent this is R&D versus SG&A? And then maybe one layer deeper, where's the focus of the higher OpEx? Thank you.","Colette Kress","I'll start off to repeat what we indicated in our transcript. We plan to increase OpEx in the high single-digits over where we finished in terms of fiscal year '19. That is related to our opportunities that we see in front of us, gaming, AI as well as self driving cars. Our focus in terms of investments, we are a very R&D heavy significant company. But there are investments across the board, both in R&D as well as what we need in terms of go to market strategies to obtain these high markets in front of us.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets.","Mitch Steves","So I don't want to poke too many holes on the memory side and the downturn in gaming due to crypto inventory. But if I think about the gross margin profile, you guys almost reached 65%. So if I look out let's call it a year or even 18 months to make it more of a long-term target. Is there any reason why you guys can't get back up to the mid 6s level?","Colette Kress","On your gross margin question, yes we still have drivers within the mix of our products that allow us to grow our gross margin over the long-term absolutely. And there is definitely a goal for us to continue doing that. So we will focus in terms of both the cost components of what we do, but also moving the entire portfolio to the higher value added platforms that we sell. So over the long term, absolutely all of those things are still in place and intact that we can do. And we'll look quarter-to-quarter to give the best guidance that we can to help you see that.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays.","Blayne Curtis","Obviously, a pause in data center particularly with the hyperscale, it's pretty well documented. And just curious your perspective particularly being AI still growth area versus more run rate being memory and CPUs. Can you give us any perspective as to how widespread is maybe number of customers or geographic perspective, and just curious how AI is affected with this greater slow down? Thanks.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Blayne, the hyperscalars, their pause is probably the most dramatic. We still see a lot of activity in enterprise. It's just a much smaller base for us but we expect it to be a much larger base in the future. And the reason for that is because most of the enterprises today don't use deep learning, they use an approach called machine learning. They might use things like decision trees, or graph analytics, or regressions, or clustering, or things like that, algorithms like that. And they run data analytics applications for business intelligence on large amounts of data, and they might be running it on top of a spark stack that was created out of Berkeley and open source from Databricks. And so there's -- if you recognize some of these things, that's what healthcare companies do and financial services companies do, and retail companies do. They use it for fraud detection, predicting inventory, trying to make the best matches between riders and drivers, and try to predict which route to take to deliver food dinner to you.","And so those applications most of the developers today use machine learning and large big data analytics. So we invested in the stack called RAPIDS and built our architecture, called T4. And we're in the process of partnering with large IT companies to take the stack and the solution out to the world's enterprise. And so, I expect enterprise to be a fairly exciting growth opportunity for us. Meanwhile, the CSPs, their pause will end. The amount of computation they do is increasing. More and more of them are using deep learning. And we have inference opportunity with the work that we do with T4 and TensorRT. And so we've got a lot of exciting opportunities to go.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Pierre Ferragu with New Street Research.","Pierre Ferragu","A question for Colette, I'm trying to figure out how your position with cloud data centers evolved last year in financial year 2019. So if I look at the cloud CapEx, we are up about 70%. If I look at the CPU going into the cloud, according to Intel, was up about 60%. So I was wondering how much you guys have been increasing revenues within your cloud business, did you grow faster than CPUs? Did you go faster than overall CapEx? And then I have a follow up on 2020.","Colette Kress","Let me start out on that piece. As we talked about earlier on the call, our hyperscales and our hyperscales many of them are also cloud providers did start to slowdown in terms of their purchasing in latter half of the year. But the overall growth rate as you can see from our data center business grew more than 50% for the full year. Now even without strong growth, we are still a very small percentage of overall CapEx that we see in the cloud providers or the overall hyperscales. We are likely one of their top priorities of areas of where they need to grow in terms of in their data center as they focus on AI, as they focus on the cloud businesses, and the importance of that compute is necessary. But we're still a very, very small percentage of it. So slowdown in the second half of the year, full year growth, phenomenal growth of 50% and we track with that for this year.","Pierre Ferragu","But this 50% growth, that's all your overall data center business. Is that's what like specifically your cloud hyperscale business grew well or did that grew even faster with that?","Colette Kress","Yes, depending on the quarter, we will have a mix of what is hyperscale growth or what is cloud in this. And again in the fourth quarter that was not a growth opportunity for us but earlier in the year definitely it was.","Pierre Ferragu","And then quickly maybe Jen-Hsun on 2020, so you seem to be very cautious on the data center outlook. When we listen to players like Google and Facebook and others, they all seem to be seemed like very tuned to grow their overall spending this year. And when we listen to other providers around you, they all seem to be -- they all demonstrate a bit of a confidence that in the second half, spending should resume. Is that just because I've been more optimistic than you? Do they say something you don't see? What do you hear from your clients about the second half?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, we're enthusiastic about the second half. We're enthusiastic about our position. And we're enthusiastic about the solution we offer. And Pure, as you know, we've also expanded our application and our market reach. We guided I think probably the biggest takeaway is we guided flat to slightly down for the whole year, for the whole number. We do have four growth drivers. And maybe the best way to think about it is we should just wait and see how it goes. I think we concerned with where we are. I feel pretty good about our guidance, but I feel even better about our strategic position. And so I look forward to working through the year with you guys.","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JP Morgan.","Harlan Sur","On the China gaming weakness, is it the slower economic environment or is it government policy related? Because we know that the Chinese government has had a freeze on new gaming approvals, probably recently started to approve new games. This ban is in place I think since the first half of last year. So given what you know the business, how much of the China weakness is coming from China gaming bans versus just overall slower economic environment?","Jen-Hsun Huang","I don't know that we could tear that apart, tease that apart, Harlan. We just know that, the China, the consumer market is relatively slow towards the end of the year. And the China economy is in the final analysis of growth economy. And so we're looking forward to it recovering. And gaming is one of the most important pass-times of their culture and so I'm excited about our prospects there. All the things that we're seeing in the near-term, Colette has done a really good job of describing and as we leave the bottom and leave this inventory issue behind us, we're super well positioned. We have a full stack of RTX. The Turing architecture is fantastic. It is unquestionably the best in the world. We have the best performance at every single price point. And we have great notebooks that the market can now buy. And so I'm looking forward to reporting our status with you guys as the year goes on. It should be a good year.","Operator","Thank you. I'll now turn the call back over to Jen-Hsun for any closing remarks.","Jen-Hsun Huang","2018 was a record year but it was a disappointing finish. This quarter, we expect to put the channel inventory issue behind us and get back on track. As the pioneer of accelerated computing, our position is unique and strong. And the opportunities ahead in graphic, high performance computing, AI and autonomous machines remain enormous. We are as enthusiastic about these growth opportunities as ever. Thanks everyone for joining us today.","Operator","And this concludes today's conference call.

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to NVIDIA's conference call for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. With me on the call today from NVIDIA are Jensen Huang, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Colette Kress, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","I'd like to remind you that our call is being webcast live on NVIDIA's Investor Relations website. The webcast will be available for replay until the conference call to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. The content of today's call is NVIDIA's property. It can't be reproduced or transcribed without our prior written consent.","During this call, we may make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. These are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of factors that could affect our future financial results and business, please refer to the disclosure in today's earnings release, our most recent forms 10-K and 10-Q and the reports that we may file on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Except as required by law we assume no obligation to update any such statements.","During this call we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO commentary, which is posted on our website.","With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.","Colette Kress","Thanks, Simona. Q4 revenue was $3.11 billion, up 41% year-on-year and up 3% sequentially, well above our outlook, reflecting upside in our data center and gaming businesses. Full year revenue was $10.9 billion, down 7%. We recovered from the excess channel inventory in gaming and an earlier pause in hyperscale spending and exited the year with great momentum.","Starting with gaming. Revenue of $1.49 billion was up 56% year-on-year and down 10% sequentially. Full year gaming revenue was $5.52 billion, down 12% from our prior year. We enjoyed strong end demand for our desktop and notebook GPUs.","Let me give you some more details. Our gaming lineup was exceptionally well positioned for the holidays, with the unique ray tracing capabilities of our RTX GPUs and incredible performance at every price point. From the Singles Day shopping event in China, through the Christmas season in the West, channel demand was strong for our entire stack.","Fueling this were new blockbuster games like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, continued esports momentum and new RTX SUPER products. With RTX price points as low as $299, ray tracing is now the sweet spot for PC gamers. Gaming is thriving and gamers prefer GeForce.","The global phenomenon of esports keeps gaming momentum with an audience now exceeding 440 million, up over 30% in just two years, according to Newzoo. The League of Legends World Championship brought more than 100 million viewers on par with this month's Super Bowl.","Ray tracing titles continue to come to market and GeForce RTX GPUs are the only ones that support this important technology. This quarter Wolfenstein: Youngblood and Deliver Us The Moon were the latest titles to support ray tracing, as well as NVIDIA's Deep Learning Super Sampling technique, which also uses AI to boost performance.","With the proliferation of RTX-enabled games and our best ever top-to-bottom performance, we are solidly into the Turing Architecture upgrade cycle. Gamers continue to move to higher-end GPUs, seeking better performance and support for ray tracing.","Gaming laptops posted double-digit year-on-year growth for the eighth consecutive quarter. The category continues to expand, driven by appealing thin and light form factors with fantastic graphics performance. This holiday season retailers stocked a record 125 gaming laptops based on NVIDIA GPUs, up from 94 last year, with our Max-Q designs up 2x.","At CES we launched the world's first 14-inch, GeForce RTX laptop with ASUS. We also continue to expand our Studio lineup of laptops for the fast-growing population of freelance creators, designers and Youtubers with 13 new RTX Studio systems introduced at CES.","Powered by Turing GPUs, these systems are optimized for over 55 creative and design applications with RTX accelerated ray tracing and\/or AI. Last week, we launched our GeForce NOW cloud gaming service.","Powered by GeForce, GeForce NOW is the first cloud gaming service to deliver ray trace games. It's also the only open platform, so gamers can enjoy the games they already have. And use their existing store accounts without having to repurchase games.","GeForce NOW enables PC games on Mac, Windows, PCs, TVs, mobile devices and soon Chromebooks. GFN has a freemium business model that includes two membership plans.","A free membership with standard access and the Founders tier with a starting price of $4.99 per month which gives priority access and RTX ray tracing support. Our goal with GeForce NOW is to expand GeForce gaming to more gamers.","About 80% of GeForce NOW gamers are playing on underpowered PCs or devices with Mac OS or Android. With GeForce NOW, they are able to enjoy PC gaming on a GeForce GPU in the cloud.","GeForce Now can expand GeForce well beyond the roughly 200 million gamers we reach today. Separately, we entered into a collaboration with Tencent, the world's largest gaming platform to bring PC gaming in the cloud to China, the world's largest gaming market.","NVIDIA GPU technology will power Tencent's Start cloud gaming service, which is in early testing stages. Moving to data center, revenue was a record $968 million, up 43% year-on-year and up 33% sequentially, our strongest ever sequential growth in dollar terms.","Full year fiscal year 2020 data center revenue was a record $2.98 billion up, 2% from the prior year. Strong growth was fueled by hyperscale and vertical industry end customers.","Hyperscale demand was driven by purchases of both our training and inference products, in support of key AI workloads such as natural language understanding, conversational AI and deep recommendators.","Hyperscale demand was also driven by cloud computing. AWS now makes the T4 available in every region. This underscores the versatility of the T4 which excels at a wide array of high-performance computing workloads, including AI inference, cloud gaming, rendering, and virtual desktop.","Vertical industry growth was driven primarily by, consumer Internet companies. Other verticals, such as, retail, health care, and logistics continue to grow from early-stage build-outs, with a strong foundation of deep learning engagements.","And we see an expanding set of opportunities across high-performance computing, data science and edge computing applications. T4, our inference platform had another strong quarter, with shipments up 4x, year-on-year driven by public cloud deployments, as well as edge AI video analytics applications.","T4 and V100, reflecting strong demand for inference and training respectfully, set records this quarter for both shipments and revenue. Even as NVIDIA remains the leading platform for AI model training, NVIDIA's inference platform is gaining wide use by some of the world's leading enterprise and consumer Internet companies, including American Express, Microsoft, PayPal, Pinterest, Snap and Twitter.","The industry continues to do groundbreaking AI work for NVIDIA. For example, Microsoft's biggest quality improvements made over the past year in its Bing search engine stem from its use of NVIDIA GPUs and software for training and inference, of its natural language understanding models.","These DNN transformer models, popularized by BERT, have computational requirements for training that are in the order of magnitude higher than earlier image-based models. Conversational AI is a major new workload, requiring GPUs for inference to achieve, high throughput within the desired low latency.","Indeed, Microsoft cited an inference throughput increase of up to 800x on NVIDIA GPUs compared with CPUs enabling it to serve over 1 million BERT inferences per second worldwide. And just this week, Microsoft researchers announced a new breakthrough in natural language processing with the largest ever publicized model trained on NVIDIA DGX-2. This advances the state-of-the-art for AI assistance and tasks such as answering questions, summarization and natural language generation.","Recommendators are also an important machine learning model for the Internet powering billions of queries per second. The industry is moving to deep recommendators, such as wide & deep model, which leverage deep learning to enable automatic feature learning and to support unstructured content. Running these models on GPUs can dramatically increase inference throughput and reduce latency compared with CPUs.","For example Alibaba's and Baidu's recommendation engines run on NVIDIA AI boosting their inference throughput by orders of magnitude beyond CPUs. Deep recommendators enabled Alibaba to achieve 10% increase in click-through rates.","We also announced the availability of a new GPU-accelerated supercomputer on Microsoft Azure. It enables customers for the first time to rent an entire AI supercomputer on demand from their desk, matching the capabilities of large on-premise supercomputers that can take months to deploy. And in Europe, energy company Eni announced the world's fastest industrial supercomputer based on NVIDIA GPUs.","AI has even come to pizza delivery. At the National Retail Federations Annual Conference last month, we announced Domino's as a customer deploying our platform for deep learning and data science applications helping with customer engagement and order accuracy prediction.","More broadly in retail, we have seen a significant increase in the adoption of NVIDIA's edge computing offerings by large retailers for powering AI applications that reduce shrinkage, optimize logistics and create operational efficiencies. At the SC19 Supercomputing conference, we introduced a reference design platform for GPU-accelerated ARM-based servers along with ecosystem partners, ARM, Ampere computing Fujitsu and Marvell.","We made available our ARM-compatible software development kit consisting of NVIDIA CUDA-X libraries and development tools for accelerating computing. This opens the floodgate of innovation to support growing new applications from hyperscale cloud to exascale supercomputing.","We also introduced NVIDIA Magnum IO, a suite of software optimized to eliminate storage and input\/output bottlenecks. Magnum IO delivers up to 20x faster data processing for multi-server, multi-GPU computing nodes when working with massive data sets to carry out complex financial analysis, climate modeling and other workloads for data scientists, high-performance computing and AI researchers.","Finally, we introduced TensorRT 7, the seventh generation of our inference software development kit, which speeds up components of conversational AI by 10x comparing to running on CPUs. This helps drive latency below the 300 millisecond threshold considered necessary for real-time interactions supporting our growth in conversational AI.","Moving to ProVis. Revenue reached a record $331 million, up 13% year-on-year and up 2% sequentially. Full year revenue was a record $1.21 billion, an increase of 7% from the prior year. ProVis accelerated in Q4 as the rollout of more RTX-enabled applications is driving strong upgrade cycle for our Turing GPUs.","RTX is also opening up new market segment opportunities such as rendering and studio for freelance creatives. In November, V-ray Arnold and Blender software renderers began shipping with RTX technology. These joined our leading creative and design applications including Premier Pro, Dimension, SolidWorks, CATIA and Maya.","With RTX, these applications enable enhanced creativity and notable productivity gains. In Blender Cycles for example, real-time rendering performance is boosted 4x versus a CPU. RTX is now supported by more than 40 leading creative and design applications reaching a combined user base of over 40 million.","Finally, turning to automotive. Revenue was $163 million, flat from a year ago and up 1% sequentially. Full year revenue reached a record $700 million, up 9% year-on-year. During the quarter, we announced DRIVE, AGX Orin, the next-generation platform for autonomous vehicles and robots, powered by our new Orin SoC and delivering nearly 7x the performance of the previous generation Xavier SoC. The platform scales from level two plus AI-assisted driving to level five fully driverless operation. Orin is software-defined and compatible, with Xavier allowing developers to leverage their investment across multiple product generations.","Moving to the rest of the P&L. Q4 GAAP gross margins was 64.9% and non-GAAP was 65.4%, up sequentially, largely reflecting higher contribution of data center products. Q4 GAAP operating expenses were $1.02 billion and non-GAAP operating expenses were $810 million, up 12% and 7% year-on-year respectively. Q4 GAAP EPS was $1.53, up 66% from a year earlier. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.89, up 136% from a year ago. Q4 cash from operations was $1.46 billion. Fiscal year 2020 cash flow from operations was a record $4.76 billion.","With that, let me turn the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. The outlook does not include any contribution from the pending acquisition of Mellanox. We are engaged and progressing with China on the regulatory approval and believe the acquisition will likely close in the first part of calendar 2020.","Before we get to the new -- the numbers let me comment on the impact of the coronavirus. While it is still early and the ultimate effect is difficult to estimate, we have reduced our Q1 revenue outlook by $100 million to account for the potential impact. We expect revenue to be $3 billion plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 65% and 65.4% respectively plus or minus 50 basis points.","GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.05 billion and $835 million respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP OI&E are both expected to be income of approximately $25 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 9% plus or minus 1% excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $150 million to $170 million. Further, financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on the IR website. In closing, let me highlight an upcoming event for the financial community. We will be at the Morgan Stanley Technology Media and Telecom Conference on March 2nd in San Francisco.","With that, we will now open the call for questions. Operator, will you please poll for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.","Toshiya Hari","Hi guys. Thanks very much for the question. I guess on data center Colette or Jensen, can you speak to some of the areas that drove the upside in the quarter? You talked about inference in both the T4 and the V100 having record quarters, but relative to your internal expectations. What were some of the businesses that drove the upside and if you can also speak to the breadth of your customer profile today relative to a couple of years ago, how that's expanded. That would be helpful as well. Thank you.","Jensen Huang","Yes. Toshiya thanks a lot for your question. The primary driver for our growth is AI. There are four fundamental dynamics. The first is that the AI models that are being created are achieving breakthroughs and quite amazing breakthroughs in fact in natural language understanding, in conversational AI and recommendation systems.","And you know this, but for the others in the audience, recommendation systems are essentially the engine of the Internet today. And the reason for that is because there are so many items in the world, whether it's a store or whether it's content or websites or information you are querying, there are hundreds of billions, trillions and depending on how you count it hundreds of trillions of items in the world.","And there are billions of people each with their own characteristics and there are countless contexts. And between the items the people the users and the various contexts that we're in location and what you're looking for and weather or what's happening in the environment, those kind of contexts affects the search query that -- the answer they provide you.","The recommendation system is just foundational now to search. And some people have said this is the end of search in the beginning and the era of recommendation systems. Work is being done everywhere around the world in advancing recommendation systems. And very first time over the last year, it's been able to be done in deep learning.","And so the first thing is just the breakthroughs in AI. The second is production AI which means that whereas, we had significant and we continue to have significant opportunities in training because the model is getting larger and there are more of them we're seeing a lot of these models going into production and that business is called inference.","Inference as Colette mentioned, grew 4 times year-over-year. It's a substantial part of our business now. But one of the interesting statistics is TensorRT 7, the entire TensorRT download this year was about 500,000, a doubling over a year ago. What most people don't understand about Inference is, it's an incredibly complex computational problem, but it's an enormously complex software problem. And so, the second dynamic is moving from training or growing from training and models going into production called Inference.","The third is the growth not just in hyperscale anymore, but in public cloud and in vertical industries. Public cloud because of thousands of AI start-ups that are now developing AI software in the cloud. And the OpEx model works much better for them as they're younger. When they become larger they could decide to build their own data center infrastructure on-prem, but the thousands of start-ups start their lives in the cloud.","We're also seeing really great success in verticals. One of the most exciting vertical is logistics, logistics, retail, warehousing. We announced I think this quarter or last -- end of last quarter USPS, American Express, Walmart just large companies who have enormous amounts of data that they're trying to do data analytics on and do predictive analytics on.","And so the third dynamic is the growth in -- beyond hyperscale and public cloud as well as vertical industries. And then the last dynamic is being talked about a lot and this is really, really exciting and it's called Edge AI. We used to call it industries and AI where the action is. But the industries now calls Edge AI. We're seeing a lot of excitement there.","And the reason for that is, you need to have low latency, inference. You might not be able to stream data all the way to the cloud for cost reasons or data sovereignty reasons and you need the response time. And so those four dynamics around AI really drove our growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.","Joe Moore","Great. Just following up on that. As you look back at the last 12 months and the deceleration that you saw in your HPC cloud business now that you have the perspective of seeing what's driving the rebound any thoughts on what drove it to slow down in the first place? Was it just digestion? Was it sort of a handoff from image recognition to these newer applications that you just talked about? Just help us what happened there? And I guess as it pertains to the future do we think of this as a business that will have that kind of lumpiness to it?","Jensen Huang","Yes. That's a really good question. In fact if you look backwards now we have the benefit of history. The deep recommendation systems, the natural language understanding breakthroughs, the conversational AI breakthroughs, all happened in this last year. And the velocity by which the industry captured the benefits here and continue to evolve and advance from these what so-called transformer models was really quite incredible. And so the all of a sudden the number of breakthroughs in AI has just grown tremendously and these models have grown tremendously.","Just this last week Microsoft announced that they've trained a neural net model in collaboration with the work that we did we call Megatron, increased the size's of the model from 7.5 billion parameters to 17.5 billion parameters. And the accuracy of their natural language understanding has just -- has really been boosted. And so the models are -- AI is finding really fantastic breakthroughs and models are getting bigger and there are more of them.","And when you look back and look at when these breakthroughs happened it essentially happened this last year. The second, we've been working on inference for some time. And until this last year very few of those inference models went into production. And now we have deep learning models across all of the hyperscalers in production. And this last year we saw really great growth in inference.","The third dynamic is public clouds. All these AI startups that are being started all over the world there's about 6,000 of them, they're starting to develop and be able to put their models into production. And with the scale out of AWS we now have T4s in every single geography. So the combination of the availability of our GPUs in the cloud and the startups and vertical industries deploying their AI models into production the combination of all that just kind of came together. And all of that happened this last year. And as a result we had record sales of V100s and T4s. And so we're quite excited with the developments and it's all really powered by AI.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities.","Vivek Arya","Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on returning the business back to the strong growth. Jensen, I wanted to ask about how you are positioned from a supply perspective for this coming year? Your main foundry is running pretty tight. How will you be able to support the 20% or so growth here that many investors are looking for? If you could just give us some commentary on how you're positioned from a supply perspective that will be very helpful.","Jensen Huang","Well I think we're in pretty good shape on supply. We surely won't have ample supply. It is true that the industry is tight and the combination of supporting multiple processes, multiple fabs across our partner TSMC. We've got a lot of different factories and a lot of different -- several different nodes of process qualified. I think we're in good shape. And so we just have to watch it closely. And we're working very closely with all of our customers and forecasting. And of course that gives us better visibility as well and -- but all of us have to do a better job forecasting and we're working very closely between our customers and our foundry partner TSMC.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS.","Timothy Arcuri","Hi. Thanks. Colette, I'm wondering if you can give us -- in data center if you can give us a little idea of what the mix was between industries and hyperscale? I think last quarter hyperscale was a little bit less than 50%. Can you give us maybe the mix or how much it was up something like that? Thanks.","Colette Kress","Yes. Tim thanks for the question. Similar to what we had seen last quarter with all things growing as we moved into this quarter growth in terms of the hyperscales, continued expansion in terms of those vertical industries and even in the cloud instances, we're still looking at around the same split of 50-50 between our hyperscales and our vertical industries and maybe a little bit tad below 50 in terms of our total overall hyperscales.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.","Aaron Rakers","Yeah. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the results. When I look at the numbers the growth on an absolute basis sequentially in data center was almost 2x or north of 2x what we've seen in the past as far as the absolute sequential change. Through the course of this quarter you were pretty clear that you would expect to see an acceleration of growth in the December quarter.","I'm just curious of how you think about that going into the April quarter? And how we should think about that growth rate through the course of this year? If you can give us any kind of framework.","And Jensen just curious I mean as you think about the bigger picture where do you think we stand from an industry perspective today in terms of the amount or the attach rate of GPUs is for acceleration in the server market? And where do you think that might be looking out over the next three years or so? Thank you.","Jensen Huang","Thanks Aaron. Colette do you want to go first?","Colette Kress","Sure. When we think about going into Q1 and our data center overall growth, we do expect to see continued growth both going into Q1. We believe our visibility still remain positive quite well and we're expecting that as we move into it and go forward.","Jensen Huang","Yes. Aaron I believe that every query on the Internet will be accelerated someday. And at the very core of it most -- almost all queries will have some natural language understanding component to it. Almost all queries will have to sort through and make a recommendation from the trillions of possibilities filter it down and recommend a handful of recommended answers to your queries.","Whether it's shopping or movies or just asking locations or even asking a question, the number of the possibilities of all the answers versus what is best answer is -- needs to be filtered down. And that filtering process is called recommendation. That recommendation system is really complex and deep learning is going to be involved in all that. That's the first thing. I believe that every query will be accelerated.","The second is as you know CPU scaling has really slowed and there's just no two ways about it. It's not a marketing thing. It's a physics thing. And the ability for CPUs to continue to scale without increasing cost or increasing power has ended. And it's called the end of Dennard scaling. And so there has to be another approach.","The combination of the emergence of deep learning and the use of artificial intelligence and the amount of computation that's necessary to for every single query, but the benefit that comes along with that and the end of Dennard scaling suggests that there needs to be another approach and we believe that approach is acceleration.","Now, our approach for acceleration is fundamentally different than an accelerator. Notice we never say accelerator, we say accelerated computing. And the reason for that is because we believe that a software-defined data center will have all kinds of different AIs. The AIs will continue to evolve the models will continue to evolve and get larger and a software-defined data center needs to be programmable. It is one of the reasons why we've been so successful.","And if you go back and think about all the questions that have been asked of me over the last three or four years around this area the consistency of the answer has to do with the programmability of architecture, the richness of the software, the difficulties of the compilers, the ever-growing size of the models, the diversity of the models, and the advances that these models are creating. And so we're seeing the beginning of a new computing era.","A fixed function accelerator is simply not the right answer. And so we believe that the future is going to be accelerated. It's going to require an accelerated computing platform and software richness is really vital so that these data centers could be software defined.","And so I think that we're in the early innings, the early innings, very, very early innings of this new future. And I think that accelerated computing is going to become more and more important.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen.","Matt Ramsay","Thank you very much. Good afternoon and obviously congratulations on the data center success. I wanted to ask a little bit Colette about the -- you took $100 million out for coronavirus, and I wanted to ask a little bit about how you got to that number. Really two pieces. One, if you could remind us, maybe in terms of units or revenue how -- what percentage of your gaming business is within China? And as you look at that $100 million that you put out of the guidance, are you thinking about that from a demand disruption perspective? Or are you thinking about it from something in the supply chain that might limit your sales? Thank you.","Colette Kress","Sure. Thanks for the question Matt. So, it's really still quite early in terms of trying to figure out what the impact from the overall coronavirus maybe. So, we're not necessarily precise in terms of our estimate. Yes, our estimates are split between an impact possibly on gaming and data center, and split pretty much equally. The $100 million also reflects what may be supply challenges or maybe overall demand. But we're still looking at those to get a better understanding where we think that might be.","In terms of our business and our business makeup, yes, our overall China business for gaming is an important piece. We have about 30% of our overall China gaming as a percentage of our overall gaming business. For data center, it moves quite a bit. They are a very important market for us, but it moves from quarter-to-quarter just based on the overall end customer mix as well as the system builders that they may choose. So, it's a little harder to determine.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur","Good afternoon and congratulations on the strong results and guidance. On gaming -- yeah, no problem. Good to see the recent launch of your GeForce NOW service. But on the partnership with Tencent on cloud gaming, seems like Tencent should have a smoother transition to the cloud model. They are the largest gaming company in the world, so they own many of the games. They also have their own data center infrastructure already in place. But how is the NVIDIA team going to be supporting this partnership? Is it going to be deal your GeForce NOW hardware framework? Or will you just be supporting them with your standalone GPU products? And when do you expect the service to go mainstream?","Jensen Huang","Let's see. Tencent is the world's largest publisher. China represents about a third of the world's gaming and transitioning to the cloud is going to be a long-term journey. And the reason for that is because Internet connection is not consistent throughout the entire market. And a lot of application still needs to be onboarded and we're working very closely with them. We're super enthusiastic about it. If we're successful long term, we're talking about an extra one billion gamers that we might be able to reach. And so, I think that this is an exciting opportunity just the long-term journey.","Now here in the West, we've had a lot more opportunity to refine the connections around the world and working through the beta centers, the local hubs as well as people's WiFi routers at home. And so, we've been in data for quite some time as you know. And here at West our platform is open. And we have several hundred games now, and we're in the process of onboarding another 1,500 games. We're the only cloud platform that's based on Windows, and allows us to be able to bring PC games to the cloud.","And so the reach is -- we've had more experience here in the West with reach and we've had -- we obviously have a lot more games that we can onboard. But I'm super enthusiastic about the partnership we have with Tencent. Overall, our GeForce NOW, you guys saw the launch, the reception has been fantastic. The reviews have been fantastic.","Our strategy has three components. There's the GeForce NOW service that we provide ourselves. We also have GeForce NOW alliances with telcos around the world to reach the regions around the world that we don't have a presence in. And that is going super well, and I'm excited about that. And then lastly, partnerships with large publishers, for example like Tencent. And we offer them our platform of course and a great deal of software and just a lot of engineering that has to be done in collaboration to refine the service.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore.","C.J. Muse","Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess a question on the gaming side. If I look at your overall revenue guide, it would seem to suggest that you're looking for typically, I guess, better seasonal trends into April. And I guess can you speak to that?","And then how are you seeing desktop gaming demand with recreation content becoming more available? How should we think about the growth trajectory through 2020? And then just really as a modeling question as part of gaming. With notebook now is third of the revenues, how should we think about kind of the seasonality going into April and July for that part of your business? Thank you.","Jensen Huang","Yes. So C.J., I want to go first and then Colette is going take it home here. So the first part of it is this, our gaming business has at the end -- I'm sorry. Okay. Our gaming business the end market demand is really terrific. It's really healthy. It's been healthy throughout the whole year. And it's pretty clear that RTX is doing fantastic. And it's very -- it's super clear now that ray tracing is the most important new feature of next-generation graphics. We have 30 -- over 30 games that have been announced, 11 games or so that have been shipped. The pipeline of ray tracing games that are going to be coming out is just really, really exciting.","The second factor -- and one more thing about RTX, we finally have taken RTX down to $299. So it's now at the sweet spot of gaming. And so RTX is doing fantastic. The sell-through is fantastic all over the world.","The second part of our business that is changing in gaming is the amount of notebook sales and the success of Nintendo Switch has really changed the profile of our overall gaming business. Our notebook business as Colette mentioned earlier, has seen double-digit growth for eight consecutive quarters and this is unquestionably a new gaming category. Like it's a new game console. This is going to be the largest game console in the world I believe. And the reason for that is because there are more people with laptops than there are of any other device.","And so the fact that we've been able to get RTX into a thin and light notebook, a thin and light notebook is really a breakthrough. And it's one of the reasons why we're seeing such great success in notebook.","Between the notebook business and our Nintendo Switch business the profile of gaming overall has changed and has become more seasonal. It's more seasonal, because devices systems like notebooks and Switch are built largely in two quarters Q2 and Q3. And they build largely in Q2 and Q3, because it takes a while to build them and ship them and put them into the hubs around the world. And they tend to build it ahead of the holiday season.","And so that's one of the reasons why Q3 will tend to be larger and Q4 will tend to be more seasonal and Q1 will tend to be more seasonal than the past. But the end demand is fantastic. RTX is doing great. And part of it is just a result of the success of our notebooks. I'm going to hand it over to Colette.","Colette Kress","Yeah. So with that from a background and you think about all those different components that are within gaming the notebook, the overall Switch and of course all of the ray tracing that we have in terms of desktop, our normal seasonality as we look at Q1 for gaming with all those three pieces is usually sequentially down from Q4 sequentially down Q4 to Q1. This year the outlook assumes it will probably be a little bit more pronounced due to the coronavirus. So, in total, we're probably looking at Q1 to be in the low double-digit sequential decline in gaming.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik with Citi.","Atif Malik","Hi. Thank you for taking my question. And good job on results and guide. On the same topic coronavirus. Colette, I'm a bit surprised that the guidance -- the range on the guidance is not wider versus historic. Can you just talk about why not widen the range? And what went into that $100 million hit from the coronavirus?","Colette Kress","So Atif, thanks for the question. Again, it's still very early regarding the coronavirus. Our thoughts are out with both the employees the families and others that are in China. So our discussions both with our supply chain that is very prominent in the overall Asia region, as well as our overall AIC makers, as well as our customers is as about as timely as we can be. And that went into our discussion and our thoughts on the overall guidance that we gave into our $100 million. We'll just have to see how the quarter comes through and we'll discuss more when we get to it. But at this time that was our best estimate at this time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of William Stein with SunTrust.","William Stein","Great. Thanks for taking my question. Jensen, I'd love to hear your thoughts as to how you anticipate the inference market playing out. Historically NVIDIA's had essentially all of the training market and little of the inference market in the last 1.5 years or so. I think that's changed where you've done much better in inference. Now you have the T4 in the cloud, you have EGX at the edge. And you have Jetson, I think is what it's called at the endpoint device. How do you anticipate that market for inference developing across those various positions? And how are you aligning your portfolio for that growth?","Jensen Huang","Yeah. Thanks a lot, Will. Let's see I think the -- historically inference has been a small part of our business because AI was still being developed. Deep learning AI is not -- historical AI, classical machine learning weren't particularly suited for GPUs and weren't particularly suited for acceleration. It wasn't until deep learning came along that the amount of computation necessary is just extraordinary.","And the second factor is the type of AI models that were developed. Eventually the type of models related to natural language understanding and conversational AI and recommendation systems these require instantaneous response. The faster the answer, the more likely someone is going to click on the answer.","And so you know that latency matters a great deal and it's measurable. The effect on the business is directly measurable. And so for conversational AI, for example, we've been able to reduce the latency of the entire pipeline from speech recognition to the language processing to -- for example fix the errors and such come up with a recommendation to text to speech to the voice synthesis. That entire pipeline could take several seconds.","We run it so fast that it's possible now for us to process the entire pipeline within a couple of 100 to 300 milliseconds. That is in the realm of interactive conversation. Beyond that it's just simply too slow. And so the combination of AI models that are large and complex that are moving to inference moving to production. And then secondarily, conversational AI and latency sensitive models and applications where our GPUs are essential now moving forward, I think you're going to see a lot more opportunities for us in inference.","The way to think about that long-term is acceleration is essential because of end of Dennard scaling. Process technology is going to demand that we compute in a different way. And the way that AI has evolved and deep learning, it suggests that acceleration on GPUs is just a really phenomenal approach.","Data centers are going to have to be software-defined. And I think as I mentioned, I think I mentioned earlier to another question, I believe that in the future the data center will all be accelerated. It will be all running AI models and it will be software defined and will be programmable and having an accelerated computing platform is essential.","As you move out to the edge, it really depends on whether your platform is software-defined whether it has to be programmable or whether it's fix functioned. There are many, many devices where the inference work is very specific. It could be something as simple as detecting changes in temperature or changes in sound or detecting motion. Those type of inference models are \u2013 could still be based on deep learning. It's function-specific. You don't have to change it very often, and you're running one or two models at any given point in time. And so those devices are going to be incredibly cost-effective. I believe those AI chips, you're going to have AI chips that are $0.50, $1 and you're just going to put it into something and it's going to be doing magical detections.","The type of platforms that we're in, such as self-driving cars and robotics, the software is so complicated and there's so much evolution to come yet and it's going to constantly get better. Those software-defined platforms are really the ideal targets for us. And so we call it AI at the edge, edge computing devices. One of the edge computing devices, I'm very excited about is, what people call mobile edge or basically 5G telco edge. That data center will be programmable. We recently announced that we partnered with Ericsson and we're going to be accelerating the 5G stack. And so that needs to be a software-defined data center. It runs all kinds of applications, including 5G. And those applications are going to be \u2013 those opportunities are fantastic for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.","Mark Lipacis","Thanks for taking my question. Jensen, I guess, I had a question about your \u2013 how you think about the sustainability of your market position in the data center. And I guess in my simplistic view about 12 years ago you made out a consensus call to invest in CUDA software distribute it to universities. Neural networking took off and you were the de facto standard and here we are right now. And for me what's interesting to hear is that the demand that you're seeing today for your products is from markets that's just developed within the last year. And my question is like, how do you think about your investment your R&D investment strategy to make sure that you are staying way ahead of the market of the competition and even your customers who are investing in these markets too? Thank you.","Jensen Huang","Yeah. Thanks, Mark. Our company has to live 10 years ahead of the market. And so we have to imagine where the world is going to be in 10 years time, in five years time and work our way backwards. Now, our company is focused on one singular thing. The simplicity of it is incredible. And that one singular thing is accelerated computing. Accelerated computing and accelerated computing is all about the architecture of course. It's about the complicated systems that we're in, because throughput is high.","When our acceleration we can \u2013 when we can compute 10, 20, 50, 100 times faster than the CPU, all of a sudden everything becomes a bottleneck. Memory's a bottleneck, networking's a bottleneck, storage is a bottleneck, everything is a bottleneck. And so we have to be \u2013 NVIDIA has to be a supremely good system designer. But the complexity of our stack which is the software stack above it is really where the investments over the course of the last \u2013 some 29 years now has really paid off.","NVIDIA frankly has been an accelerated computing company since the day it was born. And so we \u2013 our company is constantly trying to expand the number of applications that we can accelerate. Of course, computer graphics was an original one and we're reinventing it with real-time ray tracing. We have rendering, which is a brand-new application that we're making great progress in.","We just talked \u2013 I just mentioned 5G acceleration. Recently, we announced genomics computing. And so those are new applications that are really important to the future of computing. In the area of artificial intelligence, from image recognition to natural language understanding, to conversation, to recommendation systems, to robotics and animation, the number of applications that we're going to accelerate in the field of AI is really, really broad. And each one of them are making tremendous progress and getting more and more complex. And so the question about the sustainability of our company really comes down to two dimensions.","Let's assume for the fact \u2013 let's assume for now that `accelerated computing is the path forward and we surely believe so. And there's a lot of evidence from the laws of physics to the laws of computer science that would suggest that accelerated computing is the right path forward. But this really basically comes down to two dimensions. One dimension is, are we continuing to expand? Are we continuing to expand the number of applications that we can accelerate? Whether it's AI or computer graphics or genomics or 5G for example.","And then the number -- and then the second is those applications, are they getting more impactful and adopted by the ecosystem, the industry? And are they continuing to be more complex? Those dimensions, the number of applications and the impact of those applications and the evolution the growth of complexity of those applications, if those dynamics continue to grow, then I think we're going to do a good job. We're going to sustain. And so -- and I think when I spelled it out that way, it's basically the equation of growth of our company. I think it's fairly clear that the opportunities are fairly exciting ahead.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays.","Blayne Curtis","Thanks for squeezing me in. Jensen, I just wanted to ask you on the auto side. I think at least one of your customers might have slowed out their program. Just kind of curious as you look out the next couple of years, the challenges if the OEM is moving slower? And then just any perspective on the regulatory side has anything changed there would be helpful? Thanks.","Jensen Huang","I think that the automotive industry is struggling, but for all of the reasons that everybody knows. However, the enthusiasm to redefine and reinvent their business model has never been greater. Every single one of them, every single one of them would know now and they surely -- they've known for some time and autonomous capabilities is really the vehicle to do that. They need to be tech companies. Every car company wants to be a tech company. They need to be a tech company. Every car company needs to be software-defined. And the platform by which to do so is an electric vehicle with autonomous autopilot capability. That car has to be software-defined. And this is their future and they're racing to get there.","And so although the automotive industry is struggling in near term, their opportunity has never been better in my opinion. The future of AV is more important than ever. The opportunity is very real. The benefits of autonomous is for whether it's safety, whether it's utility, whether it's cost reduction and productivity has never been more clear. And so, I think that I'm as enthusiastic as ever about the autonomous vehicles and the projects that we're working on are moving ahead. And so the near-term challenges of the automotive industry or whatever sales slowdown in China that they're experiencing, I feel badly about that. But the industry is as clearheaded about the importance of AV as ever.","Operator","I will now turn the call back over to Jensen for any closing remarks.","Jensen Huang","We had an excellent quarter with strong demand for NVIDIA RTX graphics and NVIDIA AI platforms and record data center revenue. NVIDIA RTX is reinventing computer graphics and the market's response is excellent, driving a powerful upgrade cycle in both gaming and professional graphics, while opening whole new opportunities for us to serve the huge community of independent creative workers and social content creators and new markets in rendering and cloud gaming.","Our data center business is enjoying a new wave of growth powered by three key trends in AI natural language understanding, conversational AI, deep recommenders are changing the way people interact with the Internet. The public cloud demand for AI is growing rapidly. And as AI shifts from development to production, our inference business is gaining momentum. We'll be talking a lot more about these key trends and much more at next month's GTC Conference in San Jose. Come join me. You won't be disappointed.

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Rob Csongor. Sir, you may begin your conference.","Rob Csongor","Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to NVIDIA's Conference Call on the Annual and Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2013 Results. With me on the call today from NVIDIA are Jen-Hsun Huang, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Burns, Interim Chief Financial Officer. After our prepared remarks, we will open up the call to a question-and-answer session. Please limit yourself to one initial question with one follow-up.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that today's call is being webcast live on NVIDIA's Investor Relations website and is also being recorded. A replay of the conference call will be available via telephone until February 28, 2013, and the webcast will be available for replay until our conference call to discuss our financial results for our first quarter of fiscal 2014.

For a discussion of factors that could affect our future financial results and business, please refer to the disclosure in today's earnings release, our Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended October 28, 2012, and the reports we may file from time to time on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","All our statements are made as of today, February 13, 2013, based on information available to us as of today and except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements. Unless otherwise noted, all references to market research and market share numbers throughout the call come from Mercury Research or Jon Peddie Research. During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our financial release which is posted on our website.","With that let's begin. We are pleased to report a record year for the company. Despite significant headwinds, we achieved record annual revenues and gross margins for fiscal year 2013. Excluding chipset revenue, which we exited, we grew our GPU business 8% last year and for the third consecutive year. We increased overall GPU market share from 53% to 65% and our notebook share by almost 20 percentage points from 47% to 66%.","Tegra, Tesla, and notebook GPUs all achieved record revenue. We invested in new growth products that are now sampling, including Tegra 4, i500 4G LTE modem, Project Shield, [NGRID], while controlling OpEx at target for the year. This year we transitioned Kepler across our GPU businesses. Gaming was a key area to benefit. Massively multiplayer games or MMOs continued to drive a robust PC gaming market. Worldwide MMO revenues grew 21% last year to $13 billion according to market research firm Newzoo. And GeForce is the gamers choice of GPU by a margin of almost 2:1 according to gamers on steam.","Our notebook share is a near a record high. Kepler is also starting to ship into Quadro with revenues up 10% this quarter. With Tesla, we are leveraging GPUs beyond graphics into massively parallel processing in supercomputers. Just three years after we entered the market, 50 of the world's top 500 fastest computers are now powered by Nvidia GPUs, including the fastest and most energy efficient. We introduced Nvidia GRID visual computing appliances. GRID is a first of its kind graphics system that serves graphics intensive applications to many concurrent users at once.","One of the major applications is cloud gaming. More than a dozen cloud gaming trials are up and running around the world and others will be announced by more TELCOs as the year progresses. At CES, we announced Tegra 4, the world's fastest mobile processor. It is the first four plus one quad-core A15 processor with an extra energy saving core and 72 graphics cores, compared with Tegra 3\u2019s 12 cores. It delivers the world\u2019s fastest web browsing performance and new, always-on, high dynamic range computational photography. At this point in time, we already have more design wins with Tegra 4 than we had in total with Tegra 3.","We see significant new growth opportunities in the LTE connected device market which is projected to be 150 million units in 2013 and growing at 50% a year. We are now sampling our i500 4G LTE multi-band multi-mode voice and data modem. More efficient and 40% the size of conventional modems, i500 delivers four times the processing capability of its predecessor. This is the first result of our Icera acquisition. Icera is the first company to successfully create and commercialize a software-defined radio modem and has been building modems since 2006.","And we announced Project Shield, an Nvidia branded open platform gaming device. A pure Android device connected to the Google Play store and Tegra Zone, Project Shield is able to play any Android application and game and can also stream PC games from a nearby GeForce GTX PC. Powered by a Tegra 4 processor, Project Shield integrates a five inch retinal display, a console grade game controller and a first mobile tuned port bass reflex speakers. We believe Shield will be attractive to modern gamers who want to play on open platforms and have great gaming experiences, while untethered to their TVs or PCs. Shield will enhance the strategic position of Tegra. Besides highlighting the capabilities of Tegra, Shield will attract great games to Tegra Zone which can then be enjoyed on every Tegra powered device. Tegra Zone has already been downloaded 6 million times.","Looking forward, our company is shifting gears to accelerate. Our GPU business remains strong while we extend our visual computing technology leadership. Tegra 4 is ramping into production for mobile devices this year while growing into embedded devices such as cars and gaming devices. We will engage the LTE connected devices market aggressively this year and we will add new system products incorporating our processors and software, the Nvidia Grid graphics appliances and Shield Android gaming device. We are excited by the investments we\u2019re making into these very large markets where our expertise in visual computing can make any contributions.","With that, let me turn the call over to Karen.","Karen Burns","Thanks Rob. Nvidia had record revenue for the year of $4.3 billion, up 7% from fiscal 2012. At the start of the year, we set out a number of financial objectives. It\u2019s satisfying to note that we achieved many of them. Among these goals were the following. Game share and our GPU business. Driven by the introduction of our new Kepler architecture, we gained share in both desktop and notebook and delivered record revenue for our notebook products. Gross Tegra revenue at least 50%. Revenue for Tegra products sold into smartphones and tablets increased by $181 million to a record $541 million, up 50% year on year.","Grow Quadro and Tesla revenue. Revenue for Tesla products increased 37% year on year as we shipped our first Kepler products, Tesla K10 in Q3 and Tesla K20 in Q4. Quadro revenue was down roughly 6% year on year. In October we shipped Quadro K5000, our first Kepler based Quadro product in limited volume. This year, we will launch Kepler for Quadro in volume top to bottom into the professional market. We expect Kepler for both Quadro and Tesla to do very well.","Exit the year with gross margin of approximately 52%. We exceeded our targeted exiting Q4 with a gross margin of 52.9% and non-GAAP of 53.2%. We had record gross margin for the full year with GAAP gross margin at 52%, up 60 basis points from the previous year and non-GAAP gross margin up 52.3%, up 40 basis points. Manage our OpEx investments at approximately $1.56 billion on a GAAP basis and $1.4 billion for GAAP OpEx was $1.58 billion, up $20 million from our original expectations. This was due to a $20 million expense for a corporate donation made in the second quarter.","On a non-GAAP basis, which excluded this $20 million charge as well as stock-based compensation and acquisition related cost, we successfully managed to our target of $1.4 billion. Before moving on, I would like to provide more background on OpEx as we continue to invest in our key growth strategy.","Our OpEx is comprised primarily of employee related costs. This includes compensation and benefits as well as other related expenses and supporting costs, largely infrastructure for facilities and IT equipment. GAAP and non-GAAP OpEx were both at 12% from fiscal 2012. Also the year-on-year OpEx increase for GAAP, 86% related to the these employee related costs. 12% to contribution expense or corporate donation, and 2% related to all other costs. With non-GAAP OpEx excluding the contribution expense as well as stock-based comp an acquisition related costs which were flat year-over-year, 98% of the increase came from employee and supporting infrastructure cost. The remaining 2% related to all other operating expenses.","We are investing in the new products and major growth opportunities Rob talked about. i500, Project Grey, N Shield and Nvidia GRID. We added about 840 new staff in fiscal 2013, giving us a total of nearly 8000 employees at the end of the year. Of our new staff, 88% joined our engineering team, 12% joined our operations and SG&A organization. We also invested in an annual pay increase for existing employees and began a 410(k) match in Q4. We believe our focused investment and our growth strategies and our core businesses are critical to our future growth.","Now on to revenue by business segment for the full fiscal year. Beginning this quarter, we changed our financial reporting segments to reflect the way we are now managing our business. We now have two primary reporting segments. GPU and Tegra processor. This new segmentation recognizes that we have two fundamental technologies, GPUs and SSDs, which we leverage across several markets under different brands. Revenue for the GPU business, which includes GeForce, Quadro and Tesla based GPUs, was at 2% year-on-year.","This increase was achieved despite $173 million decline in chipset products which we discontinued. Excluding chipset product revenue, our GPU business grew 8%, representing our third consecutive year of GPU growth. Revenue for the Tegra processor business was up almost 30% from the previous year. Driven by the 50% increase in revenue for Tegra's sales shipped into smartphones and tablets including Win RT devices referenced earlier. Full details of our new reporting segment as well as historical revenue segmentation can be found in my CFO commentary posted on our website.","Now I would like to talk briefly about the fourth quarter. Apart from our tax rate, Q4 results were in line with our expectations at the beginning of the quarter. Revenue was $1.11 billion, down 8% sequentially and up 16% year-on-year. Gross remained at record levels. GAAP gross margin was 52.9%, non-GAAP was 53.2%. Operating expenses were $402 million for GAAP and $360 million for non-GAAP. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were both below our expectations at roughly 7% in Q4, as we benefited from the extension of the U.S. research tax credit. Extension of this credit was enacted during our fourth quarter, bringing our effective tax rate down for the year to roughly 15% for GAAP and non-GAAP, in line with our outlook with the inclusion of this credit.","Turning to the balance sheet. Our position remained strong in the quarter and throughout the year. Cash increased each quarter reaching a record $3.73 billion at Q4, up 9% sequentially and up 19% on fiscal 2012. In Q4, we initiated quarterly cash dividends and extended our share repurchase program. We returned $147 million of cash to shareholders in the quarter, with $100 million of stock repurchased and $47 million in dividends paid.","Accounts receivable at Q4 was up $9 million over the prior quarter on slightly less shipment linearity. Conversely, inventory was down $9 million from the prior quarter at $420 million.","Regarding the first quarter outlook for fiscal 2014, our expectations for GAAP are as follows. Revenue is expected to be $940 million, plus or minus 2%. We expect revenue for the first quarter to be less in Q4, reflecting lower GPU sales in line with expectations for the PC industry and lower Tegra sales as customer devices based on Tegra 3 ramp down ahead of Tegra 4 production.","We expect gross margin of approximately 52.9%, flat from Q4, OpEx of approximately $430 million and a tax rate of approximately 16% plus or minus 1%. We expect the same for the annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2014.","For non-GAAP, we expect the following differences from a GAAP outlook. Gross margin of approximately 53.2%, flat from Q4, and OpEx of approximately $395 million. This excludes stock-based compensation and certain charges related to acquisitions an aggregate of approximately $35 million. The increase in OpEx for Q1 over the fourth quarter is primarily due to the employee related costs, including planned hiring for our key growth businesses with the addition of a large FICA tax reset that occurs each first quarter.","Depreciation and amortization are expected to be in the range of $59 million to $61 million and capital expenditures of $55 million to $65 million.","Diluted shares are expected to be approximately $619 million. Lastly, we will pay our next quarterly cash dividend of $0.075 per share in the first quarter fiscal 2014. On an annual basis, this is equivalent to $0.30 per share and approximates an annual yield of about 2.4% based on yesterday\u2019s closing price of $12.43.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator instructions). And your first question does come from Betsy Van Hees Wedbush Securities.","Betsy Van Hees \u2013 Wedbush Securities","I was wondering if you could help us understand in terms of the guidance from the revenue which business segment. Is it going to be equally down as a percentage basis? Or is one going to be down more than the other in any of your reporting segments?","Karen Burns","So as I mentioned, we expect that our GPU business will be down very much in line with the PC industry and as you know Intel, AMD and other companies have already disclosed. And then the other component will be Tegra related which will be larger and that again is the transition effect from T3 to Tegra 4.","Betsy Van Hees \u2013 Wedbush Securities","Okay. Thanks very much. And so my follow up question has to do with OpEx. So, not this pretty big jump up in the GAAP OpEx, $430 million from your $402 million and then your $384 million in the prior quarter. So as we\u2019re looking at the July and October, are we going to see OpEx sort of flattening out, or are we going to continue to have these incremental increases. And I was wondering if you could help us a little bit with the OpEx?","Karen Burns","Sure. So as you saw last year, we had a similar jump and we have it every first quarter. And as I explained, it's really the FICA tax reset that hits us pretty hard in the first quarter. And just like in fiscal 2013, OpEx levels are up for the rest of the year. So we expect a similar type of impact this year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Stephen Eliscu with UBS.","Stephen Eliscu \u2013 UBS","Last year, just more specifically you gave us full year guidance for both OpEx and the percentage growth on Tegra, which was very helpful in terms of thinking about where Nvidia was coming around in fiscal '13. Slide 12 in your presentation talks about your growth drivers. Can you give us a sense as to what Tegra will grow the OpEx number and just review some of those other growth drivers. So we have a sense as to where you will end out for the full year.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, Steve, first of all thank you. I think we haven\u2019t decided yet whether to guide to full year or not. At the moment we have decided to guide a quarter out. And to tell you the truth, I am not sure how helpful it will be to all of you, that we guided the whole year. And so I think at the moment we are still thinking throughout. But some of the comments that you heard related to -- in Rob's comment, were specific Tegra. As this point we have more design wins than we had at this point with Tegra 3. You also heard we are now sampling our 4G LTE modem, and this is a pretty large market. It's still early in the modem, overall model market. It's about $150 million units large projected this year. Growing about 50% per year. The overall connected device market is probably about 1 billion -- north of a 1 billion units.","So there is a lot of LTE 4G modems that need to be shipped. And this is really the first year where we have the ability to engage the market. So we are really super excited about it. We are going to engage it very very hard. And we are sampling modems around the world now. And so those are good growth indicators for Tegra 4. In the first quarter, always we ramp down Tegra 3 as we ramp up Tegra 4. And hopefully in the future as we get more and more into lower end devices where the lifecycle is a little longer, this transitional effect would be less pronounced. But this is something we expected and is something that will transition into Tegra 4 as fast as we can.","Stephen Eliscu \u2013 UBS","And as far as feedback, as far as the guidance, the first time you provided it was probably a bit premature. But when you provided it a year ago for fiscal '13, it was extremely helpful. So we appreciate that. Just as a follow-up question here, we have heard about one of your primary competitors in the ARM processor talk about cleaning clocks of Tegra. Can you give us a sense as to, given some of the slippages that the trade press has reported with Tegra 4, that how -- to give us confidence that indeed you will be able to maintain performance leadership when we see Tegra 4 come out.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, I guess, I won't comment on his comment. And I don\u2019t know how he could possibly know the performance of Tegra 4. No one outside the company knows the performance of Tegra 4. So that\u2019s number one. I will refrain my going any further, I would like to. But with respect to Tegra 4, I guess you're just going to have to wait just a little longer, not much longer and you will see performance evaluations of Tegra 4 and I think you\u2019ll be quite pleased with them. Tegra 4 is many times higher performance than Tegra 3 in many areas and it\u2019s designed to be very high performance. There\u2019s a lot of confidence in why we can deliver that performance leadership. We said that about Tegra 3 and I think we delivered on that. This is an area that we\u2019re quite good at.","So whether it\u2019s CPU performance or GPU performance or camera performance, these are three areas that we\u2019ve made big breakthroughs on. But the two areas that are super important to our customers have to do with the battery life that we can sustain despite the fact that our performance is really high and it has to do with two very unique features. One is our four plus one energy saving core. We invented this technology and we\u2019re still the only company in the world shipping this technology and none of our competitors have this technology as of yet, although some of them are talking about it in the future.","Second is a technology that\u2019s related to modulating the backlight on a per pixel per frame level. That is something that\u2019s very unique to Tegra and it saves hundreds of Miliwatts because as you can imagine how much a display backlight consumes. It\u2019s getting higher and higher because the resolutions are getting higher and the displays are getting brighter and people expect more from their display. This is a technology that is quite unique to us and with Tegra 4 we have our second generation of that. And so we\u2019ve introduced not only performance capabilities but as well as battery saving capabilities and new functionalities like our camera. And so I\u2019m looking forward to the reviewers which ultimately the reviewers will tell us how their processor compares to ours. But based on everything we know about that, I think our position of Tegra 4 is going to be pretty extraordinary.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Caso with Susquehanna Financial Group.","Chris Caso \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group","I wonder if you could give a little more color about the Quadro business. I think in your last quarter comments you were expecting some weakness in that business and it looked like from the commentary that that grew in the quarter despite some limited quantities of the K5000. Can you talk about that a little bit and what your expectations are that for the April quarter?","Jen-Hsun Huang","I\u2019ll let Karen talk about the April quarter, but what I\u2019ll do is I\u2019ll talk to you about the dynamics of that business. We\u2019re gaining share in that business because our positioning in graphics is getting stronger than ever. Our technology leadership position is pulling ahead whereas graphics is important and it continues to be. We\u2019ve introduced new ways of rendering graphics, ray tracing and other computational graphics capabilities. We\u2019ve added simulation technology made possible by GPU computing so that you can simulate and visualize at the same time. So the capabilities that we\u2019ve provided is increasing.","We\u2019re just transitioning Kepler into our entire enterprise product line and Kepler as you know is just a wonderful GPU. It\u2019s the best GPU we\u2019ve ever built. It\u2019s the best GPU the industry has ever built and we\u2019re in the process of transitioning that into Quadro. That\u2019s been offset. There are some offsetting dynamics related to the weakness of the enterprise market in some areas around the world. There were some delays related to the next generation workstation motherboard from Intel. But I think there are people working through all those issues and I think the dynamics will play out.","Karen Burns","So to answer the second part of your question. So for this quarter Q4, we saw nice a strength in Quadro. Quarter-over-quarter Quadro was up about 11%. So as Jen-Hsun mentioned, we have great plans with Kepler and our market opportunities. For next quarter Q1, we are expecting relatively flat, as Jen-Hsun mentioned, again, there is some offsetting forces and we are being a little bit conservative perhaps. But we had a really strong quarter in Q4.","Chris Caso \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group","Okay. Great. As a follow-up, could you help us calibrate our expectations for the PC graphics business as we go through the year? I understand you don\u2019t provide full year guidance right now but what you guy had told us in the past is that your growth in PC graphics is not necessarily mirroring what's happening in the PC market. There is gaming products cycles, your own product cycles there. Could you give us some color on that and in addition, what your expectations for market share? Particularly notebook side this year, where you have gained some market share last year.","Jen-Hsun Huang","My expectation is that we will gain market share this year, or we will continue to gain market this year. With respect to PC graphics. PC graphics has two components to it, right. And I am excluding the Tesla GPU computing product line, I am excluding the workstation product line, Quadro. The PC graphics, the consumer product line has really two components. The larger component, well there is three components. So there is the OEM graphics, where the OEMs use our GPUs to differentiate their notebooks or differentiate their PCs. They add our GPUs and because it's clearly additive, and so the performance is so much better.","Now they could provide the same basic platform with a premium skew. The dynamic hasn\u2019t really changed and my guess is that an OEMs desire to create premium products will continue to be there. The larger dynamic, the larger market for PC graphics, is related to PC gaming. We have always said that PC gaming is vibrant. We have said that PC gaming is in fact growing. And the reason for that is because the PC platform is open. And it allows for a lot of innovation, not only for technology but also for business models. One of the most important new growth dynamic has to do with free to play. Free to play is really a wonderful business model. And it's a business model that doesn\u2019t serve as well a proprietary and a close platform model where it's royalty bearing.","And so these free to play platforms are fabulous for PCs. And it attracts new gamers. It costs nothing to try it and unless you really enjoy the game, that\u2019s when you really get in and buy up virtual goods. Where you can differentiate your outfit, your costume, differentiate your weapons, play new levels. And so the more you enjoy the game, the more your welcome to spend in the game. And I think that that kind of business model really tailors nicely to PCs. It's also much more associated with MMOs, massively multi-player online games. And so those dynamics continue to help drive our PC graphics business, the gaming graphics business.","So for the year, I think that these dynamics will remain true, that the MMO and the free to play business models are going to continue to drive and help grow the PC graphics business.","Operator","Your next question comes from Doug Freedman with RBC Capital Markets.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets","Jen-Hsun, when we look at the business model and the OpEx growth, last year we grew OpEx at a rate above the revenue growth and you are able to offset it with gross margin leverage. Looking forward, if I run the numbers, it looks like we are going to see about 15% OpEx growth year on year even if you hold Q1 level pretty stable for the balance of the year. How should we think about that going forward? Should we think about revenue leverage here or is there a gross margin leverage potential to hold on to the earnings column?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Doug, appreciate the question. I think first of all we have to recognize that we\u2019re investing into a once in a lifetime and very large market opportunities. We weren\u2019t the first modem company in the world, but we need a modem, a 4G LTE modem to address the very large LTE connected devices market and if we\u2019re able to deliver that, we\u2019re in a pretty special place. And the reason for that is because we have a great application processor. We have a great application processor roadmap because we have the technology and capability to sustain it. One of the most important capabilities in the mobile market is the ability to have software.","There are so many different operating systems and Microsoft does a great deal in the PC industry that\u2019s not afforded to in the rest of the embedded markets. And this is a market where in the connected device marketplace where there is Android and Chrome and WinRT and Linux and QNX and all these different operating systems require a world class system software team. And so if we have those two things and we combine it with LTE which we\u2019re now sampling. The combination of these three things could put us in a very special place. So we want to go after that large and fast growing LTE marketplace and the investments necessary. So the answer to your question is revenue leverage. We\u2019re looking forward to revenue leverage.","Now, our GPU business of course is still growing as well and there\u2019s opportunities to grow there. The last year we grew 8% if you excluded the chipset business that we exited and this year we added a new type of GPU product. We incorporated our GPUs into a first of its kind graphics appliance. It\u2019s a graphics computing system. It\u2019s dedicated to doing graphics and we described a few applications for the Nvidia GRID and I think that this type of computing appliance, this graphics appliance is \u2013 for a GPU is very similar to a router as a router is for networking chips or a network attached storage is for starter chip.","At some point, when you want to share these resources with a larger workgroup or with a lot of different people, these graphics appliances, these computing appliances are really a perfect fit and we see a lot of people wanting to go to SAS, but they can\u2019t do it with graphics intensive applications. And now with the Nvidia Grid, they can finally do that. So I\u2019m excited about the GPU growth opportunities still, but one of the areas where we\u2019re investing very heavily and that\u2019s the reason why you saw the investments from the last couple of years is really to put us in a place where we can engage the LTE market and this year we will aggressively do that.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets","And just as my follow up. I have a good understanding of where the growth is going to come from on the Tegra 4. Clearly it sounds like with the LTE modem you want to grow in the handset side of the market to take advantage of that. When you look at all the other investments that you\u2019re making as you just ran through a pretty healthy list there of new products that you\u2019ve introduced recently, what\u2019s number two and three on the list as far as revenue contribution?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, I really listed two just now. I listed LTE and that\u2019s \u2013 when I say LTE I mean Tegra LTE. You have to invest in Tegra and you have to invest in LTE in order to engage that LTE connected device market. There is no standalone modem business anymore and in many of these new 4G connected device marketplace, an integrated approach is necessary and that\u2019s the reason why we bought Icera and that\u2019s the reason why we\u2019re investing in LTE. So that\u2019s really one investment. You have to do it all together or you don\u2019t do it at all. And so that\u2019s one of the reasons why all of the standalone modem companies really have gotten out and that\u2019s the reason why most of the standalone application processor companies have gone now. Because unless you have the combination of these three things, something like a Tegra application processor or a 4G modem and a software stack, you really can't play, you can't play the big games. ","And I think we are rather uniquely positioned to be a great challenger here and the number two is GRID. That particular investment is really about taking our GPU and taking it out of the box. If you take the GPU out of the box, then you can grow independent of the box. And the GRID is going to make it possible for us to put our GPUs, if you will, on a network and whether it's a Mac network or a PC network, or an Android network, or whatever devices you have got networked on to it. So those were two investments that I have described and both have exciting growth opportunities ahead.","Operator","Your next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays Capital.","Blayne Curtis \u2013 Barclays Capital","[Inaudible]","Jen-Hsun Huang","I am sorry, that was really difficult for us to understand. Could you try to say that again if you are calling in on a landline? Just try that one more time.","Blayne Curtis \u2013 Barclays Capital","I am travelling. I was wondering if you could provide some color as to (inaudible) of what you see tablet (inaudible) a bigger driver for you as well as (inaudible)?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Okay. I am going take a swing at that. I think you asked what is likely to be a larger growth driver for us. Is it tablets or phones and number two, is it Android or Win RT. And so that\u2019s a good question and let me see if I can try to dissect that. First of all, you know on a yearly basis, although the quarters have been a little choppy, on an annual basis most of our growth, not all of our growth but the vast majority of our growth has come from tablets. Whereas people were rather skeptical about Android tablets, we really stuck with it. And we stuck with it because we believed not in whether a tablet, an Android tablet is going to be used or not, were successful or not, we believed in the Google Cloud. We believed that people will buy books and music and games and movies and store their photographs up in the cloud.","And when you put all your personal content in the cloud, you want to enjoy it on your phone, you want to enjoy when you are home in a larger format. And in which case an Android Tablet. We also believe that you would want to enjoy playing the games with a device that's designed dedicated to play games and that\u2019s the reason why built Shield. And so I think the tablet market has turned out to exceed most people's expectations. And we grew a lot in Android tablets this last year and my expectation is that there will be more Android tablets build this next year. And so the first thing is, yes, I believe in tablet. I believe in tablets wholeheartedly and it's an area, it's a segment of the marketplace that we are going to continue to invest and be quite successful in. ","WinRT, I believe it is essential. Strategically essential for Microsoft to be on all of the major processor in the world. Surely the highest volume processor in the world. As a software company and an operating system company it's a market they can't afford to ignore. And so Win RT is surely going to be an important area for them. Now whether people see Win RT as a consumer tablet or as a PC is yet to be determined. But at the very minimum, if you are extrapolated forward by a few years, it's hard to imagine how Win RT can possibly, won't possibly be a wonderful PC. We know exactly what it feels like on top of the Tegra 4 and it rocks, it's fantastic. And so WinRT, I think will be successful as well. Microsoft will have no choice but to continue to invest in it and it\u2019s a great company. ","They\u2019ll do something great with it with respect to tab. So that\u2019s Android and WinRT. I already commented on tablets, smartphones, super phones. This is an area that we will likely need to have an LTE modem in order to be successful and that\u2019s the reason why we work so hard to accelerate our LTE modem to market. We\u2019re working around the clock and this is \u2013 with an LTE modem, the Tegra processor and our software capability, we will be able to address a much larger phone opportunity going forward. And so we\u2019ll have some phone success this year, but we\u2019re not expecting to have a whole lot of phone design wins until we engage the market with LTE.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kevin Cassidy with Stifel Nicolaus.","Kevin Cassidy \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","A question. I wonder if you could give us more of a timeline on the GRID development and when we could see significant revenue for that product. What are some of the obstacles in front of you still?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Thanks a lot, Kevin. I think GRID the architecture comes in three flavors. One and the one that we developed first is GRID for enterprise VDI. We\u2019ve been working with Citrix, VMWare and Microsoft for quite a long time and that particular application by installing our graphics card, the GRID VGX graphics cards into a industry standard OEM server, you could deploy it in enterprises and accelerate the VDI installations that you have. And so if you had a Citrix desktop it would just be much snappier. We could also address markets where the current VDI solutions aren\u2019t sufficiently good enough because the graphics performance isn\u2019t good enough, it doesn\u2019t run certain applications like workstations. So we could expand the market for VDI. Our three partnerships are going fabulously. Everybody is very excited about that and that is likely the first area of growth this year for GRID.","The second component of growth has to do with Cloud gaming. We have about six partners and we\u2019re evaluating new ones who are middleware partners who service TELCOs and MSOs around the world to provide Cloud gaming to these TELCOs and MSOs. They would like to provide gaming as one of the channels of cable television. And so it\u2019s another way for them to monetize a subscriber base they already have. It\u2019s another way for TELCOs to provide content that could be enjoyed over the LTE networks. And so you could imagine that this is creating new content, adding content inventory to their subscriber bases, something that of course every TELCO and every MSO would more than love to do. And so we have six partners partnering with us around the world.","The trials are going on at 12 TELCOs around the world and there are more coming online as we speak. So that evaluation will take longer because the quality of service has to be proven and these large networks have to be tested. And so that\u2019s the second that we\u2019ve started. I\u2019m not expecting large revenue contribution this year, but it\u2019s really, really important that we do proof of concepts and trials at every TELCO this year. And so that\u2019s our primary focus. And the third has to do with SAS. As you know, most of the software companies would like to move to a SAS model, from whether it\u2019s monetization or just being able to access new customers more quickly, not having to install a heavyweight application in somebody\u2019s network is one of the fastest ways to capture new subscribers or new customers, new licensees. ","And so being able to just literally put a heavyweight application like an Adobe or AutoDesk or SolidWorks application, workstation application, there\u2019s a little icon that you double click and boom, you\u2019re in that application because the application is being served on a network. It's a real benefit to them. And so this is a new market as well for us. Obviously created the first of its kind of device. It's a graphics, it's a GPU. It's a massive collection of GPUs in a computing device. And so we are very good at GPUs of course and all the software is in-house. But we are re-cultivating that marketplace and we will see how it goes. And so I wish I had crisp answers on these -- on GRID. But this is a first of its kind device and we have enthusiastic partners. Because it provides a benefit to all those in the ecosystem and as soon as we can, we will report on the actual business component of it.","Kevin Cassidy \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Thanks for those details. Have you seen any competition or any other alternative solutions for this type of application?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, GRID is first of its kind and my expectation is that it will be the only one of its kind for a while. And the reason for that is because in order to crate GRID, we have to create a new architecture for a GPU, create a new system architecture. Create a new system software architecture to virtualize, to share, to connect, to remotely render on to devices of all kinds. And so this is -- we own the entire stack and so it's easy for us to do it. I don\u2019t really know how other people, somebody else would independently cut across that many layers of the architecture and system, and systems software to achieve it. But at the moment everything I know and what I see in the horizon, GRID is really the only one in the market.","Operator","Your next question comes from Shawn Webster with Macquarie.","Shawn Webster - Macquarie","I was wondering if you could help me understand the gross margins. You did a very job keeping them stable in a down revenue environment but it seems like you had a pretty healthy mix up in high margin areas like workstations. And even going into Q1, where you are expecting flattish gross margins, again it sounds like workstations again will be kind of flattish or you will see declines elsewhere. Are you seeing gross margin decline elsewhere or maybe price declines, just help me understand that. Thank you.","Karen Burns","I\u2019m sorry. I missed the first part of your question. Can you just -- the first part please?","Shawn Webster - Macquarie","I am trying to figure out the flat gross margins, where you have what seems like a positive mix effect happening underneath your revenues to workstation.","Karen Burns","For this quarter, or next?","Shawn Webster - Macquarie","For both Q4 as well as your guidance for Q1.","Karen Burns","Okay. So the mix is quite -- as I explained in the commentary, it's really stable. Yes, Quadro was up but there is always some offset. Quadro was up in Q4 but probably one of the larger areas is the memory. When memory moves around, that can basically drive our margins a bit. But overall the blend is pretty stable and that\u2019s just how it is. The next quarter we are expecting about the same.","Shawn Webster - Macquarie","Okay. As it relates to the desktop segment, you had pretty good share gains this year. Can you talk about what some of the dynamics are on the channel currently? As far as like how inventories are looking and maybe what your expectations are in terms of market share for the full year.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, inventory levels turn out to be slightly up when the revenues are down are you could imagine. And so we are expecting next quarter, this coming quarter to be seasonal as well as consistent with the overall PC market. And so inventory will likely be slightly -- will be up a tad. But we watch it very, very closely. You know the channel is very important to us and all the partners and the flow through is important to us. And in a way to control and manage your gross margins, it's vital. It's vital not to have too much inventory, as you know. And so that we watched that like a hawk and that\u2019s one of the reasons why our gross margins and well managed as improving.","As far as the year goes, our position in graphics is as good as it's ever been and my expectation is that our position in graphics will improve this year. Shield will help GeForce. The ability to stream remotely your PC game and to be able to enjoy it on your Shield is quite a magical new experience and the enthusiasm from our GeForce customers around the world is really quite spectacular. We\u2019ve had more press written about Shield than just about anything in the history of our company. And so I think the enthusiasm is quite high and Shield is intended to be \u2013 one of its intentions is to be a companion device for GeForce. And so that\u2019s going to enhance our GeForce position. So throughout the year my expectations are our position will continue to improve. But with respect to market share we\u2019ll just have to report that when we get there.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs.","Jim Schneider \u2013 Goldman Sachs","I was wondering if you look at your pipeline in Tegra 4 (inaudible) throughout the year, should we expect any kind of meaningful increase in Tegra as we head into the July quarter? Is this going to be more back half loaded in Q3 and Q4?","Jen-Hsun Huang","I\u2019m sorry but it\u2019s impossible to hear you at all.","Jim Schneider \u2013 Goldman Sachs","I\u2019m just wondering, in terms of the design win ramp you see for Tegra 4 this year, do you think that will be an increase in any, like the July quarter or do you expect that all to come in the back half of the year?","Jen-Hsun Huang","We ship Tegra 4 starting in Q2. We\u2019re ramping production now and we have full production release. And so we\u2019re ramping production. Q2 is when we ship to customers. Q2 is also when we ship the Tegra 4 based Shield device. And so we also start shipping in Q2. Although it\u2019s in the latter part of Q2, it\u2019s going to be in Q2.","Jim Schneider \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Follow up. When we look at your R&D spending throughout the year when you talked about modest decreases as we head into the end of the year, could you talk about any new initiatives, whether that\u2019s for GRID, for shield or (inaudible) that will provide that increase as we head through the year?","Rob Csongor","Jim, this is Rob. Did you ask are there any new initiatives on OpEx other than GRID? Is that what you asked?","Jim Schneider \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Is there any cause for the repeat through the year? Yes.","Jen-Hsun Huang","There are three things that are new businesses if you will, not new businesses but additions to our businesses this year. The first addition is LTE modems. LTE modems by itself is not a new business, but LTE modem will allow Tegra to enter into new markets where LTE is necessary. We already have many LTE design wins on i500 and our expectation is this is going to be quite a good trend for us. So that\u2019s one additional part of our business. The second additional part of our business is using our own Tegra processor and utilizing our own proprietary technologies and software and such to build an Android device. We call that Shield. The third addition to our business is GRID which is a GPU. It\u2019s a network attached GPU. It\u2019s not a new business. It\u2019s a GPU business. It\u2019s packed with GPUs and it serves our existing marketplace partnered with our existing partners. It\u2019s sold into the same ecosystems. And so we have three things this year. Tegra LTE, number one. Number two, Shield; and number three is our GRID graphics appliance. Hey, Jim, I hope we answered your question. We will follow up with you and make sure we got that. I think we have time for one more.","Operator","Your next question comes from Patrick Wang with Evercore Partners.","Patrick Wang - Evercore Partners","Just a few questions. First off, I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about your design traction on your modem business. So you talked about i500, the Icera acquisition is definitely a key part of that. Just curious as you know, if you could help us maybe understand maybe the shape of the growth this year in perhaps deciding, is it something that\u2019s grows to 100 million this year, is it something that is a lot bigger than that. I mean 150 million for the year, it's a big [tam]. So just wanted to think about that right away.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, let's see. The first thing is, it's important to note that the previous generation of our LTE modem, the i410, is the first and currently still the only Win RT LTE modem certified by AT&T. It is currently shipping in the Asus Vivo tablet. And if you get a chance to try this, it's really wonderful. It stands to reason that there are many other Win RT Tegra 4 tablets in development. And we would transition them to the i500 modem. We don\u2019t sell the modem separately. It's sold as  a kit. It's sold with Tegra 4. And so it's hard to break it out per say. But more and more of our business will include LTE because we had no LTE penetration in the past and this year we are going to be shipping LTE modem. So I don\u2019t exactly how much -- we are trying to make it as much possible. But at this point we are not guiding the whole year.","Patrick Wang - Evercore Partners","And then just for my follow up. I was curious, when we take a look at the full year, you have got a lot of great stuff happening on Tegra outside of just handsets. So you have got tablet traction, you have got Shield, you have got automotive that did well last quarter. When we look at it full year here, I mean you guys did  a great job hitting 50% growth last year. Could you care to maybe give us some help in terms of ballpark, how much growth we should be thinking about in this year in fiscal '14, given the transition and the fact that we are kind of starting off a little bit light as we enter the April quarter.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, the way we enter the April quarter is I guess similar during every transition and I am hoping that overtime as our -- although we have had this transition now for all three generations, each one of the transition, the peaks have become much higher. And the revenue at the whole business has much become much larger. And so our position in the market place is growing. Our footprint is growing and our position is more strategic to the marketplace than ever. But we haven\u2019t decided to guide the whole year. We are going to go through this transition one more time and we will start shipping in Q2. But we haven\u2019t decided to guide for the full year. What you recognize are the same things we observe as well. Whereas before we really only had Android tablets, now we have a much larger Android tablet market. We have Win RT PCs, we have Shield, and we have automotive. And so Tegra is not just the smartphone and of course we have Tegra LT which will be great for connected tablets as well as smartphones.","And so we have more than just Android application processors now. We have much more than that, but it's hard to say exactly how much for the year and we are just going to go do as best we can.","Okay. I think that will do it for today. We are going to have to wrap it up. Thank you everyone. We look forward to talking to you next quarter at our Q1 results. Thank you.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference call.

And welcome to NVIDIA's conference call for the first quarter of fiscal 2020. With me on the call today from NVIDIA are Jen-Hsun Huang, President and Chief Executive Officer and Colette Kress, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to remind you that our call is being webcast live on NVIDIA's Investor Relations Web site.","The webcast will be available for replay until the conference call to discuss our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2020. The content of today's call is NVIDIA's property. It can't be reproduced or transcribed without our prior written consent.","During this call, we may make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. These are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of factors that could affect our future financial results and business, please refer to the disclosure in today's earnings release, our most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q and the reports that we may file on Form 8-K with Securities and Exchange Commission.","All our statements are made as of today, May 16, 2019, based on information currently available to us. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements. During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO commentary, which is posted on our Web site.","With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.","Colette Kress","Thanks Simona.","Q1 revenue was $2.2 billion in line with our outlook and down 31% year-on-year and up 1% sequentially. Starting with our gaming business, revenue of $1.05 billion was down 39% year-on-year and up 11% sequentially consistent with our expectations.","We are pleased with the initial ramp of Turing and the reduction of inventory in the channel. During the quarter, we filled out our touring lineup with the launch of mid-range GeForce products that enable us to delight gamers with the best performance at every price point starting at $149.","New product launches this quarter included the GeForce GTX 1660 Ti, 1660 and 1650 which bring Turing to the high volume PC gaming side for both desktops and laptops. These GPUs deliver up to 50% performance improvement over their Pascal based predecessors leveraging new Shader innovations such as concurrent floating point and integer operations, a unified cache and adaptive shading all with the incredibly power efficient architecture.","We expect continued growth in the gaming laptops this year. GeForce gaming laptops are one of the shining spots of the consumer PC market. This year OEMs have built a record of nearly 100 GeForce gaming laptops. GeForce laptops start at $799 and all the way up to an amazing GeForce RTX 2080 4K laptops that are more powerful than even next generation consoles.","The content ecosystem for Ray traced games is gaining significant momentum. At the March game developers conference, Ray tracing sessions were packed. Support for Ray tracing was announced by the industry's most important game engines, Microsoft DSR, Epics on unreal engine and unity. Ray tracing will be the standard for next generation games.","In March at our GPU technology conference, we also announced more details on our cloud gaming strategy through our GeForce NOW service and the newly announced [indiscernible] alliance. GeForce NOW is a GeForce gaming PC in the cloud for the 1 billion PCs that are not game ready expanding our reach well beyond today's 200 million GeForce gamers. It's an open platform that allows gamers to play the games they own instantly in the cloud on any PC or Mac anywhere they like. The service currently has 300,000 monthly active users with 1 million more on the waitlist.","To scale out to millions of gamers worldwide, we announced the GeForce NOW alliance expanding GFN through partnerships with the global telecom providers, SoftBank in Japan and LG UPlus in South Korea will be among the first to launch GFN later this year.","NVIDIA, we'll develop the software and manage the service and share the subscription revenue with alliance partners. GFN runs on NVIDIA's edge computing servers as telcos raise to offer the new services for their 5G networks, GFN is an ideal new 5G application.","Moving to data center, revenue was $634 million down 10% year-on-year and down 7% sequentially reflecting the pause in hyperscale spending. While demand from some hyperscale customers bounced back nicely, others paused or cut back. Despite the uneven demand backdrop, the quarter had significant positives consistent with the growth drivers we outlined on our previous earnings call.","First, inference revenue was up sharply both year-on-year and sequentially with broad based adoption across a number of hyperscale and consumer internet companies. As announced at GTC, Amazon and Alibaba joined other hyperscale such as Google, Baidu and Tencent in adopting the T4 in their data centers. A growing list of consumer Internet companies is also adopting our GPUs for influence including LinkedIn, Expedia Microsoft, PayPal, Pinterest, Snap and Twitter. The contribution of inference to our data center revenue is now well into the double-digit percent.","Second, we expanded our reach in enterprise teaming up with major OEMs to introduce the T4 enterprise and edge computing servers. These are optimized to run the NVIDIA CUDA-X AI acceleration libraries for AI and data analytics. Within easy to deploy software stack from NVIDIA and our ecosystem partners, this wave of NVIDIA edge AI computing systems enables companies in the world's largest industries, transportation, manufacturing, industrial, retail, healthcare and agricultural to bring intelligence to the edge where the customers operate.","And third, we made significant progress in data center rendering and graphics. We unveiled a new RTX server configuration packing 40 GPUs into an 8-used space and up to 32 servers in a pod providing unparalleled density, efficiency and scalability.","With a complete stack, this server design is optimized for three data center graphic workflows rendering, remote, workstation and cloud gaming. The rendering opportunity is starting to take shape with early RTX server deployment at leading studios, including Disney, Pixar and [indiscernible].","In the quarter, we announced our pending acquisition of Mellanox for $125 per share in cash representing a total enterprise value of approximately $6.9 billion, which we believe will strengthen our strategic position in data center. Once complete the acquisition, we will unite two of the world's leading companies in high performance computing. Together NVIDIA's computing platform and Mellanox's interconnects power over 250 of the world's top 500 supercomputers and have as customers every major cloud service provider and computer maker.","Data centers in the future will be architect as giant compute engines with tens and thousands of compute nodes, designed holistically with their interconnects for optimal performance. With Mellanox, NVIDIA will optimize data center scale workloads, across the entire computing networking and storage stack to achieve higher performance, greater utilization and lower operating costs for customers. Together we can create better AI computing systems for the cloud to enterprise to the edge. As stated at the time of the announcement, we look forward to closing the acquisition by the end of this calendar year.","Moving to pro visualization. Revenue reached $266 million up 6% from a prior year and down 9% sequentially. Year-on-year growth was driven by both desktop and mobile workstations, while the sequential decline was largely seasonal. Areas of strength included the public sector, oil and gas and manufacturing. Emerging applications such as AI\/AR\/VR contributed an estimated 38% a pro visualization revenue. The real-time Ray tracing capabilities of RTX are a game changer for the visual effects industry and we are seeing tremendous momentum in the ecosystem.","At UTC, we announced that the world's top 3D application providers have adopted NVIDIA RTX in their product releases set for later this year including Adobe, Autodesk Chaos group, Dassault and Pixar. With this rich software ecosystem, NVIDIA RTX is transforming the 3D market. For example, Pixar is using NVIDIA RTX Ray tracing on its upcoming films what a digital is using it for upcoming Disney projects and Siemens and x Ray trace studios users will be able to generate rendered images up to 4x faster in their product design workflows. We are excited to see the tremendous value in NVIDIA RTX is bringing to the millions of creators and designers served by ecosystem partners.","Finally, turning to automotive, Q1 revenue was $166 million up 14% from a year ago and up 2% sequentially. Year-on-year growth was driven by growing adoption of next generation AI cockpit solutions, an autonomous vehicle development deals.","At GTC we had major customer and product announcements. Toyota selected NVIDIA's end-to-end platform to develop train and validate self-driving vehicles. This broad partnership includes advancements in AI computing, infrastructure using NVIDIA GPUs, simulation using NVIDIA drive constellation platform and in-car AV computers based on the DRIVE AGX Xavier or Pegasus.","We also announced the public availability of Drive Constellation, which enables millions of miles to be driven in virtual worlds across the broad range of scenarios with greater efficiency, cost effectiveness and safety than what's possible to achieve in the real world. Constellation will be reported in our data center market platform. And we introduced NVIDIA Safety Force Field, a computational defensive driving framework that shield autonomous vehicles from collisions mathematically verified and validated in simulation Safety Force Field will prevent a vehicle from creating escalating or contributing to an unsafe starting situation. We continue to believe that every vehicle will have an autonomous capability one day whether with driver or driverless.","To help make that vision a reality NVIDIA has created an end-to-end platform for autonomous vehicles from AI computing infrastructure to simulation to in-car computing and Toyota is our first major win that validates the strategy. We see this as a $30 billion addressable market by 2025.","Moving to the rest of the P&L and balance sheet. Q1 GAAP gross margins was $58.4% and non-GAAP was 59% down year-on-year to lower gaming margins and mix up sequentially from Q4 which had $128 million charge from DRAM boards and other components. GAAP operating expenses were $938 million and non-GAAP operating expenses were $753 million up 21% and 16% year-on-year respectively.","We remain on track for high single-digit OpEx growth in fiscal 2020, while continuing to invest in the key platforms driving our long-term growth. Namely graphics, AI and self-driving cars. GAAP EPS was $0.64 and non-GAAP EPS was $0.88. We did not make any stock repurchases in the quarter following the announcement of the pending Mellonox acquisition. We remain committed to returning $3 billion to shareholders through the end of fiscal 2020 in the form of dividends and repurchases. So far, we have returned $800 million through share repurchases and quarterly cash dividends.","With that let me turn to the outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2020. While we anticipate substantial quarter-over-quarter growth for Q2 outlook is somewhat lower than our expectation earlier in the quarter when our outlook for fiscal 2020 revenue was flat to down slightly from fiscal 2019. The data center spending pause around the world will likely persist in the second quarter and visibility remains low.","In gaming, the CPU shortage while improving will affect the initial round of our laptop business. For Q2, we expect revenue to be $2.55 billion plus or minus 2%. We expect a stronger second half than the first half and we are returning to our practice of providing revenue outlook one quarter at a time. Q2 GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 59.2% and 59.5% respectively plus or minus 50 basis points.","GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $985 million, $765 million respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP OIME or both expected to be income of approximately $27 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 10% plus or minus 1% excluding discrete items.","Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $120 million to $140 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR Web site.","In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We'll be presenting at the Bank of America Global Technology Conference on June 5; at the RBC Future of Mobility Conference on June 6; and at the NASDAQ Investor Conference on June 13. Our next earnings call to discuss financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 will take place on August 15.","We will now open the call for questions. Operator will you please poll.","Question-and-Answer Session","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.","Q - Aaron Rakers","Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Colette, I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color or discussion around what exactly you've seen in the data center segment. And whether or not, or what you're looking for in terms of signs that we can kind of return to growth or maybe this pause is behind it. I guess what I'm really asking is kind of what's changed over the last let's call it three months relative to your prior commentary from a visibility perspective and just demand perspective within that segment.","Colette Kress","Sure. Thanks for the question as we start out here. I think when we had discussed our overall data center business three months ago, we did indicate that our visibility as we turned into the new calendar year was low. We had a challenge in terms of completing some of the deals at the end of that quarter.","As we moved into Q1, I think we felt solid in terms of how we completed. We saw probably a combination of those moving forward, continuing with our CapEx expenditures and building out in terms of what they need for the data centers. Some others are still in terms of a pause. So, as we look in terms of -- with Q2, I think we see a continuation of what we have in terms of the visibility not the best visibility going forward, but still rock solid to what we think are our benefits of what we provide in terms of a platform.","Our overall priorities are aligned to what we see with the hyperscale as well as the enterprises as we think about using AI in so many of their different workloads. But, we'll just have to see as we go forward how this turns out. But right now, visibility probably just remains the same about as where we were when we started three months ago.","Aaron Rakers","Okay. And then, as a quick follow-up on the gaming side last quarter you talked about that being down I think it was termed as being down slightly for the full year. Is that still the expectation or how has that changed?","Colette Kress","So, at this time, we don't plan on giving a full year overall guidance. I think our look in terms of gaming all of the still drivers that we thought about earlier in the quarter and we talked about our Investor Day and we have continued to talk about are still definitely in the line. While the drivers of our gaming business and Turing RTX for the future are still on track. But, we're not providing guidance at this time for the full year.","Operator","And your next question comes from line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. On the last earnings call, you had mentioned China gaining demand is a headwind. At the Analyst Day in mid-March, I think Jen-Hsun had mentioned that the team was already starting to see better demand trends out of China maybe given the relaxed stance on gaming bans. Do you anticipate continued China gaming demand on a go forward basis and maybe talk about some of the dynamics driving that demand profile in the China geography?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Sure. China looks like fine. I think China has stabilized. The gaming market in China is really vibrant and it continues to be vibrant. Tencent's releasing new games. I think you might have heard that Epic stores now open in Asia and games are available from the West. So, there are all kinds of positive signs in China. There's some 300 million PC gamers in China and. And then, people are expecting it to grow. We're expecting the total number of gamers to continue to grow from the 1 plus billion PC gamers around the world to something more than that. And so, things look fine.","Harlan Sur","Thanks for that. And then, as a follow-up, a big part of the demand profile in the second half of the year for the gaming business is always the lineup of AAA rated games. Obviously, you guys have a very close partnership with all of the game developers. How does the pipeline of new games look, kind of they get launched October, November timeframe either a total number of blockbuster games and also games supporting you know real-time great racing as well as some of your deal assess capabilities?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yes. Well, it's seasonal second half the year, we expect to see some great games. We won't preannounce anybody else games for them. But, this is this is a great PC cycle because it is the end of the console cycle. And PCs are where the actions at these days. With Battle Royale and Esports and so much social going on, the PC gaming ecosystem is just really vibrant.","Our strategy with RTX was to take a lead and move the world to Ray tracing. And at this point I think it's fairly safe to say that that the leadership position that we've taken has turned into a movement that has turned next generation gaming Ray tracing into a standard. Almost every single game platform will have to have Ray tracing and some of them already announced it and the partnerships that we've developed are fantastic Microsoft DXR is supporting Ray tracing, Unity supporting ray tracing, Epic is supporting Ray tracing, leading publishers like EA has adopted RTX and supporting Ray tracing and movie studios, Pixar has adopted -- announced that they're using RTX and will use artifacts to accelerate their rendering of films.","And so, Adobe and Autodesk jumped on to RTX and that will bring Ray tracing to their content and their tools. And so, I think at this point it's fair to say that that Ray tracing is the next generation and it's going to be adopted all over the world.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS.","Timothy Arcuri","Thank you. I guess the first question is for Colette. So, what went into decision to pull for your guidance versus just cutting it. Is it really just fear around how long it could take for you no data center to come back? Thank you.","Colette Kress","Yes. I'll start off here and kind of go back to where our thoughts were in Q1 and why we provided full year guidance when we were in Q1. When we looked at Q1 and what we are guiding we understood that it was certainly an extraordinary quarter something that we didn't feel was a true representative of our business. And we wanted to get a better view of our trajectory of our business in terms of going forward.","We are still experiencing I think the uncertainty as a result of the pause in terms of -- with the overall hyperscale data centers. And we do believe that's going to extend into Q2. However, we do know and expect that our Q2 -- assuming our H2 will likely be sizably larger than our overall H1. And the core dynamics of our business at every level is exactly what we expected. Just that said though, we're going to return to just quarterly guidance at this time.","Timothy Arcuri","Okay. Thanks. And then, just as a follow-up, can you give us some even qualitative if not quantitative sense of the $320 million incremental revenue for July. How that breaks out is the thinking sort of that data center is going to be flat to maybe up a little bit and pretty much the remainder of the growth comes from gaming. Thanks.","Colette Kress","Yes. So, when you think about our growth between Q1 and Q2, yes, we do expect in terms of our gaming to increase. We do expect our Nintendo switch to start again in sizable amount. Once we move into Q2 and we do at this time expect probably our data center business to grow.","Operator","And your next question comes from line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.","Toshiya Hari","Thanks for taking the question. Jen-Hsun, I had a follow up on the data center business. I was hoping you could provide some color in terms of what you're seeing not only from your hyperscale customers which you've talked extensively on, but more on the enterprise and the HP side of your business and specifically on the hyperscale side.","You guys talk about this pause that you're seeing from your customer base. When you're having conversations with your customers, did they give you a reason as to why they're pausing is it, too much inventory of GPUs and CPUs and so on and so forth? Or is it, optimization giving them extra capacity? Is it caution on their own business going forward? Or is it a combination of all the above? Any color on that would be helpful too. Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Hyperscale are digesting the capacity they have. At this point, I think it's fairly clear that in the second half of last year they took on a little bit too much capacity. And so, everybody is has paused to give themselves a chance to digest. However, our business on inference is doing great. And we're working with CSPs all over the world to accelerate their inference models.","Now the reason why recently the inference activity has gotten just off the charts because of breakthroughs in what we call conversational AI. In fact, today I think I just saw it today, but have known about this work for some time. Harry Shum's Group, Microsoft AI Research Group today announced their multitask DNN, general language understanding model and it broke benchmark records all over the place.","And basically, what this means is the three fundamental components of conversational AI. which is speech recognition, natural language understanding which this multitask DNN is a breakthrough in and it's based on a piece of work that Google did recently called BERT. And then, text to speech all of the major pieces of a conversational AI are now put together. Of course, it's going to continue to evolve, but these models are gigantic to train.","And in the case of Microsoft's network was trained on vault to GPUs and these systems require large amounts of memory, the models are enormous takes an enormous amount of time to train these systems. And so, we're seeing a breakthrough in conversational AI and across the board Internet companies would like to make their AI much more conversational. So that you can access through phones and smart speakers and be able to engage AI practically everywhere.","The work that we're doing in industries makes a ton of sense. We're seeing AI adoption in just about all the industries from transportation to healthcare to retail to logistics, industrials, agriculture. And the reason for that is because they have a vast amount of data that they're collecting and I heard a statistic just the other day from a talk to [indiscernible] that some 90% of today's data was created just two years ago and it's being created by and gathered by these industrial systems all over the world.","And so, if you want to put that data to work and you could create the models using our systems, our GPUs for training, and then you can extend that all the way out to the edge. This last quarter, we started to talk about our enterprise server based on T4. This inference engine that has been really successful for us at the CSPs is now going out into the edge and we call them edge servers and enterprise servers. And these edge systems are going to do AI basically instantaneously. It's too much data to move all the way to the cloud. You might have data sovereignty concerns, you want to have very, very low latency, maybe it needs to have multi-sensor fusion capabilities, so it understands the context better.","For example, what it sees and what it hears has to be harmonious. And so, you need that kind of AI, those kind of sensor computing at the edge. And so, we're seeing a ton of excitement around this area. Some people call it the intelligent edge. Some people call edge computing and now with 5G networks coming, we're seeing a lot of interest around the edge computing servers that we're making. Those are the activity that we're seeing.","Toshiya Hari","Thank you. As a quick follow-up on the gaming side, Colette, can you characterize product mix within gaming. You saw in the current quarter, you cited mix as one of the key reasons why gross margins were down year-over-year albeit off a high base going into Q2 in the back half. Would you expect SKU mix within gaming to improve or stay the same? I ask because it's important for gross margins obviously. Thank you.","Colette Kress","Yes. When you look at our sequential gross margin increase that will be influenced by our larger revenue or larger revenue and better mix, which you're correct is our largest driver of our gross margin. However, we will be beginning the Nintendo switch back up and that does have lower gross margins than the company average influencing therefore our Q2 gross margin guidance that we provided.","As we look forward towards the rest of the year, we think mix and the higher revenue again will influence and likely rise our overall gross margins for the full year.","Operator","And your next question comes from line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.","Joe Moore","Great. Thank you. We've talked quite a bit about GeForce now in the prepared remarks and at the Analyst Day. It seems like cloud gaming is going to be a big topic at [83] [ph]. Is that going to be your preferred way to go-to-market with cloud gaming and do you expect to sell GPUs to sort of traditional cloud vendors in non-GeForce NOW fashion?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yes. Our strategy for cloud gaming is to extend our PC position for GeForce gamers into the cloud. And our strategy for our building out our network is partnerships with telcos around the world. And so, we'll build out some of it. And on top of the service, we have our entire PC gaming stack and when we host the service, we will move toward a subscription model. And with our telcos around the world who would like to provision the service at their edge servers and many of them would like to do so in conjunction with their 5G telco services to offer cloud gaming as a differentiator.","In all of these different countries where PC exposure has been relatively low. We have an opportunity to extend our platform out to that billion PC gamers. And so, our that's our basic strategy. And we also offer our edge server platform to all of the cloud service providers.","Google has NVIDIA GPU graphics in the cloud. Amazon has NVIDIA GPU graphics in the cloud and Microsoft has NVIDIA GPU graphics in the cloud. And these GPUs will be fantastic also for cloud gaming and workstation graphics and also Ray tracing. And so, the platform is capable of running all of the things that NVIDIA runs and we try to put it in every data center, in every cloud from every region that's possible.","Joe Moore","Thank you very much.","Operator","And your next question comes the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya","Thanks for taking my question. I actually had a clarification for Colette and a question for Jen-Hsun. Colette, are you now satisfied that the PC gaming business is operating at normal levels, when you look at Q2 guidance like all the issues regarding inventory and ratios are they over? Or do you think that the second half of the year is more than normalized run rate for your PC gaming business?","And then, Jen-Hsun, on the data center -- NVIDIA has dominated the training market inference sounds a lot more fragmented and competitive. There's a lot of talk of software being written more on the framework level. How should we get the confidence that at your lead-in training will help you maintain good lead and inference also? Thank you.","Colette Kress","Thanks for the question. So, let's start with your first part of the question regarding how we reached overall normalized gaming levels. When we look at our overall inventory in the channel, we believe that this is relatively behind us and moving forward that it will not be an issue. Going forward, we will probably reach normalized level for gaming somewhere between Q2 and Q3 similar to our discussion that we had back at Analyst Day and at the beginning of the quarter.","Jen-Hsun Huang","NVIDIA strategy is accelerated computing. It is very different than accelerator strategy. For example, if you were building a smart microphone, you need an accelerator for speech recognition ASR. Our company is focused on accelerated computing. And the reason for that is because the world's body of software is really gigantic and the world's body of software continues to evolve and AI is nowhere near done. We're probably at the first couple of innings of AI of that. And so, the amount of software and the size of the models are going to have to continue to evolve.","Our accelerated computing platform is designed to enable the computer industry to bring forward into the future all the software that exists today whether it's TensorFlow or Caffe or PyTorch or it could be a classical machine learning algorithms like XGBoost, which is actually right now the most popular framework in machine learning overall. And there are so many different types of classical algorithms and not to mention all of the handwritten engineered algorithms by programmers. And those algorithms and those hand engineered algorithms also would like to be mixed in with all of the deep learning or otherwise classical machine learning algorithms.","This whole body of software doesn't run on a single function accelerator. If you would like the body of software to run on something, it would have to be sufficiently general purpose. And so, the balance that we made was we invented this thing called a Tensor Core that allows us to accelerate deep learning to the speed of light. Meanwhile, it has the flexibility of CUDA, so that we can bring forward everything in classical machine learning as people have started to see with RAPIDS and it's being announced being integrated into machine learning pipelines in the cloud and elsewhere.","And then, also all of the high-performance computing applications or computer vision algorithms, image processing algorithms that that don't have deep learning or machine learning alternatives. And so, our company is focused on accelerated computing. And speaking of inference that's one of the reasons why we're so successful in inference right now. We're seeing really great pickup. And the reason for that is because the type of models that people want to run on one application and let's just use one application, one very, very exciting one, conversational AI, you would have to do speech recognition, you would have to then do natural language understanding to understand what did the speeches -- you might have to convert, you have to translate to another language. Then you have to do something related to maybe making a recommendation or making a search and then after that you have to convert that recommendation and search and the intent into speech.","While some of it could be 8-bit integer, some of it really wants to be 16-bit floating point in some of it because of the development state of it may want to be in 32-bit floating point. And so, the mix precision nature and the computational algorithm nature, flexibility nature of our approach make it possible for cloud providers and people who are developing AI applications. To not have to worry about exactly what model it runs or not, we run every single model. And if it doesn't currently run well, we'll help you make it run.","And so, the flexibility of our architecture and the incredible performance in deep learning is really a great balance and allows customers to deploy it easily. So, our strategy is very different than an accelerator. I think the only accelerators that I really see successful at the moment are the ones that go into smart speakers. And surely there are a whole bunch being talked about, but I think the real challenge is how to make it run real workloads. And we're going to keep cranking along in our current strategy and keep raising the bar as we have in the past.","Vivek Arya","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.","Stacy Rasgon","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. This is a question for Colette. Colette, you said inference and rendering within data center were both up very strongly, but I guess that has to imply that like the training flash acceleration pieces is quite weak even weaker than the overall. And given those should be adding to efficiency, I'm just surprised it's down that much. Is this truly just digestion? I mean is it share I mean like your competitor is now shipping some parts here? I mean I guess how do we get confidence that just we haven't seen a ceiling on this? I mean do you think given the trajectory you can exit the year above the prior peaks I guess you kind of have to feel given at least the qualitative outlook on the cycle. I guess maybe just any color you can give us on any of those trends would be super helpful.","Colette Kress","So, as we discussed, Stacy. We are targeting many of the hyperscale definitely purchasing in terms of the inferencing into the installment that it continues. Also in terms of the training; the training instances that they will need for the cloud or for internal use, absolutely. We have some that have pods and going through all those period, so that we do believe because this will come back. We do believe as we look out into the future that they will need that overall deep learning for much of their research as well as many of their workloads. So, no concern on that. But right now, we do see a pause. I will turn it over to Jen-Hsun to see if he has additional comments.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Let's see. I think that that when it comes down to training, if your infrastructure team tells you not to buy anything. The thing that suffers is time to market and in some amount of experimentation that allows you to better pause and waiting longer. And then, I should -- I think that for computer vision type of algorithms and recommendation type of algorithms those that posture may not be may not be impossible. However, the type of work that that everybody is now jumping on top of which is natural language understanding and conversational AI and the breakthrough that Microsoft just announced. If you want to keep up with that you're going to have to buy much, much larger machines.","And I'm looking forward to that and I expect that that's going to happen. But in the latter part of last year Q4 and Q1 of this year, we did see pause from the hyperscalers. But, I don't expect it to last.","Stacy Rasgon","Got it. This is a quick follow-up. I just wanted to ask about the regulatory around Mellanox in the context of what we're seeing out of China now. How do we sort of gauge the risk of potential further deterioration in relationship sort of spilling over on the regulatory front around deal. I we've seen that obviously with some of the other large deals in the space. What are your thoughts on that?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, on first principles. The acquisition is going to enable data centers around the world whether it's U.S. or elsewhere China to be able to advance much, much more quickly. Now we're going to invest and building infrastructure technology and as a combined company, we'll be able to do that much better. And so, this is good for customers and it's great for customers in China.","The two matters whether it's -- the two matters that we're talking about just are different. One is related to competition in a -- with respect to our acquisition to competition in the market. And the other is related to trade. And so, the two matters are just different. And in our particular case, we bring so much value to the marketplace in China. I mean I'm confident that the market will see that.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI.","C.J. Muse","Yes. Good afternoon and thank you for taking my question. I guess a question on the non-cloud part of your datacenter business. If you think about the trends you're seeing in enterprise virtualization and HPC and all the work you're doing around RAPIDS, rendering et cetera. Can you kind of talk through the visibility you have today for that part of your business, I think that's roughly 50% of the mix, so is at a piece that you feel confident can grow in 2019 and any color around that would be appreciated.","Jen-Hsun Huang","We expected to grow in 2019. A lot of our T4 inference work is related to what people call edge computing and it has to be done at the edge because the amount of data that otherwise would be transferred to the cloud is just too much, has to be done at the edge because of data sovereignty issues and data privacy issues. And it has to be done at the edge because the latency requirement is really, really high.","It has to respond basically like a reflex and to make a prediction or make a suggestion or stop the piece of machinery instantaneously. And so a lot of that work that we're doing in T4 inference is partly in the cloud, a lot of it is at the edge. T4 servers for enterprise were announced, I guess about halfway through the quarter and the OEMs are super excited about that because the number of companies in the world who want to do data analytics -- predictive data analytics is quite large. And the size of the data is growing so significantly and with Moore's Law ending, it's really hard to power through terabytes of data at a time. And so, we've been working on building the software stack from the new memory architectures and storage architectures all the way to the computational middleware and it's called RAPIDS and I appreciate you saying that. And that's being put together in the activity and get hub is just fantastic.","As you can see all kinds of companies jumping in to make contributions because they would like to be able to take that open source software and run it in their own data center on our GPUs. And so, I expect the enterprise side of our business both for enterprise big data analytics or for edge computing to be a really good growth driver for us this year.","C.J. Muse","As a follow up, real quickly on auto. It's a business that you've talked about more R&D focus. But clearly, I think it surprised positively, what's the visibility like there and how should we think about growth trajectory into the second half of the year?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Our Automotive Strategy has several components. There's the engineering component of it where we -- our engineers and their engineers have to co-develop the autonomous vehicles. And then there's three other components; there's the component of AI computing infrastructure, we call DGX and or any of the OEM servers that include our GPUs that are used for developing the AIs. The cars are collecting a couple of terabytes per day per test card. And all of that data has to be powered through and crunched through in the data center. And so, we have an infrastructure of what we call DGX that people could use. And so, we're seeing a lot of success there.","We just announced this last quarter a new infrastructure called Constellation that lets you essentially drive thousands and thousands of test cars in your data center. And they're all going through a pseudo directed random or directed scenarios that allows you to either test untestable scenarios or regress against previous scenarios and we call that Constellation.","And then, lastly, after working on a car for several years, we would install the computer inside the car and we call that drive. And so, these are these are the four components of opportunities that we have in the automotive industry. We're doing great in China. There's a whole bunch of electric vehicles being created, the robot taxis developments around the world largely using NVIDIA technology. We recently announced a partnership with Toyota. There's a whole bunch of stuff that we're working on. I'm anxious to announce them to you.","But this is an area that that -- is the tip of the iceberg of a larger space we call robotics and computing at the edge. But if you think about the basic computational pipeline of a self-driving car, it's no different essentially than a smart retail or the future of computational medical instruments, agriculture, industrial inspection delivery drones are all basically use essentially the same technique. And so, this is the this is the foundational work that we do for a larger space that people call the intelligent as your computing at the edge.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Chris Caso with Raymond James.","Chris Caso","Thank you. Good afternoon. First question is on notebooks and just to clarify what's been different from your expectations this year, is it simply that the OEMs didn't launch the new models you'd expected given the shortage or is it more just about unit volume. And then, just following up on that. What's your level of confidence and that coming back to be a driver as you go into the second half of the year?","Jen-Hsun Huang","In Q2, we were -- we had to deal with some CPU shortage issues at the OEMs. It's improving, but the initial ramp will be affected. And so, the CPU shortage situation has been described fairly broadly and that's affected our initial ramp. We don't expect it to affect our ramp going forward.","And the new category of gaming notebooks that we created called Max-Q has made it possible for really amazing gaming performance to fit into a thin and light. And these new generations of notebooks with our Max-Q design and the Turing GPU which is super energy efficient, in combination made it possible for OEMs to create notebooks that are both affordable all the way down to $799 thin and really delightful all the way up to something incredible with a RTX 2080 and a 4K display. And these are thin notebooks that are really beautiful that people would love to use.","And the invention of the Max-Q design method and all the software that went into it that we announced last year, we had -- I think last year, we had some 40 notebooks or so maybe a little bit less than that. And this year, we have some hundred notebooks that are being designed at different price segments by different OEMs across different regions. And so, I think this year is going to be quite a successful year for notebooks. And it's also the most successful segment of consumer PCs. It's the fastest growing segment. It is very largely under penetrated because until Max-Q came along, it wasn't really possible to design a notebook that is both great and performance and experience and also something that a gamer would like to own.","And so finally, we've been able to solve that difficult puzzle and create a powerful gaming machines that are inside a notebook that's really wonderful to own and carry around. And so, this is going to be a really -- this is a fast-growing segment and all the OEMs know it and that's why they put so much energy into creating all these different types of designs and styles and sizes and shapes and we have 100 Turing GPU notebooks gaming PCs ramping right now.","Chris Caso","It's very helpful. Thank you. As a follow-up, I just want to follow up on some of the previous questions on the automotive market. We've been talking about it for a while. Obviously, the design cycles are very long, so you do have some visibility and I guess the question is, when can we expect an acceleration of auto revenue is next year the year. And then, what would be the driver of that in terms of dollar contribution. I presume some at level two plus things you've been talking about would probably most likely there given the amount of volume there, if you can confirm that and just give some color on expectations for drivers?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yes. Level 2+ call it 2020, late 2021 or 2022-ish. So that's Level 2+. I would say 2019 very, very early for robot taxis, next year substantially more volume for robot taxis 2021 bigger volumes for robot taxis. The ASP differences, the amount of computation you put into a robot taxi because of sensor resolution's, sensor diversity and redundancy, the computational redundancy and the richness of the algorithm all of it put together it's probably an order of magnitude plus in computation and so the economics would reflect that.","And so that robot taxi is kind of like next year, year after ramp and then think of Level 2+ as 2021, 2022. Overall, remember that our economics come from four different parts. And so there's the NRE components of it. There's the AI development infrastructure, computing infrastructure part of it, the simulation part of it called Constellation, and then the economics of the car. And so, we just announced Constellation, the enthusiasm around it is really great. Nobody should ever ship anything they don't simulate. And my expectation is that billions of miles will get simulated inside a simulator long before they'll ship it. And so that's a great opportunity for Constellation.","Operator","And the next question comes from line of Matt Ramsay with Cowan.","Matt Ramsay","Thank you very much. Good afternoon. I have two questions, one for Jen-Hsun and one for Colette. I guess Jen-Hsun you've done, you said in many forums that move down to the new process noted 7-nanometer across the business was not really sufficient to have a platform approach and I agree with that. But, maybe you could talk a little bit about your product plans at least in general terms around 7-nanometer franchising in the gaming business and also in your training accelerator program? And I wonder if that might be waiting for some of those products or at least the anticipation of those might be the cause of a little bit of a pause here.","And secondly, Colette maybe you could talk us through your expectations. I understand there's a lack of visibility in certain parts of the business on revenue that maybe you could talk about OpEx trends through the rest of the year where you might have a little more visibility. Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang","The entire reason for Q4 and Q1 is attributed to oversupply in the channel as a result of cryptocurrency, has nothing to do with Turing in fact. Turing is off to a faster start than Pascal was. And it continues to be on a faster pace than Pascal was. And so, the pause in gaming is now behind us, we're on a growth trajectory with gaming, RTX has took the lead on Ray tracing and is now going to become the standard for next generation gaming support from basically every major platform and software provider on the planet.","And our notebook growth is going to be really great because of the Max-Q design that we invented and the last couple of quarters have also intersected with overlapped with the seasonal slowdown that -- not so, but build that the seasonal builds of the Nintendo switch and we're going to go back to normal build cycle.","And as Colette said earlier somewhere between Q2 and Q3, we'll get back to normal levels for gaming. And so we're off to a great start in Turing and I'm super excited about that. And then, in the second half of the year, we would have fully ramped up from top to bottom, our Turing architecture spanning everything from 179 to as high performance as you like. And we have the best price best performance and best GPU at every single price point. And so, I think we're in pretty good shape.","In terms of process notes we tend to design our own process with TSMC. If you look at our process and you measure its energy efficiency, it's off the charts. And in fact, if you take our Turing and you compare it against a 7-nanometer GPU on energy efficiency, it's incomparable. In fact, the world's 7-nanometer GPU already exists and it's easy to go and pull that and compare the performance and energy efficiency against one of our current GPUs. And so that the real focus for our engineering team is to engineer a process that makes sense for us and to create an architecture that is energy efficient. And the combination of those two things allows us to sustain our leadership position. Otherwise, buying off the shelf process is something that we can surely do, but we want to do much more than that.","Colette Kress","And to the second question regarding OpEx trajectory for the rest of the year. We're still on track to our thoughts on leaving the fiscal year with the year-over-year growth and overall OpEx on a non-GAAP basis in a high single digit. We'll see probably an increase sequentially quarter-to-quarter along there. But our year-over-year growth start to decline as we will not be growing at the speed that we did in this past year. But, I do believe we're on track to meet that goal.","Operator","And I'll now turn the call back over to Jen-Hsun for any closing remarks.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Thanks everyone. We're glad to be returning to growth. We are focused on driving three growth strategies. First, RTX ray tracing. It's now clear that ray tracing is the future of gaming and digital design. And NVIDIA RTX is leading the way with the support of Microsoft DXR, Epic, Unity, Adobe and Autodesk. Game publishers like EA, movie studios like Pixar, industry support has been fantastic.","Second, accelerated computing and AI computing, the pause in hyperscale spending will pass. Accelerated computing and AI are the greatest forces in computing today and NVIDIA is leading these movements. Whether cloud or enterprise or AI at the edge for 5G or industries NVIDIA is one scalable architecture from cloud to edge is a focal point platform for the industry to build AI upon.","Third robotics, some call it embedded AI, some edge AI or autonomous machines. The same computing architecture is used for self-driving cars, pick and place robotics arms, delivery drones and smart retail stores. Every machine that move or machines that watch other things that move whether with driver or driverless will have robotics and AI capabilities. Our strategy is to create an end-to-end platform that spans NVIDIA's DGX AI computing infrastructure to NVIDIA Constellation simulation to NVIDIA AGX embedded AI computing.","And finally, we're super excited about the pending acquisition of Mellonox. Together we can advance cloud and edge architectures for HPC and AI computing. See you next quarter.","Operator","And this concludes today's conference call.

Kress - NVIDIA Corp.","Thanks, Shawn.","We had a strong start to the year. Highlighting our record first quarter was a near tripling of data center revenue, reflecting surging interest in artificial intelligence. Overall, quarterly revenue reached $1.94 billion, up 48% from the year earlier, down 11% sequentially and above our outlook of $1.9 billion. Growth remained broad-based, with year-on-year gains in each of our four platforms, gaming, professional visualization, data center, and automotive.","From a reporting segment perspective, Q1 GPU revenue grew 45% to $1.56 billion from a year earlier, and Tegra processor revenue more than doubled to $332 million. And we recognized the remaining $43 million in revenue from our Intel agreement.","Let's start with our gaming platforms. Gaming revenue in the first quarter was $1.03 billion, up 49% year on year. Gamers continue to show great interest in the Pascal-based GPUs, including gaming notebooks. Our Tegra gaming platform also did extremely well.","Demand remained healthy for our enthusiast class GeForce GTX 1080 GPU, introduced nearly a year ago. It was complemented this past quarter with the GTX 1080 Ti, which runs 35% faster and was launched at the annual Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. The GTX 1080 Ti is designed to handle the demands of 4K gaming and high-end VR experiences. Typical of many supportive reviews, Ars Technica stated it is undoubtedly a fantastic piece of engineering, cool, quiet, and without rival. Those that demand the absolute very best in cutting-edge graphics need look no further.","We also released the next generation of our TITAN-class product, the TITAN Xp, designed for enthusiasts and researchers who demand extreme performance. Gaming continues to be driven by the headlong growth in e-sports. The newest title, Overwatch, added 30 million gamers in its first year. GeForce was the graphics platform of choice at all the top e-sports tournaments, including the finals of the big four international competitions. With apologies to the start of the baseball season, e-sports is now as popular among U.S. male millennials as America's favorite pastime. More people watch gaming than HBO, Netflix, ESPN, and Hulu combined.","GeForce sales remained underpinned by the steady stream of AAA titles coming onto market, which continued to push for more chip GPU performance. In the months ahead, we'll see a series of highly anticipated blockbuster titles. Among them are Destiny 2 coming to the PC for the first time, Star Wars Battlefront II, Shadow of War, and the next installment of the Call of Duty franchise, World War II.","We are excited to be working within Nintendo on its acclaimed Switch gaming system. Great reviews and reports of the system selling out in many geographies are a strong part of this platform.","Moving to professional visualization, Quadro revenue grew to $205 million, up 8% from a year ago, amid continued demand for high-end real-time rendering and more powerful mobile workstations. We are seeing significant increase in professional VR solutions, driven by Quadro P6000 GPUs. Lockheed Martin is deploying Quadro to create realistic VR walk-throughs of the U.S. Navy's most advanced ships. The Marines utilize VR to train air crew personnel. And IKEA is rolling out VR to many of its stores, helping consumers configure their kitchens from a huge array of options, which they can visualize in sharp detail.","Next, data center, record revenue of $409 million was nearly triple that of a year ago. The 38% rise from Q4 marked its seventh consecutive quarter of sequential improvement. Driving growth was demand from cloud service providers and enterprises building training clusters for web services, plus strong gains in high-performance computing, GRID graphics virtualization, and our DGX-1 AI super-computer.","AI has quickly emerged as the single most powerful force in technology, and at the center of AI are NVIDIA GPUs. All of the world's major Internet and cloud service providers now use NVIDIA Tesla-based GPU accelerators, AWS, Facebook, Google, IBM, and Microsoft as well as Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent. We also announced that Microsoft is bringing NVIDIA Tesla P100 and P40 GPUs to its Azure cloud.","Organizations are increasingly building out AI-enabled applications using training clusters, evident in part by growing demand for DGX-1. We are seeing a number of significant deals. Among them are Fujitsu's installment of 24 systems integrated into an AI supercomputer for RIKEN, Japan's largest research center, as well as new supercomputers at Oxford University, GE, and Audi.","Working with Facebook, we announced the launch of the Caffe2 deep learning framework as well as Big Basin servers with Tesla P100 GPUs.","To help meet huge demand for expertise in the field of AI, we announced earlier today plans to train 100 people this year through the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute, representing a 10x increase from last year. Through onsite training, public events, and online courses, DLI provides practical training on the tools of AI to developers, data scientists, and researchers.","Our HPC business doubled year on year, driven by the adoption of Tesla GPUs into supercomputing centers worldwide. The use of AI and accelerated computing in HPC is driving additional demand in governance intelligence, higher education research, and finance. Our GRID graphics virtualization business more than tripled, driven by growth in business services, education, and automotive. Intuit's latest TurboTax release deploys GRID to connect tax filers seeking real-time advice with CPAs. And Honda is using GRID to bring together engineering and design teams based in different countries.","Finally, automotive, revenue grew to a record $140 million, up 24% year over year and 9% sequentially, primarily from infotainment modules. We are continuing to expand our partnerships with companies using AI to address the complex problems of autonomous driving. Since our DRIVE PX 2 AI car platform began shipping just one year ago, more than 225 car and truck makers, suppliers, research organizations, and startups have begun developing with it. That number has grown by more than 50% in the past quarter alone, the result of the platform's enhanced processing power and the introduction of Tensor RT for its in-vehicle AI inferencing.","This quarter, we announced two important partnerships. Bosch, the world's largest auto supplier, which does business all over the world's carmakers, is working to create a new AI self-driving car computer based on our Xavier platform. And PACCAR, one of the largest truck makers, is developing self-driving solutions for Peterbilt, Kenworth, and DAF.","We continue to view AI as the only solution for autonomous driving. The nearly infinite range of road conditions, traffic patterns, and unexpected events are impossible to anticipate with hand-coded software or computer vision alone. We expect our DRIVE PX 2 AI platform to be capable of delivering Level 3 autonomy for cars, trucks, and shuttles by the end of the year, with Level 4 autonomy moving into production by the end of 2018.","Now turning to the rest of the Q1 income statement, GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins for the first quarter were 59.4% and 59.6% respectively, reflecting the decline in Intel licensing revenue.","Q1 GAAP operating expenses were $596 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $517 million, up 17% from a year ago, reflecting hiring for our growth initiative.","GAAP operating income was $554 million and non-GAAP operating income was $637 million, nearly doubling from a year ago. For the first quarter, GAAP net income was $507 million. Non-GAAP net income was $533 million, more than doubling from a year ago, reflecting revenue strength as well as gross margin and operating margin expansion.","For fiscal 2018, we intend to return approximately $1.25 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and quarterly cash dividends. In Q1, we issued $82 million in quarterly cash dividends.","Now turning to the outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we expect revenue to be $1.95 billion plus or minus 2%. Excluding the expiry of the Intel licensing agreement, total revenue is expected to grow 3% sequentially. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 58.4%, 58.6% respectively plus or minus 50 basis points. These reflect approximately a 100 basis points impact from the expiry of the Intel licensing agreement.","GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $605 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $530 million. GAAP OI&E is expected to be an expense of approximately $8 million, inclusive of additional charges from early conversions of convertible notes. Non-GAAP OI&E is expected to be an expense of approximately $3 million.","GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 are both expected to be 17% plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website.","Finally, this week we are sponsoring our annual GPU Technology Conference here in Silicon Valley. Reflecting the surging importance of accelerating computing, GTC has grown to more than 7,000 attendees from 60 countries, up from 1,000 when we started eight years ago. Among its highlights, Jen-Hsun will deliver a news-filled keynote tomorrow morning. We have 550-plus talks, more than half on AI. Developers will have access to 70 labs and workshops to learn about deep learning and GPU computing. And we will award a total of $1.5 million to the six most promising companies among the 1,300 in our Inception program for AI startups. We will be hosting our annual Investor Day tomorrow and hope to see many of you there.","We will now open the call for questions. Please limit your questions to two. Operator, will you please poll for the questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Your first question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis from Jefferies.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","Thanks for taking my questions. On the HPC and data center business, clearly impressive growth, and I'm hoping that you can maybe drill down on the drivers here. I guess on the cloud side, we think of two different areas: GPU as a service versus the cloud companies' own AI effort. And I'm hoping you could help us understand to the extent where the demand is falling into either one of those buckets.","And then on the enterprise side, I think there's a view out there that the enterprise is going to the cloud. So to hear you talk about training clusters for web services is very interesting, and I was hoping you could provide some more color on that demand driver.","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","Yeah, Mark, thanks for your question. So our GPU computing business for data center is growing very fast, and it's growing on multiple dimensions. On the one hand, there's high-performance computing using traditional numerical methods. We call that HPC. That's growing. There's in enterprise the virtualization of graphics. There's a whole lot of desktop PCs running around. However, more and more people would like to have thinner laptops or they would like to have a different type of computer and still be able to run Windows. And they would like to virtualize basically their entire PC and put it in the data center. It's easier to manage. The total cost of ownership is lower. And mobile employees could enjoy their work wherever they happen to be. And so the second pillar of that is called GRID, and it's basically virtualizing the PC. And as you can tell, virtualization, mobility, better security, those are all driving forces there.","And then there's the Internet companies. And the Internet companies, as you mentioned, really have two pillars. There's the Internet service provision part, where they're using deep learning for their own applications, whether it's photo tagging or product recommendation or recommending a restaurant or something you should buy or personalizing your webpage, helping you with search, provisioning up the right apps, the right advertisement, language translation, speech recognition, so on and so forth. There's a whole bunch of amazing applications that are made possible by deep learning. And so Internet service providers are using it for internal application development.","And then lastly, what you mentioned is cloud service providers. And basically, because of the adoption of GPUs and because of the success of CUDA and so many applications are now able to be accelerated on GPUs, so that we can extend the capabilities of Moore's Law so that we can continue to have the benefits of computing acceleration, which in the cloud means reducing cost. That's on the cloud service provider side of the Internet companies. So that would be Amazon Web Services, it's the Google Compute cloud, Microsoft Azure, the IBM cloud, Alibaba's Aliyun (18:31 \u2013 19:03) by Microsoft Azure. We're starting to see almost every single cloud service around the world standardizing on VM video architecture, so we're seeing a lot of growth there as well. So I think the nut of it all is that we're seeing data center growth and GPU computing across the board.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","As a follow-up if I may, on the gaming side, what we have observed over time is that when you launch a new platform, it definitely creates demand, and you see 12 months of very good visibility into growth. And I was wondering if you see the data center numbers come in quarter after quarter here. To what extent do you think the data center demand that you're seeing is \u2013 I know probably you're only able to answer qualitatively. But to what extent do you think the data center is secular versus you have a new platform and there's just platform-driven demand?","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","PC gaming is growing. There's no question about that. E-sports is growing the number of players in e-sports. The number of people who are enjoying e-sports is growing. MOBA [Multiplayer Online Battle Arena] is growing. I think it's amazing the growth of MOBA and the latest games. And of course, the first-party titles, the AAA titles are doing great. Battlefield is doing great, and I'm looking forward to the new Battlefield. I'm looking forward to the new Star Wars and I'm looking forward to the first time that Destiny is coming to the PC. As you know, it was a super hit on consoles, but the first-generation Destiny wasn't available on PC. Destiny 2 is coming to the PC, so I think the anticipation is pretty great. So I would say that PC gaming continues to grow, and it's hard to imagine people [audio gap] (21:03 \u2013 21:39) around in another amazing world. So I think people are going to be amazed at how long the alternate reality of the videogame market is going to continue.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the solid results and execution. Jen-Hsun, for my first one, it's on the competitive landscape in your data center business. There has been more noise around FPGA or CPU or ASIC solutions also chasing the same market. What do you think is NVIDIA's sustainable competitive advantage? And what role is CUDA playing in helping you maintain this lead in this business?","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","Vivek, thanks for the question. First of all, it's really important to understand that the data centers, the cloud service providers, the Internet companies, they all get lumped together in one conversation. But obviously, the way they use computers are very different.","There are three major pillars of computing up in the cloud or in large data centers, hyperscale. One pillar is just internal use of computing systems, for developing, for training, for advancing artificial intelligence. That's a high-performance computing problem. It's a very complicated software problem. The algorithms are changing all the time. They're incredibly complicated. The work that the AI researchers are doing are not trivial, and that's why they're in such great demand. And it's also the reason why computing resources have to be provisioned to them so that they can be productive. Having a scarce AI researcher waiting around for a computer to finish simulation or training is really quite unacceptable.","And so that first pillar is the market that we \u2013 is a segment of the (23:46 \u2013 24:18) once the network is trained, it is put into production. Like for example, your Alexa speakers have a little tiny network inside. And so obviously, you can do inferencing on Alexa. It does voice recognition on a hot keyword. In the long term, your car will be able to do voice recognition and speech recognition. (24:42) Are we okay? Are we still on?","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. I think the...","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","No, Vivek, I was wondering whether the phone line was cut or not. So anyways, the second pillar is inferencing. And inferencing as it turns out is far, far less complicated than training. It's a trillion times less complicated, a billion times. It's a trillion times less complicated. And so once the network is trained, it can be deployed. And there are thousands of networks that are going to be running inside these hyperscale data centers, thousands of different networks, not one, thousands of different types. And they're detecting all kinds of different things. They're inferring all kinds of different things, classifying, predicting, all kinds of different things, whether it's photo or voice or videos or searches or whatnot.","And in that particular case, our advantage \u2013 in that particular case, the current incumbent is CPUs. The CPU is really the only processor at the moment that has the ability to basically run every single network. And I think that's a real opportunity for us, and it's a growth opportunity for us. And one would suggest that FPGA is as well. One would suggest that ASICs like TPUs, TPUs and ASIC is as well. And I would urge you to come to the keynote tomorrow, and maybe I'll say a few words about that tomorrow as well.","And then the last pillar is cloud service providers, and that's basically the outward public cloud provisioning a computing approach. It's not about provisioning inferencing. It's not about provisioning GPUs. It's really provisioning a computing platform. And that's one of the reasons why the NVIDIA CUDA platform and all of our software stack that we've created over time, whether it's for deep learning or molecular dynamics or all kinds of high-performance computing codes or linear algebra or computer graphics, all of our different software stacks make our cloud computing platform valuable, and that's why it's become the industry standard for GPU computing. And so those are three different pillars of hyperscalers, and it's just important to segment them so that we don't get confused.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's very helpful. And as my quick follow-up, Jen-Hsun, there is a perception that your gaming business has been driven a lot more by pricing and adoption of more premium product, and hence there could be some kind of feeling to how much gamers are willing to pay for these products. Could you address that? Are you seeing the number of gamers and the number of cards grow, and how long can they continue to reach for more premium products? Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","The average selling price of the NVIDIA GeForce is about a third of a game console. That's the way to think about it. That's the simple math. People are willing to spend $200, $300, $400, $500 for a new game console, and the NVIDIA GeForce GPU PC gaming card is on average far less.","There are people who just absolutely demand the best. And the reason for that is because they're driving a monitor or they're driving multiple monitors at a refresh rate well beyond a TV. So if you have a 4K or you want 120 hertz or some people are even driving it to 200 hertz, those kind of displays demand a lot more horsepower to drive than an average television, whether it's 1080p or 4K at 60 frames a second or 30 frames a second. And so the amount of horsepower they need is great. But that's just because they just really love their rig, and they're surrounded in it, and they just want the best.","But the way to think about that is ultimately that's the opportunity for us. I think GeForce is a game console. And the right way to think about that is at an equivalent ASP of some $200 \u2013 $300, that's probably potentially an opportunity ahead for GeForce.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore.","C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC","Good afternoon, thank you for taking my questions. I guess first question is around gaming. I was hoping you could walk through how you're thinking about seasonality here in calendar 2017, particularly as Pascal launch calendarizes and you get both to launch coming I presume early 2018. I would love to hear your thoughts on how we should think about the trajectory of that business.","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","First of all, GeForce is sold a unit at a time and it's sold all over the world and it's a consumer product. It's a product that is sold both into our installed base as well as growing our installed base.","When we think about GeForce, these are the parameters involved. How much of our installed base has upgraded to Pascal? How much of our installed base is growing? How is gaming growing overall? What are the driving dynamics of gaming, whether it's team sports or MOBA or using games for artistic expression? It's related to the AAA titles that are coming out. Some years the games are just incredible. Some years the games are less incredible. These days the production quality of the games have just become systematically so good that we've had years now of blockbuster hits. So these are really the dimensions of it.","And then it's overlaid on top of it with some seasonality because people do buy graphics cards and game consoles for Christmas and the holidays, and there are international holidays where people are given money as gifts and they save up the money for a new game console or a new game platform. And so in a lot of ways our business is driven by games, so it's not unlike the characteristics of the rest of the gaming industry.","C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC","Very helpful. I guess as my follow-up, on the inventory side, that grew I think 3% sequentially. Can you walk through the moving parts there? What's driving that, and is foundry diversification part of that? Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","The driving reasons for inventory growth is new products, and that's probably all I ought to say for now. I would come to GTC. Come to the keynote tomorrow. I think it will be fun.","C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC","Great, thanks a lot.","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","Yeah, thanks, C.J.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, congrats on the strong quarter. Jen-Hsun, can you maybe talk a little bit about the breadth of your customer base in data center relative to maybe 12 months ago? Are you seeing the same customer group buy more GPUs, or is the growth in your business more a function of the broadening of your customer base?","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","Thanks, Toshiya. Let me think here. I think one year ago \u2013 one year ago was \u2013 maybe it was two years ago. Maybe it was somewhere between 18 months ago or so when I think Jeff Dean gave a talk where he said that Google was using a lot of GPUs for deep learning. I think it wasn't much longer ago than that, and really that was the only public customer that we had in the hyperscale data center. Fast-forward a couple years, we now have basically everybody. Every hyperscaler in the world is using NVIDIA for either deep learning, for some announcements that you'll read about in data center deployment, tomorrow hopefully. And then a lot of them have now standardized on provisioning the NVIDIA architecture in the cloud.","And so I guess in the course of one or two years, we went from basically hyperscale being an insignificant part of our overall business to quite a large part of our business, and as you can see, also the fastest-growing part of the business.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then as my follow-up, I had a question for Colette. Three months ago, I think you went out of your way to guide data center up sequentially. And for the July quarter, ex the Intel business going away, you're guiding revenue up 3% sequentially. Can you maybe provide some additional color for the individual segment? Thank you.","Colette M. Kress - NVIDIA Corp.","Thanks for the question. We feel good about the guidance that we're providing for Q2. We wanted to make sure that it was understood the impact of Intel that's incorporated in there. It's still too early, given that it's \u2013 to say about the same size of what we just finished in Q1 to make comments specifically exactly where we think each one of those businesses will end up. But again, we do believe data center is a super-great opportunity for us. I think you'll hear more about that tomorrow. But we don't have any more additional details on our guidance, but we feel good about the guidance that we gave.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citigroup.","Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the strong results and guide. Jen-Hsun, can you talk about the adoption of GPU in the cloud? At the CES earlier this year, you guys announced GeForce NOW. Curious how the adoption of GeForce is going.","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","Yes, Atif, thanks for the question. GeForce NOW is really an exciting platform. It virtualizes GeForce. It puts it in the cloud, turns it into a gaming PC that's a service, that can be streamed as a service. And I said at GTC that around this time that we'll likely open it up for external beta. We've been running internal beta for some time, and we'll shortly go to external beta. And the last time I checked, there's many, many tens of thousands of people who are signed up for external beta trials. And so I'm looking forward to letting people try it.","But the important thing to realize about that is that's still years away from really becoming a major gaming service. And it's still years away from being able to find the right balance between cost and quality of service and the pervasiveness of virtualizing a gaming PC. So we've been working on it for several years, and these things take a while. My personal experience is almost every great thing takes about a decade. And if that's so, then we've got a few more years to go.","Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. As a follow-up, with your win and success in Nintendo Switch, does that open up the console market with other console makers? Is that a business that is of interest to you?","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","Consoles is not really a business to us. It's a business to them. And we're selected to work on these consoles. And if it makes sense and the strategic alignment is great and we're in a position to be able to do it, because the opportunity cost of building a game console is quite high. The number of engineers who know how to build computing platforms like this \u2013 and in the case of the Nintendo Switch, it's just an incredible console that fits in such a small form factor. And it could both be a mobile gaming device as well as a console gaming device. It's just really quite amazing, and they just did an amazing job.","Somebody asked me a few months ago before it was launched how I thought it was going to do. And of course without saying anything about it, I said that it delighted me in a way that no game console has done in the last 10 \u2013 15 years. And it's true, this is a really, really innovative product and really quite ingenious. And if you ever have a chance to get it in your hands, it's just really delightful.","And so in that case, the opportunity to work on it was just really, really too enticing. We really wanted to do it, but it always requires deep strategic thought because it took several hundred engineers to work on, and they could be working on something else like all of the major initiatives we have. And so we have to be mindful about the strategic opportunity cost that goes along with these. But in the case of the Nintendo Switch, it's just a home run. I'm so glad I did it, and it was the perfect collaboration for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis from B. Riley.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Yes, thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the real strong execution. I wanted to follow up on some of the prepared comments on automotive with my first question, and it's this. I think Colette mentioned that there were 225 car and truck development engagements that were underway, up 50% in the last quarter. The question is, as you engage with those partners, what's NVIDIA finding in terms of the time from engagement to revenue generation? And what are you finding with your hit rate in terms of converting those individual engagements into revenues?","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","I know the second one easier. The second one is the revenue contribution is not significant at the time \u2013 at this moment. But I expect it to be high, and that's why we're working on it. The 200 developers who are working on the DRIVE PX platform are doing it in a lot of different ways. And at the core, it's because in the future, every aspect of transportation will be autonomous. And if you think through what's going on in the world, one of the most important and powerful effects that's happening right now is the Amazon effect. We're grabbing our phone, we're buying something, and we expect it to be delivered to us tomorrow.","When you sent up those set of electronic instruction, the next thing that had to happen is a whole bunch of trucks have to move around, and they have to go from trucks to maybe smaller trucks and from smaller trucks to maybe a small van that ultimately delivers it to your house. And so if you will, transportation is the physical Internet. It's the atomic Internet. It's the molecular Internet of society. And without it, everything that we're experiencing today wouldn't be able to continue to scale.","And so you could imagine everything from autonomous trucks to autonomous cars surely and autonomous shuttles and vans and motorcycles and small pizza delivery robots and drones and things like that. And for a long time, it's going to augment truck drivers and delivery professionals, who quite frankly we just don't have enough of. The world is just growing too fast in an instant delivery delivered to your home, delivered to you right now phenomenon, and we just don't have enough delivery professionals. And so I think autonomous capability is going to make it possible for us to take pressure off that system and reduce the amount of accidents and make it possible for that entire infrastructure to be a lot more productive.","And so that's one of the reasons why you're seeing so much enthusiasm. It's not just the branded cars. I think the branded cars get a lot of attention and we're excited about our partnerships there. And gosh, I love driving autonomous cars. But in the final analysis, I think the way to think about the autonomous future is every aspect of mobility and transportation and delivery will have autonomous \u2013 will be augmented by AI.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","That's very helpful color, Jen-Hsun. The follow-up is related to the data center business, and you provided a lot a very useful customer and other information. My question is higher level. Given your very unique position in helping to nurture AI for the last many years and your deep insights into the way that customers are adopting this, as investors try and understand the sustainability of recent growth, can you help us understand where you believe AI adoption is overall? And since Colette threw out a baseball comment earlier, if we thought about AI adoption in reference to a nine-inning game, where are we in that nine-inning game?","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","Let's see here. It's a great question, and there are a couple ways to come at it. First of all, AI is going to infuse all of software. AI is going to eat software. Whereas Marc [Andreessen] said that software is going to eat the world, AI is going to eat software, and it's going to be in every aspect of software. Every single software developer has to learn deep learning. Every single software developer has to apply machine learning. Every software developer will have to learn AI. Every single company will use AI. AI is the automation of automation, and it will likely be the transmission. We're going to for the first time see the transmission of automation the way we're seeing the transmission and wireless broadcast of information for the very first time. I'm going to be able to send you automation, send you a little automation by email.","And so the ability for AI to transform industry is well understood now. It's really about automation of everything, and the implication of it is quite large. We've been using now deep learning \u2013 we've been in the area of deep learning for about six years. And the rest of the world has been focused on deep learning for about somewhere between one to two, and some of them are just learning about it.","And almost no companies today use AI in a large way. So on the one hand, we know now that the technology is of extreme value, and we're getting a better understanding of how to apply it. On the other hand, no industry uses it at the moment. The automotive industry is in the process of being revolutionized because of it. The manufacturing industry will be. Everything in transport will be. Retail, e-tail, everything will be. And so I think the impact is going to be large, and we're just getting started. We're just getting started.","Now that's kind of a first inning thing. The only trouble with a baseball analogy is that in the world of tech, things don't \u2013 every inning is not the same. In the beginning the first inning feels like \u2013 it feels pretty casual and people are enjoying peanuts. The second inning for some reason is shorter and the third inning is shorter than that and the fourth inning is shorter than that. And the reason for that is because of exponential growth. Speed is accelerating.","And so from the bystanders who are on the outside looking in, by the time the third inning comes along, it's going to feel like people are traveling at the speed of light next to you. If you happen to be on one of the photons, you're going to be okay. But if you're not on the deep learning train in a couple of two, three innings, it's gone. And so that's the challenge of that analogy because things aren't moving in linear time. Things are moving exponentially.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann with Rosenblatt Securities.","Hans Mosesmann - Rosenblatt Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Congratulations, guys. Hey, Jen-Hsun, can you give us like a state of the union on process node and technology roadmaps that you guys see? Intel made a pretty nice exposition of where they are in terms of their transistors and so on. So what's your comfort level as you see process technology and your roadmaps for new GPUs? Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","Yes. Hi, Hans. I think there are a couple of ways to think about it. First of all, we know that this is the \u2013 we know that some \u2013 the world calls it the end of Moore's Law, but it's really the end of two dynamics that has happened. And one dynamic of course is the end of processor architecture productive innovation, end of instruction-level parallelism advances. The second is the end of Dennard scaling. And the combination of those two things makes it look like it's the end of Moore's Law.","The easy way to think about that is that we can no longer rely \u2013 if we want to advance computing performance, we can no longer rely on transistor advances alone. That's one of the reasons why NVIDIA has never been obsessed about having the latest transistors. We want the best transistors. There's no question about it, but we don't need it to advance. And the reason for that is because we advance computing on such a multitude of levels, all the way from architecture, this architecture we call GPU accelerated computing, to the software stacks on top, to the algorithms on top, to the applications that we work with. We tune it across the top, from top to bottom all the way from bottom to top.","And so as a result, transistors is just one of the 10 things that we use. And like I said, it's really, really important to us. And I want the best, and TSMC provides us the absolute best that we can get, and we push along with them as hard as we can. But in the final analysis, it's one of the tools in the box.","Hans Mosesmann - Rosenblatt Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley.","Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thank you. I've attended GTC the last couple days. I'm really quite impressed by the breadth of presentations and the number of industries you guys are affecting. And I guess, just on that note, how do you think about segmenting the sales effort? Do you have a healthcare vertical, an avionics vertical, a financial vertical, or is it having the best building blocks and you're letting your customers discover stuff?","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","Thanks a lot, Joe. You answered it right there. It's both of those. The first thing is that we have developed platforms that are useful per industry. And so we have a team working with the healthcare industry. We have a team that's working with the Internet service providers. We have a team that's working with the manufacturing industry. We have a team that's working with the financial services industry. We have a team that's working with media and entertainment and with enterprise, with the automotive industry. And so we have different verticals. We call them verticals, and we have teams of business development people, developer relations, a computational mathematician that works with each one of the industries to optimize their software for our GPU computing platform.","And so it starts with developing a platform stack. Of course, one of our most famous examples of that is our gaming business. It's just another vertical for us, and it starts with GameWorks that runs on top of GeForce, and it has its own ecosystem of partners. And so that's for each one of the verticals and each one of the ecosystems.","And then the second thing that we do is we have horizontally partner management teams that work with our partners, the OEM partners and the go-to-market partners, so that we could help them succeed. And then of course, we rely a great deal on the extended salesforce of our partners so they can help to evangelize our computing platform all over the world. And so it's this mixed approach between dedicated vertical market business development teams as well as a partnership approach to partner with our OEM partners that has really made our business scale so fast.","Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, that's helpful. Thank you. And then the other question I had was regarding Colette's comment that HPC had doubled year on year. Just wondering if you had any comments on what drove that. And is that an indication of the supercomputer types of businesses, or are there other dynamics in terms of addressing new workloads with HPC products?","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","HPC is different than supercomputing. Supercomputing to us is a collection of \u2013 not a collection, but is 20 different supercomputing sites around the world. And some of the famous ones, whether it's Oak Ridge or Blue Water at UCSC, you've got TITech in Japan. There are supercomputing centers that are either national supercomputing centers or they could be public and open supercomputing centers for open science. And so we consider those supercomputing centers.","High-performance computing is used by companies who are using simulation approaches to develop products or to simulate something. It could be scenarios for predicting equity, or for example, as you guys know, Wall Street is the home of some of the largest supercomputing or high-performance computing centers. The energy industry, Schlumberger, for example, is a great partner of ours, and they have a massive, massive high-performance computing infrastructure. And Procter & Gamble uses high-performance computers to simulate their products. I think last year McDonald's was at GTC, and I hope they come this year as well.","And so I think high-performance computing, another way of thinking about it is that more and more people really have to use simulation approaches for product discovery and product design and product simulation and to stress the products beyond what is possible in a physical way so that they understand the tolerance of the products and make sure they're as reliable as possible.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, thanks for taking my questions and nice results. Just curious, Jen-Hsun, you've seen a half dozen, dozen private companies going after the desiccant (54:35) silicon Google TPU. I know you felt the comparison to a CPU maybe wasn't fair, but I was just curious your response to these claims of 10x, 100x, 500x performance better than a GPU.","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","It's not that it's not fair. It's just not right; it's not correct. And so in business, who cares about being fair? And so I wasn't looking for fair; I was just looking for right. And so the data has to be correct. It turns out, and I said earlier that our hyperscale businesses have three different pillars. There's training, which our GPUs are quite good at. There's cloud service provision, which is a GPU computing architecture opportunity where CUDA is really the reason why people are adopting it and all the applications that have adopted CUDA over the years. And then there's inferencing, and inferencing is a zero opportunity for us, a zero business for us at the moment. We do 0% of our business in inferencing, and it's 100% on CPUs.","And in the case of Google, they did a great thing and built a TPU as an ASIC. And they compared the TPU against one of our older GPUs. And so I published a blog. I wrote a blog to clarify some of the comparisons, and you can look that up. But the way to think about that is our Pascal was probably approximately twice the performance of the TPU, the first-generation TPU. And it's incumbent upon us to continue to drive the performance of inferencing. This is something that's still kind of new for us. And tomorrow I'm probably going to say a few words about inferencing and maybe introduce a few ideas, but inferencing is new to us. There are 10 million CPUs in the world in the cloud, and today many of them are running Hadoop and doing queries and looking up files and things like that.","But in the future, the belief is that the vast majority of the world's cloud queries will be inference queries, will be AI queries. Every single query that goes into the cloud will likely have some artificial intelligence network that it processes, and I think that's our opportunity. We have an opportunity to do inferencing better than anybody in the world, and it's up to us to prove it. At the moment, I think it's safe to say that the P40, the Tesla P40 is the fastest on the planet, period. And then from here on forward, it's incumbent upon us to continue to lean into that and do a better job.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. And then just moving to the gaming GPU side, I was just wondering if you can just talk about the competitive landscape looking back at the last refresh. And then looking forward into the back half of this year, I think your competitors have a new platform. I'm just curious as to your thoughts as to how the share worked out on the previous refresh and then the competitiveness into the second half of this year.","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","My assessment is that the competitive position is not going to change.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's a short answer, thank you.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Mitch Steves from RBC.","Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just have one actually on the gaming side. I remember at CES you had mentioned a leasing model that almost effectively target the low-end consumer of gaming products. So I'm just wondering if that will be some catalyst in the back half. Or how do we think about gaming working out in terms of both the leasing model and the year-over-year comparison getting a bit difficult?","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","Hi, Mitch. I was just talking about that earlier in one of the questions called GeForce NOW. And I announced at CES and I said that right around this time of year we're going to open it up for external beta. We've been running internal beta and closed beta for some time. And so we're looking forward to opening up the external beta.","My expectation is that it's going to be some time as we scale that out. It's going to take several years. I don't think it's something that's going to be an overnight success. And as you know, overnight successes don't happen overnight.","However, I'm optimistic about the opportunity to extend the GeForce platform beyond the gamers that we currently have in our installed base. There are several billion gamers on the planet. And I believe that every human will be a gamer someday, and every human will have some way to enjoy an alternative universe some way someday. And we would love to be the company that brings it to everybody. And the only way to really do that on a very, very large scale basis and reach all those people is over the cloud.","And so I think our PC gaming business is going to continue to be quite vibrant. It's going to continue to advance, and then hopefully we can overlay our cloud reach on top of that over time.","Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it, thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","Thanks a lot, thanks for all the questions today. I really appreciate it. We had another record quarter. We saw growth across our four market platforms. AI is expanding. Data center nearly tripled, large ISP\/CSP deployments everywhere. PC gaming is still growing, e-sports, AAA gaming titles fueling our growth there. And we have great games on the horizon. Autonomous vehicles becoming imperative on all sectors of transportations, as we talked about earlier. We have a great position with our DRIVE AI computing platform.","And as Moore's Law continues to slow, GPU accelerated computing is becoming more important than ever, and NVIDIA is at the center of that. Don't miss tomorrow's GTC keynote. We'll have exciting news to share, next-generation AI, self-driving cars, exciting partnerships, and more.

Welcome to NVIDIA's financial results conference call.","Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Shawn Simmons from Investor Relations. Please begin your conference.","Shawn Simmons - NVIDIA Corp.","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to NVIDIA's conference call for the second quarter of fiscal 2018. With me on the call today from NVIDIA are Jensen Huang, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Colette Kress, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","I'd like to remind you that our call is being webcast live on NVIDIA's Investor Relations website. It's also being recorded. You can hear a replay via telephone until August 17, 2017. The webcast will be available for replay up until next quarter's conference call to discuss Q3 financial results.

Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements.","During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO commentary, which is posted on our website.","With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.","Colette M. Kress - NVIDIA Corp.","Thanks, Shawn. NVIDIA continues to fire on all cylinders. We achieved strong revenue in each of our businesses. Data center revenue grew more than 2.5 times, reflecting momentum behind artificial intelligence as we expanded our product portfolio and began shipping our new Volta platform.","Overall, quarterly revenue reached a record $2.23 billion, up 56% from a year earlier, up 15% sequentially, and well above our outlook of $1.95 billion. From a reporting segment perspective, Q2 GPU revenue increased 59% to $1.9 billion from a year earlier. Tegra processor revenue doubled to $333 million. OEM revenue reached $251 million, reflecting sales of our cryptocurrency-specific GPUs, partially offset by the lapse in our licensing agreement with Intel.","Let's start with our gaming platform. Gaming revenue was $1.19 billion, up 52% year on year and up 15% from Q1. This reflects the vibrant gaming ecosystem, underpinned by continued excitement over our recent launch GPUs and other technologies, great games, and growing interest in e-sports. Gamers continue to love our Pascal-based GPUs, with demand remaining strong for GeForce GTX 10 series products. Our new Max-Q design approach, enabling gaming notebooks that are thinner, lighter, and faster, is finding a strong market. Max-Q is being utilized in more than 20 new notebook models from a wide range of OEMs.","Quality games continue to drive GPU sales. At the E3 Gaming Expo in L.A., we showed the eagerly anticipated Destiny 2 running in 4K on PCs, which drew rave reviews. Major fall titles in addition to Destiny 2 include the new Call of Duty: WWII, Star Wars: Battlefront 2, and Middle Earth: Shadow of War. We're also seeing the rise of independent titles that have become runaway hits, most notably, a new last man standing shooter called PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS.","Gaming also continues to be driven by the surging popularity of e-sports. This week's biggest sporting event isn't playing out at Dodger Stadium or Wrigley Field. It's in Seattle at the International Dota 2 Championships. The $24 million in prize money is more than twice the purse of golf's richest event, the U.S. Open. For the third straight year, GeForce GTX is Dota 2's official graphics platform.","GPU sales were lifted by demand from increasingly mining activity, or Ethereum. We serve a large portion of this specialized market with a dedicated board, as seen in our OEM sales, and some with GeForce GTX boards. Our strategy is to stay alert to this fast-changing market, knowing that GPUs are highly efficient at running the algorithms used to mine cryptocurrencies.","Moving to professional visualization, Quadro revenue grew $235 million, up 10% from a year ago, up 15% sequentially, on the demand for high-end real-time rendering and for more powerful mobile workstations. Demand was especially strong in education, both among universities and large public school districts, as well as in the financial sector and defense industry.","And last week at SIGGRAPH's computer graphics show, we highlighted how AI will augment the process of content creation. This new OptiX 5.0 SDK uses AI to accelerate ray tracing when running on our DGX rendering appliance that provides the rendering capability of 150 standard dual-CPU servers. We also introduced NVIDIA eGPU system solutions. This creates a new category for our platforms, using an external chassis to expand access to Titan Xp and Quadro GPUs for the 25 million content creators using standard notebook PCs.","Next, data center, revenue of $416 million was up more than 2.5 times from a year ago. This growth, shared across AI, deep learning, high-performance computing, and GRID, is particularly notable, given that we announced and shipped production units of our Volta-based V100 accelerator as we transition from Pascal generation GPUs. Looking ahead, we see inferencing and video transcoding as emerging applications that are well suited for our GPUs. V100 was among the most important launches at this quarter's GPU Technology Conference [GTC]. It provides 10 times the deep learning power of its year-old predecessor, widely outpacing Moore's Law.","Some of the early V100 production units were given out in recent weeks to leading AI researchers attending the CVPR [Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition] and ICML [International Conference on Machine Learning] conferences. We made available our TensorRT 3 inference optimizer and run time for deep learning application. It delivers 100 times faster inferencing on V100 than the best CPU implementation, and it supports the industry's two most common AI frameworks, Google TensorFlow and Facebook's Caffe.","We also entered into a wide range of important partnerships based on AI. Among them, Baidu has aligned with us on Volta. It's bringing this new architecture to its cloud and optimizing the Paddle Paddle open source deep learning framework for Volta. Volkswagen is collaborating with us to bring the power of AI across their organization. And we announced a new partner program with Taiwan's top ODMs, including Foxconn, Inventec, Quanta, Wistron, to provide them with the early access to the HGX reference architecture, GPU computing technologies, and design guidelines.","Demand remains strong for our DGX AI supercomputer, as organizations take on multiple systems to build out AI-enabled applications. Facebook disclosed a system incorporating 128 DGXs. We have shipped systems to more than 300 unique customers, with 1,000-plus in the pipeline.","Our HPC business remained strong. The new Green500 list showed that the world's 13 most efficient supercomputers run on NVIDIA Tesla P100 accelerators. The top position is held by the Tokyo Institute of Technology's TSUBAME3.0 system. It achieved an extraordinary 14.1 gigaflops per watt, 50% higher efficiency than the previous leader, helping to point the way to exascale supercomputing.","Momentum continued in our GRID graphics virtualization business. Among key wins was Amazon Web Services, whose G3 instances now run on NVIDIA Tesla GPUs.","In automotive, revenue grew to $142 million, up 19% year over year. We announced important new partnerships based on our DRIVE PX AI platform, which is being used by more than 225 car and truck makers, Tier 1 suppliers, HD mapping companies, startups, and research institutions.","Additionally, production cars using our technology continued to make their way into the market. Audi announced last month that the 2019 A8 will be the first car to feature NVIDIA's powered Level 3 autonomous technology. This means that under certain specific use cases, it will be able to be driven by its own software without monitoring from the driver. Our DRIVE PX platform is already on the road in Tesla Motors' full line of cars, including the new Model 3, which uses the second-generation Tesla Autopilot.","This quarter, we also announced that Toyota selected NVIDIA DRIVE PX for their next-generation autonomous cars. Volvo, long a byword for safety and value, and Autoliv selected DRIVE PX for self-driving cars targeted to hit the market by 2021. ZF and HELLA have selected the NVIDIA DRIVE PX platform for their line of autonomous vehicle products. And Baidu announced that its Project Apollo open source self-driving platform for the China market will use NVIDIA DRIVE PX. You'll be hearing more from us in the months ahead at regional GTCs that we will be conducting in Beijing, Munich, Tel Aviv, Taipei, Washington DC, and Tokyo.","Now turning to the rest of the Q2 income statement, GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins for the second quarter were 58.4% and 58.6% respectively, reflecting the decline in Intel licensing revenue. Q2 GAAP operating expenses were $614 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $533 million, up 19% from a year ago, reflecting hiring for our growth initiatives.","GAAP operating income was $688 million. Non-GAAP operating income was $773 million, doubling from a year ago. GAAP net income was $583 million, non-GAAP net income $638 million, also doubling from a year ago, reflecting revenue strength as well as gross margin and operating margin expansion.","For fiscal 2018, we intend to return approximately $1.25 billion to shareholders through stock repurchases and quarterly cash dividends. In the first half of fiscal 2018, we have paid $758 million in share repurchases and $166 million in quarterly cash dividends.","Now turning to the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we expect revenue to be $2.35 billion plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 58.6% and 58.8% respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $672 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $570 million. GAAP OI&E is expected to be an expense of approximately $2 million, inclusive of additional charges from the early conversions of convertible notes. Non-GAAP OI&E is expected to be nominal. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 17% plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items.","Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website.","We will now open the call for questions. Please be sure to limit your questions to one or two. Operator, will you please poll for the first question? Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Your first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you for taking my question, maybe a clarification on a question and a question after that on the data center. On the clarification side, we have seen several quarters where your data center business grew very strongly on a sequential basis. This time the growth was somewhat more modest, and I was wondering if there is a little more color around that.","And then the bigger question is, Jensen, it seems the data center market is bifurcating between your GPU approach on one side and ASICs on the other side. What are you doing to make sure that the balance stays in your favor as the market matures from here?","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","So first of all, Q2 was a transition quarter for our data center. I thought we did great. We almost tripled year over year, and we ramped Volta into volume production. And because Volta was so much better than our last generation processor \u2013 Volta is 100 times faster than Kepler, 100 times faster than Kepler just four years ago, and Kepler was already 10 times faster than CPUs. And so Volta was such a giant leap when we announced it in GTC right at the beginning of the quarter. I thought the team did fantastically transitioning the customer base to Volta, and now Volta is in high-volume production.","The application of data center \u2013 you asked a larger question about data center. Data center is a very large market, as you know, and the reason for that is because the vast majority of the world's future computing will be largely done in data centers. And there's a very well accepted notion now that GPU acceleration of servers delivers extraordinary value proposition. If you have a data-intensive application, and the vast majority of the future applications in data centers will be data intensive, a GPU could reduce the number of servers you require or increase the amount of throughput pretty substantially. Just adding one GPU to a server could reduce several hundred thousand dollars of reduction in number of servers. And so the value proposition and the cost savings of using GPUs is quite extraordinary.","There are several applications in data centers. First of all, there's training and there's high-performance computing. There's cloud virtual PC, as what Amazon AWS G3 announcement was about this quarter. And then there are also new applications such as inferencing as these models are now going into production, and the new applications that are coming online, which is likely to overwhelm the Internet in the near future, which is live video, consumers taking live video on their phones and sharing it with their friends.","And there are going to be hundreds of millions of these happening all the time, and each one of these videos will have to be transcoded to a variety of formats to be shared with their friends and also has to be \u2013 you have to perform AI on it instantaneously so that you could avoid inappropriate video from being streamed to large audiences. And so the number of applications where GPUs are valuable, from training to high-performance computing to virtual PCs to new applications like inferencing and transcoding and AI, are starting to emerge.","The one area where you're talking about ASICs and TPUs, TPU is basically an ASIC. The way to think about that is this. After four generations of evolution of our GPU, NVIDIA GPU is basically a TPU that does a lot more. We could perform deep learning applications, whether it's in training or in inferencing now, starting with the Pascal P4 and the Volta generation. We can inference better than any known ASIC on the market that I've ever seen. And so the new generation of our GPUs is essentially a TPU that does a lot more. And we can do all the things that I just mentioned and the vast number of applications that are emerging in the cloud.","And so our belief is this. Our belief is that, number one, a GPU has to be versatile to handle the vast array of big data and data-intensive applications that are happening in the cloud, because the cloud is a computer. It's not an appliance. It's not a toaster. It's not a lightbulb. It's not a microphone. The cloud has a large number of applications that are data-intensive. And second, we have to be world-class at deep learning, and our GPUs have evolved into something that can be absolutely world-class at TPU, but it has to do all of the things that a data center needs to do.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","Thanks for taking my question. It sounds like things went very well on the cryptocurrency side. That market has not had a lot of history, but the little history it has, has had some volatility. And I was wondering if you could help us understand how you think about managing that volatility. And a broader question on this topic is, do you consider cryptocurrency or other blockchain applications on par with your other four big markets?","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","Thanks. Cryptocurrency and blockchain is here to stay. The market need for it is going to grow, and over time it will become quite large. It is very clear that new currencies will come to market, and it's very clear that the GPU is just fantastic at cryptography. And as these new algorithms are being developed, the GPU is really quite ideal for it. And so this is a market that is not likely to go away anytime soon, and the only thing that we can probably expect is that there will be more currencies to come. It will come in a whole lot of different nations. It will emerge from time to time, and the GPU is really quite great for it.","What we've done, our strategy is to stay very, very close to the market. We understand its dynamics really well. And we offer the coin miners a special coin-mining SKU. And this product configuration \u2013 this GPU configuration is optimized for mining. We stay very close to the market. We know its every single move and we know its dynamics.","And then last thing that I can say is that the larger of a GPU company you are, the greater ability you could absorb the volatility. And so between the combination of the fact that we have GPUs at just about every single price point, we have such incredibly efficient designs that we're so close to the marketplace. And because we have such large volumes, we have the ability to rock and roll with this market as it goes. But this is an important market that likely will continue to grow over time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great, thanks for taking the question and congrats on the results. I have a question on some of the numbers. So Q2 revenue came in roughly about $250 million above your guide. Can you confirm what some of the drivers were to the upside relative to your guidance? Was it all cryptocurrency, or was it a combination of multiple things? And related to that, for your Q3 guide I think you are guiding revenue up about $120 million sequentially. What are the puts and takes here on a sequential basis? Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","Sure, let's see. First of all, we actually gave a really great guidance last quarter, and we beat it by $250 million. And the $250 million you could see in our \u2013 we categorized under the OEM SKUs basically the cryptocurrency SKUs. And that, if you reverse-engineered it out, I think is approximately $150 million. And we serve the vast \u2013 I would say the large majority of the cryptocurrency demand out of that specialized products.","There are still small miners that buy GeForces here and there, and that probably also increased the demand of GeForces. There were a lot of shortages all over the world. And as we go into this quarter, there's still cryptocurrency mining demand that we know is out there. And based on our analytics and understanding of the marketplace, there will be some amount of demand for the foreseeable future. But it's also the case that there were gamers whose needs and demands were not filled last quarter.","The second quarter is an important part of the year for us. GeForce is in an incredibly great strategic position. After all of the numerous product launches that we've seen from other players, it's very, very clear that the GeForce product lineup is absolutely the best in the world. And the second half is going to see some very exciting titles. You've got Destiny 2. You have Call of Duty from Activision. You have Star Wars: Battlefront from EA. These are going be blockbusters, and we're expecting them to do incredibly well.","We also know that a game that came out of nowhere \u2013 and this is one of the things that's really great about the video game market, you never know where the next amazing new title is going to come from. PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS, it's really essentially Survivor meets Hunger Games. How could that not be a fun game? So they've done incredibly well. And so I think the market dynamic is really vibrant for the second half of the year, and we have a really great position.","With respect to our guidance, the way to think about our guidance, we gave a good guidance and we're comfortable with our guidance. And we know that the dynamics in our business, our data center position is quite exciting. We know that our gaming business is vibrant and our position is excellent. We saw growth across all of our product segments. And we'll just see how it turns out at the end of next quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein Research.","Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I was wondering if you could tell us how much Volta contributed to the data center revenue in the quarter. And what are your expectations for that ramp trajectory into the second half? The reason I ask is when I look at gross margins, they're fine, but it doesn't look like the Volta ramp is driving upside to that number. So I'm trying get some feeling for the trajectory of that ramp.","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","First of all, it's very difficult to reverse-engineer from the first ramp of Volta any impact on gross margins, and the reason for that is because the first ramps tend to be more costly, and you're still trying to stabilize yield. There are a lot of complexities involved. But what I can tell you is that we shipped a lot of Voltas. We shipped a lot of Voltas, and Volta is fully ramped. Customers are clamoring for it. The leap generationally for deep learning is quite extraordinary. And so we're expecting Volta to be very, very successful.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of C. J. Muse with Evercore.","C. J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC","I guess a follow-up question to that on the Volta transition and now that that is ramping in high-volume manufacturing and considering the pretty large uplift in die size there, I'm curious how you're thinking about ASP uplift over time, and whether you would expect that to drive a reacceleration in growth in data center looking into the second half of the calendar year.","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","So the first way to think about our ASP is to think about the value proposition that our GPUs provide. Whenever you include a Volta in your data center, in your server that is doing data-intensive processing, the number of commodity servers that it replaces and the number of just NICs [Network Interface Cards] and cables that it replaces is pretty extraordinary. Every single Volta allows you to save several hundred thousand dollars.","And so the price of Volta is driven by the fact that, of course, the manufacturing cost is quite extraordinary. These are expensive things to go and design. The manufacturing cost itself, you guys can estimate it, is probably in the several hundred dollars to close to $1,000. However, the software intensity of developing Volta, the architectural intensity of developing Volta, all of the software intensity associated with all the algorithms and optimizing all the algorithms of Volta is really where the value-add ultimately ends up. And so I guess the pricing \u2013 your question relates is pricing. We expect pricing to be quite favorable for Volta.","And then your second question I think is related to acceleration. The data center growth opportunity for us is quite significant, as you know. There are several applications that demand GPUs today. Almost every single data center in the world today recognizes that GPU is the path forward for data-intensive processing. Every single OEM and every single cloud service provider now supports NVIDIA GPUs and offer video GPUs, and Volta is going be the engine that serves them. So I'm expecting a lot of good things from Volta.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik with Citi.","Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, thanks for taking my question, congratulations on the strong results. Even if you exclude the OEM (31:10) contribution, you have beaten the Street expectations. My question is on auto. You've announced a very strong pipeline of auto partnerships this year. Can you just talk about when do you expect acceleration in auto sales? And are there any other ways you can monetize your auto partnerships and maybe through licensing of software stacks? Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","Sure, thanks a lot, Atif. The roadmap for auto looks like this. For this year and next, what you should see is development partnerships that we have with a growing number of car companies, and they're reflected in NRE projects, development systems, and purchasing of our AI supercomputers like DGX. And so for the next I would say this year and the vast majority of next year, that's what you should expect from the autonomous driving perspective.","Starting next year, you're going to start to see robot taxis start to come to the road. We're working with a handful, maybe I guess about six or seven really exciting robot taxi projects around the world. And you could see them start to go into a prototype or beta testing starting now, and then next year you'll see a lot more of them. And starting 2019, you'll see them go into real commercial services. And so those are robot taxis, what some in the industry call Level 5s, basically driverless cars.","And then the fully autonomous drivered cars, driven cars, branded cars will start hitting the road around 2020 and 2021. So the way to think about it is this year and next is really about development. Starting next year and the following year is robot taxis. And then 2021 to forward you're going to see a lot of Level 4s.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.","Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thank you. I wanted to actually ask about the ProVis business. That business continues to grow faster than I had expect it to, and you had real good quarter there. Can you talk about what's driving that and what the trajectory of that business looks like?","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","Sure. Our Pro business, call it roughly nearly $1 billion. It grew 8% last year. It grew 8% the year before that, maybe a little bit less, and this year it grew about 10%, maybe a little faster.","The way to think about that business is it's really a platform for design, digital design of all kinds. And it's designing movies, designing cars, designing products, people designing websites. Anybody who's doing digital design could really benefit from a Quadro platform. It's very software-intensive. It's certified with every major computer-aided design package. It's certified by large industrial companies all over the world. You could use Quadro and bring up a database 10 years from now and know that because of the nature of how we manage our software, the certification process we go through with each one of the major industry partners, we could pull up an entire design that was designed five years ago 10 years from now. And so if anything were to happen to a product or a plane or a ship or a building, the level of certainty in your data integrity is going be complete. And so the software intensity is high, and our platform is recognized all over the world as the industry standard.","The growth opportunity for Quadro are several, and it's starting to kick in. And I'm rather optimistic about its future growth as well. One of them is photorealistic rendering. We now have the ability to use our artificial intelligence and ray tracing technology in combination, called OptiX 5.0, that we just announced at SIGGRAPH. That allows you to visualize photorealistic rendering practically interactively, and it's just an amazing thing to watch.","Second, we now have a new system called an external GPU system. That's a partnership between the work that we did with Intel and all of our partners in the ecosystem by taking advantage of Thunderbolt 3 and the new external GPU-capable Windows system. You can now have an external system connect to Thunderbolt and basically our GPU is outside the laptop. And so for some 25 million \u2013 20 million users of thin and light notebooks, you can now have the ability to have a GPU as well and get a boost in your productivity like you've never seen before. And so you can now have thin notebooks and still have the benefit of our GPUs. And so that's a new market for us.","We're going to see virtual reality do quite well, especially in design. And we partnered with HP recently to do an industrial version of a backpack that allows designers to be able to freely roam within their design space and completely in virtual reality. So there's a variety of growth drivers in that business that I'm quite excited about.","Operator","Your next question comes there the line of Craig Ellis with B. Riley.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the very good execution and capitalizing on the crypto opportunity. Jensen, I wanted to start just connecting a few dots. You had mentioned that there was significant upside from that opportunity. And we've seen through checks that we can do via public means that demand was very strong in the quarter. And as I look ahead at the guidance for the fiscal third quarter, it's up 5% when I think normally it would be up in the low double digits. So can you talk about how comfortable you are with your supply availability here, and if demand was there for double-digit growth if you'd be able to achieve that?","And then, Colette, one for you, the OpEx guidance setup, I think it's $37 million quarter on quarter, more than we've seen the last few quarters. Can you just bin out what some of the bigger drivers for that increase are? Thanks, team.","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","Sure, thanks a lot. So first of all, to answer that question, I would say there are three factors. The first factor is our strategic position. Our competitive lineup is probably the best it's ever been, better than last year even, which was incredibly strong, better than the year before that because it was incredibly strong. I think our strategic position and the value of our architecture is more powerful today than ever. And so I think number one is our strategic position.","The second, if the demand were there in the second half with respect to \u2013 from a perspective of gaming demand and if there's any residual crypto demand, we will surely be able to serve it. And then lastly, the factors related to our guidance, our guidance is we're comfortable with our guidance. We're happy with our guidance, and we want to have an opportunity to come back and give you an update in Q3.","Colette M. Kress - NVIDIA Corp.","And, Craig, on our second question regarding the OpEx guidance in Q3, generally our guidance and actuals as we move into Q3 is usually a little stronger, and it's consistent with our normal annual compensation increase that happens in Q3. And also keep in mind, we are expected to move into our new headquarter building within Q3. And underlining our overall growth in investments is our hiring and focus in terms of on AI, autonomous driving, as well as gaming. All of these factors contribute to that with about a 19% year-over-year growth rate in terms of what we're targeting.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Caso with Raymond James.","Chris Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yes, thank you. I just wanted to clarify some earlier comments with regard to Volta and data center. Is it correct to interpret your comments to mean that some customers may have tended to delay purchases as you went through the quarter as they're waiting for Volta given the stronger performance gains for that? And if that's the case, if I've got that right, now that Volta is fully ramped, do you expect that to drive stronger growth rates as you go through the second half?","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","The answer to your first question is yes. Volta was a giant leap. It's got 120 teraflops. Another way to think about that is eight of them in one node is essentially one petaflops, which puts it among the top 20 fastest supercomputers on the planet. And the entire world's top 500 supercomputers are only 700 petaflops. And with eight Voltas in one box, we're doing artificial intelligence that represents one of them. So Volta is just a gigantic leap for deep learning and it's such a gigantic leap for processing that \u2013 and we announced it at GTC, if you recall, which is practically right at the beginning of the quarter.","And so the transition was not insignificant, and it was that the team just executed flawlessly. I'm so proud of the team. They executed the most complex processor that's ever been built. And working with our teams, working with our partners at TSMC and Samsung and all of our package partners still, and they just did a great job for us, and so the team did great.","Now looking forward, there's a whole bunch of growth drivers for our data center business. Deep learning is \u2013 training is a growth driver. Cloud computing, high-performance computing is a growth driver, and we have new growth drivers with inferencing. And so I'm pretty excited about our prospects going into the age of \u2013 the generation of Volta.","In terms of the guidance and what we expect, I think our dynamics are really positive. And so we've just got to \u2013 we're happy with the guidance, and let's give you an update at the end of the quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of William Stein with SunTrust.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the very strong results. Jensen, you've had a couple questions already about the pace of growth in data center in the second half from Volta, but I'm thinking a little bit further out. At GTC, you highlighted this $30 billion TAM opportunity by 2020. And when we look at the charts that you've published about your expectation for XFLOPS, the number of XFLOPS required to train an increasing number of deep learning networks through 2020, it looks like your expectation is for that to accelerate over time. But naturally, the Street is contemplating decelerating growth for data center. People don't expect things to grow 150-plus percent forever. So can you comment as to the growth trajectory beyond maybe the very near term in that business? Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","I think at the highest level, the way to think about that is data-intensive computing, whether it's deep learning or high-performance computing, the GPU is just phenomenal at it. NVIDIA's CUDA GPU was, after 12 years of driving this architecture and pioneering this computing approach, it's just a home run. And the value proposition and the money that it saves people, the amount of energy that it saves is quite extraordinary. One way to think about that is if you speed up an application by a factor of 10, you're basically saying that it takes 10 times fewer servers to do the same job, or you could do 10 times as much work in the same amount of servers. So the value proposition is really quite great.","The applications that we serve is really diverse now. It used to be just high-performance computing and supercomputing. But the number of applications we serve in Internet service providers, manufacturing, healthcare, financial services, transportation, the number of data-intensive applications and industries that need them is really growing very fast.","And so how fast does that \u2013 what does that imply in terms of long-term growth? It's hard to say. But first principles would suggest that every single data center in the world will be GPU-accelerated someday. And I've always believed that, and I believe that even more today. Because I believe that in the future, this new computing model that we all finally call AI is going be a highly data-intensive business model, and the GPU is the ideal computing model for that.","So I'm not exactly sure if that completely answers your question, and partly because I'm not exactly sure. I just know that on first principles, the computing architecture is ideal. There's every evidence that every single data center and every single OEM and every single Internet service provider is jumping on this architecture and jumping on Volta. And I believe that AI is going be the future of computing. And so somewhere between those beliefs and executing the business is the truth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann with Rosenblatt Securities.","Hans Mosesmann - Rosenblatt Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Hey, Jensen, can you give us an update in terms of how the new platforms and servers may have impacted the business in the data center with Purley launching here recently and the upcoming EPYC? As a follow-on, when can we expect Volta in the consumer gaming market? Thanks.","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","That's a good question, Hans, and it's a good observation. Because Purley, I didn't know if everybody understood that code name, but Purley is a new motherboard, a new platform for Intel servers, and the CPU is Skylake. It's an excellent server platform. And obviously, every OEM and every service provider was waiting for the launch of that, and it officially launched in the middle of this quarter.","And so did it affect the rollout of new servers based on GPUs? It probably did, and surely it did. But now that it's ramped, it's a successful ramp. Every single cloud provider and every single OEM is now fully geared up to take that server to market, and they all have GPU options. Every single OEM in the world now and every cloud provider and every ODM now has NVIDIA GPU chassis and platforms, whether it's in one GPU in 1U to eight GPUs in a supercomputing configuration. And so the number of options of ways to enjoy NVIDIA GPUs is really quite countless now.","Volta for gaming, we haven't announced anything. And all I can say is that our pipeline is filled with some exciting new toys for the gamers, and we have some really exciting new technology to offer them in the pipeline. But for the holiday season for the foreseeable future, I think Pascal is just unbeatable. It's just the best thing out there. And everybody who's looking forward to playing Call of Duty or Destiny 2, if they don't already have one, should run out and get themselves a Pascal.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets.","Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just had two high- level ones. First, since you commented on cryptocurrency and blockchain, so when decentralized applications begin to take off and we see people essentially renting out parallel processing, how are you guys going to essentially be able to tell what products are being used in a lease model versus what's being used in gaming, et cetera?","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","First of all, it's not really possible because our GPUs are all architecturally compatible, which at some level is one of our strengths. There are hundreds of millions of NVIDIA GPUs in the world, and they're all CUDA compatible, and they're all 100% CUDA compatible. And we're so rigorous and so disciplined about ensuring their compatibility that for developers it's really a wonderful platform.","However, we're thoughtful about how we configure the GPUs so that they're best for the applications. Some applications would like to have the maximum amount of performance in a few nodes. Some would like to have the maximum amount of performance within 30 watts. Some would like to have the maximum amount of flexibility with all of the I\/O and connectors and all the display connectors. Some people like to have multi-GPUs and that they have the ability to configure them together. And so every market has a slightly different need, and we have to understand the market needs and understand what it is that the customers are looking for, and configure something that is best for them.","Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it, thank you, and just one small one on a follow-up. Do you guys have an estimate on how fast the neural network is growing right now relative to a year ago?","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","Let's see. A neural net in terms of complexity is approximately \u2013 not quite, but approximately doubling every year. And this is one of the exciting things about artificial intelligence. In no time in my history of looking at computers in the last 35 years have we ever seen a double exponential where the GPU computing model, our GPUs are essentially increasing in performance by approximately three times each year. In order to be 100 times in just four years, we have to increase overall system performance by a factor of three, by over a factor of three every year.","And yet on the other hand, on top of it, the neural network architecture and the algorithms that are being developed are improving in accuracy by about twice each year. And so object recognition accuracy is improving by twice each year, or the error rate is decreasing by half each year. And speech recognition is improving by a factor of two each year. And so you've got these two exponentials that are happening, and it's pretty exciting. That's one of the reasons why AI is moving so fast.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks for taking my question. On the data center, it was slightly below the Street number. I know it's not your number, but I think we've gotten used to you surpassing the Street number by a wide margin. I'm wondering if you can just talk about in the July quarter the three sub-segments and if they came in as expected. And as you look to October, maybe you can talk about what kind of growth you're looking for, for that segment. Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","I'm not sure I understand the question. Colette, do you? If you understand, go ahead and answer.","Colette M. Kress - NVIDIA Corp.","So in discussing how we did versus our guidance, again, we overshot our overall guidance for Q2. Part of that was the cryptocurrency. And your question was more around the data center and the data center number. We set out with a good amount of work ahead of us to transition to Volta within the quarter. We're very pleased with that result and the overall year-over-year growth that we accomplished in terms of the data center. We always have different ranges across the organization and across the different businesses, but we don't have specifics in terms of our guidance nor did we provide specific guidance in terms of on the data center.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Raji Gill with Needham & Company.","Robert Mertens - Needham & Co. LLC","Hi, this is Robert Mertens on behalf of Raji. Congratulations and thank you for taking my question. I guess I wanted to get a little more clarity towards your automotive division. I didn't know if you broke out rough percentages about the near-term growth between infotainment and these AS or autonomous vehicle systems. And then as a follow-up in the autonomous systems, how you're pricing between the different levels, if that's mainly just the GPUs, or if the software is baked in there as well?","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","Our GPUs are useless without software, I'll start from the back and work forward. Our GPUs are useless without software, and the reason for that is because otherwise each one of the markets, whether it's playing games or professional visualization or high-performance computing, doing molecular dynamics computation or doing seismic processing, or perceiving the three-dimensional world around the car and reasoning about where it is and trying to figure out how to drive, all of that software is very, very different.","What we do is there's a core in our company. The core architecture is a GPU core. However, the configuration of the products and the chips and the systems are very different from market to market. So somebody asked me earlier, the gentleman asked me about cryptocurrency. That configuration is very, very different than a gaming configuration, which is different than a high-performance computing configuration, and it's different from our inferencing configuration and it's different from our self-driving car configuration.","And so the chips are designed to be different, even though they're architecturally identical. And then the systems are designed to be market-specific and application-specific. And the software on top of it is super, super application-specific. And that's one of the reasons why our company is increasingly differentiated from a components company and what we call a platform company. Each one of these platforms that we bring to market are very, very different, even though at its core, this data-intensive parallel computing architecture called CUDA is essential among all of them.","We don't break out the automotive from the rest of the Tegra business. The Tegra business consists of basically three parts at the moment. One major component of it is the Nintendo Switch gaming console, and it's just doing incredibly well. I'm so happy for Nintendo because they're risk takers. They're innovators. They're not influenced by what other people do, and they're original thinkers. And I just love the way they invented the Switch and the way they've taken it to market. I'm so happy for them. And it's doing really well.","The second major component is our self-driving car platforms, and a lot of it still is infotainment systems. Our infotainment system is going to evolve into an AI cockpit product line. We initially started with autonomous driving. But you probably heard me say at GTC that our future infotainment systems will basically turn your cockpit or turn your car into an AI. So your whole car will become an AI. It will talk to you. It will know where you are. It knows who's in the cabin. And if there are potential things to be concerned about around the car, it might even just tell you in natural language. And so the entire car will become an AI.","We announced at CES a partnership with Daimler, and they talked about the work that we're doing together in the next-generation car how we're going bring AI to the car. And that's our first visible, highly visible project, and there are others that we're working on. And then the future projects, starting from end of next year with robot taxis, and starting with 2020 the autonomous cars, fully autonomous cars, you're going to see the rest of that come online, and that's a major component of Tegra.","And then the last component, the third component, major component I would say is AI at the edge. That's the next major revolution. And we have a new product line that we announced about a year ago. It's called Jetson. Jetson is just an amazing little AI computer. And if you want to do deep learning at the edge, whether it's really, really clever cameras for smart and safe cities, to traffic lights that can now monitor traffic, Jetson AI at the edge is going be the next growth opportunity for us. And those three major segments make up essentially the Tegra business. We haven't split each one of them out separately, but one of these days we'll consider doing that.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO.","Ting Pong Gabriel Ho - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","This is Gabriel Ho calling in for Ambrish, thanks for taking my question. I think last year at this time, on the data center business, you disclosed I think a high level of growth for your cloud business. Your deep learning business was about half, and then a third HPC. I was wondering. As you're ramping Volta, how should we think about maybe the mix as you're entering the second half of the year between the PC\/cloud and maybe the rest of the business for the data center?","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","Ambrish (sic) [Gabriel], that's a good question. Partly I'm not in total control of the answer. But on first principles, let me maybe explain it this way. I believe that there are a few hundred million office workers and information workers whose PCs will be virtualized and just become an application like Netflix, and it will be virtualized. They'll be streamed from our cloud GPUs called GRID.","I believe that every single company in the world, manufacturing, healthcare, finance will use computational approaches to analyzing their business. And some of them will use AI and some of them will use traditional first principle physics-based algorithms. And it's hard to say exactly what the split is going to be. My guess, however, is that AI will be the larger part of that, but you're going to see hybrid versions of it. Most computation \u2013 the reason why we're so bullish about CUDA and our GPU, which is able to do both general purpose computation as well as deep learning, is because most algorithms have the combination of both. Inside the card, we don't just use deep learning. We use CUDA and deep learning. We use CUDA for all kinds of algorithms, computer vision algorithms including deep learning. And we're seeing in quantum chemistry, in physics simulations like fluid dynamics, more and more of the algorithms are hybrids of deep learning and numerics. And so that segment of the marketplace is hard to predict.","And then there's just the consumer Internet service providers and the billions and billions of queries that are going into the cloud. Some of them are text, some of them are speech, and increasingly some of them are video. The amount of traffic that's going to be inferenced using deep learning is going be quite explosive. It's hard to know exactly the pace of each one of these, but I think on first principles, we would all agree that these are large computation challenges, and that the previous model of using just microprocessors to do that computation is not efficient, and that the GPU with its parallel data processing capability and now our fourth-generation deep learning architecture, you essentially have a GPU that does a whole bunch more. And so I think the approach that we take has great promise, and we're just super-enthusiastic about it. But exactly how much it's going contribute in the near term in percentages is going be hard to guess.","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","Okay, that was great. I appreciate all the questions. We had a great quarter. We're seeing exciting growth dynamics driving in each of our businesses. This is the era of artificial intelligence, and NVIDIA has dedicated ourselves to be its brain. Cloud and Internet service providers are going all in on AI and jumping onto our new Volta GPU. Enterprises and giant industries from transportation to healthcare to manufacturing to financial services have an awakened to the power of AI. And the growing pipeline of the NVIDIA DGX AI supercomputer is a great indicator.","The next revolution of AI will be at the edge, and the most visible impactful evidence will be the autonomous vehicle. Our strategy is to build a ground-up deep learning platform for self-driving cars, and that has put us in pole position to lead the charge. And in gaming, which is actually the first consumer AI application, we have a great strategic position in this growing market. We have a once in a lifetime opportunity ahead.

At this time, I\u2019d like to welcome everyone to the NVIDIA First Quarter Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)","Thank you. And at this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Mr. Chris Evenden, Senior Director of Investor Relations. You may begin sir.","Chris Evenden","Thanks, Lisa. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to NVIDIA's conference call for the second quarter of fiscal 2014. With me on the call today from NVIDIA are Jen-Hsun Huang, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Karen Burns, Interim Chief Financial Officer. After our prepared remarks, we will open up the call to a question-and-answer session. Please limit yourself to one initial question with one follow-up.","Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that today\u2019s call is being webcast live on NVIDIA's Investor Relations website and is also being recorded. A replay of the conference call will be available via telephone until August 15, 2013, and the webcast will be available for replay until our conference call to discuss our financial results for our third quarter of fiscal 2014. The content of today's call is NVIDIA's property and cannot be reproduced or transcribed without our prior written consent.","During the course of this call, we may make forward-looking statements based on the current expectations. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of factors that could affect our future financial results and businesses, please refer to the disclosure in today's earnings release, our Form 10-Q for the fiscal period ended April 28, 2013, and the reports we may file from time to time on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","All our statements are made as of today, August 8, 2013, based on information available to us as of today and except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements. Unless otherwise noted, all references to market research and market share numbers throughout the call come from Mercury Research or Jon Peddie Research.","During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP in our financial release, which is posted on our website.","With that, let's begin. Our focus on visual computing enabled us to write out a rough PC market this quarter and is setting us up for growth in new markets. Revenue came in at the middle of our outlook, driven by strengthened GPU offset by Tegra. PC gaming performed particularly well in reaching our product mix, growing our share of GPU revenue at driving margins to another record high.","The PC market is evolving. As entry level laptops face pressure from tablets. Yet sales of specialty PCs like gaming systems and work stations continue to grow. The disparity reflects how consumers use these different classes of PCs. Many consumers look for PC as a general purpose device they can use for browsing, email, social media video. But much of this can be better served by a tablet. In contrast, gamers are preparing their systems for a strong roster of games coming this fall, including blockbuster franchises, such as Call of Duty: Ghosts, Grand Theft Auto V and Assassin's Creed IV.","In a similar time, for digital artist and designers, the work station is the tool of their trade. They depend on increasing processing power to deliver results for their clients. And the use of specialty PCs could become even more widespread with a growth of new applications like 3D printing.","Open platform such as PC and Android are outgrowing the world gardens of the traditional console market. They benefit from more innovation. Nearly half of the developers surveyed at GDC recently who are working on PC games compared only 11% on Next Gen consoles. PC game revenues are expected to reach around $20 billion annually by 2015, whereas the total for both PlayStations will be less than $10 billion and Xbox is only around half of that.","In mobile, games generate 80% of revenues on Google\u2019s marketplace and 2\/3s of the time spend on a tablet is spent playing games. It\u2019s this innovation and energy that we\u2019re leveraging with SHIELD. It started shipping July 31st and the critical reception has been excellent. [Xen] should be described as a game geeks stream device, a writer at Forbes got him excited about gaming again and CNET called it a high quality device with stellar performance. Because SHIELD is an open platform, it can access anything available to an android tablet. That means there were literally 100s of 1000s of games available for SHIELD today at launch. It\u2019s a web browser and a way to update Facebook. It excels as a metrics movie player and as an internet radio or Pandora music platform.","Thanks to the effort we put into the loud speaker and acoustic design. SHIELD is the best way to play games, android games. And a key element of our strategy to generate a virtual circle in open gaming is linked to GeForce on PCs. So gamers can play PC games from their couch. One day it will be an excellent plat for GRID gaming. We padded with TegraZone, a curated collection of games all tested on Tegra and many of them optimized to Tegra. TegraZone has been installed by the 7.5 million times already and that number increases around 10% a quarter.","The model we\u2019re building for games is familiar for music and movies. You can buy a song from Amazon and download it to your device or stream it directly from a service like Spot 5 or even buy it and hosted in the cloud or Google. Similarly, a game you can download games to SHIELD play, play game online and soon stream it from GRID.","Our Content GRID helps to develop and differentiate the games in our platforms and this creates synergy across devices. Games optimized for SHIELD will also look like on Tegra 4 devices like the HP SlateBook x2, or the Toshiba Excite Pro, both of which shipped this quarter. Games optimized with GeForce will be excellent context for GRID gaming. In this way SHIELD, GeForce and GRID each benefit the other and gamers benefit from a dynamic ecosystem.","Q2 is a trough quarter for Tegra and you will see more Tegra 4 devices, but you will see more Tegra 4 devices launched through the balance of this year. Meanwhile, qualification of our modems both the standalone base band i500 and the integrated application process of Tegra 4i is proceeding as expected. And we\u2019re making steady progress to what certification at a number of carriers.","We previewed our next generation mobile processor, Project Logan last month. Logan includes our first mobile Kepler GPU delivering what the technical [press] described as unambiguous mobile GPU leadership. Last thing our GPU cost as we announced this quarter, allows us to generate revenue from markets previously and acceptable, such as vertically integrated smartphone OEMs.","The mobile Kepler inside Logan has around three times the performance (indiscernible) of the iPad 4 GPU yet performs like a new desktop part. We showed it running Epic Games next generation game engine on real engine 4 and running Ira (indiscernible) as recently as of the Investor Day in April was restricted to high end gaming PCs.","Forbes suggested that in video Logan could be a mobile graphic disruptor (indiscernible) said that if you get a new phone in 2014 with crazy battery life and amazing onscreen performance, the Kepler GPU will be a reason. Other press was similarly enthusiastic.","Last year we made the decision to pull in Tegra 4i and Logan. This made a slate to market with Tegra 4. However, with Project Logan we're early and well positioned to capture key design wins.","Moving on to our GPU server business, Telsa had an excellent quarter very nearly its best ever. Notably this quarter's revenue was driven by application-based deals. That is customers using off-the-shelf applications are turning to Tesla GPUs to accelerate them. This validates our continued investment in software. For example, last week's acquisition of PGI, the leading developer of (indiscernible) for high performance computing.","Also, since this revenue passes through OEMs it requires much less sales and support resources from us and offers a more efficient reach to scale for that business. In professional visualization, Quadro displayed a strong sequential and year-over-year growth. We launched the Quadro K6000 to complete the lineup of Kepler top to bottom. Prospects look good for future growth. 80% of Quadro sales are driven by manufacturing and recent PMI and\/or manufacturing data has been very encouraging.","GRID is showing increased traction in the ecosystem. We announced this quarter that GRID is now supported natively within XenDesktop 7, so enterprise is considering Citrix virtualized infrastructures can easily also evaluate GPU acceleration. We have over 150 proof-of-concept trails underway and a dozen Citrix of our partners working on active GRID opportunities.","I'll focus on gaming visualization and compute generated growth in the turbulent market, leveraging our IP into new markets and applying GPUs to the cloud would accelerate that growth in the future.","With that, I'll now hand it over to Karen.","Karen Burns","Thanks, Chris. Hello, everyone. I want to highlight some key points before we open up for Q&A. Overall results for the second quarter exceeded our original expectations, driven by strong demand and the high end segments of our GPU business across desktop, workstation and server.","Gross margins are now in the 56% range with Q2 being the fourth consecutive record quarter. The performance of our GPU business and intense focus on costs delivered EPS of $0.16 on a GAAP basis and $0.23 on a non-GAAP basis. These were $0.04 above consensus estimates of $0.12 for GAAP and $0.19 for non-GAAP.","Revenue for the quarter of 977 million was at the midpoint of our outlook. The GPU business was very strong with a 9% increase quarter-over-quarter and 8% over the prior year. Growth was fueled by the release of new Kepler-based GPUs with high end and desktop and with Kepler-based GPUs now available top to bottom for workstation and server.","Revenue for the Tegra Processor business was down 49% sequentially and 71% year-over-year. We had expected a drop as discussed last quarter with the ramp down of Tegra 3 products and ahead of Tegra 4 shipments. Nonetheless, we are disappointed with the size of the decline.","Due to current dynamics in the mobile space, we believe it will be challenging for Tegra revenue to remain flat year-over-year as originally expected. That said we anticipate Tegra revenue to be up significantly in Q3 from Q2, as we start to ship Tegra 4 base design wins and SHIELD, our NVIDIA branded gaming and entertainment portable. We expect further growth in Q4 as more Tegra 4 OEM products come to market.","Our revenue guidance for Q3 reflects these new expectations. We expect revenue to be up approximately 7% from the prior quarter with stable growth in the GPU business and significant growth in Tegra Processor.","We again achieved record growth margins this quarter. The large increases you have seen quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year reflect our strong market position in high margin segments of our GPU business, particularly in desktop and workstations.","For Q3 we expect gross margins to maintain at current levels. OpEx this quarter of 401 million was below our outlook at 7 million below the midpoint. Some of this investment shifted to Q3. For Q3 we expect OpEx of approximately 460 million for GAAP and 480 million for non-GAAP.","Our OpEx investments remained tightly in line to our key growth strategies. For digital computing, we are extending the technical leadership of our GPUS, growing GPU for accelerated computing and engaging the market with our GRID GPU servers for enterprise VDI.","GRID servers are in production by Cisco, Dell, HP and IBM. For Tegra [SSV], we are leveraging our core GPU investments to bring our visual computing leadership to industries that are being revolutionized by Android and ARM. We can make a contribution to many applications where a great GPU is desired.","To-date, we have established a proven market position for Tegra that we will build on. Largely with Tegra 2 we generated 360 million in revenue in fiscal 2012 from smartphones and tablets alone. Largely with Tegra 3, we grew revenue 50% to 540 million from these devices in fiscal 2013.","With Tegra 4, we are expanding our reach to other large markets where visual computing matters, such as auto navigation systems, TV set top boxes and new desktop foreign factors like all-in-one and smart monitors.","With non-GAAP OpEx of 797 million in the first half of the year and 418 million expected in Q3, we are tracking at the high end of our full year expectations of approximately 1.6 billion. We aim to reduce this amount as we remain intensely focused on operating costs.","Turning to the balance sheet, our overall position remains very strong. In the first half of the fiscal year, we generated 275 million in cash from operations and 122 million in free cash flow. Cash at the end of the quarter was 2.9 billion, a reduction of 778 million from Q1. This relates to our capital return allocation to shareholders of 793 million, consisting of 43 million in dividend payments and 750 million for share repurchases.","In Q2 we executed in an accelerated share repurchase agreement to repurchase 750 million of shares. To-date, we have received 40 million shares under this agreement reducing our outstanding common stock. And we expect to receive additional shares when the contract ends in Q3.","In addition, year-to-date we have returned $190 million to shareholders including 100 million in share repurchases and 90 million in quarterly dividend payments. With this capital allocation strategy along with our quarterly dividend payments in the second half, we are on track to return capital to shareholders in excess of 1 billion.","Thank you. Chris?","Chris Evenden","Thanks, Karen. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now take questions. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Lisa?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Our first question will come from the line of Christopher Rolland.","Chris Rolland - Friedman, Billings, Ramsay, & Co., Inc.","Hi, guys. How are you? Can you guys talk about initial sales or at least shipments of SHIELD so far? Is it above, below or in line with your estimates? Thanks.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Hi, Chris, yeah thanks a lot. SHIELD is doing great. The early reviews are fantastic. You probably read some of the reviews online, people really love that, it's a well made device, it feels exquisite and the performance is fantastic, it's an open platform and it does all the things that you would expect an Android device to do and more. And people are really loving, playing with the Beta version of our PC streaming and to be able to enjoy GeForce games that looks fantastic on a PC, on a small device like that while you\u2019re sitting on a couch is pretty amazing. Sales have been great. Everything that we shipped so far has sold out and \u2013 but we\u2019re just starting to ramp production, we\u2019ve shipped out to our partners only several thousand units, and so it's still quite early to tell. But we\u2019re expecting to do quite well with SHIELD.","Chris Rolland - Friedman, Billings, Ramsay, & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. And also on the Tegra segment, maybe you can give us a little bit more detail there. How should we think about console royalties, I guess Pachinko, Auto versus your regular mobile sort of breakdown and I guess SHIELD is going to be in there too for next quarter; what that might look like this quarter as well as next? Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well this was our Tegra trough quarter and we had talked about that before, the transition between Tegra 3 and Tegra 4. Because we pulled in two very important projects Tegra 4i with out integrated 4G modem and Logan which incorporated our mobile Kepler GPU as a result of that Tegra 4 was a little later than our typical cycle. And so we had to gap out and we expected Q2 to be the trough. We expect next quarter to be up substantially and as Karen mentioned earlier however there were some disappointments this year, some projects that we worked on that we had spent a lot of effort on didn\u2019t pan out as we expected and it's relatively well known now but nonetheless it didn\u2019t meet our expectations.","But overall I would say that Tegra 4 is going to ramp up very nicely this coming quarter. There is tablets from Asus, Toshiba and HP. There is SHIELD that\u2019s ramping up and there are new devices that are going into production that are quite exciting. I think relative to your other question of auto we had said earlier that auto is about $100 million for the year or so roughly and last year it was 15% we\u2019re expecting next year to be another 100% growth year. Auto as you know the design cycles are quite long and so the product life is also quite long, but it takes some time to ramp up.","Chris Rolland - Friedman, Billings, Ramsay, & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks guys.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yeah, and just one last thing. You had mentioned something about game console royalties. We\u2019re not accounting for much game console royalties.","Chris Rolland - Friedman, Billings, Ramsay, & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you guys.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yeah, thanks a lot.","Chris Evenden","Hi, Lisa. Next question.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.","Gabriel Ho - BMO Capital Markets","Hi, this is Gabriel Ho calling in for Ambrish, thanks for taking my question. Actually can you give us more details on the licensing initiative for the graphic technology and also when should we expect that to translate into your F revenues and more importantly help us understand the thinking behind that what kind of customer pull were to seeing versus the means to diversify yourself?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Sure. Well we are a specialist in visual computing, this is our core business. And over the years we\u2019ve enhanced and extended our business model from just chips to now chips and systems such as GRID to system components such as GTX cards and Quadro cards and Tesla cards to now including GPU IP, and so we\u2019re an end-to-end provider of GPU technologies to all of the application that relate to visual computing. And the way that we go to market has everything to do with how the customers would enjoy incorporating our technology into their products. In some customers they would like to buy our chip and put it on their own motherboard, with some customers they would like to buy our system components with our software and we integrated into their servers or work stations. Some customers would like to buy in retail adding cards of GeForce and some customers prefer to build their own chips, their own systems and take it to market themselves. And so in those vertically integrated opportunities we\u2019ve historically not had an opportunity to serve them with our technology and now with our mobile Kepler GPU that we revealed at SIGGRAPH it took us some three years to mobilize the worlds most advanced GPU. Now the worlds most advanced GPU is in a mobile format. It's the worlds first CUDA GPGPu available for mobile and it takes a huge advance in energy efficiency. And now with this Kepler GPU we could license our technology in a GPU core format to customers who would like to incorporate it into their own products and address their own vertically integrated market. And so that\u2019s basically the idea.","Gabriel Ho - BMO Capital Markets","Thanks. As a follow-up I just want to get an idea as you know two often three major game consoles being launched in the second half of the year, how should we think about the PC gaming business or what's your view on that?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well game consoles are fantastic and I am looking forward to buying one myself. But today, just like in movies and music you game on every computing platform. And the fastest growing platforms in the world today are open platforms. PC is the fastest growing and it's now become the largest, some $20 billion worth of global software sales. Obviously China is very, very large, but the United States is large as well, Russia and Korea and you name it. PC gaming has become very large.","The business models are vibrant whether it's declare online games, AAA titles or now free to play games. You could see that PC games are just really vibrant. The fastest growing -- so that\u2019s the largest, the fastest growing and now the second largest is mobile. One of the reasons why we really feel that we can make a contribution to mobile is because video games is such a large part of the mobile experience and in fact it's the largest download of the worlds largest digital store Google Play it is \u2013 video games is what people spend the most time actually doing on a tablet and video games and great computer graphics go hand in hand.","This is an area where we can add a lot of value. And so these two platforms are the largest and now the fastest growing and I don\u2019t think there is anything that game consoles would do at this point that would disrupt that. People just have too many PCs and there are too many people with tablets and mobile devices and people like to game wherever they happen to be not just while they\u2019re sitting in front of their TV, sitting in front of the family room.","Chris Evenden","Let\u2019s reach our next question please.","Operator","Yes sir. And our next question will come from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital","We\u2019re going to follow-up on the Tegra revenue, if you could just talk about the delta you\u2019re looking at flat now, it's expected to be down. One, I was wondering if you could sell and if could give any sort of magnitude on how much you expect it to decline now and then, you had some ramps that didn\u2019t pan out in the first half but are you still looking at the same pipeline of that ramping in the second half for you? Thank you ","Jen-Hsun Huang","Missed a part of that question and Dwayne said it so fast.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital","If you could dial in any, you expected decline, do you have any sort of range that you could provide us to how much it would decline?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Relative to last year?","Karen Burns","Yeah.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Oh relative to last year. The decline comes from, so coming into the year we had pretty high expectations on one particular platform and there\u2019s no sense mainly, but it's a very important platform that also derived from it a lot of design wins. And because this particular platform just didn't do as well as we or frankly anybody in the industry had hoped, we don't expect as much returns on that investment as we originally hoped. Our guess is that it's going to be down a couple of $100 million or so, maybe somewhere between $200 million or $300 million overall and we don't expect it in the short term to come back. But not all of the other platforms that we're talking about obviously are not affected by this one, one particular design win and all of its associated design wins.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital","Okay, thanks for that. And then on the GPU side, you expected growth into Q3. Is that both desktop and notebooks and if you can just talk about the Haswell refresh. Your notebooks were down a little bit in Q2 of the June quarter or the third quarter. If you could talk about, are you expecting to see notebooks see a bit of a rebound with Haswell? Thanks.","Jen-Hsun Huang","I think that our notebook was down very, very low single digit year-over-year and was down single digits from Q2 in the last quarter. And so it's slightly down. The overall notebook, PC marketplace of course is not as vibrant as people have hoped. But you know that we're not really in the mainstream PC market, we're really in the specialty PC market whether it's gaming PC or workstation PCs or high performance computing PCs or premium consumer PCs or PCs that are used for video editing and digital content creation, that's primarily our target. The notebook part of it of course, the consumer part of it is not vibrant and we're not expecting it to \u2013 in our guidance we're not expecting the growth [Technical Difficulty] our growth from GPU is primarily attributed to gaming, to workstations, to Quadro, workstation GPU and the Tesla GPU.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital","And that's relative to October with that comment?","Jen-Hsun Huang","I'm sorry, Blayne\u2026","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital","My question was when you look into October, you talked about broad growth, is both desktops and notebooks growing into October?","Karen Burns","Yeah, that's the quarter for Q3. That's where the growth we're expecting. I think that's your question.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital","Sorry if I'm being difficult. I'm just trying to figure out \u2013 I think you're answering it, but when you mentioned all the drivers into October, you left notebooks. So I just wanted to clarify do you also expect notebooks to see a bit of rebound into October?","Jen-Hsun Huang","We're not expecting much growth from notebook.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital","Okay, thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Thanks. Lisa?","Operator","Our next question is going to come from the line of Patrick Wang with Evercore.","Unidentified Analyst","(Indiscernible) for Patrick. Thanks for taking my questions. Speaking on GPU, could you talk about the pricing around GPUs now? And how will share trend in the second half in your view?","Jen-Hsun Huang","ASPs are up but they've been on an upward trend for some time and that's one of the reasons why \u2013 also because they're shifting towards premium products or specialty products like gaming and workstations and high performance computing what we call GeForce, Quadro and Tesla because of the growth of those segments, it improves ASP and it improves gross margins. We haven't seen share movements substantially for some time and we're not expecting much later on this year.","Unidentified Analyst","All right, thanks for that. And then maybe, can you discuss the buyback plan you're looking for in 3Q and 4Q?","Karen Burns","Well, we haven't announced any new buyback plan but we certainly have a commitment to capital returns for the long term. The contracts that we're under right now does not add until the end of Q3.","Unidentified Analyst","Is there any dollar amount we should think about for each quarter?","Karen Burns","It was an accelerated share repurchase, so we're just waiting for the contract to complete.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Karen, why don't you just tell him what the whole thing is for the year? Maybe he hasn't seen some of the stuff.","Karen Burns","The 750 million is what we're going to repurchase and the bulk of it, the majority of 40 million shares we have received and we're expecting an incremental amount in Q3. So effectively a share repurchase in Q3 as well.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Will that be complete in Q3, I guess, is my question?","Karen Burns","That transaction will be complete in Q3. Any further repurchases we'll announce in Q3.","Unidentified Analyst","Good. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Kevin Cassidy with Stifel Nicolaus.","Unidentified Analyst","[Dean] calling in for Kevin. Thank you very much for taking my call. Could you provide some extra color on the acceptance and progress in the GRID hardware area? We're seeing a number of software announcements. I was wondering how the hardware maybe coming along in terms of sale and potentials?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Thanks, [Dean]. GRID just as a background for everybody, GRID is our data center GPU server initiative and GRID has several attributes. One, of course, could be used to for high performance computing and one could be used for big data analysis whether it's image direct ignition or image processing or audio processing or video processing, you know that more and more people are uploading just an enormous amount of multimedia data onto the web. And the third initiative is enterprise virtualization. And one of the most challenging parts of enterprise virtualization is called VDI. And so these are the major applications of GRID. All of our OEMs have now completed all of their server and data in their certifications and are now in production; Cisco, Dell, HP and IBM. There are trials going around all over the world where we see visibility into some of them and we track about 150 all over the world; in Japan, in Europe, in United States, in China and this quarter we had just started shipping early samples. So we'll see how it turns out. But this is our first true enterprise computing application, our first true enterprise computing product and so we're quite excited about the prospects.","Unidentified Analyst","If you can't comment on this, is there \u2013 primarily interest in customers building their own hardware or in using the video design or how is the interest shaping up in this area?","Jen-Hsun Huang","There are three ways to access GRID. One is buy it from our OEMs and so that's Cisco and Dell and HP and IBM and there's some over \u2013 almost 30 different server platforms that are now available in the marketplace with GPUs in it. The second way is to build their own data centers and they would buy GPUs directly from us. And so these are data centers that \u2013 they're not announced yet, but they're just large data centers that want to build their own data centers. And the third way is for small or medium businesses who would like to build \u2013 who's customers are single application customers or don't have an IT department or not big enough to be served by large IT companies and they'll buy a fully integrated appliance from us. The last which is the GRID VCA appliance is not in volume production yet. It's sampling in North America but the first two are in production.","Unidentified Analyst","That's helpful. Thank you very much.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Thanks, Dean.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Chris Caso with Susquehanna Financial Group.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Hi, Chris, are you there?","Chris Evenden","Why don\u2019t we go to the next one?","Chris Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group","Hello, can you hear me? Hello.","Chris Evenden","Yes, there we go.","Chris Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group","Sorry about that.","Chris Evenden","Go ahead.","Chris Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group","Just, the first question about OpEx and the, I guess you said that some OpEx was pushed forward into this quarter, but your comments also suggested that the OpEx, I guess you were going to take some actions to reduce the OpEx going forward, could you expand on that a bit?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Actually what Karen said was that we\u2019re going to target the $1.6 billion that we had we said before.","Chris Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group","Okay, so I mean, I guess going forward even as we look over the longer term, I know you\u2019re making a lot of investments in the business at this point, just some general guidance about the level of OpEx spending we should expect going forward?","Jen-Hsun Huang","I don\u2019t think the plan is to reduce OpEx below the current levels. We\u2019re investing in three very, very important initiatives. One is GRID. GRID puts our GPUs and data centers which powers Cloud computing. I can\u2019t imagine a more important initiative. The second is Tegra, which is going after the Android and ARM computing revolution. Computing devices are cropping up everywhere of course it's already -- we know that it disrupted smartphones. It's in the process of disrupting computing with tablets, but it\u2019s disruption will propagate out to consumer electronics to gaming to TVs to automobiles to just about anything with a computing device. And wherever there is a computer there is an opportunity that some of them would require GPUs. And what Tegra is about -- initiative is about is addressing those opportunities. And wherever we can address those opportunities, what Tegra -- the effort of Tegra, the focus of Tegra spins off because of that intense focus on energy efficiency and targeting mobile devices and small computing devices it spins off GPU course that we can now use as core IP. And so our investment is really around these three areas, GRID, Tegra and our core IP initiatives. And I think these are three very large and very important growth initiatives that are very important to investing, and so we\u2019re not expecting to reduce OpEx. What Karen has been saying is that we\u2019re constantly focused on making sure that there are no waste in the company. And we are the largest visual computing company in the world and our investments are leveraged from visual computing and leveraged from our GPUs, but these are still large investments as you know.","Chris Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group","Okay, great. And as a follow-up I just want to make sure that I understood the comments earlier with regard to the Tegra expectations for the year. I guess or I think what you said was $200 million to $300 million in Tegra revenues overall. If you could just clarify that, make sure that I got it right.","Jen-Hsun Huang","It's actually backwards. I think last year we had done something along the lines of $750 million in Tegra in overall Tegra from smartphones to tablets to automobile to embedded entertainment. Whether it's Windows on ARM -- excuse me Win RT or Android. Okay, so that all of that was under Tegra and last year it was about $750 million. This year we\u2019re expecting it to be somewhat between $200 million to $300 million less than that. And even though the second half is going to be a big increase from the first half we\u2019re not expecting the increase in the second half to make up for the full-year last year. Was that clear, Chris?","Chris Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group","[Likely].","Operator","Okay. And we\u2019re going to move to our next question and that is from Betsy Van Hees with Wedbush Securities.","Betsy Van Hees - Wedbush Securities Inc.","Thanks for taking my questions. You guys have done a really great job of growing gross margin quarter-over-quarter and then I believe you guided it for 56% in this quarter, are we going to continue to see as we look forward the continued strides in gross margin or are we kind of plateauing out here? That\u2019s my first question, thanks.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Hi, Betsy. There are several drivers for gross margins. One is Quadro our professional visualization products is quite rich in gross margins, because it's mostly a software product. Our value proposition in Quadro is very heavily related to all of the middleware and tools and all of the algorithm technologies that we incorporate into software packages all over the world that are processed by Quadro. Tesla is rich in gross margins, because again it's very much a computing platform products, it's not a chip product, and it's about the programming model, it's about the programming language, it's about compilers and tools and libraries and all about although the computation of mathematicians that work with our super computing centers and research centers around the world to solve the worlds most complex science problems. What also helps our gross margin \u2013 drives our gross margins is GRID.","GRID again is a heavily software product. The GPU hypervisor, all of the compatibility that\u2019s integrated into all of the hypervisors and to enterprise infrastructures around the world, the value proposition that it delivers it's just very much a software product. And of course in the future if we were successful with our core - GPU core IP strategy that would be a big lift on gross margins. So we have products that are very software intensive, very IP intensive and therefore very margin rich. But we also have OEM products where we have to compete against other chip providers and our margins are much more compressed there. And so it just depends on where, which one of these parts of our businesses grow faster.","I am not exactly sure whether I would be happier if the gross margins were to be richer and richer or whether our revenues were to outpace our gross margin growth, but we have the vehicles now from IP to chips to very value rich, software rich system components and systems to be able to drive our growth and yet we can be singularly focused on visual computing. We can be singularly focused and being the world\u2019s best GPU provider and serve these markets that are growing quickly.","Betsy Van Hees - Wedbush Securities Inc.","Thanks. And that was very, very helpful. And as we look at the guidance and we look a the GPU business and Tegra in the licensing, is it fair to say that the GPU business is kind of be inline with the mid-point of your guidance and then you\u2019re going to have a significant growth in Tegra and but that\u2019s going to be offset the \u2013 because of some declines in the videogame consoles, is that how we should be looking at the quarter?","Jen-Hsun Huang","I think that\u2019s a good approximation. Our GPU product line basically is mid-point of margins and so if you see quarter growth faster than top line, if you see Tegra growth faster in top line, if you see GRID growth faster in top line, then I would expect our gross margins to increase. If you see Tegra growth faster than top line, then you would see our gross margins come under some pressure and if they both grow at similar rates, then our gross margins would stay flat.","Betsy Van Hees - Wedbush Securities Inc.","Okay, thanks. I know I said that was my last question. But I do have one more, and that\u2019s \u2013 I know you guys give forward guidance just the quarter, but as we look at the January quarter, what typical seasonality in the January quarter? I know things have changed a lot in the dynamics of the PC market. But how do you think we should be looking at seasonality for the January quarter?","Jen-Hsun Huang","I think there are seasonality factors, but I think that there are product cycle factors that are greater than the seasonality factor. And although -- and don\u2019t take this as a guidance for the January quarter, but we\u2019re just in the process of ramping Tegra 4 into all of the devices that have been announced and devices that have not yet been announced. We're ramping SHIELD and the holiday season of course is a factor there and SHIELD is a brand new product for us. And we're ramping on Logan. And so we were late to market with Tegra 4 and it was a bit of a scramble, but I think the decisions were really, really good. We wanted to bring forward our modem technology so that we can start to engage the market and start the long process of certification. We also wanted to pull forward very importantly our mobile Kepler GPU. It was a three-year endeavor to take the world's most advanced GPU and mobilizing it and the results are just really quite spectacular. It's kind of amazing to see the graphics that you see in a high end PC or even a super computer for that matter running in a little mobile processor. And the architecture and the efficiency is so exquisite that the energy efficiency is really \u2013 really it's a big continuity. We've already demonstrated some three times better energy efficiency and as you know; energy efficiency if in a constrained energy environment like a mobile device, the most energy efficient processor is also the most high performance processor. And so I'm super excited for Logan and now we can get into the marketplace well ahead of the competition. And so those factors along with the work that we're doing in GPUs are likely to play a role and so we'll see how it turns out.","Betsy Van Hees - Wedbush Securities Inc.","Thanks, Jen-Hsun. I really appreciate it. Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Thanks, Betsy.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Jimmy Schneider with Goldman Sachs.","Jim Schneider - Goldman Sachs","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the qualification I think Tegra 4, the LTE modem, are you still on track for AT&T qualification by the end of this year. I was wondering if you could maybe give us some help to understand whether you might expect that the Tegra 4 product or the LTE modem might ship on other carriers before AT&T?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Let's see, first of all, our modem qualification comes in two different parts and they're related but not the same. First is the data service which is important for all of our tablet products. And so data modem cert is well ahead of the voice and we're in the process of doing that as we speak. And then there's the [voice] that goes with Tegra 4i. That happens when the certification completes near the end of the year. And so we're not expecting \u2013 the reason why we do AT&T is because it's the most rigorous and if we get through AT&T, you're pretty much set on just about vastly the western world's open markets. So that's the reason why we focus on AT&T first.","Jim Schneider - Goldman Sachs","Thanks. That's helpful. And then just as a quick follow-up, on the gross margins you saw in Q2, was more of the improvements due to the mix up of the Quadro and Kepler businesses or was more of that due to the increase in mix just from your desktop GSU businesses?","Jen-Hsun Huang","All three. Chris mentioned that Tesla had an almost record quarter and most of that was from not one singular supercomputing center installation. It was all from open markets and smaller installations, (indiscernible) purchased around off-the-shelf applications. So there is now just a current of business that appears to have developed around the world and that's really healthy for gross margins. And whenever we do well in gaming, it helps our gross margins. You know that GeForce has two parts. There's the GeForce for OEMs and there is GeForce GTX for gaming. Usually when I say gaming, I just mean GeForce GTX which happens to be most of our \u2013 the upper half of our GeForce business.","Jim Schneider - Goldman Sachs","That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis with B. Riley.","Craig Ellis - B. Riley","Thank you for taking the question. Jen-Hsun, just to clarify the question that Chris had asked, you had mentioned that you expect operating expense to stay at current levels. When you refer to current levels, were you referring to the levels that you'll be at with fiscal third quarter guidance or levels that you were at with the result that you had in fiscal 2Q?","Jen-Hsun Huang","This coming quarter plus or minus.","Craig Ellis - B. Riley","Okay, so annualized if that's where OpEx is, then you'd be on something closer to a 1.84 billion annual OpEx run rate, correct?","Jen-Hsun Huang","No, that's not correct. We \u2013 go ahead, Karen.","Karen Burns","So I mentioned we were at 700 \u2013 just under 800 million for the first half. And then if you add the 418 guidance and then on a path for Q4 if you do some trajectory small, we're just above 1.6 and it's a classic range of plus or minus 2%.","Craig Ellis - B. Riley","Okay, got it. And then switching gears to the products, Jen-Hsun, a lot of discussion on SHIELD as they get started to ramp for revenues. When you look out at the ramps that you have planned for those separate products, when do they start becoming a material relative to total company revenues? For example, when would either of them start to move into that 3% to 5% of company sales range?","Jen-Hsun Huang","I would really love to see GRID be able to contribute on a level like Telsa next year. And Telsa contributes materially. I think that SHIELD is just hard to say. We didn't \u2013 we had high expectations from a personal level but we didn't set high expectations from a financial level. We think it's just a really special and quite a distinguished product. And the more people that are playing with it and touching it and holding it and enjoying it, the more they become really passionate around it. It's a little bit like a gaming PC is to a PC. This is a gaming Android device to an Android device. And it's a specialized Android device just as our GeForce PCs are really a specialized PC for gaming. And so I think the logic is relatively similar. We can deploy the company's DNA expertise in graphics and gaming into SHIELD and so people understand it when NVIDIA brings a gaming product to market, they've known and grown up with GeForce for many of our \u2013 I even meet many engineers in NVIDIA who grew up on NVIDIA's GPUs. And they know our gaming brands very well and they know what we can do in this field. So I think it could be a really, really interesting outcome but we're modest with it right and we're just really grateful that everybody loves it so much.","Craig Ellis - B. Riley","So with the growth that you're seeing in the\u2026","Chris Evenden","Can we follow up with you afterwards? We've only got a couple of minutes left and let's get one more question in if possible.","Craig Ellis - B. Riley","Sure, Chris. Thanks.","Chris Evenden","Go ahead, Lisa.","Operator","Yes. Our next question will come from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo.","David Wong - Wells Fargo","Thanks very much. Your notebook GPU sequential trend for July and October, is this purely a reflection of the overall notebook market or have you had any significant socket losses that would result in the market numbers showing a falling notebook GPU share in NVIDIA?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Our sequential and annual notebook decline is dramatically slower than the overall notebook decline.","David Wong - Wells Fargo","Okay, great. And do you expect Tegra 4 sales might ramp to a big equal or greater than Tegra 3 or should we expect a lower crest for Tegra 4?","Jen-Hsun Huang","That's a tough question because of two factors. One factor is, it\u2019s hard to say exactly where SHIELD is going to be and we\u2019re just expecting it \u2013 we\u2019re just trying to be modest at the moment. Two, the separation between Tegra 4 and Tegra 3 or Tegra 3 and Tegra 4 is well over a year. The separation between Tegra 4 and Tegra Next is as you know relatively short, because Logan is already sampling. The sacrifice that we made on Tegra 4 to bring in Logan was really a good decision, because we wanted to introduce the mobile world to the most advanced GPU in the world and what NVIDIA\u2019s core DNA is all about. And it\u2019s a time when the market is really craving a great GPU. The next generation Tegra or Logan has a lot more than a great GPU in it. And there are many other surprises that we\u2019ve in store that I\u2019m just super excited about. But at the very minimum, it contains the most advanced GPU in the world binary compatible, architecturally compatible, but at a power envelope that\u2019s 100 times lower and it\u2019s the most efficient GPU that\u2019s ever been built for mobile and any energy or performance comparison is against anything that\u2019s available around the horizon is just off the charts and so we\u2019re going to take Logan to market as fast as we can. And so those two factors SHIELD and Logan are kind of makes that your question a little hard to answer.","David Wong - Wells Fargo","Great. Thanks very much.","Jen-Hsun Huang","I think the net of it is good.","David Wong - Wells Fargo","Okay, good. Thanks.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Thanks everyone. And we look forward to talking to you next time in our Q3 earnings call. Anyone we haven\u2019t got up with now we will catch up with you immediately after the call. Thank you.","Operator","And this does conclude today\u2019s conference call.

","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Simona Jankowski, Vice President of Investor Relations, to begin your conference.","Simona Jankowski","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to NVIDIA\u2019s conference call for the second quarter of fiscal 2019. With me on the call today from NVIDIA are Jensen Huang, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Colette Kress, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","I\u2019d like to remind you that our call is being webcast live on NVIDIA\u2019s Investor Relations website. It\u2019s also being recorded. You can hear a replay by telephone until August 23, 2018.

Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements.","During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO Commentary, which is posted on our website.","With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.","Colette Kress","Thanks, Simona. This is a big week for NVIDIA. We just announced the biggest leap in GPU architecture in over a decade. We can\u2019t wait to tell you more about it. But first, let\u2019s talk about the quarter.","We had another strong quarter, led by Datacenter and Gaming. Q2 revenue reached $3.12 billion, up 40% from a year earlier. Each market platform, Gaming, Datacenter, Pro Visualization, and Automotive hit record levels with strong growth, both sequentially and year-on-year. These platforms, collectively grew more than 50% year-on-year. Our revenue outlook had anticipated cryptocurrency-specific products declining to approximately $100 million, while actual crypto-specific product revenue was $18 million, and we now expect a negligible contribution going forward. Gross margins grew nearly 500 basis points year-on-year, while both GAAP and non-GAAP net income exceeded $1 billion for the third consecutive quarter. Profit nearly doubled.","From a reporting segment perspective, GPU revenue grew 40% from last year to $2.66 billion. Tegra Processor revenue grew 40% to $467 million.","Let\u2019s start with our Gaming business. Revenue of $1.8 billion was up 52% year-on-year and up 5% sequentially. Growth was driven by all segments of the business with desktop, notebook, and gaming consoles up all strong double-digit percentages year-on-year. Notebooks were standout this quarter with strong demands for thin and right form factors, based on our Max-Q technology. Max-Q enables gaming PC OEMs to pack a high-performance GPU into a slim notebook that is just 20 millimeters thick, or less. All major notebook OEMs and ODMs have adopted Max-Q for their top of the line gaming notebooks, just in time for back-to-school. And we expect to see 26 models, based on Max-Q, in stores, for the holidays.","The gaming industry remains vibrant. The eSports audience now approaches 400 million, up 18% over the past year. The unprecedented success of Fortnite and PUBG has popularized this new Battle Royale genre, and expanded the gaming market. In fact, the Battle Royale mode is coming to games like the much anticipated Battlefield 5. We are thrilled to partner with EA to make GeForce the best PC gaming platform for the release of Battlefield 5 in October.","We\u2019ve also partnered with Square Enix to make GeForce the best platform for its upcoming Shadow of the Tomb Raider. Monster Hunter World arrived on PCs earlier this month, and it was an instant hit. And many more titles are lined up for what promises to be a big holiday season. It\u2019s not just new titles that are building anticipation.","The gaming community is excited of the Turing architecture, announced earlier this week at SIGGRAPH. Turing is our most important innovation since the invention of the CUDA GPU, over a decade ago. The architecture includes new, dedicated ray-tracing processors or RT Cores, and new Tensor Cores for AI inferencing which together will make real-time ray-tracing possible for the first time.","We will enable the cinematic quality gaming, amazing new effects powered by neural networks and fluid interactivity on highly complex models. Turing will reset the look of video games and open up the 250 billion visual effects industries to GPUs. Turing is the result of more than 10,000 engineering years of effort. It delivers up to 6x performance increase over Pascal for ray-traced graphics and up to 10x boost for peak inference swaps. This new architecture will be the foundation of new portfolio of products across our platforms going forward.","Moving to Datacenter. We had another strong quarter with revenue of $760 million, accelerating to 83% year-on-year growth and up 8% sequentially. This performance was driven by hyperscale demand as internet services used daily by billions of people increasingly leverage AI. Our GPUs power real-time services such as search, voice recognition, voice synthesis, translation, recommender engines, fraud detection, and retail applications. We also saw growing adoption of our AI and high-performance computing solutions by vertical industries, representing one of the most fastest areas of growth in our business.","Companies and sectors ranging from oil and gas to financial services to transportation are harnessing the power of AI and our accelerated computing platform to turn data into actionable insights.","Our flagship Tensor Core GPU, the Tesla V100, based on Volta architecture continued to ramp for both AI and high-performance computing applications. Volta has been adopted by every major cloud provider and hyperscaledatacenter operator around the world. Customers have quickly moved to qualify the new version of V100, which doubled the on-chip DRAM to 32 gig to support much larger data sets and neural networks. Major server OEMs, HP Enterprise, IBM, Lenovo, Cray and Supermicro also brought the V100 32 gig to market in the quarter.","We should continue to gain traction with AI inference solution which helped expand our addressable market in the datacenter. During the quarter, we released our TensorRT 4 AI inference accelerator software for general availability. While prior versions of the TensorRT optimized image and video-related workloads, TensorRT 4 expands the aperture to include more use cases such as speech recognition, speech synthesis, translation, and recommendation systems. This means, we can now address a much larger portion of deep learning inference workloads, delivering up to 190x performance speed-up relative to CPUs.","NVIDIA and Google engineers have integrated TensorRT into the TensorFlow deep learning framework, making it easier to run AI inference on our GPUs. And Google Cloud announced that NVIDIA Tesla P4 GPU, our small form factor GPU for AI inferenceand graphic virtualization is available on Google Cloud Platform.","Datacenter growth was also driven by DGX, our fully optimized AI server which incorporates V100 GPUs, our proprietary high-speed interconnect and our fully optimized software stack. The annual run rate for DGX is in the hundreds of millions of dollars. DGX-2, announced in March at our GPU Technology Conference, is being qualified by customers and is on track to ramp in the third quarter.","At GTC Taiwan in June, we announced that we are bringing DGX-2 technology to our HGX-2 server platform. We make HGX-2 available to OEM and ODM partners, so they can quickly deploy our newest innovations in their own server designs.","In recent weeks, we announced partnerships with NetApp and Pure Storage to help customers speed AI deployment from month to days or even hours, with highly-integrated, optimized solutions that combine DGX with the company\u2019s all-flash storage offerings and third-party networking.","At GTC Taiwan, we also revealed that we are -- set high speed records for AI training and inference influence. Key to our strategy is our software stack. From CUDA to our training and inference of SDKs as well as our work with developers to accelerate their applications. It is the reason we can achieve such dramatic performance gains in such a short period of time. And our developer ecosystem is getting stronger. In fact, we just passed 1 million members in our developer program, up 70% from one year ago.","One of our proudest moments this quarter was the launch of the Summit AI supercomputer in Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Summit is powered by over 27,000 Volta Tensor Core GPUs and helped the U.S. reclaim the number one spot on the TOP500 supercomputer list for the first time in five years. Other NVIDIA power systems joined the TOP500 list were Sierra at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the third spot and the ABCI Japan\u2019s fastest supercomputer in the fifth spot, NVIDIA now powers five of the world\u2019s seven fastest supercomputers, reflecting the broad shift in supercomputing to GPUs. Indeed, the majority of the computing performance added to the latest TOP500 list comes from NVIDIA GPUs and more than 550 HPC applications are now GPU accelerated. With our Tensor Core GPUs, supercomputers can now combine simulation with the power of AI to advance many scientific applications from molecular dynamics to seismic processing to genomics and material science.","Moving to Pro Visualization. Revenue grew to $281 million, up 20% year-over-year and 12% sequentially, driven by demand for real-time rendering and mobile workstations, as well as emerging applications like AI and VR. These emerging applications now represent approximately 35% of Pro Visualization sales. Strength extended across several key industries including healthcare, oil and gas, and media and entertainment. Key wins in the quarter include Raytheon, Lockheed, GE, Siemens and Phillips Healthcare.","In announcing the Turing architecture at SIGGRAPH, we also introduced the first Turing-based processors, the Quadro RTX 8000, 6000 and 5000 GPUs, bringing interactive ray-tracing to world, years before it\u2019s been predicted. We also announced that the NVIDIA RTX Server, a full ray-tracing global illumination rendering server that will give a giant boost to world\u2019s render firms as Moore\u2019s Law ends.","Turing is set to revolutionized the work of 5 -- 50 million designers and artists, enabling them to render photorealistic scenes in real time and add new AI-based capabilities to the workflows. Private GPUs based on the Turing will be available in the fourth quarter. Dozens of leading software providers, developers and OEMs have already expressed support for Turing. Our ProViz partners view it as a game-changer for professionals in the media and entertainment, architecture and manufacturing industries.","Finally, turning to Automotive. Revenue was a record $161 million, up 13% year-over-year and up 11% sequentially. This reflects growth in our autonomous vehicle production and development engagements around the globe, as well as the ramp of next-generation AI-based, smart cockpit infotainment solutions.","We continue to make progress on our autonomous vehicle platform with key milestones and partnerships announced this quarter. In July Daimler and Bosch selected DRIVE Pegasus as the AI brain for their level 4 and level 5 autonomous fleets. Pilot testing will begin next year in Silicon Valley. This collaboration brings together NVIDIA\u2019s leadership in AI and self-driving platforms, Bosch\u2019s hardware and systems expertise as the world\u2019s largest tier 1 automotive supplier, and Daimler\u2019s vehicle expertise and global brand synonymous with safety and quality.","This quarter, we started shipping development systems for DRIVE Pegasus, an AI supercomputer designed specifically for autonomous vehicles. Pegasus delivers 320 trillion operations per second to handle diverse and redundant algorithms, and architected for safety as well as performance. This automotive grade, functionally safe production solution uses two NVIDIA Xavier SoCs and two next-generation GPUs, designed for AI and visual processing, delivering more than 10x greater performance and 10x higher data bandwidth compared to the previous generation. With co-designed hardware and software, the platform is created to achieve ASIL D ISO 26262, the industry\u2019s highest level of automotive functional safety.","We have created a scalable AI car platform that spans the entire range of automated and autonomous driving, from traffic jam pilots to level 5 robotaxis. More than 370 companies and research institutions are using NVIDIA\u2019s automotive platform. With this growing momentum and accelerating revenue growth, we remain excited about the intermediate and long-term opportunities for autonomous driving business.","This quarter, we also introduced our Xavier platform for Jetson for the autonomous machine market. With more than 9 billion transistors, it delivers over 30 trillion operations per second, more processing capability than a powerful workstation or using one-third the energy of a light bulb. Jetson Xavier establishes customers to deliver AI computing at the edge, powering autonomous machines like robots or drones with applications in manufacturing, logistics, retail, agricultural, healthcare and more.","Lastly, in our OEM segment, revenue declined by 54% year-on-year and 70% sequentially. This was primarily driven by the sharp decline of cryptocurrency revenues to fairly minimal levels.","Moving to the rest of the P&L. Q2 GAAP gross margin was 63.3% and non-GAAP was 63.5%, in line with our outlook. GAAP operating expenses were $818 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $692 million, up 30% year-on-year. We can continue to invest in the key platforms, driving our long-term growth including Gaming, AI and Automotive.","GAAP net income was $1.1 billion and EPS was $1.76, up 89% and 91%, respectively, from a year earlier. Some of the upside was driven by a tax rate near 7% compared to our outlook of 11%. Non-GAAP net income was $1.21 billion and EPS was $1.94, up 90% and 92%, respectively, from a year ago, reflecting revenue strength, as well as gross and operating margin expansion and lower taxes. Quarterly cash flow from operations was $913 million, capital expenditures were $128 million.","With that, let me turn to the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2019. We are including no contribution from crypto in our outlook. We expect revenue to be $3.25 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 62.6% and 62.8%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $870 million and $730 million, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP OI&E are both expected to be income of $20 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 9%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $125 million to $150 million.","Further financial details are included in the CFO Commentary and other information available on our IR website.","In closing, I\u2019d like to highlight some of the upcoming events for the financial community. We will be presenting at the Citi Global Technology Conference on September 6th and meeting with the financial community at our GPU technology conferences in Tokyo on September 13th and Munich on October 10th. And our next earnings call to discuss our financial results is in the third quarter of 2019, will take place on November 15.","We will now open the call for questions. If you could limit your questions to one or two? And operator, would you please poll for questions? Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.","Mark Lipacis","The question is on ray-tracing. To what extent is this creating new markets versus enabling greater capabilities in your existing markets? Thanks.","Jensen Huang","Yes, Mark. So, first of all, Turing, as you know, is the world\u2019s first ray-tracing GPU. And it completes our new computer graphics platform, which is going to reinvent computer graphics altogether. It unites four different computing modes rasterization, accelerated ray-tracing, computing with CUDA, and artificial intelligence. It uses these four basic methods to create imagery for the future.","There\u2019s two different -- two major ways that we\u2019ll experience the benefits right-away. The first is for the markets of visualization today, they require photorealistic images. Whether it\u2019s a IKEA Catalog or movie, or architectural engineering, or product design, car design, all of these types of markets require photorealistic images. And the only way to really achieve that is to use ray-tracing with physically based materials and lighting. The technology is rather complicated, has been computing intensive for very long time. And it wasn\u2019t until now that we\u2019ve been able to achieve it in a productive way. And so, Turing has the ability to do ray-tracing, accelerated ray-tracing, and it also has the ability to combine very large frame buffers, because these data sets are extremely large.","And so, that marketplace is quite large, and it\u2019s never been served by GPUs before, until now, all of that has been run on CPU render farms, gigantic render farms in all these movie studios and service centers and so on and so forth. The second area where you\u2019re going to see the benefits of ray-tracing, we haven\u2019t announced.","Mark Lipacis","Okay. If I could have a follow-up on the gaming side. Where do you think the industry is on creating content that leverages that kind of capability? Thank you.","Jensen Huang","Yes, Mark. At GTC this last year in March -- GDC and GTC, we announced a brand new platform called NVIDIA RTX. And this platform has those four computation methods that I described, for generating images. We put that platform out with the support of Microsoft. They call it the Microsoft DirectX Raytracing. And the major game engine companies, Epic has implemented real-time ray-tracing and the RTX into, the Unreal Engine. And at GDC and GTC, we demonstrated for the very first time on four Volta GPUs, on four Volta GPUs, the ability to do that. And it was the intention of - to get this platform out to all of the game developers. And we\u2019ve been working with game developers throughout this time.","This week, at SIGGRAPH, we announced our Quadro, which is the first -- the Quadro RTX 8000, 6000 and 5000, the world\u2019s first accelerated ray-tracing GPUs. And I demonstrated one Quadro running the same application that we demonstrated on four Volta GPUsrunning in March. And the performance is really spectacular.","And so, I think the answer to your question is, developers all have access to RTX. It\u2019s in Microsoft\u2019s DirectX; it\u2019s in the most popular game engine in the world; and you\u2019re going to start to see developers use it.","On the workstation side, on the Professional Visualization side, all of the major ISVs have jumped on to adopt it. And at SIGGRAPH this year there, there you could see a whole bunch of developers demonstrating the NVIDIA RTX with accelerated ray-tracing, generating full realistic images. And so, I would say that no platform, in our history, has on day one of announcement, had so many developers jump onto it. And stay tuned. We\u2019ve got a lot more stories to tell you about RTX.","Operator","Your next question is from Matt Ramsay with Cowen.","Matt Ramsay","Thank you very much. Colette, I had a couple of questions about inventory, the first of which is, I understand you\u2019ve launched a new product set in ProViz, and the Datacenter business is obviously ramping really strongly. But, if you look at the balance sheet, I think the inventory level is up by mid-30% sequentially and you\u2019re guiding revenue up 3% or so. Maybe you could help us sort of walk through the contributions of that inventory and what it might mean for future products? And secondly, if you could talk a little bit about the gaming channel, in terms of inventory, how things are looking in the channel, as you guys see it, during this period of product transition? Thank you.","Colette Kress","Sure. Thanks for your questions. So, when you look at our inventory on the balance sheet, I think it\u2019s generally consistent with what you have seen over the last several months in terms of what we will be bringing to market. Turing is an extremely important piece of architecture, and as you know, it will be with us for some time. So, I think the inventory balance is getting ready for that. And don\u2019t forget, our work in terms of Datacenter and what we have for Volta is also a very, very complex computer in some cases in terms of what we have also in terms of there. So, just those things together, plus our Pascal architecture is still here, makes up almost all of what we have there in terms of inventory.","Jensen Huang","Matt, on the channel inventory side, we see inventory in the lower end of our stack. And that inventory is well-positioned for back-to-school and the building season that\u2019s coming up on Q3. And so, I feel pretty good about that. The rest of our product launches and the ramp-up of Turing is going really well. And so, I think the rest of the announcements we haven\u2019t made, but stay tuned. The RTX family is going to be a real game-changer for us. And the reinvention of computer graphics altogether has been embraced by so many developers. We\u2019re going to see some really exciting stuff this year.","Operator","Next question is from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.","Vivek Arya","Actually, just a clarification, and then the question. On the clarification, Colette if you could also help us understand the gross margin sequencing from Q2 to Q3? And then, Jensen, how would you contrast the Pascal cycle with the Turing cycle? Because, I think in your remarks, you mentioned Turing is a very strong advancement over what you had before. But, when you launched Pascal, you had guided to very strong Q3s and then Q4s. This time, the Q3 outlook, even though it\u2019s good on an absolute basis, on a sequential and a relative basis, it\u2019s perhaps not as strong. So, could you just help us contrast the Pascal cycle with what we should expect with the Turing cycle?","Colette Kress","Let me start first with your question regarding gross margins. We have essentially reached, as we move into Q3, normalization of our gross margins. I believe, over the last several quarters, we have seen the impact of crypto and what that can do to elevate our overall gross margins. We believe we\u2019ve reached a normal period, as we\u2019re looking forward to essentially no cryptocurrency as we move forward.","Jensen Huang","Let\u2019s see. Pascal was really successful. Pascal, relative to Maxwell, was a leap in fact, and it was a really significant upgrade. The architectures were largely the same. They were both programmable shading. They were both at the same generation programmable shading. But Pascal was much, much more energy efficient, I think it was something like 30%, 40% more energy efficient than Maxwell. And that translated to performance benefits to customers. The success of Pascal was fantastic.","There\u2019s just simply no comparison to Turing. Turing is a reinvention of computer graphics; it is the first ray-tracing GPU in the world; it\u2019s the first GPU that will be able to ray trace light in an environment and create photorealistic shadows and reflections and be able to model things like areal lights and global illumination and indirect lighting. The images are going to be so subtle and so beautiful, when you look at it, it just looks like a movie. And yet it\u2019s backwards compatible, with everything that we\u2019ve done. This new hybrid rendering model which extends what we\u2019ve built before but added to it two new capabilities artificial intelligence and accelerated ray-tracing is just fantastic. So, everything of the past will be brought along and benefits, and it\u2019s going to create new visuals that weren\u2019t possible before.","We also did a good job on laying the foundations of the development platform for the developers. We partnered with Microsoft to create DXR, Vulkan RT is also coming, and we have OptiX that are used by ProViz renderers and developers all over the world. And so, we have the benefit of laying the foundation stack by stack by stack over the years. And as result, on the data that Turing comes out, we\u2019re going to have a richness of applications that gamers will be able to enjoy.","You mentioned guidance. I actually think that on a year-over-year performance, we\u2019re doing terrific. And I\u2019m super excited about the ramp of Turing. It is the case that we benefited in the last several quarters from an unusual lift from crypto. In the beginning of the year, we thought and we projected that crypto would be a larger contribution through the rest of year. But, at this time, we consider it to be immaterial for the second half. And so, that makes comparisons on a sequential basis -- on a I guess, quarterly sequential basis harder. But, on a year-to-year basis, I think we\u2019re doing terrific. Every single one of our platforms are growing, high-performance computing of course, Datacenters is growing. AI, the adoption continues to seep from one industry to another industry. The automation that\u2019s going to be brought about by AI, is going to bring productivity gains to industries like nobody has ever seen before. And now with Turing, we\u2019re going to be able to reignite the Professional Visualization business, open us up to photorealistic rendering for the very first time, render farms, and everybody who is designing products that has to visualize it photo realistically to reinventing and resetting graphics for video games. And so, I think we\u2019re in a great position, and I\u2019m looking forward to reporting Q3, when the time comes.","Operator","Your next question is from Atif Malik with Citi.","Atif Malik","Colette, I have a question on Datacenter. In your prepared remarks, you talked about AI and high-performance computing driving new verticals, and some of these verticals are fastest growing. Some of your peers have talked about enterprise spending slowing down in the back half of this year on sever unit demand, and you guys are not -- units play more of an AI adoption. Just curious in terms of your thinking about second half Datacenter growth.","Colette Kress","So, as you know, we generally give our view on guidance for one quarter out. You are correct that our Datacenter results that we see is always a tremendous, unique mix every single quarter in terms of what we\u2019re seeing. But, there\u2019s still some underlying points of that that will likely continue. The growth in terms of use by the hyperscales, continued industry-by-industry coming on-board, essentially just because the needs of accelerated computing for the workloads and for the data that they have is so essential. So, we still expect as we go into Q3 for Datacenter to grow, both sequentially and year-over-year. And we\u2019ll see probably a mix of both, selling our Tesla V100 platforms, but also a good contribution from DGX.","Jensen Huang","Yes. That\u2019s right. Atif, let me just add a little bit more to that. I think, the one simple way to think about that is this. In the transportation industry, let\u2019s take one particular vertical, there are two dynamics that are happening that are very, very abundantly clear, and that will double -- transform that industry. The first of course is ride hailing and ride sharing. Those platforms in order to make a recommendation of which taxi to bring to which passenger, which customer, is a really large computing problem. It\u2019s a machine learning problem; it\u2019s an optimization problem at very, very large scale. And in every -- in each and every one of those instances, you need high-performance computers to use machine learning to figure out how to make that perfect match, or the most optimal match.","The second is self-driving cars. Every single car company that\u2019s working on robot taxis or self-driving cars, needs to collect data, label data, train on your network, or train a whole bunch of on your networks, and run those neural networks and cars. And so, you just make your list of how many people are actually building self-driving cars. And every single one of them will need even more GPU accelerated servers. And that\u2019s just for developing the model. The next stage is to simulate the entire software because we know that the industry or the world travels 10 trillion miles per year. And the best we could possibly do is to drive several million normal miles. And what we really want to do is to be able to simulate and stress, stress test our software stack. And the only way to do that is to do in virtual reality. And so, that\u2019s another supercomputer that you have to build for simulating all your software across those billions and billions of virtually created challenging miles.","And then lastly, before you OTA, the software, you\u2019re going to have to re-sim and replay against all of the miles that you\u2019ve collected over the years to make sure that you have no regressions before you OTA the new models into a fleet of cars. And so, transportation is going to be a very large industry.","Healthcare is the same way, from medical imaging that is now using AI just about everywhere to genomics that has discovered deep learning and the benefits of artificial intelligence, and in the future pathology. The list goes on. And so, industry after industry after industry, we\u2019re discovering the benefits of deep learning, and the industries could be really, really revolutionized by them.","Operator","Your next question is from C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI.","C.J. Muse","I guess, short-term and a long term. So, for short-term, as you think about your gaming guide, are you embedding any drawdown of channel inventory there? And then, longer term, as you think about Turing Tensor Cores? Can you talk a bit about differentiation versus Volta V100, particularly as you think about 8-bit integer and the opportunities there for inferencing? Thank you.","Jensen Huang","We\u2019re expecting the channel inventory to work itself out. We are masters at managing our channel, and we understand the channel very well. As you know, the way that we go to market is through the channels around the world. We\u2019re not concerned about the channel inventory.","As we ramp Turing, whenever we ramp a new architecture, we ramp it from the top down. And so, we have plenty of opportunities as we go back to the back to school in the gaming cycle to manage the inventory. So, we feel pretty good about that.","As a result, comparing Volta andTuring, entering, CUDA iscompatible, that\u2019s one of the benefits of CUDA. CUDA, all of the applications that take advantage of CUDA are written on top of cuDNN, which is our network platform to TensorRT that takes advantage -- that takes the output of the frameworks and optimize it for runtime. All of those tools and libraries run on top of Voltaand run on top of Turing and run on top of Pascal. What Turing adds over Pascal is the same Tensor Corethat is inside Volta. Of course, Volta is designed for large scale training. Eight GPUs could be connected together. They have the fastest HBM2 memories. And it\u2019s designed for datacenter applications, has 64-bit double-precision, ECC, high-resilience computing, and all of the software and system software capability and tools that make Voltathe perfect high-performance computing accelerator.","In the case of Turing, it\u2019s really designed for three major applications. The first application is to open up Pro Visualization, which is a really large market that has historically used render farms. And we\u2019re really unable to use GPUs until we now have -- we now have the ability to do full path trace, global illumination with very, very large data sets. So, that\u2019s one market that\u2019s brand new as a result of Turing. The second market is to reinvent computer graphics, real time computer graphics for video games and other real time visualization applications. When you see the images created by Turing, you\u2019re going to have a really hard time wanting to see the images of the past. It just looks amazing.","And then the third, Turing has a really supercharged Tensor Core. And this Tensor Core is used for image generation. It\u2019s also used for high throughput, deep learning inferencing for data centers. And so, these applications for Turing would suggest that there are multiple SKUs of Turing, which is one of the reasons why we have such a great engineering team, we could scale one architecture across a whole lot of platforms at one time.","And so, I hope that answers your question that the Tensor Core inference capability of Turing is going to be off the charts.","Operator","Next question is from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.","Joe Moore","Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk about cryptocurrency. Now that the dust is settled, you guys have done a good job of kind of laying out exactly how much of the OEM business has been driven by that but there\u2019s also been I think some sense of -- some of the GeForce business was being driven by crypto. Can you -- looking backwards, can you size that for us? And I guess if -- I am trying to understand the impact the crypto would have on the guidance for October, given that it seems it was very small in the July quarter?","Jensen Huang","Well, I think the second question is easier to answer and the reason -- the first one is just ambiguous. It\u2019s hard to predict, anyway. It\u2019s hard to estimate, no matter what. But, the second question, the answer is we\u2019re expecting -- we\u2019re projecting zero basically. And for the first question, how much of GeForce could\u2019ve been used for crypto? A lot of gamers at night, they could -- while they\u2019re sleeping, they could do some mining. And so, do they buy it for mining or did they buy it for gaming, it\u2019s kind of hard to say. And some miners were unable to buy our OEM products, and so they jumped on to the market to buy it from retail, and that probably happened a great deal as well. And that all happened in the last -- the previous several quarters, probably starting from late Q3, Q4, Q1, and very little last quarter, and we\u2019re projecting no crypto-mining going forward.","Operator","Your next question is from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.","Toshiya Hari","I had one for Jensen and one for Colette. Jensen, I was hoping you could remind us how meaningful your inference business is today within Datacenter, and how would you expect growth to come about over the next two years, as you -- as your success at accounts like Google proliferate across a broader set of customers? And then, for Colette, if you can give directional guidance for each of your platforms. I know you talked about Datacenter a little bit, if you can talk about the other segments. And on gaming specifically, if you can talk about whether or not new products are embedded in that guide?","Jensen Huang","Inference is going to be a very large market for us. It is surely material now in our Datacenter business. It is not the largest segment, but I believe it\u2019s going to be a very large segment of our Datacenter business. There\u2019re 30 million servers around the world, and that\u2019s kind of estimate, in the cloud, and there are a whole lot more in enterprises. I believe that almost every server in the future will be accelerated. And the reason for that is because artificial intelligence and deep learning software and neural net models are going to prediction models, are going to be infused into software everywhere. And acceleration has proven to be the best approach going forward.","We\u2019ve been laying the foundations for inferencing for a couple or two, three years. And as we have described at GTCs, inference is really, really complicated. And the reason for that is you have to take the output of these massive, massive networks that are output of the training frameworks and optimize it. This is probably the largest computational graph optimization problem that world has ever seen. And this is brand-new invention territory. There are so many different network architectures from CNNs to RCNNs, to auto encoders to RNNs and LSTMs, there is just so many different species of neural networks these days and is continuing to grow. And so the compiler technology is really, really complicated.","And this year, we announced two things. Earlier this year, we announced that we\u2019ve been successful in taking the Tesla P4, low-profile, high-energy-efficiency inference accelerator into hyperscale datacenters. And we announced our fourth generation TensorRT optimizing compiler, neural network optimizing compiler. And TRT 4 goes well beyond CNNs and image recognition in the beginning, and now allows us to support and optimize for voice recognition or speech recognition, natural language understanding, recommendation systems, translation. And all of these applications are really pervasive from internet services all over the world. And so, now from images to video to voice to recommendation systems, we now have a compiler that can address it. We are actively working with just about every single internet service provider in the world to incorporate inference acceleration into their stack. And the reason for that is because they need high throughput and very importantly, the need low latency. Voice recognition is only useful if it response in a relatively short period of time. And our platform is just really, really excellent for that.","And then, this last week, this week we announced Turing. And I announced that the inference performance of Turing is 10 times the inference performance of Pascal, which is already a couple of hundred times the inference performance of CPUs. And so, you take a look at the rate at which we\u2019re moving on, both in the support of new neural networks, the ever-increasing optimization and performance output of the compilers, and the rate at which we\u2019re advancing our processors, I think we\u2019re raising the bar pretty high. Okay. So, with that, Colette?","Colette Kress","So, when you look at our overall segments, as you\u2019ve even seen our results in terms of this last Q2, there is growth across every single one of our platforms from a year-over-year standpoint. We probably possibly see that again in our Q3 guidance, the year-over-year growth across each and every one of those platforms. Of course, our OEM business will be down likely year-over-year, again just due to absence of those cryptocurrency in our forecast. When we think about sequentially, our hopes is absolutely our Datacenter will grow and will likely see the growth of our Gaming business as well. It\u2019s still early, still we\u2019ve got many different scenarios on our ProViz and Auto. But definitely our Gaming and our Datacenter are expected to grow sequentially.","Operator","Your next question is from Blayne Curtis with Barclays.","Blayne Curtis","Two on gross margin. Colette, I just want to make sure I understood July to October gross margins down. I know you\u2019ve been getting a benefit from crypto but it was pretty de minimis in July. So, is there any other than pieces? And then, kind of longer picture here, how do you think about the ramp of Turing affecting gross margins? You\u2019re obviously enabling a lot of capabilities to get paid for it, 12 nanometers, fairly stable. And just kind of curious how to think about over the couple of quarters gross margin with that ramp?","Colette Kress","Yes. So, let me take your first part of the question regarding our gross margins and what we have","seen from crypto. Although crypto revenue may not be large, it still has a derivative impact on our stack in terms of what we are selling and to both replenish the overall channel and such. So, over the last several quarters, that we had stabilizing that overall channel, we did get the great effect of selling just about everything and our margins really been able to benefit from that. Again, when we look at the overall growth year-over-year for Q2, you have 500 basis points in terms of growth. We\u2019re excited about what we have now here for Q3 as well, which is also significant growth year-over-year. Of course, we have our high value added platforms as we move forward, both -- those in Datacenter, those in terms of what we expect the effects of Turing in terms of on our Quadro piece as well. But that will take some time for that all to partake. So, we\u2019ll see how that goes. We haven\u2019t announced anything further at this time. But, yes, we\u2019ll see probably over the longer term, the effects of Turing can do.","Operator","Next question is from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.","Aaron Rakers","I\u2019m curious, as we look at the data center business, if you can help us understand the breakdown of demand between hyperscale, the supercomputing piece of the business, and the AI piece. And I guess on top of that, I\u2019m just curious, one of the metrics that\u2019s pretty remarkable over the last couple quarters is you\u2019ve seen significant growth in China. I\u2019m curious, if that\u2019s related to the Datacenter business or what\u2019s really driving that, as kind of a follow-up question. Thank you.","Jensen Huang","Yes, Aaron. I think, that if you look at the -- if you start from first principles, here\u2019s the simple way to look at it. Demand is continuing to grow at historical levels of 10x computing demand. Computing demand is increasing at historical levels of 10x every five years. 10x every five years is approximately Moore\u2019s Law. And computing demand continues to grow at 10x every five years. However, Moore\u2019s Law stopped. And so, that gap in the world in high-performance computing, in medical imaging, in life sciences computing, in artificial intelligence, that gap -- because those applications demand more computing capability, that gap can only be served in another way. And NVIDIA\u2019s videos GPU accelerated computing that we pioneered, really stands to benefit from that.","And so, at the highest level, whether it\u2019s supercomputing, and this year -- you heard Collette say earlier that NVIDIA GPUs represented 56% of all the new performance that came into the world\u2019s TOP500. The TOP500 is called the TOP500, because it reflects the future of computing. And my expectation is that more and more from one vertical industry after another, and I mentioned transportation, I mentioned healthcare, the vertical industries go on and on, that as computing demand continues at a factor of 10x every five years, developers are rational and logical to have jumped on NVIDIA\u2019s GPU computing to boost their demand. I think that\u2019s probably the best way to answer it.","Operator","Your next question is from Harlan Sur with J.P. Morgan.","Harlan Sur","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. When we think about cloud and hyperscale, we tend to think about the top guys right there, designing their own platforms, using your Tesla-based products or sometimes even designing their own chips for AI and deep learning. But, there\u2019s a larger base of medium to smaller cloud and hyperscale customers out there who don\u2019t have R&D scale. And I think that\u2019s where your HGX platform seems to be focused on. So, Jensen, can you just give us an update on the uptake of your first generation HGX-1 reference platform and the initial interest on HGX-2? Thanks.","Jensen Huang","HGX-1 was I guess kind of the prototype of HGX-2. HGX-2 is doing incredibly well, and for all the reasons that you mentioned. It is an even the largest hyperscale data centers can\u2019t afford to create these really complicated motherboards at the scale that we\u2019re talking about. And so, we created HGX-2, and it was immediately adopted by several most important hyperscalers in the world. And we were at GTC Taiwan, and we announced basically all of the leading server OEMs and ODMs supporting HGX-2 and are ready to take it to market. So, we\u2019re in the process of finishing HGX-2 and ramping into production. And so, I think HGX-2 is a huge success for exactly the reasons that you mentioned. We could use it for essentially a standard motherboard, like the ATX motherboard for PCs that could be used for hyper scalars, it could be used for HPC, it could be used for datacenters, and it\u2019s a really fantastic design. It just allows people to adopt this really complicated and high-performance and really high-speed interconnect motherboard in a really easy way.","Operator","Your next question is from Tim Arcuri with UBS. ","Tim Arcuri","Thank you. Actually, I had two questions, Jensen, both for you. First, now that Crypto has fallen off, I\u2019m curious what you think the potential is that maybe we see a slug of cards that get resold on eBay or some other channel and that could cannibalize new Pascal sales. Is that something that keeps you up at night? Number one. And number two, obviously, the stories about Gaming and Datacenter. And I know that you don\u2019t typically talk about customers. But, since Tesla did talk about you on their call, I\u2019m curious what your comments are about the development for Hardware 3 and their own efforts to move away from your DRIVE platform? Thank you.","Jensen Huang","Sure. Well, the Crypto mining market is very different today than it was three years ago. And even though, new cards -- at the current prices, it doesn\u2019t make much sense for new cards to be sold into the mining market. The existing capacity is still being used. And you can see the hash rates continue. And so, my sense is that the installed base of miners will continue to use their cards. And then, probably the more important factor though is that that we\u2019re in the process of announcing a brand new way of doing computer graphics. And with Turing and our RTX platform, computer graphics will never be the same. And so, I think there\u2019s -- our new generation of new GPUs is really going to great.","I also think that -- I appreciate Elon\u2019s comments about our Company, and I also think Tesla makes great cars, and I drive them very happily. And with respect to the next generation, it is the case that when we first started working on autonomous vehicles, they needed our help. And we used a three-year-old Pascal GPU for the current generation of autopilot computers. And it is very clear now that in order to have a safe autopilot system, we need a lot more computing horsepower. In order to have a safe computing -- in order to have safe driving, the algorithms have to be rich and has to be able to handle corner conditions in a lot of diverse situations. And every time that there\u2019s more and more corner conditions or more subtle things that you have to do or you have to drive more smoothly or be able to take turns more quickly, all of those -- all of those requirements require greater computing capability. And that\u2019s exactly the reason why we built Xavier. Xavier is in production now. We\u2019re seeing great success and customers are super excited about Xavier. And that\u2019s exactly the reason why we\u2019ve built it. And I think a super-hard to build a Xavier and all the software stack on top of it. And if it doesn\u2019t turn out for whatever reasons, it doesn\u2019t turn out for them, they can give me a call, and I\u2019d be more than happy to help.","Operator","And unfortunately we have run out of time. I will now turn the call back over to Jensen for any closing remarks.","Jensen Huang","We had a great quarter. Our core platforms exceeded expectations, even as crypto largely disappeared. Each of our platforms AI, Gaming, ProViz and self driving cars continued to enjoy great adoption. These markets are -- we are enabling are some of the most impactful to world -- to the world today. We launched Turing this week. It was 10 years in the making and completes the NVIDIA RTX platform. NVIDIA RTX with Turing is the greatest advance since CUDA, nearly a decade ago. I\u2019m incredibly proud of our Company for tackling this incredible challenge, reinventing the entire graphic stack, and giving the industry a surge of excitement as we reinvent computer graphics. Stay tuned as we unfold the exciting RTX story. See you guys next time.","Operator","Thank you for joining.

The webcast will be available for replay until the conference call to discuss our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2020. The content of today\u2019s call is NVIDIA\u2019s property. It can\u2019t be reproduced or transcribed without our prior written consent.","During this call, we may make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. These are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of factors that could affect our future financial results and business, please refer to the disclosure in today\u2019s earnings release, our most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q and the reports that we may file on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All our statements are made as of today, August 15, 2019, based on information currently available to us. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements. During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO commentary, which is posted on our website.","With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.","Colette Kress","Thanks, Simona. Q2 revenue was $2.58 billion, in line with our outlook, down 17% year-on-year and up 16% sequentially. Starting with our gaming business, revenue of $1.31 billion was down 27% year-on-year and up 24% sequentially. We are pleased with the strong sequential growth in the quarter when we launched our RTX SUPER lineup for desktop gamers, wrapped up our greatest ever number of gaming laptops and launched our new RTX studio laptops for creators.","In July, we unveiled 3 GeForce RTX SUPER GPUs, delivering the best-in-class gaming performance and power efficiency and real-time ray tracing for both current and next-generation games. These GPUs delivered a performance boost of up to 24% from our initial Turing GPUs launched a year earlier. The SUPER lineup strengthens our leadership in the high end of the market and the response has been great. We look forward to delighting gamers with the best performance in ray tracing as we get into the back to school and holiday shopping seasons. Ray tracing is taking the gaming industry by storm and have quickly come to define the modern era of computer graphics. A growing number of blockbuster AAA titles have announced support for NVIDIA RTX ray tracing, including Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, Cyberpunk 2077, Watch Dogs: Legion and Wolfenstein: Youngblood.","Excitement around these titles is tremendous. GameSpot called Cyberpunk one of the most anticipated games of the decade. NVIDIA GeForce RTX are the only graphic cards in the market with hardware support for ray tracing. They deliver a 2 to 3x performance speed up over GPUs without a dedicated ray tracing core. The laptop business continues to be a standout growth driver as OEMs are ramping a record 100-plus gaming laptop models ahead of the back to school and holiday season. The combination of our energy-efficient Turing architecture and Max-Q technology enables beautifully crafted thin and light form factors that can deliver the performance of high-end gaming desktop or our next-generation console.","At Computex in May, we unveiled NVIDIA RTX Studio laptops, a new design artist platform that extends our reach to the large, underserved market of creators. In the age of YouTube, creators and freelancers are rapidly growing population, but they have traditionally not had access to professional-grade workstations through online and retail channels. RTX Studio laptops are designed to meet their increasing complex workflows such as photorealistic ray tracing, AI image enhancement and ultra high-resolution video. Powered by our RTX GPUs and optimized software, RTX Studio laptops deliver performance that\u2019s up to 7x faster than that of the MacBook Pro. A total of 27 RTX Studio models have been announced by major OEMs. Sequential growth also benefited from the production ramp of the two new models of Nintendo Switch gaming console. We are expecting our console business to remain strong in Q3 before the seasonal production slowdown in Q4 when console-related revenue is expected to be fairly minimal, similar to last year.","Moving to data center, revenue was $655 million, down 14% year-on-year and up 3% sequentially. In the vertical industries portion of the business, expanding AI workload drove sequential and year-over-year growth. In hyperscale portion, we continue to be impacted by relatively weak overall spending at a handful of CSPs. Sales of NVIDIA GPUs for use in the cloud were solid. While sales of internal hyperscale use were muted, the engineering focus on AI is growing.","Let me give some color on each of these areas. We are building a broad base of customers across multiple industries as they adopt NVIDIA\u2019s platforms to harness the power of AI. Public sectors, higher education and financial services were among the key verticals driving growth this quarter. In addition, we won Lighthouse account deals in important industries that are on the cusp of being transformed by AI. For example, in retail, Wal-Mart is using NVIDIA GPUs to run some of its product demand forecasting models, slashing the time to do so in just 4 hours from several weeks on CPUs. By accelerating its data science workflow, Wal-Mart can improve its algorithms, reduce development cycles and test new features.","Earlier this week, we announced breakthroughs for the fastest training and inference of the state-of-the-art model for natural language process understanding called BERT, or Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, a breakthrough AI language model that achieves a deeper sense of language, context and meaning. This can enable mere human comprehension in real-time by chat box, intelligent personal assistants and search engines. We are working with Microsoft as an early adopter of these advances. AI computing leadership is a high priority for NVIDIA. Last month, we set records for training deep learning neural network models on the latest MLPerf benchmarks, particularly in the most demanding areas. In just 7 months, we have achieved up to 80% speed-ups enabled by new algorithms and software optimizations across the full stack while using the same hardware. This is a direct result of the productive programming environment and flexibility of CUDA.","Delivering AI at scale isn\u2019t just about silicon. It\u2019s about optimizing across the entire high-performance computing system. In fact, the NVIDIA AI platform is getting progressively faster. Every month, we publish new optimization and performance improvements to CUDA-X AI libraries, supporting every AI framework and development environment. All in, our ecosystem of developers is now 1.4 million strong. In setting these MLPerf records, we leveraged our new DGX SuperPOD AI supercomputer, demonstrating that leadership in AI research demands leadership in computing infrastructure. This system debuted in June at #22 on the TOP500 list of the world\u2019s fastest supercomputers at the annual International Supercomputing Conference. Used to meet the massive demand for autonomous vehicle development program, it is powered by more than 1,500 NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core GPUs linked with Mellanox interconnects. We have made DGX SuperPOD available commercially to customers, essentially providing them with the turnkey supercomputer that they can assemble in weeks rather than months. It is roughly 400x smaller in size than other similarly performing TOP500 systems, which are built from thousands of servers. Also at the conference, we announced that by next year\u2019s end, we will make available to the ARM ecosystem NVIDIA\u2019s full stack of AI and HPC software, which accelerates more than 600 HPC applications and all AI frameworks. With this announcement, NVIDIA will accelerate all major CPU architectures, including x86, POWER and ARM. Lastly, regarding our pending acquisition of Mellanox, we have received regulatory approval in the U.S. and are engaged with regulators in Europe and China. The approval process is progressing as expected, and we continue to work toward closing the deal by the end of this calendar year.","Moving to pro visualization, revenue reached $291 million, up 4% from our prior year and up 9% sequentially. Year-on-year and sequential growth was led by record revenue for mobile workstations with strong demand for new thin and light form factors. We had a great showing at SIGGRAPH, the computer graphics industry\u2019s biggest annual conference held in Los Angeles. Our researchers won several Best in Show awards. In just a year since the launch of RTX ray tracing, over 40 design and creative applications with RTX technology had been announced by leading software vendors, including Adobe, Autodesk and Dassault systems and many others. NVIDIA RTX technology has reinvigorated the computer graphics industry by enabling researchers and developers to take a leap in photorealistic rendering, augmented reality and virtual reality.","Finally, turning to automotive, Q2 revenue was $209 million, up 30% from a year ago and up 26% sequentially. This reflects growing adoption of next-generation AI cockpit solutions and autonomous vehicle development projects, including one particularly sizable development services transaction that was recognized in the quarter. In addition, in June, we announced a new partnership with the Volvo Group to develop AI and autonomous trucks utilizing NVIDIA\u2019s end-to-end AI platform for training, simulation and in-vehicle computing. The strategic partnership will enable Volvo Group to develop a wide range of autonomous driving solutions for freight transport, recycling collection, public transport, construction, mining, forestry and more. This collaboration is a great validation of our long-held position that every vehicle, not just cars but also trucks, shuttles, business, taxis and many others, will have autonomous capability 1 day. Autonomous features can bring enormous value to the trucking industry, in particular as the demand of online shopping put ever greater stress on the world\u2019s transport systems. Expectations for overnight or same-day deliveries create challenges that can only be met by autonomous trucks, which can operate 24 hours a day. To help address these needs, NVIDIA has created an end-to-end platform for autonomous vehicles from AI computing infrastructure to large-scale simulation to in-car computing. Multiple customers from OEMs like Mercedes-Benz, Toyota and Volvo to Tier 1s like Bosch, Continental and ZF are already onboard. We see this as a $30 billion addressable market by 2025.","Moving to the rest of the P&L, Q2 GAAP gross margins was 59.8% and non-GAAP was 60.1%, up sequentially, reflecting higher automotive development services, a favorable mix in gaming and lower component cost. GAAP operating expenses were $970 million, and non-GAAP operating expenses were $749 million, up 19% and 8% year-on-year, respectively. We remain on track for high single-digit OpEx growth in fiscal 2020 while continuing to invest in the key platforms driving our long-term growth, namely graphics, AI and self-driving cars. GAAP EPS was $0.90, down 49% from a year earlier. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.24, down 36% from a year ago.","With that, let me turn to the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2020. We expect revenue to be $2.9 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 62% and 62.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $980 million and $765 million, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP OI&E are both expected to be income of approximately $25 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 10%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $100 million to $120 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website.","In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We will be at the Jefferies conference, hardware and communications infrastructure summit, on August 27 and at the Citi Global Technology Conference on September 25. With that, we will now open the call for questions. Operator, would you please poll for the questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore.","C.J. Muse","Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the questions. I guess first question on gaming, how should we think about your outlook into the October quarter vis-\u00e0-vis kind of normal seasonality? How are you thinking about Switch within that? And considering now that you have full Turing lineup as well as content truly coming to the forefront here, how do you think about trends beyond the October quarter? Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Sure. Colette, why don\u2019t you take the Switch question? And then I will take the rest of the RTX questions.","Colette Kress","Sure. From a gaming perspective, the overall Switch or the overall console business definitely is a seasonal business. We usually expect to see production ramping in Q2 and in Q3, with it coming down likely in Q4. So you should see Switch to be a portion definitely of our gaming business in Q3.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yes. C.J., thanks for your question. RTX as you know is \u2013 first of all, RTX is doing great. I think we have put all the pieces in place to bring ray tracing into the future of games. The number of games, the blockbuster games that adopted RTX is really snowballing. We announced several 6 games in the last couple of months. There is going to be some exciting announcements next week at gamescom. It\u2019s pretty clear now the future of gaming will include ray tracing. The number of software developers that create \u2013 with creative tools that adopted RTX is really quite spectacular. We now have 40 \u2013 over 40 ISV tools that was announced at SIGGRAPH that have accelerated ray tracing and video editing. And some of the applications\u2019 amazing AI capabilities for image optimization enhancement support RTX.","And so looking forward, this is what I expect. I expect that ray tracing is going to drive a reinvigoration of gaming graphics. I expect that the over 100 laptops that we have RTX designed \u2013 RTX GPUs designed into is going to contribute our growth. Notebook gaming is one of the fastest-growing segments of the gaming platform world. The number of notebooks that are able to game is only a few percent, so it\u2019s extremely underexposed. And yet, we know that gamers are \u2013 like the rest of us, they like thin and light notebooks, but they like it to be able to run powerful games. And so this is an area that has grown significantly for us year-over-year, and we\u2019re expecting it to grow through the end of the \u2013 through the second half and through next year. And one of the things that\u2019s really exciting is our RTX Studio line that we introduced recently. We observed, and through our discussions with the PC industry, that the creatives are really underexposed and underserved by the latest technologies. And they want notebooks and they want PCs that have powerful graphics. They use it for 3D content creation and high-definition video editing and image optimization and things like that. And we introduced a brand-new line of computers that we call RTX Studio. Now the OEMs were so excited about it. And at SIGGRAPH, we now have 27 different laptops shipping and more coming. And so I think RTX is really geared for growth. We have great games coming. We got the SUPER line of GPUs. We have all of our notebooks that were designed into that we are ramping and of course, the new RTX Studio line. And so I expect this to be a growth market for us.","Christopher James","Very helpful. If I could follow-up on the data center side, perhaps you can speak directly just to the hyperscale side, both internal and cloud, and whether you\u2019re seeing any green shoots, any signs of life there and how you are thinking about what that rate of recovery could look like over time?","Jen-Hsun Huang","With the exception of a couple of hyperscalers, C.J., I would \u2013 we\u2019re seeing broad-based growth in data centers. In the area of training, the thing that\u2019s really exciting everybody, and everybody is racing towards, is training these large gigantic natural language understanding models, language models. The transformer model that was introduced by Google, called BERT, has since been enhanced into XLned and RoBERTa and, gosh, so many different, GP2, and Microsoft\u2019s MASS. And there are so many different versions of these language models. And in the AI, NLU, natural language understanding, is one of the most important areas that everybody\u2019s racing to go to. And so, these models are really, really large. It\u2019s over 1,000x larger than image models that we\u2019re training just a few years ago, and they\u2019re just gigantic models. It\u2019s one of the reasons why we built the DGX SuperPOD so that we could train these gigantic models in a reasonable amount of time. The second area \u2013 so that\u2019s training in the hyperscalers. The second area where we are seeing enormous amounts of activity has to do with trying to put these conversational AI models into services so that they could be interactive and in real time. Whereas photo tagging and photo enhancement is something that you could put off-line and you could do that while you have excess capacity when it\u2019s off of the most busy time of the day. You can\u2019t do that with language and conversational AI. You better to respond to the person in real time. And so the performance that\u2019s required is significant. But more importantly, the number of models necessary for conversational AI from speech recognition to language understanding to recommendation systems to text-to-speech to wave synthesis these 5, 6, 7 models have to be processed in real time \u2013 in series and in real time so that you can have a reasonable conversation with the AI agent. And so these type of activities is really driving interest and activity at all of the hyperscalers. My expectation is that this is going to continue to be a big growth opportunity for us. But more importantly, in addition to that, we\u2019re seeing that AI is \u2013 the wave of AI is going from the cloud to the enterprise to the edge and all the way out to the autonomous systems. The place where we\u2019re seeing a lot of excitement, and we talked about that in the past and we\u2019re seeing growth there, has to do with the vertical industry enterprises that are starting to adopt AI to create new products, whether it\u2019s a delivery robot or some kind of a Chat Bot or the ability to detect fraud in financial services, these applications in vertical industries are really spreading all over the place. There\u2019s some over 4,000 AI start-ups around the world. And the way that we engage them is they use our platform to start developing AI in the cloud. And as you know, we\u2019re the only AI platform that\u2019s available on-prem and in every single cloud. And so they can use our AI platforms for \u2013 in all the clouds, which is driving our cloud computing, external cloud computing growth. And then they can also use it on-prem if their usage really grows significantly. And that\u2019s one of the reasons why our Tesla for OEMs and DGX is growing. And so we\u2019re seeing broad-based excitement around AI as they use it for their products and new services. And these 4,000, 4,500 start-ups around the world is really driving consumption of that.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya","Alright thanks for taking my questions. I actually had 2 as well, one quick one for Colette and one for Jensen. Colette, good to see the gross margin recovery getting into October is this 62% to 63% range a more sustainable level and perhaps a level you could grow off of as sales get more normalized levels? And then a bigger question is for Jensen. Again, on the data center side, Jensen, when I look back between \u2013 2015 to 2018, your data center business essentially grew 10x. And then the last year has been a tough one with the slowdown in cloud CapEx and so forth. When do you think your data center starts to grow back on a year-to-year \u2013 on a year-on-year basis? Can that happen sometime \u2013 later this year? And then just longer term, what is the right way to think about this business? Does it go back to prior levels? Does it go at a different phase? This is the one part of the business that I think is toughest for us to model, so any color would be very helpful.","Colette Kress","Great, so let me start first with your question, Vivek, regarding gross margins. Yes, thanks for recognizing that we are moving towards our expectations that, over time, we\u2019ll continue to see our overall volumes improve. Essentially, our business is normalized. We\u2019ve reached normalized levels through the last couple of quarters. And this quarter, just very similar to what we will see going forward, is mix is the largest driver, what drives our overall gross margins and our gross margin improvements.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yes, Vivek, if you look at the last several years, there\u2019s no question our data center business has grown a lot. And my expectation is that it\u2019s going to grow a lot more, and let me explain to you why. Aside from a couple \u2013 a few of uncontrollable circumstances and the exception of a couple of large customers, the overall trend, the broad-based trend, of our data center business is upward, to the right. And it is growing very nicely. There\u2019s a couple of different dynamics that\u2019s causing that on first principles to grow. And of course, one of them is as AI is well known now to require accelerated computing, our computing architecture is really ideal for it. AI is not just one network. It\u2019s thousands of different types of networks, and these networks are getting more and more complex over time, the amount of data you have to process is enormous. And so like all software programs, you cannot predict exactly how the software is going to get programmed. And having a programmable architecture like CUDA and yet optimized for AI like Tensor Cores that we\u2019ve created is really the ideal architecture.","We know also that AI is the most powerful technology force of our time. The ability for machines to learn and write software by itself and write software that no humans can write is pretty extraordinary. And the applications of AI, as you guys are watching yourself, are just spreading in every single industry. And so the way we think about AI is in waves, if you will. The first wave of AI is developing the computer architecture, and that was the first part where \u2013 that\u2019s when a lot of people discovered who we are, and we emerged into the world of high-performance computing in AI. The second wave is applying the AI for cloud service providers or hyperscalers. They have a large amount of data. They have a lot of consumer applications. Many of them are not life-critical and so, therefore, the application of an early technology \u2013 early-adoption technology was really viable. And so you saw hyperscalers adopt AI. And the thing that\u2019s really exciting for us is beyond recommendations, beyond image enhancement, the area where we believe the most important application for AI is likely conversational AI. Most people talking and asking questions and talking to their mobile devices and looking for something or asking for directions instead of having a page of \u2013 a list of options, it responds with an answer that is very likely a good one. The next phase of AI is what we call vertical industry enterprise AI. And this is where companies are using it not just to accelerate the business process internally, but they\u2019re using AI to create new products and services. They could be new medical instruments to IoT-based medical instruments to monitor your health. It could be something related to an application that \u2013 used for financial services for forecasting or for fraud detection. It could be some kind of device that delivers pizza to you, delivery bots. And the combination of IoT and artificial intelligence, for the very first time, you actually have the software capabilities to make use of all of these sensors that you\u2019re putting all over the world. And that\u2019s the next phase of growth. And it affects companies from large industrials, transportation companies, retailers, you name it. Health care companies, you name it. And so that phase of growth of AI is the phase that we\u2019re about to enter into.","And then the longer term is an industry that we all know to be extremely large, but it takes time because it\u2019s life-critical, and it has to do with transportation. It\u2019s a $100 trillion industry. We know it\u2019s going to be automated. We know that everything that moves in the future will be autonomous or have autonomous capabilities. And that\u2019s just a matter of time before we realize its full potential. And so the net of it all is that I believe that AI is the single most powerful technology force of our time, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re all in on it. And we know that acceleration and accelerated computing is the perfect model for that. And it started in the cloud, but it\u2019s going to keep moving out into the edge and through data centers and enterprises and hopefully \u2013 well, eventually, all the way out into autonomous devices and machines in the real world. And so this is a big market, and I\u2019m super enthusiastic about it.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.","Toshiya Hari","Hi guys. Thanks very much for taking the questions. I had two as well, one for Jensen and the other for Colette. Jensen, you guys called out inference as a significant contributor to growth in data center last quarter. I think you guys talked about it being a double-digit percentage contributor, curious what you saw from inference in the quarter. And more importantly, if you can talk about the outlook, both near term and long term, as it relates to inference, that\u2019ll be helpful. And then secondly, for Colette, just want to double click on the gross margin question. The sequential improvement that you\u2019re guiding to is a pretty significant number. So I was just hoping if you can kind of break it down for us in terms of overall volume growth mix dynamics, both between segments and within segments and also to the extent DRAM pricing is impacting that, any color on that will be helpful as well. Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yes, Toshiya, I got to tell you, I\u2019m less good at normal pre \u2013 near-term productions than I am good at thinking about long-term dynamics. But let me talk to you about inference. Our inference business is \u2013 remains robust. It\u2019s double digits. It\u2019s a large part of our business. And \u2013 but more importantly, the two dynamics that I think are near term and that\u2019s going to drive growth, number one is interactive conversational AI, interactive conversational AI inference. If you simply ask a chat bot a simple question, where is the closest pizza and you would \u2013 pizza shop, and you would like to have a conversation with this bot, it would have to do speech recognition, it has to understand what it is that you asked about, it has to look it up in a recommender based on the locations you\u2019re at, maybe your preferences of styles of pizza and the price ranges that you\u2019re interested and how far you\u2019re willing to go, to go get it. It has to recommend a pizza shop for you to go to. It has to then translate that from text-to-speech and then into human \u2013 a human understand a voice. And those models have to happen in just a few \u2013 ideally, a few hundred milliseconds. Currently, it\u2019s not that. And it makes it really hard for these services to be deployed quite broadly and used for all kinds of different applications. And so that\u2019s the near-term opportunity, it\u2019s interactive conversational AI inference. And you could just imagine every single hyperscaler racing to go make this possible because recently, we had some important breakthroughs in machine learning language models. The BERT model that I mentioned earlier is really, really an important development, and it\u2019s caused a large number of derivatives that has improved upon it and so near-term conversational AI inference. But, we are also seeing near term the inference at the edge. There are many types of applications where because of the laws of physics reasons, the speed of light reasons or the economics reasons or data sovereignty reasons, it\u2019s not possible to stream the data to the cloud and have the inference done at the cloud. You have to do that at the edge. You need the latency to be low, the amount of data that you\u2019re streaming is continuous. And so you don\u2019t want to be paying for that line rate the whole time, and maybe the data is of great confidentiality or privacy. And so we\u2019re seeing a lot of excitement and a lot of development for edge AI. Smart retail, smart warehouses, smart factories, smart cities, smart airports, you just make a list of those kind of things, basically locations where there is a lot of activity, where safety or cost or large amount of materials is passing through, you could just imagine the applications. All of those really want to be edge computing systems and edge inference systems. And so those are near term \u2013 two near-term drivers, and I think it\u2019s fair to say that both of them are quite large opportunities.","Colette Kress","So to answer your question regarding gross margin in a little bit more detail, probably our largest area that we expect improvement in terms of our mix is our mix return regarding our overall gaming business. We expect to have a full quarter of our SUPER lineup within the next quarter including our RTX as well as our notebook becoming a bigger mix as well as it grows. These drivers are one of the largest reasons why we see that growth in our gross margin. We always think about our component cost, our overall cost of manufacturing, so this is always baked in over time, but we\u2019ll continue to see improvements on that as well.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Again on your data center business, many of your peers on the compute and storage side are seeing spending recovery by cloud and hyperscalers in the second half of this year after a similar weak first half of the year. You guys saw some growth in Q2 driven primarily by enterprise. It seems like you had some broadening out of the customer spending this quarter. Inferencing continues to see strong momentum. Would you guys expect that this translates into a double-digit percentage sequential growth in data center in Q3 off of the low base in Q2?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Our hyperscale data center with a few customers don\u2019t give us very much \u2013 we don\u2019t get very much visibility from a handful of customers in hyperscale. However, we\u2019re seeing broad-based growth and excitement in data centers. And the way to think about data center, our data center business consists of hyperscale training, internal training, hyperscale inference, cloud computing \u2013 and that\u2019s hyperscale, and that cloud is a public cloud. And then we have vertical industry enterprise, what sometimes we call enterprise, vertical industry enterprise, it could be transportation companies, retailers, telcos, vertical industry adoption of AI either to accelerate their business or to develop new products and services. And then the \u2013 so when you look at our data center from that perspective and these pieces, although we don\u2019t see as much \u2013 we don\u2019t get as much visibility as we like in a couple of the large customers, the rest of the hyperscalers, we\u2019re seeing broad-based growth. And so we\u2019re experiencing the enthusiasm and the energy that maybe the others are and so we will keep updating you guys as we go. We will see how it goes.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS.","Timothy Arcuri","Thanks a lot. I had two. I guess first for Jensen, Volta\u2019s been around now for about 2 years. Do you see signs of demand maybe building up ahead of the new set of nanometer products, whenever that comes out? I guess I\u2019m just wondering whether there\u2019s some element of this is more around product cadence that gets resolved as you do roll out the product. That\u2019s the first question. And then I guess, the second question, Colette, is of the $300 million growth into October, it sounds like Switch is pretty flat, but I\u2019m wondering if you can give us maybe some qualitative sense of where the growth is coming from, is it maybe like two-third gaming and one-third data centers, something like that? Thanks.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, Volta data center products can churn that fast. We gamers could churn products quickly because they\u2019re bought and sold one at a time. But data centers data center infrastructure really has to be planned properly, and the build-out takes time. And we expect Volta to be successful all the way through next year. And software still continues to be improved on it. We\u2019re still improving systems on it. And in fact, just 1 year in just 1 year, we improved our AI performance on Volta by almost 2x, 80%. And so, you could just imagine the amount of software that\u2019s built on top of Volta and all the Tensor Cores and all the GPUs connected with NVLink and the large number of nodes that are connected to build supercomputers. The software of building these systems, large-scale systems, is really, really hard. And that\u2019s one of the reasons why you hear people talk about chips, but they never show up because building the software is just an enormous undertaking. The number of software engineers we have in the company is in the thousands, and we have the benefit of having built on top of this architecture for over 1.5 decades. And so, when we\u2019re able to deploy into data centers as quickly as we do, I think we kind of lose sight of how hard it is to do that in the first place. The last time a new processor entered into a data center was an x86 Xeon, and you just don\u2019t bring processors in the data centers that frequently or that easily. And so, I think the way to think about Volta is that it\u2019s surely in its prime, and it\u2019s going to keep continue to do well all the way through next year.","Colette Kress","In regard to our guidance on revenue, and we do guide in terms of the total. You have seen, in this last quarter, we executed a sequential increase really focusing on moving to a normalization of our gaming business. And we\u2019re now approaching the second half of the year getting ready for the back to school and the holidays. So, you should expect also our gaming business to continue to grow to reach that full normalization by the end of Q3. We do expect the rest of our platforms to likely also grow. We have a couple different models on how that will come out. But yes, we do expect our data center business to grow, and then we\u2019ll see on the rest of our businesses as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen.","Matt Ramsay","Thank you very much. Good afternoon. A couple of questions. I guess the first one is Jensen, if you have any, I guess, high-level qualitative commentary on how the new SUPER upgrades of your Turing platform have been received in the market and how you might think about them progressing through the year. And then, I guess, the second question is a bigger one. Intel\u2019s talked quite openly about One API. The software stack at Xilinx is progressing with Versal ACAP. I mean you guys get a lot of credit for the decade of work that you\u2019ve done on CUDA. But I wonder if you might comment on if you\u2019ve seen any movement in the competitive landscape on the software side for the data center space. Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang","SUPER is off to a great start. Goodness, SUPER is off to a super start. And if you look at if you do channel checks all over, even though we\u2019ve got a lot of products in the channel and we last quarter was a transitional quarter for us actually. And we didn\u2019t we shipped SUPER later in the quarter. But because the entire ecosystem and all of our execution engines are so primed, we were able to ship a fair number through the channel. And so, and yet, if you do spot checks all around the world, they\u2019re sold out almost everywhere. And the pricing in the spot market is drifting higher than MSRP. That just tells you something about demand. And so that\u2019s really exciting. SUPER is off to a super start for and at this point, it\u2019s a foregone conclusion that we\u2019re going to buy a new graphics card, and it\u2019s going to the last 2, 3, 4 years to not have ray tracing is just crazy. Ray tracing content just keeps coming out. And between the performance of SUPER and the fact that it has ray tracing hardware, it\u2019s going to be super well positioned for throughout all of next year.","Your question about APIs and software programmability, APIs is just one of the issues. The large issue about processors is how do you program it. The reason why x86s and CPUs are so popular is because they solve the great challenge of software developers: how to program a computer and how to program a computer and how to compile for that computer is a paramount concern to computer science, and it\u2019s an area of tremendous research. Going from single CPU to multi-core CPUs was a great challenge. Going from multi-core CPUs to multi-node multi-core CPUs is an enormous challenge. And yet, when we created CUDA in our GPUs, we went from 1 CPU core or one processor core to a few to now, in the case of large-scale systems, millions of processor cores. And how do you program such a computer across multi-GPU, multi-node? It\u2019s a concept that\u2019s not easy to grasp. And so, I don\u2019t really know how one programming approach or a simple API is going to make 7 different type of weird things work together. And I can\u2019t make it fit in my head. But programming isn\u2019t as simple as a PowerPoint slide, I guess. And I think it\u2019s just time will tell whether one programming approach could fit 7 different types of processors when no time in history has it ever happened.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.","Joe Moore","Great. thank you. I wonder if you could talk about the strength in the automotive business. Looks like the services piece of that is getting to be bigger, what\u2019s the outlook for that part of the business? And can you give us a sense of the mix between services and components at this point?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Sure. Thanks, Joe. Our approach to autonomous vehicles comes in basically 2 parts. The first part is a full stack, which is building the architected processor, the system, the system software and all of the driving applications on top, including the deep neural nets. The second part of it, we call that a full stack self-driving car computer. The second part of DRIVE includes an end-to-end AV development system. For those who would like to use our processors, use our system software but create their own applications, we created a system that allows basically shares with them our computing infrastructure that we built for ourselves that allows them to do end-to-end development from deep learning development to the application of AV to simulating that application to doing regression testing of that application before they deploy it into a car. And the two systems that we use there is called DGX for training and Constellation for simulation and what is called Replay. And then the third part of our business model is development agreements, otherwise known as NRE. These 3 elements, full stack computer, end-to-end development flow and NRE project development product development consists of the overall DRIVE business. And so, although the cars will take several years to go into production, we\u2019re seeing a lot of interest in working with us to develop self-driving cars using our development systems and entering into development projects. And so, we\u2019re the number of autonomous vehicle projects is quite large around the world as you can imagine. And so, my sense is that we\u2019re going to continue to do well here. The additional part of autonomous vehicles and where the capability has been derived and is going to seal up more near-term opportunities has to do with things like delivery shuttles, self-driving shuttles and maybe cargo movers inside walled warehouses. Those kinds of autonomous machines require basically the same technology, but it\u2019s sooner and easier to deploy. And so, we are seeing a lot of excitement around that area.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.","Aaron Rakers","Yes, thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on the improved performance. At your Analyst Day back a couple of months ago, you had highlighted the installed base opportunity for RTX. And I think at that point in time, you talked about 50% being Pascal base, 48% being pre-Pascal. You also alluded to the fact that you were seeing a positive mix shift higher in terms of the price points of this RTX cycle. So, I\u2019m curious, where do we stand on the current product cycle? And what are you seeing currently as we go through this product cycle on the Turing platforms?","Jen-Hsun Huang","We launched well, first of all, the answer is that RTX adoption is faster than Pascal\u2019s adoption if you normalize to time 0 of launch. The reason for that is Pascal launched top to bottom on the same day. And as you guys know, we weren\u2019t able to do that for Turing. But if we did that for Turing, the adoption rate is actually faster. And to me, it\u2019s a rather sensible. And the reason for that is because Pascal was basically DX12. And Maxwell was DX12. And Turing is the world\u2019s first DXR, the first ray tracing GPU, brand-new functionality, brand-new API and a lot more performance. And so, I think it\u2019s sensible that Turing\u2019s adoption is going to be rapid. The second element of Turing is something that we\u2019ve never talked about before. We\u2019re mentioning it more and more because it\u2019s such an exciting book market for us is notebooks. The install base of Pascal has a very, very little notebook in it. And the reason for that is because, in the past, we were never able to put a high-performance gaming GPU into a thin and light notebook until we invented Max-Q. And in combination with our energy efficiency, we were able to we\u2019re now able to put a 2080 into a laptop, and it\u2019s still beautiful. And so, this is effectively a brand-new growth market for us. And with so few people and so few gamers in the world that are able to game on a laptop, I think this is going to be a nice growth market for us.","And then the new market that we introduced and launched this last quarter is called RTX Studio. And this is an underserved segment of the market where consumers, enthusiasts, they could be artists that are working on small firms, they need powerful computers to do their work. They need powerful computers to do rendering and high-definition video editing. And yet it\u2019s underserved by workstations because workstations are really sold on a B2B basis into large enterprises. And so, we aligned all of the OEMs and created a whole new line of notebooks called RTX Studio. And the enthusiasm has been great. We\u2019ve launched 27 different laptops, and I\u2019m looking forward to seeing the results of that. This is tens of millions of people who are creators. Some of them professionals, some of them hobbyists. And they use Adobe suites, they use Autodesk in their suites and some of them use SolidWorks and some of them use all kinds of renders, like blender. And these are 3D artists and video artists, and this digital content creation is the modern way of creativity. And so, this is an underserved market that we\u2019re excited to go serve with RTX Studio.","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.","Stacy Rasgon","Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two for Colette. My first question is on data center. So, I know you say that you have a broad-based growth except for a few hyperscalers. But you only grew at 3% sequentially, about $20 million. That doesn\u2019t sound like broad-based growth to me unless like did the hyperscalers get worse or are they just still so much bigger than like the rest of it? I guess, what\u2019s going on in data center? How do I wrap my head around like broad-based growth with relatively minimal growth observed?","Colette Kress","So, to answer your question here, Stacy, on what we refer to when we\u2019re discussing the broad-based growth is the substantial expansion that we have on the types of customers and the industries that we are now approaching. As you know, even a year ago, we had a very, very small base in terms of industry-based hyper excuse me, industry-based AI workloads that they were using. Over this last quarter, we\u2019re continuing to see strong growth as we roll out all different types of AI solutions, both across the U.S. and worldwide, to these overall customers. Our hyperscalers, again, a couple of them, not necessarily growing, some of them are flat and some of them are growing depending on whether or not that\u2019s for cloud instances or whether or not they\u2019re using it for internal use. So, we believe that our continued growth with the industries is important for us for the long term to expand the use of AI and we are just really pleased with what we are seeing in that growth this quarter.","Operator","I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Jensen for any closing remarks.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Thanks, everyone. We are happy with our results this quarter and our return to growth across our platforms. Gaming is doing great. It\u2019s great to see NVIDIA RTX reinvigorating the industry. GeForce has several growth drivers. Ray traced games continue to gain momentum. A large number of gaming laptops are rolling out, and our new Studio platform is reaching the large underserved community of creators. Outside a few hyperscalers, we\u2019re seeing broad-based growth in data centers. AI is the most powerful technology force of our time and a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. More and more enterprises are using AI to create new products and services while leveraging AI to drive ultra efficiency and speed in their business. And with hyperscalers racing to harness recent breakthroughs in conversational AI, we see growing engagements in training as well as interactive conversational inference. RTX, CUDA accelerated computing, AI, autonomous vehicles, the work we\u2019re doing is important, impactful and incredibly fun. We\u2019re just grateful there is so much of it. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect."],"16432":["NVIDIA Corp.

Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Arnab. Third quarter revenue was a record $1.305 billion, up 7% from a year earlier, up 13% sequentially and substantially above our outlook of $1.18 billion. Growth was driven by record revenue for gaming, particularly for our GTX platform and automotive infotainment systems.","From a reporting segment perspective, GPU revenue was $1.11 billion, up 12% from a year earlier. Tegra processor revenue was $129 million, down 23% from a year earlier. Our strategy remains focused on creating platforms for gaming, professional visualization, data center, and automotive. Our progress is the result of product innovation, our strong position in growing markets, and disciplined execution.","In Q3, our four market platforms contributed 85% of our revenue, up from 71% a year earlier. First, let's start with our gaming platform. Gaming revenue rose 44% year-on-year to $761 million. Growth is being fueled by a number of factors, among them, the significant increase in graphics production value, the rise of eSports, the anticipation of blockbuster games for the holiday season, and the emergence of new technologies like VR for richer, more immersive game play.","Professional gaming competitions or eSports are well on their way to becoming a global entertainment category with an audience of 188 million viewers. There were 30 million viewers alone for last month's League of Legends World Championship. The launch of great gaming titles drives gaming platform sales. We are excited by the strong pipeline of AAA games ready for the holiday season, including Star Wars Battlefront, Call of Duty, Black Ops III, Rainbow Six and Fallout Four. Meanwhile, we are looking-forward to the launch of virtual reality, with the approaching availability of VR headsets from Oculus, HTC, and others, as well as new VR games such as EVE: Valkyrie.","During the quarter we enabled a new category of high capable enthusiast class gaming notebooks with the launch of GTX 980. For the first time notebooks are able to deliver the same gaming experience as desktops and have the processing power to drive frame rates needed for VR.","Our long-term bet on Android gaming is SHIELD. During the quarter, we extended the reach of SHIELD Android TV, the market's most advanced 4K smart TV console in two key European markets. We launched GeForce NOW which provides Netflix-like service for streaming games from the cloud to your SHIELD device.","Moving to professional visualization. Quadro revenue increased 8% sequentially to $190 million, a decline of 8% year-over-year. At the SIGGRAPH Professional computer design conference, we introduced NVIDIA DesignWorks. This suite of algorithm libraries and tools enables developers to easily incorporate photo realistic visualization of product and building designs. And with DesignWorks VR, developers can easily provide the amazing experience for such areas as theme park design, product design, telepresence, and surgical training.","In data center, inclusive of Tesla and GRID, revenue rose 13% sequentially to $82 million, reflecting demand in deep learning, high-performance computing, and graphic virtualization. Revenue declined 8% year-on-year due to the lumpiness from large deep learning projects. Most of the world's leading web services companies have adopted Tesla for deep learning to power next-generation services. In addition to using our GPUs for training servers on massive data set, companies like Baidu are using them for inference for such work as real-time voice recognition. In high-performance computing we increasingly find that GPUs are moving from the domain of researchers to commercial use, in such areas as weather forecasting and seismic processing.","We continue to make progress as well with our GRID virtualization platform, which enables companies to deliver graphic-rich applications to employees on any device anywhere. At VMworld in San Francisco, we launched GRID 2.0, with twice the user density and application performance of its predecessor and support for both Linux and blade servers, a dozen fortune 100 companies are completing trials of GRID 2.0 and more than 125 OEM offered servers are qualified to run it.","Also reflecting momentum for NVIDIA data center offerings Microsoft Azure announced that it is integrated NVIDIA GRID into its rapidly growing cloud service in response to customer demand for GPU acceleration in the Cloud.","Finally, automotive revenue rose 51% year-on-year to a record $79 million. At last month's International Auto Show in Frankfurt, Mercedes Benz, Audi, Porsche, Bentley, and Honda all showcased a range of production vehicles and concept cars with NVIDIA-powered digital cockpits, and our partner, Tesla Motors just introduced its falcon-winged Model X. Like the Model S, the Model X is equipped with both a multi-touch infotainment system and a digital instrument cluster powered by NVIDIA.","Finally, we are continuing deeper collaborations with over 50 companies that are developing self-driving car technologies, using NVIDIA DRIVE PX. These include car manufacturers, Tier 1 OEMs, start-ups and research institutions. DRIVE PX is an advanced autonomous driving platform that fuses data from cameras, lidars, radar and ultrasonic sensors to determine the path forward using deep learning techniques. We look forward to sharing more details about this work at CES 2016. Our OEMs and IP business was $192 million, up 11% sequentially, driven by seasonal demand for notebooks.","Now, turning to the rest of the income statement. GAAP gross margin was 56.3%, non-GAAP gross margin was 56.5% in line with our outlook. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin increased from a year ago reflecting our strong gaming revenue. GAAP gross margin increased sequentially, as the previous quarter included a charge related to the NVIDIA SHIELD tablet recall. Non-GAAP gross margin was nearly flat sequentially.","GAAP operating expenses for the third quarter were $489 million, inclusive of $8 million of restructuring and other charges. Non-GAAP operating expenses including litigation charges were $430 million, slightly lower than our outlook. We continue to focus on operating efficiencies, and we manage investment growth while growing operating margins.","GAAP operating income for the third quarter was $245 million, up 15% from $213 million a year earlier, reflecting strong revenue growth. Non-GAAP operating income was $308 million, up 17% from $264 million a year earlier. GAAP net income was $246 million. GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.44, including $0.01 of restructuring and other charges, as well as a benefit of $0.09 from a tax reserve relief. Non-GAAP net income was $255 million. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.46, an increase of 18% year-over-year.","Now turning to some key balance sheet items. In Q3, our cash and marketable securities balance was $4.73 billion. During the third quarter, we paid $53 million in cash dividends and we closed our accelerated repurchasing agreement with an additional 4.6 million shares returned. As a result, we have returned to shareholders an aggregate of $604 million fiscal year-to-date of our full year intent to return $800 million.","As part of our ongoing commitment to deliver shareholder value, through capital return, we have announced an 18% increase to our quarterly cash dividend to $0.115 per share to be paid on December 14 to all shareholders of record on November 20. In addition, we are pleased to announce our intention in fiscal 2017 to return approximately $1 billion to shareholders through ongoing quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases.","Now turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. We remain excited about our business prospects. Gaming continues to accelerate, and eSports, VR, and a pipeline of exciting games will lift it further.","GPU accelerated data centers are expanding in both high performance computing and cloud, driven by the acceptance of deep learning techniques. And the transition to autonomous driving is well underway. We have excellent positions in each of these growth markets.","We expect revenue for the fourth quarter of 2016 to be $1.3 billion, plus or minus 2%. Our GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 56.7% and 57%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $503 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $445 million.","For fiscal 2016, we expect non-GAAP operating expenses excluding litigation costs to be approximately flat with fiscal 2015. Litigation costs are anticipated to be in the range of $70 million to $80 million as we defend our intellectual property.","GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 are both expected to be 20%, plus or minus 1%. The above GAAP outlook excludes restructuring charges which are expected to be in the range of $25 million to $35 million as we finalize the wind down of the Icera operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Further, financial details including the CFO commentary and revenue by market platforms are available on our IR website.","With that, we will now open the call for questions. Operator, will you please poll for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. One moment please for the first question which comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for the question, and congratulations on the great results. For my first question, the last two quarters you have substantially exceeded your original outlook and PC gaming has been an important part of that. And I'm wondering these trends that you're seeing or the upside surprise that you have seen in both these quarters, has that come more from units, has that come more from better mix or ASPs or share gains? And more importantly, how sustainable is this kind of upside trajectory?","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Vivek, first of all, thanks. Well, I think that we've been consistent that our PC gaming business is driven by several factors. The first factor is the great AAA titles that are coming out with ever increasingly graphics production value. The second is just the number of eSports players that are growing around the world. And it's a very social phenomenon. The more of your friends are joining eSports, the more you have to join eSports, so that you can hang out with your friends.","The third is the developing countries. One of the things about PC gaming and overall gaming is that you really need to have broadband access anymore so that you can download these amazing games. And so, as broadband adoption continues to grow in the developing countries, the PC is really the best way to get into gaming. It's a platform that you need for your daily lives anyways, and surely most young people need it for school. And so that's been helpful.","All of those factors have increased both the units as well as the ASPs that we're enjoying. If you look at the size of the overall market, I think it's probably fair to say that we're not fully penetrated. And our expectation is that as we look into next year, all of the great games that are coming out, whether it's Call of Duty that's coming out, or Star Wars that's coming out, or Assassin's Creed or Tomb Raider, surely everybody's quite excited about VR coming out in the beginning of next year. So I think there are several growth drivers that are still quite powerful and our expectation is that this is going to be a large market going forward.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks, Jen-Hsun. And for my follow-up question, not to quibble, but when I look at your Q4 guidance, it's strong, better than expectations, but it implies flattish trends in what is usually a seasonally stronger quarter. If you could just give us some color on what segments directionally do you think would be up or down versus Q3? Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, the guidance that we provide is the guidance that we think is best and balanced. And we'll see how the quarter plays out. But the growth drivers in our business overall, gaming is a growth driver, and we just mentioned some of the dynamics that are underlying it. Data centers is a growth driver for us and I'm sure we'll be talking more about that during the conference call. And then third, the automotive business is a growth driver for us. And so we have several growth drivers, but at this point, our guidance is the best we have to offer.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you, Jen-Hsun.","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. First question on virtual reality as a driver. It seems that you have fairly low expectations for 2016. When you see the Oculus VR demos, I really leave with the sense that they could transform business processes for many different industries and it seems like a lot of potential. So I'm just trying to reconcile that kind of reaction that I've noticed versus your it seems like lower key expectations for virtual reality as a driver. So if you could help reconcile that, that'd be great.","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, first of all, Mark, we are over the top excited about virtual reality. There's nobody at NVIDIA who is low key about it. There's no question that when you enjoy the Oculus headset with GeForce GTX 980 or GeForce GTX Titan the experience is unbelievable. And recently we even produced a whole family of notebooks that are able to enjoy VR directly from the notebook. And so we're super excited about VR. The sense of presence that you have in enjoying VR headsets whether it's from Oculus or Valve's Vive, it's really fantastic.","We also see that the application of VR is quite sweeping. Of course, we're quite enthusiastic about games and the games that we've seen are really amazing. But it's used for industrial design, architectural design, it's used for, whether it's medical imaging, even scientific computing. We're seeing entertainment, large-scale entertainment, large format entertainment. And so we're seeing all kinds of applications from places all over the world. We're tracking over 250 companies now that are working with us on VR and it ranges everywhere from video games to entertainment, to professional graphics, as I've mentioned.","Our approach is to provide a platform by which the entire VR industry can be built upon and so we call it our DesignWorks VR for our enterprise products, our professional products, and GameWorks VR for our consumer products. And by connecting to our APIs and connecting to our SDK, the performance and the experience is just phenomenal.","Now, maybe your question is much more related to financial. And I guess our approach there is to be enthusiastic about the work that we are doing, to support the entire industry as it moves into VR. We are engaged deeply with the industry in doing so. I think that we built the premier platform for VR for both PC gaming as well as professional graphics. As far as financial is concerned, realize that the shipment hasn't really started yet and I think it's prudent to wait and see. But my expectation long-term is that VR is going to be a very powerful growth driver for us. That is almost undeniable at this point based on everything that we've seen and all the effort that's going into it.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. That's very helpful color, Jen-Hsun. Thank you for that. Follow-up question, if I may. On the gaming software, the PC gaming software, there's a strong product cycle you've mentioned a number of times. Is there a risk that this is partially helping to drive gaming GPU sales now and then there's some kind of a let-up later on in, say, two or three quarters from now? How should we think about that? Is there a correlation between gaming software launches and lumpy shipments of gaming GPUs? Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","I guess in the end, it's hard to predict. There's only a few things that we do know. The first principles of what we know are that the gaming market overall is growing. The number of eSports players is continuing to grow. The number of countries, developing countries, that are now able to bring more people into gaming is growing as they continue to adopt broadband. The production value of the video games are just amazing. Boy, if you just look at Star Wars and Assassin's Creed and Call of Duty and Tomb Raider, I mean, they're almost cinematic. And so our expectation is that these factors combined is going to continue to drive the gaming market forward. And so we'll see from quarter-to-quarter how they do, but at the moment everywhere in the world, we're just seeing gaming to be quite vibrant.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, thanks a lot, Mark.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin with UBS. Please go ahead.","Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one, Jen-Hsun, if I could on the automotive market. First of all, at your last Analyst Day you guys mentioned an aggregate backlog number for an estimate on the rough value of the design wins over a number of years looking out. I was wondering if you could potentially provide us an update on how that number changed over the last several quarters.","And related to that, given the nice pipeline that you guys have building up, can you talk about what sense of urgency your customers are telling you guys in terms of how quickly they need to get Tegra into some of these systems, whether it's infotainment or ADAS-type products and what that translates to in terms of the revenues coming on for Tegra?","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, thanks a lot, Stephen. First of all, our automotive business is growing quite robustly and year-over-year it's grown over 50%. And our expectation is that it's going to continue to grow through next year and a couple years of after that.","Meanwhile, there are two very important dynamics that are happening in the car industry that is very favorable for us. One dynamic has to do with the central car computer. It is very clear now that your future car will be software-defined. That there will likely be multiple operating systems. These operating systems will control graphics-rich experiences, that this centralized computer will be built like a data center so that it can be secure, it can be robust, it can be mission-critical. And software is going to play just a huge role in it.","And so when the car becomes more and more computerized, more than just digital, more than just electronic, but it's computerized and that it's software-rich, it plays into our hands, because we're such a great software company. We know system software incredibly well and software capability is one of our major differentiating advantages. It's one of the reasons why we're able to do what we do.","The second dynamic is that whereas the first generation of driver assistance was made possible with radars and the second generation included cameras. The first generation of autonomous driving is about to come. Autonomous driving hasn't really made its way into the market yet. And we're seeing the early versions of that, but architectures that enable fully autonomous driving is yet to come.","And this is an area where we really have a great deal of capability. It's going to require sensor fusion, it's going to require an enormous amount of software, it's going to require artificial intelligence and it's going to require the ability to support an open computing platform that NVIDIA is built upon. If you look at our accelerated computing platform, it's programmed by so many people in the world and this is a real advantage because car companies need the ability to develop their own artificial intelligence network so that they can ultimately own their driving experience. And so this is something that I think the new era of autonomous cars and autonomous vehicles is a great opportunity for us. So those two dynamics are going to be fundamental to the future growth of our automotive business.","Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for that color, Jen-Hsun. And as my follow-up question, I was wondering if you could help parse out some of the drivers within the Tesla and GRID product families. Just between high-performance computing, cloud data center, and traditional corporate enterprise-type customers that are currently buying your Tesla and GRID products. Can you talk about the near medium term demand trends across the different verticals? Thanks.","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I appreciate that question. PC gaming, of course, is a powerful growth driver for us. Our automotive business is a growth driver for us. And I fully expect our data center business to be a growth driver for us. We've simplified our data center strategy over the course of last several quarters. Whereas we used to have multiple data center strategies, we now have basically one data center platform with multiple applications that drive it on top. The data center platform \u2013 accelerated data center platform is called Tesla. On top of it, we have multiple software stacks. The first software stack that we created was for high-performance computing for scientists to be able to do things like weather simulations and molecular dynamic simulations, and quantum chemistry simulations, to material simulations. And so, HPC, high-performance computing was our first stack.","We also talked about GRID. GRID is our enterprise virtualization stack. We have GeForce NOW, which is our cloud gaming stack. And one of the things that's super important in the future is the work that we're going to do in hyperscale data centers that allowed cloud data centers to do their work around artificial intelligence and to take the pressure off of the enormous amount of new traffic that is swamping and flooding data centers from users generating their own video.","Basically everybody's going to become a broadcaster. And there are PC gamers that are already broadcasting on a daily basis, and Twitch is the name by which we all know it by. But you're going to see YouTube Live. YouTube Live is doing incredibly well. And then, you're going to see applications like Meerkat and Periscope and there are more coming that basically lets almost everybody become a broadcaster. You're going to have billions of people broadcasting to billions of other people. And all of those videos today needs to be somehow processed. And our GPUs are really fantastic at that. And so, we have multiple applications, if you will, that sit on top of our data center platform.","Now, the dynamics that I've mentioned some, one, one of the most important dynamics around data centers is Moore's Law needs a boost. We know now that Moore's Law is under some amount of pressure and it's not growing as fast as the industry needs it to. So Moore's Law needs a boost and that's really what Tesla is about. Tesla is an accelerated computing platform that boosts the microprocessor. So that's one dynamic.","The second dynamic is what I mentioned, the global race to AI. The global race to AI, there's not one data center on the planet. There's not one cloud service on the planet. Frankly, there's not one application company on the planet that we know of, that's not trying to figure out how AI can completely revolutionize the applications that they provide. And then, of course, accelerating the cloud and making it possible for cloud to offer smart services and graphics-rich services, like the announcement that we recently did with Microsoft Azure. Azure now provides the NVIDIA GRID to power graphics accelerated applications as a service and we're super excited about that. So those dynamics are happening all in real-time and it's contributed to our sequential growth of 13%.","Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, Jen-Hsun and congrats on the strong results.","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thanks a lot, Stephen.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James.","Hans C. Mosesmann - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thank you. Congrats, guys. Hey, Jen-Hsun, can you give us a quick rundown on the competitive dynamic in the data center, particularly with GRID, if there is any kind of competition and the reason I bring it up is that the Intel Altera combo perhaps is a way to kind of fight what you guys are doing there? Thanks.","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Hans, first of all, thank you. Well, I think it's very clear at this point that boosting Moore's Law is an essential path forward that relying on CPUs alone for the entire workload of a data center is unrealistic and frankly unnecessary. There are no supercomputing centers that I know of that are not considering accelerated computing. And the reason for that is because just relying on traditional methods, unfortunately doesn't allow you to scale your data center in an efficient way anymore. There are no hyperscale data centers that I know of that aren't somehow overwhelmed and flooded by the user generated video content or the need to move to machine learning and artificial intelligence to provide smarter services.","And so, these dynamics are putting a lot of pressure on data centers and it's one of the reasons why there's so much talk about new approaches for improving the throughput of these data centers, whether it's supercomputing data centers or hyperscale data centers across the board. And I think that's an enormous opportunity for us. This is an area that we have invested almost 10 years in. And as you know, I have been talking about accelerated data centers now for, well, 10 years. And this is an area that we are seeing a lot of momentum and as other people pursue other ideas, I think it's just an acknowledgment that this is really a good path forward.","I think that in your question, you also specifically asked about FPGAs. FPGAs, we use FPGAs at NVIDIA. And we use FPGAs to do simulations and emulations of our products. FPGAs have been around a long time and they are perfect for certain applications. The challenge for \u2013 I guess the tradeoff is an FPGA is like it's designed. It's designed and configured on an array of transistors and gates, whereas a GPU is a full custom processor that is designed completely by hand. Whereas one FPGA is designed probably by a handful of engineers, a GPU is designed by thousands of engineers. And a GPU performing a task could be 100 times the frequency, 100 times the performance of that of a FPGA. It stands to reason that it's a result of handcraftsmanship and a processor that's designed to go very fast.","And FPGA, however, can do specific tasks quite well. If you only want to do one or two things, you can surely limit the functionality and make an FPGA quite efficient. However, our perspective is that a data center doesn't do one or two things. A data center runs thousands of applications. A data center has video, has imaging. It has voice. It does machine learning. The algorithms are changing every day. Today, the algorithms are convolution neural nets, tomorrow, it has memory, and after that, it's recursive. And so the type of neural nets just keep growing and the algorithms just keep on moving forward. And so, our belief is that the vast array of applications and the evolution of the algorithms really makes a processor much much easier to adopt and much faster to increase the overall throughput of your data center. And so, we will see how it plays out, but at the moment, we are enjoying a lot of enthusiasm around accelerated computing.","Hans C. Mosesmann - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for the run down.","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, thanks a lot, Hans.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks for taking my question. I'm just wondering on GeForce NOW, how is that revenue going to be recorded as you start getting subscribers and is that going to go under GRID or is that going to go under SHIELD, and can you talk a little bit more about what gross margins are expected for that?","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, it's not very much right now, so it's not much to talk about. But I think that the way to think about it is this, SHIELD and GeForce NOW is our long-term bet on the future of gaming. When we look out in the future, I think there are two dynamics that I think are unquestionable. One dynamic is that Android is going to become more important in an operating system. Don't forget gaming is about computer gaming. Gaming is made possible because it's built on top of a computer architecture and Android is the most popular operating system in the world. And so, it's undeniable that it will become a major force in gaming some day and SHIELD is our bet in that.","The second is that Cloud services application as a service and therefore video games as an application, as a service will eventually come. It took many years for Netflix to eventually become mainstream and my expectation is that it will take several years for GeForce NOW to become a popular all over the world. And so, those two dynamics, I think are largely unquestionable. The question is not so much if, the question is simply when.","And then, maybe the next question is who? Who is best equipped to be able to bring this future into the world and we feel that as the world leader in visual computing and as one of the major platform leaders in video games today, that this is an area that we can really make a great contribution. It's a modest investment for us and we are thoughtful about the level that we invest to make sure that it times with long-term the opportunity. Okay? But if we were to recognize the revenues just to put it back into the original question, if we were to recognize the revenues, it would go into gaming.","Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, great, and maybe if I could ask one other question about the split in the PC gaming business between notebook and I've seen a lot of reviews of the new gaming notebooks, it seems all top 10 are based on GeForce and between notebooks and your cards, what's the revenue split now?","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, the revenue split is largely still PC desktops. I appreciate you bringing up the notebook work that we did. Maxwell, the GPU architecture that we created and the craftsmanship of the GPUs we made are so incredible that it's finally possible for a notebook to be able to deliver the same level of performance as a desktop and our timing was timed so that people who want to enjoy VR with a notebook can finally do it. And so the latest generation of notebooks with GTX 980 are just amazing. I mean, they are so many times more powerful than a game console. It fits in a space smaller than a game console and it can drive VR. Everything you want to do, every game you want to play is possible on that thin laptop. And so the enthusiasm behind our launch with GTX 980 has been really, really fantastic. I appreciate you recognizing it.","Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Well, congratulations.","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thanks a lot.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Please go ahead.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Thank you. Two questions. One is back on the professional side, Jen-Hsun. If I look at Quadro and Tesla, what reverses the year-over-year decline that we have seen the last couple of quarters? As it relates to Tesla, is it just a matter of timing of when the HPC systems get launched? And the second follow-up was for Euclid on the IP side and expenses for IP. What is the -- it's not debatable that you guys have a very unique IP portfolio, but I'm wondering given the initial reversal you had on the lawsuit against Qualcomm and Samsung, why should the expenses be continuing to be higher on that front? Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Thanks for the questions, Ambrish. Let me take it in reverse order. So first on IP. It's not over. The administrative law judge has opined that of the three patents that he had to rule on, that two were not infringed and one was infringed, but he opined invalid. Of course, we disagree with that, and we have submitted our rebuttal. And now all of that has to go to the commission, which is ultimately where the ruling happens. The next phase is for the commission to decide whether they want to review, and we hope they do and it's not uncommon that they do. And then in February timeframe, the commission would determine their judgment, and it is not uncommon at all to have the commission disagree with the administrative law judge. And so I think it's far from over and, therefore, I guess, it's not over.","But I think that the higher level point is this. The higher level point is that our IP is very important to us. That invention as the world leader in our field is fundamental and core to our future. We have to invent the future. We are the world leader, after all. And from time to time, we may decide that as a one-off and strategically decide that we would defend our IP. And this is what we have done in this case. But it's not our business model. We don't litigate for our business model. We don't depend on licensing for our business model. And I hope that all of you on the call today don't invest in our company as a result of IP royalties. What I hope that you see is that we are quite a unique company, and we are a world leader in the space that we endeavor, that visual computing is more important than ever and applies to more industries than ever. And that our business model is really about selling products into vertical markets that are really exciting and quite vibrant and growing. And so I hope that you decide to invest on the basis of the products, the business model, and our special position in the marketplace.","On the two questions related to Tesla and Quadro, as you know, Quadro is about design and it's about workstations, it's about manufacturing, it's about things that people make. And we are a very, very, very significant leader in this market. We make a great deal of contributions to this market, but it's also a mature market. And so the way that \u2013 our strategy for growing Quadro is very, very simple. We have to reinvent it, and we have to reinvent it by bringing new capabilities to it, and we have two that we're quite excited about.","One is a new technology called Iray, and Iray is a brand new way of generating images that is photorealistic and physically accurate. It's almost like inventing the font of desktop publishing. What you see is what you will get. And it's just really quite amazing. And so I think Iray is going to rejuvenate the way that people do computer graphics and I hope that it will increase the size of the market, make it easier for people to design products and it will increase our ASPs quite significantly.","Number two, VR. We have already mentioned before that from design to architectural design to medical imaging to scientific computing to large-scale entertainment, we're seeing that VR is going to be very important. So those two we hope will drive the future growth of Quadro and get it back on a growth track.","As for Tesla, we grew 13% quarter-over-quarter. We declined year-over-year. Frankly, it didn't meet my expectation either. However, the fundamental dynamics, the reasons don't really matter here or there, but the fundamental dynamics are incredibly sound. And the groundswell around the fundamental dynamics is unquestionable. Moore's Law needs a boost. AI, every company on the planet is racing towards the future of AI and cloud computing needs to be accelerated with graphics as Microsoft Azure has demonstrated. And so my expectation is that we'll grow sequentially again and that the fundamental dynamics around Tesla is just really, really positive.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks for all the details, Jen-Hsun. Good luck.","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thanks, Ambrish.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Deepon Nag. Please go ahead.","Deepon Nag - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Yeah. Thanks a lot for taking my question. On virtual reality, so the recommended specs from Oculus are something like a GTX 970, but I think a lot of third parties and I think even you guys have mentioned that it actually requires much more in order to get a pretty reasonable experience. So can you help us understand what we should be expecting in terms of the average set-up for what's called an early adopter of Oculus? Should we expect two GTX 970s, should we expect a GTX 980, a Titan? Anything would be helpful there.","And then also if you could walk us through the economic fall through for NVIDIA in terms of what kind of revenues you would expect to see or ASPs NVIDIA would recognize for, let's say, a $300 card and what kind of gross profit dollar fall through we could see from that as well? Thanks a lot.","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, appreciate that. So I would say that the GTX 970 is the minimum requirement. It is the minimum requirement. And I think Oculus has done a good job setting the minimum requirement. And I think the minimum requirement simply means that anything below it is not going to be a great experience. We're seeing more and more content coming and usually the content gets richer. Content doesn't usually move backwards. And so the production value is going to continue to grow. If you buy into a GTX 970, it will give you a limited amount of growth over time, but if you buy into a GTX 980 or GTX Titan, you just have a lot more opportunities to continue to enjoy that platform for a longer period of time as content gets richer.","And so in terms of the economics, our gross margins are higher on GTX 970 and above, it's higher than our corporate average. And so we appreciate the adoption and the growth in that segment of the marketplace. But ultimately our focus is to help enable the entire ecosystem of hundreds of companies who are working on VR to be able to deliver this experience to the marketplace that fulfills the promise of VR. We're just intensely concerned that if we don't do a great job that we ruin a great thing. This is really, really a great thing.","And the folks at Oculus and the folks at Valve, the folks at HTC, ourselves and the 230 companies that are out there working on VR, we all want to deliver just a fantastic experience. And that's our focus at the moment. And our recommendation, if anybody were to walk up to me and ask me for a recommendation, I would tell them that a GTX 980 Ti would be the baseline and, in my own case, I'll probably have a pair of Titans, which, who doesn't need a pair of Titans?","Deepon Nag - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Well, that would be really nice for all of us. So then on that same theme, if I think about the competitive dynamics into next year, so you I think pretty obviously have taken a significant leadership advantage, especially at that enthusiast portion versus AMD. As we go into VR, when you talk to the game developer community, what kinds of things are you doing in order to maintain that advantage? And what kinds of things could we see in Pascal that could actually allow you to extend that advantage?","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, sure. Well, first of all, we respect our competitors. We take our competition seriously. You know that as a company we compete pretty intensely. And this is a company that has seen a lot of competition over the years and so we take competition seriously, we respect the capabilities of our competition. However, I think it's also very, very clear that our business and our business model and our strategy is completely different than AMD and the PC graphics chip company we used to be a long time ago. And our company is just on a different trajectory.","Our approach to building products is different. Our approach at go-to-market is different. Our approach in engaging the ecosystem is different. I can't imagine a more different company to tell you the truth. And so as much as we are always alert and paranoid about \u2013 and we don't take our position for granted and we are thoughtful about competition, we have our own work to do and we have our own platform to do and we have our own ecosystem to go and care for and nurture and push forward. And so I think that I appreciate the question, but I can't imagine a more different company, to tell you the truth.","Deepon Nag - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Jee-Hoon Park - Deutsche Securities Korea Co.","Thank you. Congrats on the solid quarter. This is Jee for Ross Seymore. Just going back to the guidance, given that there's a slate of AAA-rated games coming out this quarter, I guess what's the reason behind the conservatism behind the expectations for gaming, or is that growth expected to be offset by other segments?","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, our guidance is the best guidance we think we should provide at this moment and we'll see how the market plays out. We're not in control of the market, as you know. But I think at the foundational level, we have multiple growth drivers. And some of them on some day exceeds our expectations and some of them don't exceed our expectation. But that's one of the benefits of our business model today. That's one of the benefits of our strategy today.","We have multiple growth drivers in the company. PC gaming is a growth driver. Artificial intelligence is a growth driver. VR is a growth driver. Autonomous cars is a growth driver. And I really don't know of that many companies in the world that is working on these important dynamics in the industry that's going to shape the future of computing all together.","So we have multiple growth drivers in our company. And I believe that those drivers are fundamentally sound and powerful. However, we'll see how they turn out at the end of the quarter and I remain optimistic. And so we're enthusiastic about the guidance we provided and are optimistic that we'll do a good job on it. And then we'll just have to see how it turns out.","Jee-Hoon Park - Deutsche Securities Korea Co.","Thank you. And for my follow-up. It looks like some of the revenue segmentations for the end markets was changed a little bit this quarter with the new classification of Quadro and data center or pro-visualization and data center versus enterprise and HPC cloud. What was behind the change? And is it related to the unifying of the data center strategy?","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yes, that's right. That's exactly right. The reason we decided to classify it a little differently is because I changed the architecture of it. We used to have several different product lines and each one of the product lines were planned differently and they were specified differently and so on and so forth. We've decided to unify all of our data center product lines and abstracted out the software from it. And so from this one unified platform, Tesla, Tesla is our accelerated computing platform. And on top of it are software stacks that allows us to solve a problem for a particular marketplace.","So, for example, we have our entire software stack for HPC. We have a rich software stack for enterprise virtualization, we call Grid. We have a software stack that is incredible for providing cloud gaming around the world, that's called GeForce NOW and then we are going to have a software stack for hyperscale. And so each one of these software stacks are built on top of one common architecture, one common platform called Tesla Accelerated Computing. And so as a result, we decided to unify all of that and report it simply as data centers. And, quite frankly, I think it will just be easier to understand.","Jee-Hoon Park - Deutsche Securities Korea Co.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you for taking my question. And solid job on the quarterly execution. On the strong growth in the gaming segment; blockbuster games, eSports, big drivers, but there appears to be another potential driver and that is the shift from console to PC gaming here in the U.S. I think Jen-Hsun, you've always characterized the U.S. as a console-centric market, but this seems to be changing pretty rapidly with high schoolers and some of the older demographics here in the U.S. I don't know what the stats are, but thus far I think it's been a pretty big untapped market. So how much of this penetration is contributing to the growth in your gaming business?","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, Harlan, first of all, thank you. I think that there is no question that the U.S. \u2013 even the U.S. is seeing growth in PC gaming and the fundamental reason is really quite singular, eSports. eSports is it may be the new social platform. It is the new digital playground. You go hang out with your friends. It's the new virtual arcade. This is how you hang out with your friends. Not only do you play \u2013 if you're not playing, you are watching, but at all times you are talking to your friends. This is how you hang out. And so this is a big deal. This isn't something you can do easily on mobile. This isn't something you can do easily on TV. This particular platform really benefits from having a PC. And so eSports is probably, if I had to tag it on one thing, eSports would probably be it.","The growth of eSports, as you know, not only is the gamers enjoying eSports and growing faster than anybody would have expected, and I think the reason for that is because it's a social platform, and therefore, it grows not linearly but arguably exponentially. And in the case of eSports, there's also viewerships, and now all kinds of businesses are cropping up to help people enjoy watching eSports and sharing the moment with other people. So I think this is real. And it's quite exciting.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Joe L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. And congratulations, again. In terms of the buyback for next year, can you talk about your domestic cash position and would you need to do anything synthetic to achieve that buyback?","Colette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, thanks, Joe, for the question. We have an outlook for our capital return program next year to return $1 billion as well as the increase in the dividend that will be in effect there. We continue to look at our overall total cash balance and also our U.S. cash balance. We still receive cash flow from both the combination of our international operations and our U.S. operations, which will take us through the good part of fiscal year 2017 in probably the whole amount. But if some need comes, we have several options for us to think about how we would fund that and we'll look at that at that time, if necessary.","Joe L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. And then I was under the impression from our conversations during the quarter that there was a 14-week quarter in January. Is that the case? And if so, does that have any impact on the financials?","Colette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. This fiscal year, we do have an extra week in this fiscal year. So we have incorporated our best estimates at this time for the fourth quarter incorporating that extra week.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Alex Gauna with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.","Alex D. Gauna - JMP Securities LLC","A powerful quarter, congratulations, everyone. Jen-Hsun, I know you touched upon the challenges in the data center for Moore's Law and that driving opportunity for you. But what are your own big picture thoughts on the implications of Moore's Law for your core GPU business? And then associated with that, if I think about the increasing challenges of Moore's Law as well as the power of some of the big OEMs, and it can be either on the hardware, or on the cloud side, and many of them are both, how does that not mean you need to have some sort of licensing business or strategic partnership business in order to move your technology forward? Thanks.","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Alex, first of all, thanks for the question. Well, semiconductors and chips is really important to us. And on balance, it's a lot easier if the world will just get better without anybody having to work for it, i.e., Moore's Law. And so if every year transistors just got faster and they got morbid and they got cheaper and so on and so forth, all at the same time, it surely would make for a easier ride.","However, accelerated computing is a very different beast. The way that accelerated computing works and some people have characterized NVIDIA's growth and performance to Moore's Law squared and I don't think it's much far off from that actually. And the reason for that has to do with the fact that we change our -- we can innovate change, improve our GPU underneath, the software stack on top, the algorithms that we innovate on top of that, and then also targeting specific applications.","One of the things that most people don't realize is that we are not a general purpose processor. We only target a few specific applications. And the specific applications as you know that we focus on is visual computing and this particular field has become quite large. And because of the work that we have done, whether it's visual computing, images, video, and very parallel applications, which artificial intelligence falls into, these applications are just right down the strike zone and right in the bull's-eye of accelerated computing.","They just have \u2013 maybe it happened by serendipity, but we hope that we have a large part to do with it that the accelerator that we created made it possible for these applications to move forward. And as a result, moved forward more quickly and became large markets. And so, I would say that the answer to your question is that we don't just do chips and the value proposition of our platform is really about chips, about software, about algorithms and applications that we select. And that combination is really, really powerful.","Now your second question has to do with IP licensing. I would say that five years ago as a technology component company, a PC graphics chip company, where our path to market is only through OEMs, our path to market is only through OEMs that our industry, where our products are industry standard with, i.e., Wintel or PC, or so on and so forth. That's no longer true. We now have four vertical markets by which we engage to market ourselves that we can go directly to the market, we can innovate openly and we have specialized platforms whereby we can innovate without dependency on somebody else.","And so whether it's accelerated data centers, which has a specialized platform, gaming, where we go to market ourselves and we have a specialized platform there, these markets are really, really large. And so, the reinvention of our company put us in very large markets that are growing quite robustly. And so I think our primary focus today is through product sales. And so, we changed our business model that way, if you will, instead of remaining a components company and moving, if you will, backwards into licensing. We decided to move forward into the market vertically and creating specialized platforms.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Sanjay Chaurasia with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Sanjay Chaurasia - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Hi Jen-Hsun, one question on the gaming notebooks. You indicated that now you have the same desktop graphics and notebooks. And my question to that is with the VR coming in and notebooks, graphics getting more powerful, do you see that it could shift from desktops to notebook, your product mix, and if so do you think that that mix is less favorable or similarly favorable to you versus desktop graphics?","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","I guess I would say, I don't care. I would say that I don't care and the reason for that is these desktop -- these notebook GPUs are really high end. And they are all GeForce platforms to us. They all go to the same gamers and so I think the most important thing is that we would like the games to have higher graphics production value, the AAA games. I would like eSports to continue to grow. I would like developing countries to have broadband. And I would like VR to be incredible. And so I would say that those are really the drivers for our business, and however a gamer would like to enjoy GeForce, we would love to welcome him.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsey with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.","Matthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Yes. Thank you very much. Jen-Hsun, you had mentioned I think earlier in the call in response to a question that obviously you guys are not fully penetrated in gaming with the eSports phenomenon and more broadband coming to emerging markets. Maybe you could help us understand and break down the growth between unit growth or overall installed base growth versus upgrade sales from the current install base? And I guess what I'm trying to get at is the segment, the growth between that and what's the upgrade cycle you see when someone say they bought a high-end GPU from you a year ago, what's the upgrade cycle in links and what are the real drivers to that upgrade cycle to someone that is already engaged with you and in your install base? Thanks.","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yes. So, of course, one of the most important drivers is the combination \u2013 it's the combination of really, really high production value games and our install base, because our install base are already gamers, our installed base are already GeForce customers and when new games come out, new amazing games come out, the install base wants to upgrade their GPUs to support it.","And so if you look at our install base and just take a look at our, if you will, first base -- the mainstream GTX, let's pick the GTX 950. GTX 950 class install base represents probably less than a quarter of our install base. Another way of thinking about it is that three quarters of our install base really needs to get upgraded so that they can enjoy today's exciting AAA titles. And so, the install base alone is a really exciting opportunity for our growth and that's only possible because of the amazing AAA titles. It's the Star Wars of the world, the Call of Duty's of the world, the Assassin's Creed and the Batman's that really causes our install base, inspires our install base to upgrade to new GPUs. And so that alone has really great growth opportunity.","Not to mention the other factors that you started with which was eSports and developing countries having broadband and then, of course, what we hoped to be a big driver in the coming year with VR. And so the install base I think is a big growth driver for us. Okay?","Operator","Please note that at this time we are taking one question at a time. The next question comes from the line of Rajvindra Gill with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.","Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC","Yeah, thank you, and congratulations on good results. And a lot of this has been talked about before, but just wanted to get a sense of kind of the normalized revenue growth rate, at least as much as you can discuss with some of the headwinds that you experienced this year, potentially abating next year, mainly the PC OEM business, it might not decline this fast or at the same rate as it did this year. So I was wondering if you could maybe discuss little bit about the more of a normalized growth rate. It seems like this year you are going to end up about 5% growth rate given the fact that PCs have fallen pretty significantly. So any color there would be helpful?","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I appreciate it. I think, first of all, the recognition that our PC OEM or our OEM business has largely, the decline has abated. We obviously still work on OEM projects and we're selective about the OEM projects. We're thoughtful about the projects we work on. And we care very much about working with our strategic partners. For example, some of the really amazing projects that have been announced recently, the Microsoft Surface Book. I mean, holy cow! What a great laptop. Mine should be arriving any day now. And so, I'm super excited about that. I thought Panos and the guys over at Microsoft just did a killer job on that laptop. And it was incredibly challenging, and we love to work and we love building groundbreaking work.","And in the other project, over at Google, with Google Pixel C, I thought it was amazing. I mean, it's just a fantastic laptop. And it's based on our latest generation Tegra. Hiroshi and the team did a great job building it, and what a fantastic new tablet model. And so, we're going to continue to work on these type of OEM projects. And so we have exciting ones that we're in the process of working on. And so, my expectation is that the PC OEM business and the Tegra OEM business is going to be here. But it's just not a huge focus of ours \u2013 focus is not the right word, it's not where we expect our growth drivers to come from. Our major growth drivers are the four that we've talked about several times during the call.","In terms of growth rate, I think it's going to take potentially a couple years for us to have some kind a feeling for growth rate. Let me tell you why. In no time in the history of our company did we have a brand new business model, first of all. We have a brand new business model. This new business model leverages one architecture, but instead of going towards just serving OEMs, we largely engage the vertical markets ourselves. It's a platform strategy, it's an ecosystem strategy. We engage the markets directly ourselves. So this new business model transition and the approach to this market is really working and accelerating.","Now, because we're engaging the markets directly and we're looking at some very large markets, the autonomous driving market is going to be a large market. The accelerated data center market, it's going to be a large market. AI is going to be large, VR is going to be large. PC gaming is going to be large. And so we're now engaging large markets and we have multiple growth drivers. And so I think that the TAM for the company is larger than any time that we've ever enjoyed. And so that's kind of the second thing. We have multiple growth drivers and they have large TAMs.","And then finally, gosh, we're just doing really exciting and important work that will shape the future of computing. I don't know any time in the history of our company that we're working on things like AI and VR and self-driving cars and cloud computing all at the same time. And so all of that leveraging one fundamental architecture, which gave us the ability to simultaneously engage these vertical markets with a very powerful singular investment behind it. And so I think our business model is very different. The vertical markets we engage are very different and I hope that, as a result, our growth will continue to surprise.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you very much. In your gaming GPUs, do you have any estimate of what market share you currently control and how that's been changing over the last few quarters?","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, David, thanks for the question. We don't really control anything. Our products are purchased by our gamers freely and so it's not really a matter of control. And I mean that in a way that, look, we've got to earn the love and loyalty of our customers every single day. And whereas we used to be a PC OEM company, an OEM company where that responsibility lies on our OEMs, today that responsibility really lies with us and we take it really, really seriously. We have 70 million gamers that are connected with us. I hope that we add value to them on a continuous basis and that we earn their trust and their loyalty over time.","The beauty of this model, of course, it's much, much harder. It requires much, much greater understanding of the software stack. The way that you digitally connect and engage your community has to be very different than before. Obviously the PC OEM model is simple. The selling motion is simple. The marketing motion is simple. Everything we do today, the selling motion is much more complicated and the marketing motion is much more complicated.","But the end result is that the promise that we made to them, whether it's Quadro's ability to help you realize your imagination, to GeForce that helps you enjoy your game to the fullest, these promises we have the ability to deliver on a day-to-day basis. And so over time I believe it allows us to create much deeper connections with our customers, which in business talk is stickiness, but we don't think of it that way. We think of it as earning the loyalty and the trust and hopefully the passion of our customers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ian Ing with MKM Partners. Please go ahead.","Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC","Yes, thanks. A question for Colette here. Lots of interesting opportunities and investments here. Could you update us in terms of where we are in terms of identifying and implementing the operating synergies? I think at the Analyst Day you talked about some software synergies unifying the silicon architecture. Thanks.","Colette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks for the question. Yeah, I think our focus over this last several years has really been focusing around one single unified architecture and investment. That's really helped us to make the appropriate investments that we need in these four different markets that we're going after, but allowing us also to really focus on a single architecture that allows the efficiencies that we're seeing in our operating expenses.","That is still going to be our focus as we move into the current quarter Q4 and as we move forward into fiscal year 2017, as our financial performance is very important to us and improving that financial performance in the short term. So thanks for the recognition of noting our work on our investment portfolio and ensuring that our investments are right-sized for our top line.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Chris Roland with FBR & Company. Please go ahead.","Christopher Rolland - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Hey, guys. Let me echo my congrats on a really strong quarter here. So the current leader in ADAS, autonomous driving I guess is where they are going with this, they're running their platform off of what's essentially like a $5 microcontroller and they really talk down the importance of hardware. So, Jen-Hsun, maybe if I could get your idea on what you think this hardware platform \u2013 I know the importance of software, but what this hardware platform might look like for these future generations that you're talking about.","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Chris, I appreciate that. If we can get a $5 microcontroller to drive and it's just a matter of software and driving is like one of the most complicated things we do, I think humans could be replaced in just about everything we do with a $3 microcontroller. And so it seems unlikely.","I agree that smart microcontrollers could be used to enhance smart cameras to do computer vision and I think that for ADAS it is really, really good, just to be serious here. I think that smart cameras, whether it's from Tier 1s or from companies in Japan various companies around the world, the ADAS driver \u2013 better cruise control to automatic braking to lane keeping, those things are all important things and it improves our driver experience.","But autonomous driving is just a whole different thing. Autonomous driving nobody's figured out.","And obviously, there are several companies that we know who have real cars on the market who are doing autonomous driving and there's no pretense. Nobody is saying that all it takes is a $5 microcontroller to make that happen. It takes a lot of computing to make that possible. And so our strategy is not driver assistance. I mean, I've been consistent about that. I appreciate all of the people's work that are enhancing driver assistance, whether it's radar or ultrasonics or cameras to move driver assistance forward. Our strategy is really a computing platform for autonomous driving. And it's going to take a lot of software, and it's going to take a lot of software that is going to be owned by the car companies themselves.","And our strategy is to provide a platform by which we provide a lot of the capabilities of artificial intelligence whereby they can embrace it, modify it, enhance it, so that they can make their personality of the driver experience in their own software long term. I just can't imagine how every single car company in the world will have exactly the same driver experience. The way that the car responds to you, the way that the car responds at all is something that I believe long term is going to require a lot of computing. This is an area that's just far from being done and I think it's very complicated stuff and we don't even know what we don't know yet.","But the one thing that we do know, it's going to need a lot of computing horsepower, it's going to need a lot of software. Artificial intelligence is going to be at the core of it. And I think if we succeed in doing so, we're going to make the world a much, much better place. There are a lot of people that shouldn't drive. There are a lot of people that would love to get around, but they can't drive and I think we're going to keep a lot of people out of harm's way, so I think the work is incredibly important. It's far from being over and so there's lots to do.","Operator","The last question comes from the line of Joseph Zaccaria with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Joseph W. Zaccaria - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the quarter. I just wanted to circle back on the automotive part of the business. I know you have done a lot of work with the VW Group, specifically with Audi and Porsche. I was wondering if you have seen any of the impact from the potential R&D clawbacks or any sort of comments on what you are seeing out of Germany would be helpful? Thanks.","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","The area where we work with VW and Porsche and Audi are really about advancing the state-of-the-art in their cars. If you look at the work that we do, it's really about innovation and it's about the technology that they want to be world's first at bringing to market. This is a company \u2013 this is an organization that believes the technology leadership and leaning forward, leaning into the software-defined car and leaning into the computerized car and leaning into driver autonomous driving and leaning into electric vehicles is a good thing. This is a company that is very forward thinking as everybody is very well aware of. And so, our work with them are really along those areas and if anything at all, we see quite a significant heightened desire to move the company forward and do something great.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I'll now turn the call back to you, please continue with the presentation and\/or closing remarks.","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, thanks everybody for joining us today. There are several things that we wanted to say. We wanted to say that our new business model, transition approach to market is working and accelerating. We talked about our multiple growth market drivers, PC gaming data center and automotive are all growing nicely. We talked about the fact that we're working at the center of some big developments that are shaping the future of computing. AI, VR, accelerated cloud computing and autonomous driving cars, these are really exciting things. And we're doing that with one singular leveraged investment around one architecture and that allows us to bring the might of this company and the expertise that we have to help solve some of the problems that I have mentioned.","NVIDIA is the world leader in visual computing and it's becoming more important than ever in a growing number of industries. Our strategy is to leverage this one core investment to four growth markets, gaming, professional visualization, data center and auto, and is delivering good results and gaining momentum.

My name is Ashley, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the NVIDIA Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Christopher Evenden, Senior Director of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Chris Evenden","Thanks, Ashley. Good morning, and welcome to NVIDIA's conference call on the first quarter of fiscal 2013 results. With me on the call today from NVIDIA are Jen-Hsun Huang, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Burns, Interim Chief Financial Officer. ","After our prepared remarks, we will open up the call to a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that today's call is being webcast live on NVIDIA's Investor Relations website and is also being recorded. A replay of the conference call will be available via telephone until May 15, 2012, and the webcast will be available for replay until our conference call to discuss our financial results for our second quarter of fiscal 2013. The content of today's conference call is NVIDIA's property and cannot be reproduced or transcribed without our prior written consent.","During the course of this call, we will make -- we may make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of factors that could affect our future financial results and business, please refer to the disclosure in today's earnings release, our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2012 and the reports we may file from time to time on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","All our statements are made as of today, May 11, 2012, based on information available to us as of today. And except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements. ","Unless otherwise noted, all references to market research and market share numbers throughout the call come from Mercury Research or Jon Peddie Research.","During this call, we may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our financial release, which is posted on our website or in the case of our fiscal year 2013 outlook, the reconciliation is posted on our Investor Relations website.","With that, let me begin. Each of NVIDIA's businesses performed at least in line with expectations for the quarter with notebook graphics and Tegra coming in slightly higher than we had anticipated. As expected, we faced headwinds from the soft economy and hard, hard drive prices -- high hard drive prices, which passed the PC mix away from the channel in favor of OEMs. ","However, our competitive position was enhanced in mid-March with the launch of our new Kepler GPU architecture. Kepler is more powerful, more compact and more efficient than anything before it. Kepler is also our first architecture to include virtualization technology built right into the GPU. And we'll talk more about what that means at our GPU Technology Conference next week and at our upcoming Analyst Day on May 24.","Our first Kepler product was the GeForce GTX 680, which is 10% faster, 20% smaller and 22% more power efficient than its direct competitor. Of more than 130 media reviews published so far, each and every one of the recommended our GeForce GTX 680 over the competition. Kepler is the most efficient GPU architecture we've ever created and we expect this to translate into more market share and higher margins. ","Less than 2 weeks ago, we launched our second GeForce Kepler product, the GeForce GTX 690, which uses 2 Kepler GPUs to set a new bar for performance. The 690 is a gorgeous piece of engineering and industrial design, and this is widely noted by the press. The public reaction speaks to its degree of craftmanship and pride our engineers and designers put into their product. PC Magazine, which is a mainstream technology publication, described it as the card to cherish. Enthusiast sites went even further with HardOCP calling it the most perfect card they've ever tested. Their review found it to be, and I quote, \"the finest looking, best performing, most efficient jewel GPU card in the world with unsurpassed design and engineering.\"","And yesterday, we launched the GTX 670 to even better reviews. ","These cards enter a healthy PC gaming market. We launched the 690 at our GeForce LAN\/NVIDIA Gaming Festival in Shanghai. The event had 8,000 live attendees competing with a passion that has to be seen to be believed, and more than 1 million people viewed the 2-day contest online. ","Note that revenue hit a record in the first quarter as we refreshed our notebook GPUs top to bottom with the launch of the GeForce 600M series. The unprecedented power efficiency of GeForce 600M notebook GPUs has enabled new notebook form factors like that of the Acer Aspire Ultrabook M3. Putting a GeForce 600M GPU in an Ultrabook makes the Ultrabook truly worthy of the ultra tag. ","All indicators are that the strong growth will continue for our notebook business through 2Q -- Q2 and Q3 driven by Kepler design wins on the Ivy Bridge platform. Our visibility into OEM builds suggests that the attach rate, stable for the last 3 years, will remain strong. ","We'll be instituting more Kepler GPUs in the coming quarters. Demand is high for Kepler and although supply will continue to improve, we are not able to meet all our OEM and channel demand in Q2. We do not expect the 28-nanometer supply situation to resolve itself until later this year. This is factored into our current outlook. At this point, we can sell everything we can get. ","I'll now turn to our Tegra business. The world's first Tegra 3 phone was launched in February by HTC. The HTC One X is their new flagship product and has delighted reviewers worldwide. This is the first phone we've had that launched day one across multiple carriers. Tegra 3 gives it a long battery life, thanks to the 4-PLUS-1 quad-core architecture, console gaming -- console quality gaming and fast web browsing. And because Tegra 3 utilizes a specially enhanced 40-nanometer process, it's not affected by 28-nanometer supply constraints. ","Other phone wins around -- announced at Mobile World Congress includes ZTE with the first Tegra plus Icera phones, Fujitsu, LG and K-Touch. Tegra 3 phones are now shipping from 22 carriers in Europe and Asia and more will follow shortly.","The launch this past quarter of the first 2 phones with Icera baseband processor signals a new opportunity for NVIDIA to penetrate the mainstream smartphone market and to capture a greater share of the silicon bond in each phone. Looking forward, you'll see Tegra 3 LTE phones with partners' baseband processors in the second half of this year and then next year with our own LTE baseband processors as well. ","Additionally, we remain very excited about Tegra's opportunity in Windows on ARM. Progress continued this quarter with Microsoft shipping development PCs powered by NVIDIA's Tegra 3 mobile processor to Windows 8 developers and to device makers. Microsoft, itself, has made some important recent announcements about Windows on ARM, particularly those referring to its ability for enterprise application. And related, Forrester has predicted that 375 million tablets will ship in 2016 and almost 1\/3 of these will be bought directly by business. Even for the rest, Forrester believes that most consumers will use them for work as well as at home. ","Before handing things over to Karen, I'd like to remind everyone that our annual GPU Technology Conference takes place next week. We're bringing together several thousands of sciences, engineers and academics together to share, learn and network. Jen-Hsun will be presenting a major keynote at 10:30 a.m. on May 15, and it's well worth listening online if you can't be there in person. We'll also have keynotes from a Princeton researcher using GPUs to model collective behavior and the leader of a team competing for the Lunar X PRIZE. Many of the best minds in computing will be there. ","Finally, I want to highlight our Annual Investor Day on May 24. If you'd like to attend, please e-mail me or visit our website at nvidia.com\/ir to register. ","Now, over to Karen.","Karen Burns","Thanks, Chris. Revenue was at the high end of our outlook at $924.9 million on the strength of our new Kepler GPUs we launched in the quarter, as well as from strong performances in our notebook and Tegra businesses. GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 50.1%. Non-GAAP was 50.4%, both at the high end of our outlook, again on the strength of our new Kepler GPUs and desktop and notebook.","Our GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins were 1.3 and 2.1 percentage points lower than the prior quarter, respectively, largely due to the impact of 28-nanometer supply shortage that we experienced for our new Kepler products. GAAP OpEx was $390.5 million, non-GAAP was $348 million, both slightly above our outlook. The quarter-on-quarter increase was largely attributable to planned hiring and related infrastructure spending to support our strategic businesses as well as the impact of the payroll FICA tax reset that affects every first quarter. ","These results contributed to a GAAP net income of $60.4 million for the quarter or $0.10 per diluted share and non-GAAP net income of $97.5 million or $0.16 per diluted share, both slightly above the midpoint of our expectations.","Revenue results by business segment were as follows: Our GPU business was down 6.7% quarter-on-quarter due to the 28-nanometer supply shortage, which largely impacted our high-end desktop business as well as shorted supply for our new Kepler GPUs for notebook. Our professional business was down slightly at 4.2% from the fourth quarter, within normal seasonality. Our Consumer business was up 20.8% on the strength of our Tegra business as we've launched Tegra 3 for smartphones and tablets, offset by a decrease in our embedded business. ","For GAAP, our outlook for the second quarter is as follows: revenue of $990 million to $1.05 billion, gross margin of 51.2% plus or minus 1 percentage point, OpEx of approximately $418 million. ","Our GAAP OpEx outlook for Q2 includes a onetime charge related to our corporate donation to Stanford Hospital of $25 million payable over a 10-year period. ","We approximate our tax rate for the quarter at 20% plus or minus 1 percentage point.","For non-GAAP, we expect the following differences from our GAAP outlook: gross margin of 51.5% plus or minus 1 percentage point, OpEx of approximately $354 million, which excludes the $25 million onetime charge related to our contribution to Stanford, as well as stock-based compensation and certain other charges related to acquisition.","Outlook for the second quarter depreciation and amortization are expected in the range of $55 million to $57 million and capital expenditures of $35 million to $45 million. Diluted shares are expected to be approximately 628 million.","Chris Evenden","Thanks, Karen. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now take questions. Ashley?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just looking for the forward guidance, what are your segments doing specifically between the 3 main segments of your business?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, I guess they're all up.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Are there any specific drivers?","Jen-Hsun Huang","I'm sorry?","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I thought you were done. Go ahead.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yes, we're expecting them to be all up. Supply is still constrained, and our manufacturers are working their hearts out to catch up to our demand. But at the moment, demand still continues to exceed supply, and we expect that to happen for throughout the year as Chris was saying earlier. But Kepler is a fantastic, fantastic GPU. This is arguably the best we've ever made, and we've made some pretty fantastic GPUs over the years, and we're just in the process of rolling out Kepler into each and every one of our businesses and -- starting with desktop. There are still many, many segments within desktop that we're expecting to transition into Kepler throughout the year and throughout next year. There's a notebook that's in the process of rolling out now, and we started shipping this quarter and that -- or this last quarter, and that explains the big jump up and we're expecting another jump up this coming quarter. But Kepler is our GPU that goes into GeForce and Quadro and Tesla. And this upcoming week at GTC, I'd love to tell you about some of the new ideas around GPUs, and so Kepler is the core of many of our businesses. And when our GPU architecture is incredibly successful, you could see it drive all of our businesses for several years. And so my guess is that this will do again the same. And of course, Tegra 3 is ramping as we talked about before. Although we don't have LTE at the moment, LTE is predominantly a U.S.-centric phenomenon. Outside of the United States, the big superphone upgrade is quad-core. And Tegra 3 is the world's first quad-core and it's even a special quad-core at that with 4-PLUS-1, and it's got NVIDIA's branded graphics and all of our style of doing wonderful graphics and the video games and the content really shows. And so Tegra 3 is the next major upgrade for superphones in Europe and in China and elsewhere. And then towards the end of the year, we hope to bring Tegra 3 with LTE phones to United States.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I think this is my one follow-up. On that 28-nanometer shortage side of things, do you expect the solution to that problem to be more yield-driven by your primary supplier or -- I think in the past you've talked about looking to potentially diversify to additional foundries, so would the supply coming on from those potential suppliers fix the problem as well?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yields of 28 are probably the best of any new node that TSMC has ever done. They've done a great job with 28, and I think that it also explains the demand on their 28. It's yielding wonderfully at this point in its ramp. The performance is fabulous. The efficiency, energy efficiency, is terrific. So I think it explains the reason why the demand is so great for this particular node. I think the increased supply will have to come from increased capacity and it's -- we're short now, and every chip that they can come out of their fab is being shipped instantaneously. We've reduced cycle time dramatically between us and our customers, and we're trying to get the products to market as quickly as possible. And so I expect us to be supply constrained from wafers at the wafer level, and we'll continue that way throughout the end of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Daniel Berenbaum with MKM Partners.","Daniel A. Berenbaum - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Maybe just to follow up on Ross' question a little bit. So your 28-nanometer yields are good and we've heard this from other -- from some of your peers as well who are also constrained by TSMC supply. Was the problem that the customers of Taiwan Semi just didn't give a bullish enough forecast so that TSMC didn't add sufficient capacity, or was there sort of a misunderstanding in the planning process? Can you maybe help us understand a little bit of the dynamic that's going on between you and your supplier?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, I think clearly, clearly, there just isn't enough capacity, and we've expected a really, really successful Kepler launch. And the reason for that is because we've known for some time that Kepler is going to be a fantastic GPU and we've had big plans for Kepler, and we invested last year rather aggressively on the various designs of Kepler and all of the capabilities that people were starting to learn about Kepler, and there are many more to come. And we made those investments because we expected to be able to grow the market, and there's every evidence that we're growing the market. There's just not enough capacity and the planning process when we think about these new nodes, it just simply needs to be better. And I don't think there's any way around that. In combination between us and TSMC, we under planned for the supply of 28-nanometer, and we need to fix that in the future.","Daniel A. Berenbaum - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","So is this something that can simply be fixed by better planning, or is there really sort of a more structural change where TSMC is the only option at 28-nanometer, at least for some period of time, and getting the 20-nanometer will clearly have a lead among the other foundries of 20-nanometer. Is that a structural change where you're seeing potentially lower margins because you're much more tied to just the one supplier?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, I don't know that it's a structural change in the sense that if TSMC and ourselves were to have properly planned for this ramp, we wouldn't be shorting our customers so severely at the moment. And if we can make plenty of high-end GPUs like Keplers, our margins would be fine. And so it's really a shortage of supply that is causing our margins to be compressed at the moment, but we expect that to be cured as we go through the year. In terms of planning, that's a -- and building capacity, that's something that only TSMC can decide and ultimately, the industry will sort itself out.","Operator","Your next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Jen-Hsun, how much did the Tegra business grow in the first quarter? I know you were expecting it to grow at least 50%, and I'm assuming Tegra is going to contribute to the growth in the July quarter. Is the growth there going to be more driven by customers ramping new smartphones or new tablets or a combination of both? And then I have a follow-up.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Tegra grew 50% or more as we expected this last quarter, and we're expecting it to grow again this coming quarter. We launched the first phone in one region. The first phone was HTC's One X and the region was in Europe. Now it's expanding in Europe, and we're expecting to go through more regions with HTC. And then there are many other Tegra 3 phones that are teed up and coming to market. And so we're expecting the phone segment of Tegra 3 to continue to grow. There's also tablets. Tablets are doing very well for us. It represents about half of the overall demand at the moment, and there's some pretty exciting tablets that are about to come out throughout this year that we're working on. One particularly is, of course, Windows on ARM, and the enthusiasm behind it is growing every day. So it's a fantastic tablet, and I can't wait to show it you. And so I think the answer is to your question is yes to both. We're expecting to see growth in both tablets as well as phones.","Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And then obviously, you mentioned in your prepared remarks about under shipping demand in both the desktop and notebook segments in Q1. Can you just quantify roughly dollar-wise how much more revenue you could have shipped in Q1? And given obviously the constraints here in Q2, what the rough dollar impact on July sales could be as well.","Jen-Hsun Huang","We haven't broken it out, but it's a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from C.J. Muse with Barclays.","Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess first question -- I guess trying to understand both the impact of the shortage of 28-nanometer but also you guys moving from good die to full wafer pricing, how should we think about the impact to gross margins today and literally, I guess, through the year?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, when we don't have enough of our premium products, then that will hurt our margins the most. And so I think at the moment, it's safe to say that supply is what's constraining, what's holding our margins back. As supply improves and yields will be improving throughout the year, I think we have every chance and every possibility of delivering great margins again. And so I think the #1 issue for us right now is just to make sure that we have enough supply of Kepler GPUs. And if that comes through, the margins will take care of itself.","Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division","That's helpful. And as my follow-up, can you talk about the attach rates with Ivy Bridge ramping? Usually, you talk about design wins. Would love to get some color there.","Jen-Hsun Huang","We expect to gain share in Ivy Bridge and we expect Ivy Bridge to likely be the best node, if you will, best processor platform that we've ever participated in. Primarily, the reason for that is because Kepler is such an energy-efficient GPU and the performance and the energy efficiency of the performance is just the best in the world, and I think that people are recognizing that. Ivy Bridge hasn't really changed anything from our perspective. The market structure seems to be consistent as it was before. Consumer demand continues to be quite high and consumers -- one of the most important applications for it is video games, and video games still prefer to have GeForce. And so I think all of those dynamics are still consistent. OEMs still would like to have ways to differentiate their products, and adding the GeForce processor has been one of the best ways to differentiate and create a premium segment and it remains that way. And so whether it's thinner notebooks or Ivy Bridge, I don't think that, that's really changed the dynamics. So we're expecting attach rates to be quite healthy and consistent with the past.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Wong with Wells Fargo.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","When you talked about yields on 28-nanometers being so good at the moment, so as you do ramp Kepler and it matures somewhat, do you expect to get higher gross margins on this than prior-generation 40-nanometer chips? And also, are the shortages you're seeing on 28-nanometers translating into any upward pressure on wafer prices, or have you got pricing locked in for the Kepler generation?","Jen-Hsun Huang","The second question, I kind of lost a couple of bits. What did he say?","Chris Evenden","He said because supply is short, are wafer prices going to go up or are prices locked in.","Jen-Hsun Huang","I think the second question I have a better answer on. We have an understanding about wafer prices from TSMC and we negotiate with them and we now both understand where the pricing is, and so I don't expect a pricing increase and I surely hope it doesn't happen. With respect to margins, the reason why margins are great on Kepler is because it's a really efficient GPU. It's higher performance, it's lower power and for every performance level, it's also very efficient in terms of die size. And if that's the case, then our margins would lift. It is the most efficient architecture we've ever done and certainly relative to Fermi, our last-generation GPU, Kepler is much more efficient. And as you know, efficiency drives productivity, and in this particular case, productivity is margins. And so I expect that the more Kepler we ship, the higher our margins would lift. And so the really big focus for us is just to continue to ship as many Keplers as we can.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","That's great. And also on Tegra 3, you said that it's roughly 50-50 smartphone and tablets. Given your current design wins as again as the year progresses, do you expect that to stay 50-50 or is it going to be more skewed towards either smartphones or tablets?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Windows on ARM is going to be the big variable on that. And at the moment, it's running 50-50 and about. And throughout the next quarter, my expectation is that phones would exceed tablets. But towards the end of the year, latter half of the year, the question is how does Windows on ARM do. And so that's the biggest lever, and we can report on that a little bit later.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brendan Furlong with Miller Tabak.","Brendan Oliver Furlong - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","A follow-on, on the handset business. If you could, just maybe as the year progresses here, give us some indications on your baseband business, particularly on the LTE part of that.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Let's see. Well, we're really targeting the superphone segment of the marketplace. And when you look at the superphone segment of the marketplace, call it 100-plus million units a year or so, that part of the marketplace really is shared by 2 -- from a merchant semiconductor perspective, 2 players. Our focus -- because we didn't start from the modem business, we really focused on computing and graphics, we focused on segments of the marketplace where LTE isn't necessary at the moment and where it's just not ready for LTE. And so Europe, Asia, basically everywhere outside of United States has been our primary focus. Towards the end of this year starting in Q3-ish, we're working with LTE vendors and LTE partners to bring Tegra 3 and LTE phones to the rest of the markets. And so our primary focus at the moment is it's outside of United States. In the second half, in the United States, we'll bring LTE and Tegra devices into United States.","Brendan Oliver Furlong - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","Excellent. And then my second question would be on the consumer side, if you could give any sort of indication of what the royalty piece -- portion of that is in the quarter.","Chris Evenden","You're talking about Sony there, Brendan?","Brendan Oliver Furlong - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","Yes.","Karen Burns","We don't disclose that.","Chris Evenden","Yes, we don't break it out.","Operator","Your next question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Jen-Hsun, if you look at the PC guys that reported in April, they guided up a few percent, which was certainly better than seasonal. My question is on your Consumer GPU business, how much of the strength are you seeing is really driven by the channel restocking versus some of the share gains you've outlined with Kepler?","Jen-Hsun Huang","There's really 2 factors that's driving our growth, and one is 28-nanometer supply. There's just more of it than last quarter. I would say last quarter was not a typical quarter for us. I would characterize last quarter as a difficult quarter, and it was completely supply constrained. And this coming quarter, we're still supply constrained. And although it's a significant growth quarter, it is still difficult from my perspective, and the supply is still far short of demand. And the second part of our growth comes from Tegra 3's ramp, and we're really fortunate with Tegra 3 to have chosen an enhanced version of the 40-nanometer process. This is a technology called LPG, and we're the only one in the world using it. And it is a balance between high performance as well as extremely low power. TSMC did a fabulous job with us on that, and I really appreciate it because now we can support Tegra 3's ramp without consuming more of the 28-nanometer wafers that we can allocate to Kepler. And so I think the answer is, quite simply, more supply and more supply of 28-nanometer and Tegra 3's ramp that's contributing to the growth.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","All right. My follow-up is on the cash balance. If you consider how the stock performed during the quarter and how much cash you generated on your balance sheet, if the cash balance is about 40% of your total market cap, and my question is are you managing or do you plan to manage the cash to a certain level considering the valuation? What are your thoughts around doing a share repurchase program or instituting a dividend?","Jen-Hsun Huang","We haven't -- we don't have anything to announce today, and that's a topic that we have with the board on a regular basis. But we don't have anything to announce today.","Karen Burns","Just if I may, I'd like to give a little more clarity on the previous question from Brendan. On CPB, the royalties were flat and embedded, as you know, and our CFO commentary is down. So if directionally, that helps you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Jen-Hsun, I had actually 2 questions for you. The first one was we were all in a room all day yesterday at a small company in Santa Clara and there was a lot of talk about the structural advantage that Intel had going down in node. So just wanted your perspective since you do -- are one of the fabless companies that uses leading-edge technology and ultimately the first and the follow-up to that -- kind of related to that was as we go down in node, and some of the fabless companies have talked about going down in 20-nanometer, and what does that do to potentially margin or affects headwind. So what is your perspective on both those topics?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, I think our partner for advanced nodes is doing quite a nice job, I think, and I expect TSMC to continue to be able to advance their capabilities on an ongoing basis. There's nothing that would suggest that TSMC doesn't have the scale or the capabilities to do so. They're manufacturing an enormous number of wafers by anyone's standards, and so I think the availability of leading-edge wafers is not something I'm overly concerned about. In terms of process technology, it's also important to recognize that CPU's needs for process technology and SoC's needs for process technology is similar but not the same. And TSMC's leadership and density is something that can't be ignored. People always talk about one dimension of the semiconductor process, which is the transistor, but metallization is increasingly, especially for SoCs, by far, the most important variable. And so I think that we just need to be careful not to get -- drink too much marketing bathwater when we think about the technology variable because it's so complicated and SoCs are very different than CPUs. And so let's see, the second is margins. Our job is to make sure that we continue to create efficient architectures that are highly valued, and I think that if we continue to do and create GPUs like Kepler, I think we're going to be doing just fine.","Operator","Your next question comes from Doug Freedman with RBC Capital Markets.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Could you help us understand the dependency on 28-nanometer? What percent of your mix is it now? And at what point do you think we'll cross over to, say, the 50% of your output coming from 28? And I have a follow-up.","Jen-Hsun Huang","I think we're expecting it to be about 30% this coming quarter. We'd like it to be a lot more.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And can you give us any idea when you think you can reach 50%?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, this coming quarter's about 30% is my estimate. Next quarter will be more than that, and the quarter after that will be even more than that. And so hopefully, we cross 50% as soon as possible. We would like to cross this as quickly as possible.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then my follow-up is really sort of an add-on to the previous question, and that relates to the efficiency that you're gaining at the advanced node. If they're so -- I guess I share your commentary that there isn't much risk of development of advanced process technology. I think the question comes into the economic advantage that the advanced technology is going to deliver. Are you getting the cost reduction? Clearly, 28 appears to be delivering that. Is the forecast for the next node going to give you an equal cost-to-benefit ratio or are you starting to see sort of a slowing of benefit as we go to these advanced nodes because they are so complex?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Every -- by the way, every node is complex. This is a conversation that we have at every node and we take every node seriously. And there's no evidence that anyone is becoming increasingly complacent, and so I think these are typical conversations to have. With respect to efficiency or productivity of each node, we will go into the node when it delivers value for the products that we need to create. And so if it makes no sense to go to a new node, we wait until it make sense to go to a new node. And so there isn't anything that -- nobody is in automatic cruise control, and we look at each node carefully with TSMC and we try to adjust each node if we can improve it for our products and otherwise. And then based on those analysis, we decide which products and when should go into the new nodes. And so it just simply needs to be analyzed. I don't -- there's nothing that suggests that the next node is going to be unproductive. If it's unproductive, it won't get used, and so my expectation is that it will be productive.","Operator","Your next question comes from Uche Orji with UBS.","Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just real quick. As we look at the gross margin issues, can you talk about -- because one of the areas you've highlighted in the past is PSB and the future opportunities that, that brings. What are the gross margin drivers for going down the line, and I'm talking about looking at other areas, so if you can talk specifically on PSB. And also on Tegra, as these constraints happen across the group and then Qualcomm talked about it, do you see yourself increasingly gaining share going down the line on Tegra 3? That's my first question, please.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Okay. First, I'll answer the question backwards. Well, the answer is yes, we're gaining share. And the reason for that is because we were a very small player before. And as a discrete application processor provider, we've gained quite a bit of share. If you look at their market, our competitor's market -- business around discrete application processors, I think that you'll find that our share is growing quite rapidly. And so my expectation is that as we grow throughout the year that we're doing so because we're growing share, number one. Number two, PSB's gross margins are healthy and slightly improving, and the reason for that is because we continue to add more value to the high end of the visual computing market. Digital content creation is a growing market, and more and more of design is moving to digital forms, and this is an area that we are world leaders at and this is an area that we continue to add a lot of value to the industry on. And so as we increase value to the marketplace, we'll reward it with higher margins. And our focus is to make sure that PSB, where we have extremely high share already, that we continue to help grow the market. And that's one of the focus next week of GTC. If you all have a chance to either tune in or come even down to GTC, you're going to find some really, really fantastic work being done around the world by our partners and content developers who are using our technology to create wonderful assets and create wonderful things and discovery of new science.","Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Right. Let me just ask you a second question. Can you give us any updates on Windows on ARM as well the efforts in terms of timing of products coming, especially as Intel is making a big push in that category as well on the tablet front? So any commentary on development on the PC form factor on tablets and Windows 8 and regarding timing as well, that'd be helpful. That's one question. And then two, Kepler, it's been said that you will need Kepler in volume to be able to increase discrete attach rates in Ultrabooks. Any commentary as to the attach rates in Ultrabook in general? And how much of that is going to be Kepler? And how much of that will be a print [ph] products? That'll be helpful.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Windows 8 tablets and Windows RT tablets are very different things. Windows 8 x86 tablets and Windows on ARM tablets are very different things. And as Microsoft goes to market, people will understand why we're so enthusiastic about Windows on ARM. They're just very, very different things, and so I'll let Microsoft tell you about their plans, but I'm very enthusiastic about it. I think it makes a lot of sense for enterprise. Anybody who has a large part of their work around Windows would really benefit from Windows on ARM tablets and all the Windows on ARM devices -- range of devices that will be following after that. We've shipped about 1,000, maybe more than 1,000 Tegra Windows on ARM, or Microsoft has shipped more than 1,000 Tegra Windows on ARM tablets for software developers, and that number is growing very rapidly. And so we're working very closely with them to march to market with an exciting product as quickly as we can. Ultrabook, we see no difference between an Ultrabook and a PC. It's a thinner PC, but PCs have been getting thinner. And there's plenty of room from a thermal or mechanical or electrical perspective to support a GPU. And the reason why people put GPUs in their notebooks is because it helps them deliver a premium device. It also enables consumers the ability to enjoy multimedia better. And so I don't see any difference relative to attach rates when it comes to Ultrabooks. And then with respect to Kepler, Kepler is our primary focus for next-generation notebooks and we're trying to build as much as we can. And the more that our supply catches up to the demand, the more our customers can ship Kepler GPUs. Everybody is really, really anxious to get more, and so we need to just make more.","Operator","Your next question comes from Daniel Gelbtuch with Cantor.","Daniel M. Gelbtuch - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Just digging a little deeper into Tegra. I was just wondering if you could compare and contrast how Tegra really, not only from a efficiency perspective, how it compares with the current status quo in the market, number one. And number two, with regard to SDR or software-defined radios and Icera, how do you think that changes the landscape for LTE, I guess, next year and the year -- and beyond?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, Tegra 3 is the world's first quad-core processor. And it's not only quad-core, as you might know. It has a really energy-efficient CPU core as well. And so not only does it deliver higher performance, it's also more energy efficient than the status quo. And of course, with all of the products, the graphics and the video games are just so much better. And so I think that based on the demand and the reception in the marketplace for the first Tegra 3 phone, I think it's safe to say that Tegra 3 is really the standard by which everything is being compared, number one. Number two, software-defined radio, there's no question that SDR allows us to deliver a much smaller and efficient and cost-efficient modem. And with LTE, it is very clear that the die size is smaller, the energy efficiency is excellent and that's really going to help, especially with capacity being so constrained. Having a very small modem, a very small LTE modem, is going to be a big differentiator for us. Not only will we be able to make more of integrated versions of application processors and LTE modems, we'll also be able to bring more cost-effective solutions to the marketplace. So we're really, really gunning for that and running as hard as we can.","Daniel M. Gelbtuch - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","So is it fair to say that once you get this integration of SDR rolling, this would be perhaps the first time that the current incumbent in the APE space is going to be seeing some serious -- a real competitor?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, the incumbent is a really good company, and they're very competitive. And this is new for us, and we still have a lot to learn and we're learning as fast as we can. But the Icera SDR modem is really revolutionary and when we can combine that -- and there's every evidence it works great. We're shipping phones now. There were people said that we couldn't get that modem to market, people said that we couldn't get phone's voice to work. But obviously, all wrong. We're now certified on LTE and we're in the process of getting products to market. And so these are all barriers that we have to overcome, but we're taking it -- ticking it off one at a time and we're -- I'm cautious, but very enthusiastic about the technology we're bringing to the market.","Operator","Your next question comes from Suji De Silva with ThinkEquity.","Sujeeva De Silva - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division","So first question, Jen-Hsun, on this Kepler architecture and the energy efficiency of it as you described it, how do you monetize that? Is that smaller die or is that a value proposition that customers pay for and just allows you to kind of get that upgrade?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, absolutely both, absolutely both. Kepler is the most energy-efficient. It's also the most die size-efficient GPU we've ever made. The performance per watt and the performance per millimeter are both the best that we've ever done. It was a huge drive for our company to transform ourselves in just about every single dimension from architecture to design to implementation to software. We pulled everything together for Kepler. When you're more energy-efficient, at any level of power that the system can provide will be higher performance. And so if the system can provide 300 watts, we're higher performance. If the system can provide for only 10 watts, we're higher performance. If the system can provide 1 watt in the future, we'll be higher performance. So energy efficiency is incredibly important. And of course, at any price point in the marketplace, if we are efficient with respect to die size, that can only help our gross margins. Whatever gross margins we had at the Fermi generation, so long as market dynamics remain similar, I expect our gross margins to be higher than the Fermi generation wherever that happens to be. And so that explains why I'm so impatient to get Kepler lined [ph] up and why we need so much more Kepler supply from TSMC.","Sujeeva De Silva - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division","Understood. And my other question, Jen-Hsun, is in January, you had a Microsoft representative in CES and you asked them about how Windows -- Microsoft would avoid confusion as Windows on ARM came out, and you may defer this question to Microsoft, but what's your update on that thought as we look ahead to Microsoft tablets?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, I think you guys are going to really like the answer. They've been very thoughtful about the segmentation of the Windows -- the next Windows generation. There are different customers with different needs, and I think you're going to find their answer rather thoughtful. I'm very pleased with where they ended up and I think it's going to really, really, really help the positioning of the Windows on ARM tablets because they're very different than those -- than x86. It's a new product category. I think you're going to find that they're really desirable, and they're going to bring a lot of value to the marketplace. For people who -- where Windows and Office is still a very central part of their digital experience, I think you're going to find that this is really the best tablet on the planet.","Operator","Your next question comes from Raji Gill with Needham & Company.","Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","The question I have is on Tegra. I just wondered if you can update us on the annual guidance that you had given at the start of the year. Any changes to that, any additional color?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Thank you. No, no change to that. No additional color. The 3 growth drivers for Tegra are: One, phone design wins; and two, because we've successfully reduced the costs of tablets, we're starting to reach price points of Android tablets that are really resonating with the market and of course, the Android tablets are just getting better and better all the time, and Tegra 3 Android tablets are really delightful. And there's a whole bunch of new tablet that are coming starting now and towards the end of the year. And then the third driver is Windows on ARM. That's coming together really nicely, and I think that people are going to be quite delighted by it. And so those are really the 3 primary drivers and they, all 3, remain drivers at the moment.","Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Just a question on the OpEx. The OpEx went up about 7% sequentially. It's being guided up again. So now we're kind of at the high end of your OpEx range. How should we look at the OpEx throughout this year? Do you think you could really go past that range? What -- how do you think we should look at it next year? And along those same lines, are we starting to be kind of a return on investment on the Icera?","Jen-Hsun Huang","We are going to do the best we can to stay at the guidance level that we provided previously. Now if there -- if some of the new initiatives in our company starts to gain traction, we'll increase the level of investment to take that to market. But we'll play that as we go. But at the moment, our current plan is to stay as close as we can to the guidance that we provided before.","Operator","Your next question comes from Craig Berger with FBR Capital Markets.","Craig Berger - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Can you help us understand the impact Kepler's having on GPU ASPs and what ASPs did in desktop and notebook in the first quarter? And then I have a follow-up.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, the more -- because Kepler comes in through the performance segment and the enthusiast segment, it naturally lifts ASPs. The more we ship, the more -- the higher our ASPs will be. And so Kepler ASPs are higher than Fermi ASPs because they target the premium segments. Kepler margins are better than Fermi margins because they're in the enthusiast segment and the performance segments, also because they're so much more energy-efficient and so much more die size-efficient. And so I think the simple answer is we just need a lot more Keplers, and the demand for Kepler is really, really high in desktops, in notebooks. The gamers come out and refresh their PCs once every few years. And on all accounts, Kepler has been a complete home run. And this is -- it's pulling people out to refresh their PCs, it's -- and PC gaming is really vibrant right now. And so I think those factors are really driving Kepler. So the more we can build, the higher ASPs we will be and surely the much higher margins we will be.","Craig Berger - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","As the follow-up, can you update us on your CFO search? And then really I wanted to ask again on the OpEx. I know it was just asked, but can you just reiterate what was your guidance? And you said you might spend more; is that more than you're spending now, more than your guidance? And what's the time line there because, I mean, from my perspective, you did better on revenues, you did better on gross margins and my model is still challenged because of the OpEx. And so that's kind of disappointing.","Jen-Hsun Huang","The guidance that we gave you on OpEx is exactly the guidance we gave you on OpEx. And so we just provided the guidance and that's what it was, and that's what we're planning. With respect to -- what was the first question, CFO search? I think my CFO is doing fabulously, and she's doing a fantastic job with the business. And we're looking. And if there's a world-class CFO that we fall in love with, certainly we'll consider. But Karen's doing a fabulous job.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions.","Chris Evenden","All right. Thanks, Ashley.

(Operator Instructions)","I would now turn the call over to Mr. Chris Evenden, Senior Director for Investor Relations with NVIDIA. Sir, you may begin your conference.","Chris Evenden","Thanks, Colin. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to NVIDIA's conference call for the second quarter of fiscal 2015. With me on the call today from NVIDIA are Jen-Hsun Huang, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Colette Kress, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open up the call to a question-and-answer session. Please limit yourself to one initial question with one follow-up.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that today\u2019s call is being webcast live on NVIDIA\u2019s Investor Relations Web-site and is also being recorded. A replay of the conference call will be available via telephone until August 14, 2014, and the webcast will be available for replay until our conference call to discuss our financial results for our third quarter of fiscal 2015.

For a discussion of factors that could affect our future financial results and business, please refer to the disclosure in today\u2019s earnings release, our Form 10-Q for the fiscal period ended April 27, 2014, and the reports we may file from time to time on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","All our statements are made as of today, August 7, 2014 based on information available to us as of today, and except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements. Unless otherwise noted, all references to market research and market share numbers throughout the call come from Mercury Research or Jon Peddie Research.","During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our financial release, which is posted on our Web-site.","So let's begin. Revenue was $1.1 billion, up 13% year-on-year and in line with our outlook. Gross margin was a record 56.1% and we delivered EPS up 38% year-on-year. The quarter's gross margins and overall profitability were better than we had anticipated, driven by strength in PC gaming GPUs and in datacenter and cloud platforms.","PC gaming continued to deliver year-on-year growth in an expanding industry. GeForce sits at the center of the PC gaming ecosystem, now powering close to 100 million gaming PCs around the world. Our new entry-level GeForce GTX GPU delivers the performance of the latest generation consoles, making the GeForce gaming PC the largest target for developers of latest generation games. There's no better place to look for evidence of the strength in PC gaming than eSports.","Last month's DOTA 2 Tournament in Seattle was televised on ESPN and carried total prize money of over $10 million, more than the British Open Golf Championship. The number of players playing League of Legends rose to about 67 million and they accumulated over 1 billion hours of playtime under the strong pipeline of AAA games launching on PC this fall, including new versions of Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Call of Duty.","In the workstation market, Adobe continue to push the use of GPUs with the addition of acceleration to Adobe Illustrator CC. Illustrator have millions of users worldwide. They could get up to a 10x performance boost by adding Quadro making the experience silky smooth.","Tesla had a record quarter and demonstrated continued momentum in big data analytics and machine learning with some high volume purchases from consumer Web companies for image and voice proc4essing. Tesla sales for high-performance computing also grew and several OEMs announced they will ship Tesla-based servers combined with ARM64 SoCs. ARM64 server processors were initially targeted at micro Web service but GPUs expanded their market opportunity by providing them muscle to tackle HPC workloads.","NVIDIA Tesla GPUs now power the world's 15 most energy-efficient supercomputers as listed in the Green500 list. Tesla also powers the faster computer in the U.S., the fastest in Europe and the world's fastest enterprise supercomputer.","GRID sales continue to ramp in Q2, and also during the quarter we launched wrinkles we launched GRID Test Drive to help enterprise IT professionals experience the benefits that GRID can bring to their virtual desktop infrastructures. The services attracted more than 10,000 users in its first eight weeks.","Companies are realizing quantifiable benefits by adopting GRID to virtualize demanding PC and workstation applications. GRID enabled Turkish Aerospace to rapidly scale its design team. Roger Williams University is providing students access across its vast campus to architecture and engineering applications 24x7, and Daewoo Shipbuilding is doubling the number of engineers who can collaborate live on their cloud based system.","Moving now to mobile computing, this quarter we saw some major development. We launched the next member of the SHIELD family, the SHIELD tablet. Powered by Tegra K1, the SHIELD tablet is the highest performance tablet on the market. From top to bottom, processor, tablet, software and peripherals, the SHIELD tablet is designed to be the ultimate tablet for gamers.","To understand the market for the SHIELD tablet, consider that Newzoo, a research company, estimates there are 1.6 billion gamers in the world today. Many of them are looking to buy a tablet, an idea supposed by the fact that 90% of Google Play revenue is generated by gaming.","Press reaction has been great. Gizmodo described it as a gaming beast and so much more. AnandTech said that it's incredibly important to get the controller right for gaming devices and NVIDIA has nailed it. SlashGear said that it's the new high watermark for a well-rounded tablet.","There are 400 plus games optimized today for touch and controller on Tegra and more and more are leveraging the power of Tegra K1. For example, the SHIELD tablet comes with Frozenbyte's Trine 2, a hit game on PlayStation 4. And Portal and Half Life 2, both from Valve software, have been optimized to Tegra K1. Half-Life 2 is the highest rated PC game in history having won over 50 Game of the Year awards and multiple Game of the Decade awards.","An interesting new development is cross-platform multiplayer. War Thunder to be launched on SHIELD this fall by Gaijin Entertainment will offer massively multiplayer combat across Tegra, PC and PlayStation 4. As with GeForce on Windows, our strategy with SHIELD is to build the best game platform on Android, now one of the largest gaming platforms in the world. The SHIELD tablet is one more important element of our gaming strategy.","Google used its annual developer conference, Google I\/O, to announce the Android extension package for its next version of its operating system, Android L. It brings, in the company's words, desktop class gaming to Android, and they leveraged Tegra K1 to demonstrate its capabilities with Epic's start-of-the-art Unreal Engine 4. Tegra K1 also runs many other desktop-class engines including Source, Unity, CryEngine and id Tech. Supporting these game engines makes it much easier for developers to bring games to Android on Tegra K1.","Android TV was also launched at I\/O and Google gave every attendee a development platform based on Tegra. Finally, Google used I\/O to launch Android Auto and demonstrated it with a Tegra powered infotainment system in Audi S3.","Our automotive business grew more than 70% year-on-year. Volkswagen announced that the upcoming Passat will use Tegra to power its infotainment system following on from the Golf which is already shipping with Tegra. The new GT which features two Tegra chips has started production in Europe and Audi has upgraded the A7's infotainment system to include Tegra, evidence of the faster cycles possible with the use of our Visual Computing Module. Separately, BMW has started shipping the i3 and announced its i8, both powered by Tegra.","Xiaomi's Mi Pad with the Tegra K1 started shipping in Q2 with the first 50,000 units selling out in four minutes. We expect the first Tegra K1 Chromebooks to start shipping this quarter and IDC expects the Chromebook market to triple over the next three years.","In conclusion, our investments in differentiated platforms are delivering success in gaming, HPC, professional visualization design and in automotive markets. We've leveraged our visual computing IP to set the stage for accelerated growth. And with that behind, over to Colette.","Colette Kress","Thanks, Chris. Hello everyone. Let me provide some details on the second quarter of fiscal 2015. Revenue of $1.10 billion grew 13% year-over-year. Growth was driven by Tegra Processor sales, GeForce GPUs for gaming, Tesla and GRID for datacenter and cloud workloads.","Revenue from GeForce GPUs for gaming desktops and notebooks grew 10%, fueled by continued strength in the gaming market, including the recently released GeForce GTX 750 and GTX 750 Ti, Maxwell-based GPUs. Tesla and GRID for datacenter and high performance computing increased significantly from VDI deployments and large project wins with cloud service providers, as well as high-end education and government customers. Quadro revenue increased, with particularly strong growth in mobile workstations.","Tegra processor sales grew 200% from a year ago led by mobile devices and automobile infotainment systems. Revenue from Tegra processors for automobiles grew 74% year-over-year. All key platforms for growth, gaming, datacenter and cloud, and mobile showed strong growth this quarter. Our transformation into visual computing systems and solutions allows us to realize the continued success in consumer PC and mobile gaming, as well as realize the growth in cloud datacenters, supercomputers, professional design and automobiles.","The GPU business declined 2% sequentially as we executed well during the seasonal decline of consumer desktop GPUs. We believe we outperformed the market for consumer PCs led by our overall performance and ecosystem supporting PC gaming. Quadro, Tesla and GRID, all grew sequentially as well.","Moving to gross margins, GAAP gross margin was 56.1%, up 130 basis points sequentially. Non-GAAP gross margin was 56.4%, up 130 basis points sequentially. These margins were both a record and better than our outlook. The increases reflected continued strength in our GPU margins for PC platforms, datacenter and cloud, and partially offset by the increased volume in Tegra processors. Compared to our outlook, the higher gross margin levels were driven by strong absolute average selling prices for consumer GPUs and aided by our record quarter for Tesla and datacenter solution.","GAAP operating expenses for the second quarter were $456 million, in line with our outlook and essentially flat from the prior quarter\u2019s $453 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $411 million, flat from the prior quarter. With continued management of our investments through alignment to a single unified architecture, we produced a third consecutive quarter of flat operating expenses. Operating expenses grew slightly year-over-year due to employee additions, employee compensation increases and related costs, partially offset by lower engineering development costs.","GAAP operating income was $163 million, up 55% from the prior year\u2019s second quarter, reflecting strong revenue growth from higher margin GPUs and contained operating expenses. GAAP net income was $128 million, up 33% from a year earlier, driven by increased operating profit from strong revenue and margins. GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.22 increased 38% from $0.16 per diluted share in the year-ago quarter, reflecting net income growth and share repurchases.","Now turning to some key balance sheet items, during the second quarter we paid $47 million in cash dividends and received 6.8 million shares under the $500 million structured repurchase agreement we entered into in the first quarter. During the first quarter, we had paid $47 million in cash dividends and received 20.6 million shares under the agreement. As a result, during the first half, we have returned $594 million of the $1 billion we intend to return to shareholders in fiscal 2015.","Accounts receivable at the end of the quarter were $470 million, up $74 million from the prior quarter. The increase was primarily due to less linear second quarter shipments compared to the first quarter. DSO at the quarter-end was 39 days, up from 33 days in the prior quarter, and flat from the second quarter of fiscal 2014.","Inventory at the end of the quarter was $387 million, down $6 million from the prior quarter. The sequential decrease includes the ramping of Tegra processor products and products based on new GPU architectures, which were more than offset by decreases in products based on our previous-generation architectures. DSI at the quarter-end was 73 days, up from 72 days in the prior quarter.","Cash flow from operating activities was $96 million, down from $151 million in the prior quarter and flat from $96 million a year earlier. The sequential decrease was primarily due to higher levels of accounts receivable and lower payables than the prior quarter. Compared to the year ago quarter, the operating cash flow reflected higher net income from improved gross profit and contained operating expenses, offset by lower payables outstanding.","Free cash flow was $74 million in the second quarter. Depreciation and amortization expense amounted to $56 million. Capital expenditures were $23 million, lower than our outlook of $40 million.","Now turning to the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2015, following our $1.1 billion in second quarter, we expect revenue for the third quarter to be $1.2 billion, plus or minus 2%. The sequential revenue growth of 9% is reflective of our continued strength in gaming for PC and mobile platforms, datacenter and cloud solutions, and automobiles. We expect our consumer GPU business to be up seasonally in the third quarter. Our Tegra business is also expected to grow sequentially.","Our GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 55.2% and 55.5% respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. The gross margin outlook reflects higher expected Tegra processor revenue which has overall lower margins than our Company total, a greater mix of devices versus SoCs with Tegra compared to the second quarter, and expected growth in volumes of consumer GPUs.","GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $463 million and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $416 million, nearly flat with expense levels for Q2. Our operating expenses in the third quarter will reflect an onset of our annual compensation increases and expenses associated with our higher revenue. We will continue to manage through our fourth consecutive quarter of maintaining operating expense levels.","GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for the third quarter and annual 2015 are both expected to be 19%, plus or minus 1%. This estimate is 1 percentage point lower than our previous outlook and is consistent with our tax rate in the second quarter excluding any discrete tax events.","With that, I'm going to turn it back to Chris and we'll open up for questions.","Chris Evenden","Thanks. That concludes our prepared remarks and we'll take questions. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Colin, over to you please.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of James Covello with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Gabriela Borges - Goldman Sachs","Congrats on the strong results. This is Gabriela Borges on behalf of Jim. I was hoping you could talk about relative to guidance, you mentioned a number of business lines that are doing well right now, maybe you could talk about which ones of those you would highlight just in terms of magnitude driving the strength in the quarter?","Colette Kress","In terms of how we did versus the quarter in Q2 versus our guidance, is that the statement?","Gabriela Borges - Goldman Sachs","Sorry, within the guidance for third quarter.","Colette Kress","Correct. In terms of where we think the growth will stem from, from a revenue perspective, again it is usually a seasonally uptick in terms of our overall consumer GPUs that are there for gaming as we get ready for the second half of the year on the high gaming season. So, that we do expect to be a significant contributor to our overall revenue growth sequentially of 9%. Additionally, we also expect our overall Tegra business to also grow sequentially associated with both our SoCs particularly for auto will increase and also what we expect for our devices as well.","Gabriela Borges - Goldman Sachs","That's helpful, thank you. And then just as a follow-up if I may on the gross margin guidance, maybe if you could just give us a sense of the longer-term as to what level is sustainable just with some of the tailwinds that you have from richer mix shift over the next few quarters or so?","Colette Kress","So, we talked quite a bit about what will contribute to our gross margins going forward and we do expect in any one quarter to see seasonal increases or potentially large projects completed in some of our enterprise businesses. So it's really a nature of the overall mix over a longer-term period of time which will influence our gross margins long-term. When you think about our overall enterprise businesses from Tesla, GRID and overall Quadro, which carry slightly higher gross margins than overall Company average, and depending on the seasonality of some of those businesses as well as large projects that we may complete, you will see our gross margins be very strong.","Our overall consumer GPUs, we've done a very solid job in keeping our overall gross margins with solid ASPs and that should contribute as well in the quarters which we have strong growth. Then thirdly, when you think about our overall Tegra business, it is a case in terms of volumes and we do know that these are lower overall gross margins than our Company average. So depending on when those volumes hit, it can also affect the overall Company's gross margin. But at this time, it is hard to say in precise every single quarter in terms of what that guidance will be but those are generally the factors that will influence our gross margin ranges going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I think you had mentioned about 10% growth in gaming revenues. I'm curious, how much of that growth is coming from unit growth versus just stronger ASPs or share gains from AMD?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Vivek, this is Jen-Hsun. If you take a look at the overall gaming market, it is surely growing. Depending on which one of the analysts you follow, the vast majority of them see that global gaming market is growing about 10%, a little bit over 10%. If you take a look at the largest gaming franchise today, they are mostly associated with massively online battle arena games called MOBA games. Whether it's League of Legends or DOTA 2, the two combined has nearly 100 million gamers and each day there are some 10 million gamers playing these two games. The size of the eSports, competitive sports associated with these two games, is becoming quite a large industry in itself.","China is still growing, Southeast Asia is extremely underexposed and those markets are growing. And so, I think that it's fair to say that the gaming market overall is still growing. ASP is increasing and the reason why ASP is increasing is because the production value of games are increasing. The latest generation game consoles are now out. The entry-level GTX, GeForce GTX, with a street price of about $100 is comparable in performance to a next generation game console.","And so, if the market shifts to even that level, our ASP has quite a lot of room to still grow. And so as the production value of games continue to grow, I think we're going to see our ASPs grow. And so I would say that the dynamics of the gaming industry, PC gaming industry is really quite healthy, both in more and more players playing and ASPs increasing because of production value.","Now when you think about it in terms of our own platform, there's almost I would say there's about 100 million GeForce gamers around the world, they are active gamers around the world. And yet we know there are several hundred million gamers altogether and PC gaming is becoming more and more popular for the reasons that I've mentioned already and others. My sense is that we still have quite a bit of penetration to go. And so these are the dynamics that are helping us.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thanks Jen-Hsun, very helpful. And then as my follow-up, there has been a lot of discussion or concern about the royalty payments from Intel since they are a very important part of your EPS and domestic cash, and I do realize the agreement runs for a few years, but when do you need to start to renegotiate and do you think the new agreement would be flat, up or down from what you have right now?","Jen-Hsun Huang","It's hard to predict the future but there are some things that we know. NVIDIA invents more in modern computer graphics than just about all of the world's companies combined. We invented the GPU, we invented GPGPU, we invented the ability for GPUs to be virtualized so that you can put it in the cloud and that's one of the reasons why our cloud computing business has grown so fast now. We're continuing to focus on this one specialized field of computing that's becoming more and more important. I don't know of too many technology companies in the world today who doesn't rely on technologies that we've invented.","Technology licensing is an important part of our business. Long before there was Intel licensing our technology, there were other companies licensing our technology. We have licensing revenues as a component of our business now for 15 plus years. And so my expectation is that licensing revenues will continue to be an important part of our income for quite some time to come.","Now there's a second component that's really important which is, whereas we historically were able to license to mostly PC companies, we can now license to mobile and cloud companies. And so those are new opportunities for us. And then lastly, we no longer just license IP as in patents, we've productised our design into a core and that core could be licensed, so that makes it easier for companies who would like to innovate and build their own products to be able to license our technology. We have now more ways to engage customers in IP licensing.","We're serious about this business, we're actively working on these matters, they take time, but I'm very confident that licensing will continue to be an important part of our business going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with J. P. Morgan Chase. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Harlan Sur - J. P. Morgan","Congrats on the solid quarterly execution. The Q3 guidance signifies revenue growth of 14% on a year-over-year basis. Your GPU business in particular, that grew double-digits year-over-year in Q1 and took a bit of a pause in Q2, I'm assuming just weaker consumer PCs. The question is, are you looking forward to GPU business to return to double-digits year-over-year growth in Q3, and if you are, if you could just highlight some of the drivers?","Jen-Hsun Huang","First of all, Q2 is seasonally slower than all of the other quarters, and considering the performance that we had, it was actually quite extraordinary. And our expectation is that Q3 will return to its traditional seasonal growth era. There's a couple of other dynamics that's going on now. There are some really big titles coming this fall. I don't remember a time when PC gaming is going to benefit from the huge titles that are coming out this fall at the pace that it is. And partly the reason for that is because this is the first year, the first major year, first full year of next generation game consoles, and so these new large franchise titles like Call of Duty and Assassin's Creed are going to hit the market.","And ultimately what drives our business, some seasonality, of course Christmas matters, of course back-to-school matters, of course Chinese New Year matters, but ultimately what really drives our business are huge games, and this fall we're going to see some really, really huge titles.","Our position in the marketplace is fantastic. GeForce is really the best gaming platform for PCs today, it's not even close anymore. I think that because of the technology, we know that Kepler has been a fantastic platform for us, Maxwell is even better than that, but all of the software and all the application technology that we put around GeForce has really changed its profile for gamers.","Not only can you play great games now, you could use our GeForce Experience, which has been installed some 40 million times, there are 40 million PCs around the world that now has GeForce Experience inside so that you could record completely in the background without affecting your gameplay and stream it to Twitch, which as you probably know very well at this point is the largest real-time video platform in the world, and a lot of those gamers are streaming using GeForce and the number of concurrent viewers is really quite amazing. And so, GeForce as a gaming platform has really reached a level that is pretty substantial and my expectation is that this holiday season, this fall is going to be pretty big.","Harlan Sur - J. P. Morgan","Okay, thanks for that Jen-Hsun. And then, Colette, on the OpEx front, I mean obviously the team is certainly delivering to its target of $1.65 billion in OpEx this year and it seems clear that the team is going to continue to drive an OpEx profile that is below your revenue run rate. Any way to just help us quantify OpEx growth versus revenue growth from a longer-term perspective?","Colette Kress","I think we're looking quite nicely at how we've executed over the last three quarters. It's definitely been through a lot of work thinking about how much better we can execute as a company with our overall business groups and working on reallocating investments across. And to look farther, there's continued day to day conversations about where those growth opportunities are on the top line and are we the best positioned at this time with our investments for those.","So right now, I'd like to get through the rest of the fiscal year and I think we'll reassess what does that look like going forward, but I don't have anything at this time to give on a longer-term perspective. But I thank you for recognizing the great work on growing the top line and maintaining a very consistent OpEx base to improve the profitability.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with the Deutsche Bank Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities","Your primary competitor had some issues with channel inventory on their side. It doesn't appear to be impacting you guys at all. But Jen-Hsun, could you give us some color, a little commentary on what you see going on in the channel right now for the GPU business please?","Jen-Hsun Huang","You're going to have to ask them for commentary about their channel inventory. In our case, we've seen spot shortages around the world. We're really super-focused on making sure that GeForce is the world's best gaming platform for PCs. It doesn't mean that, it doesn't mean alone that it has to be \u2013 just being the world's best GPU is not enough. We're surely the best GPU but being the GPU is just the first bar, if you will, for being a great gaming platform. And for us today, GeForce, all of the technology that we put into game-works, all the work that we do with game developers around the world, GeForce Experience which as I mentioned earlier has been installed some 40 million times, has really turned GeForce into one of the largest gaming platforms in the world.","And if you're a gamer and you have GeForce in your system, you can be assured you're going to have a great experience. We're incredibly dedicated to the user experience, we're incredibly dedicated to making sure that every single game works perfectly and works marvellously as it can be in your PC. The amount of dedication that we put into this platform, this living breathing platform that's evolving and changing literally every day, is something that we've really mastered and it's something that has taken us well over a decade to do, and I think people are starting to recognize that.","And as the PC market continues to become the most important gaming platform because of its open nature, you don't pay royalties to proprietary platforms, the installed base is really quite large now as you could imagine, and for most people outside of United States where disposable income is still rather challenging, a PC is necessary for most of them, everything else is a luxury, and so the fact that GeForce is extended inside a PC, on a platform that you already know you need, makes it quite a unique gaming platform.","And so I think the comments that we've made over the years and as you've followed us over the years, we've been consistently dedicated to this game platform and I think it's starting to pay off now.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities","Great, thanks for that. And one is my follow-up for Colette, on the cash return side, you guys are nicely ahead of the $1 billion run rate, so that's working out well. Just wondered, is the ASR now complete, and if so, in the back half of the year to get up to that $1 billion number, is the plan to be much more of an organic day-by-day buyback plan or is there something more that you have in plan for us?","Colette Kress","In the end of Q2, yes, we had completed the outstanding ASR that we began shortly after our Q1 earnings release. In the second half of the year, we are committed to meeting the full-year plan for $1 billion. Breaking that down, the dividend payments are still in the second half of the year, a part of the remaining balance to go, and then the amount of repurchasing as well. We're still assessing what the best method is overall to do that and we'll have something for you at the next earnings call definitely on how we executed within that quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays Capital. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital","Nice results. I was wondering a couple of questions. One, if you could quantify, you mentioned gaming up 10%, how much is that of the overall GPU business? And then if you could talk about if overall ASPs were up in the July quarter as well?","Colette Kress","It's a very good percentage of our overall consumer GPU business and we've talked about that remember our professional workstation GPUs are also in the overall GPU business as well as what we have for the overall datacenter with Tesla and our overall cloud in terms of GRID, but as a percentage of our overall consumer, it is a significant proportion of our overall consumer GPU.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital","Okay. And then I guess if you could just, the ASP trends overall in July and then your expectations into October, you're looking for another step-up in ASPs?","Colette Kress","The ASPs are definitely a lot of different factors in terms of how certain things fell into the channel with certain OEMs or in terms of any just overall add in market. So it's real hard for us to lay out that mix perfectly over that. We believe what we've seen right now is extremely stable, if not from year-over-year, overall increases in our overall average ASPs over that period of time. So we'll get to see what that looks like as we go into the gaming season in the second half of the year, but you are correct that our overall gaming portfolio GPUs do carry overall higher than the average across our overall consumer GPUs.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Blayne, you know what, just to add to that, one of the things that surely everyone is noticing now is that our business is really moving away from being a components business to being much more of a platform business, that's obviously built on top of a processor. Our ASPs for datacenters and for the cloud computing platforms are much, much higher than our ASPs for PCs, not only because the processors themselves are much more complex, because it has to be shared by many people, it's virtualized.","It's designed for datacenter and so the robustness for it, the reliability of it, the quality of it has to be at a level that is able to sustain 24x7 operations. But mostly the reason is because the software stacked on top of it is really complex. Most of our datacenter business, most of our cloud computing business isn't really a software business anymore, it's really about GPU virtualization, it's really about high-performance computing, it's really about the ability to serve accelerated cloud computing.","And so, our ASP profile is going to have to start changing over time. Tracking PC sales and then multiplying that by some ASP is not a logical way to think about our business anymore, because of cloud computing platforms, because increasingly our business is really a platform business. I hope that's helpful.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital","Thanks for that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open. Please proceed with your question.","Matt Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity","In your prepared remarks, there was some mention, and Jen-Hsun, you just mentioned it as well, sort of a longer-term growth in the datacenter for cloud computing and HPC around your GPU and the platform. I'd be interested, it seems like there were some developments relatively recently around your partnerships with other ARM 64-bit vendors maybe versus your own internally developed solutions. Maybe you could give us an update about what the strategy is going forward for attack in that market and is I guess the general purpose compute engine that sits next to your GPU in those applications of paramount importance to you or does your GPU really drives the value?","Jen-Hsun Huang","First of all, I think I've said this before and I continue to believe it and more so every day, that the datacenter and accelerated cloud computing will likely be the largest opportunity that the Company is following today. Our ASPs there are many, many, many times higher than our ASPs in average. The gross margins are obviously a lot higher, primarily because it's a software business.","Now, at the center of that platform strategy is recognizing that datacenters, Internet service providers, cloud service providers, even countries who have their own supercomputing interests, have rather different opinions about what kind of CPUs they use. They don't all want exactly the same instruction set architecture.","What we've done with Tesla is, and what we've done with our GPUs, GRID and Tesla, is established a bit of an ISA-neutral attitude about what datacenters can and cannot use, and we believe that people want to use whatever instruction set architecture they would like to use and we've created the ability to support x86, we support Power with our announcements with IBM, a very deep and quite a broad strategic alliance to bring accelerated computing to the Power platform, and also ARM. Of course we care about ARM. ARM is one of the most pervasive CPU ISAs in the world, it is very accessible, it's available to anybody who would like to build CPUs around them.","And so, our first philosophy is focus on building a platform for accelerated cloud computing, accelerated computing. Our second is to be ISA-neutral, so that Tesla could be a platform that any service provider or any datacenter can build around. And then third, if it makes sense for us to build CPUs for those platforms ourselves, we'll consider doing so, but it kind of goes in that particular order. Is that helpful?","Matt Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity","That's really helpful perspective, thank you. And then as my follow-up for Colette, there's been a lot of conversation on the call here about the progress on capital returns. If you could give us, one question is, an update on the domestic cash balance, and then just going forward after the $1 billion is completed through the year, maybe you could give an update on your longer-term philosophy about capital returns relative to that domestic cash position?","Colette Kress","So we've been pretty clear that when you look at our overall cash balance and our overall cash flow, a good percentage of our cash flow extends from our international operations and the overall revenue that we receive from a good percentage of our business. From time to time, we'll have a little bit of peak in the U.S. in terms of some of the providers that we do business with in the U.S., but I'd say more than the majority, our significant amount of the earnings are earned overseas.","So overall, cash balance about a November year ago, we infused with the overall convertible debt which added $1.5 billion. So right now, outside of the Intel payments as well that come once a year, it's pretty steady and it may grow a little bit from time to time, but I'd say it's just right now at about a steady level.","Secondly, when talking about our overall capital return from a long-term perspective, we are really trying to look at our overall growth this year. We've executed strongly to the $1 billion that we put out for the fiscal year and we're just about half way through that right now, and so we'll continue to look what is the appropriate level for long-term.","As you know, we're executing to return more than 100% of our free cash flow, that you've seen in this quarter and the last quarter. But over the last three years, we've probably been executing on average anywhere from about 70% to 80% of our free cash flow. So, stay tuned, let us get through this year in terms of the $1 billion and we'll look in terms of what the future will lie after we look at that overall cash balance and the options that we can do.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Once again, Mr. Moore, your line is live, please proceed with your question. Alright, moving along, our next question comes from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","David Wong Wells Fargo","To push a bit further on a couple of the earlier questions, your GPU segments that are growing are the higher ASP segments. So year-over-year GPU sales grew 2% but ASPs also rose a fair amount, didn't they? So did your unit shipments for GPUs overall actually declined on a year-over-year basis in June?","Jen-Hsun Huang","I would think so. I would think that it declined a little, and the reason of course has to do with the fact that the consumer PC market overall declined. You know very well that our consumer PC business is a components business and those components' ASPs are rather low and the margins are lower. And although we care about that business very much, components business and volume business does provide scale and it leverages our R&D anyhow, and so we surely appreciate the business, but in the final analysis the consumer PC market was down and I think that the consumer PC market is expected to be more stable now and we'll see how it trends out.","David Wong Wells Fargo","Okay, great. And my other question, what portion of total Tegra sales is Tegra for automotive at the moment, and did your current level of R&D spending have meaningful spending on Tegra for smartphones and tablets or is it, is the Tegra R&D primarily on automotive products?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Our Tegra strategy is really centered around several areas. One is automotive, as you've mentioned, a business that has grown to be quite sizable. I think Colette mentioned earlier that it grew 70% year-over-year. We're expecting the growth to continue for the next several years. The pipeline of projects that we know that we're already working on that will go into production is relatively well understood now.","On the second is gaming. Android is the world's largest computing platform and gaming, we've shortened to computer gaming, and with a great computing platform like Windows, we were able to build a franchise called GeForce on top of it. Our strategy with SHIELD is exactly the same as that, to leverage the Android platform, which is now the world's largest computing platform, and build a gaming platform out of it and we call that SHIELD.","The mobile platform is now extended beyond phones and has gone into tablets, as you know of course, but recently also into television. This fall I'm looking forward to seeing some exciting products for Android TVs and hopefully NVIDIA could be part of some of those.","Our focus is primarily there, the vast majority of our focus, automotive, consoles, if you will, Android TV consoles, gaming, and wherever we can, wherever it makes sense for us, continue to engage with OEMs like Xiaomi and others who are building exciting devices where Tegra could be a differentiator for them, and that's basically our strategy and where we're focusing our R&D.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rajvindra Gill with Needham & Company. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Rajvindra Gill - Needham & Company","Thank you and congrats on the good results. Just given the changing mix of your business, could you maybe talk a little bit about seasonality in the fourth quarter, fiscal fourth quarter and how do you see that relative to kind of historical patterns?","Jen-Hsun Huang","We're talking about fiscal third quarter, but I appreciate it, Raj.","Rajvindra Gill - Needham & Company","No, I mean in general now that the\u2026","Jen-Hsun Huang","We'll talk about fiscal fourth quarter next quarter.","Rajvindra Gill - Needham & Company","No, to just kind of get a sense of kind of how the patterns are changing given the mix of the business, the changing trends of the business.","Jen-Hsun Huang","I appreciate that, I was just kidding. Look, consumer business is still a large part of our business and GeForce for PC gaming is a large part of our business, and for the foreseeable future I expect it to be a large part of our business. Consumer business is important to us because consumers drive a lot of computing technology today and obviously the volumes are much, much higher and it's important to have high-volume business to drive the flywheel of R&D.","And so I appreciate the seasonality, GeForce is going to benefit from that in the third and fourth quarter, but increasing over time \u2013 and one of the things you're highlighting here is that our datacenter business, our cloud computing business, our high-performance computing business are not affected by those kind of seasonality, people buy those platforms when they need those platforms, and the dynamic trends of those businesses are several.","One, the more mobile devices in the world, the more pictures people take, the more videos they upload, the more they talk into their phones for search, more of those applications, those consumer applications are going to be accelerated by GPU in the cloud. And so those are great opportunities for us and I think it's pretty clear now the dynamic trends of consumer generated media, as it's censored to cloud, shared and processed and otherwise, is growing I guess at least exponentially and I think that that's one of the dynamics, major dynamics driving our GPU success in the cloud.","And then the second has to do with the fact that more and more of companies are using high-performance computing to drive their business. Some companies call it big data analytics, some you then refer to machine learning to understand what is happening to the dynamics of their business. High-performance computing is more is more important in enterprise than ever.","Those two dynamic trends \u2013 and then maybe if I could just add the last one, is enterprise virtualization. Our GPUs on GRID makes it possible for you to virtualize your enterprise beyond the walls of the datacenter and all the way out to the fringe where the clients are. We could virtualize very, very compute intensive PC applications for the very first time.","And so these three dynamics are really important to the future of our datacenter and cloud business, and as those continue to grow, our business will become increasingly less seasonal, if you will.","Rajvindra Gill - Needham & Company","That was helpful. And just my follow-up, to your point about the enterprise and the virtualization that you're seeing there, your design engagements with GRID are accelerating pretty rapidly and that appears to continue as the enterprises begin to realize the leverage that they can get from cloud-based visual computing. You talked in the past about the installed base being around over 500 million units. Can you talk a little bit about how systematically you're going to be able to kind of convert that installed base to a virtualized platform?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Good question. The most important partners, number one, starts with the hypervisor companies, the companies that build the core of virtualization. Of course VMware is a very important part of that, Microsoft is, Citrix is. I think it was at GTC, I guess it's in May, VMware was on stage with me to announce that they were adopting GRID, integrating GRID into ESX, and enabling virtual GPUs for their hypervisor stack. I'm anxiously waiting for them to go to beta, and so let's watch this space. I think that that has probably the single greatest near-term turbocharger to the GRID business.","Beyond that, the ecosystem partners that we will go to market with are all the OEMs. They have the largest sales forces in the world and they are engaging enterprises from financial services to government to education to industry, and those sales forces are being trained on a constant basis and enabling OEMs to be able to take GRID to market as a very big part of the overall strategy.","We now have every single OEM in the world supporting us. There are some 70, 80 servers that have been certified and qualified for GRID. OEMs from HP and Dell and IBM and Cisco and Hitachi and Fujitsu and just every OEM in every corner of the world has been enthusiastic supporters of GRID, and partnering with VMware and partnering with Citrix and partnering with Microsoft over time, that's how we're going to convert and virtualize all of the enterprises around the world.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets","Congratulations on the strong results. If I could, Jen-Hsun, dig into GRID just a little bit more, in the past you guys gave out a number for the number of engagements that you were tracking. I believe last quarter it was 600. Just to have a like-for-like, what is that number this quarter?","Jen-Hsun Huang","We stopped mentioning it because the numbers were getting kind of large and maybe we just got kind of bored talking about it, but it's almost 1,000, Doug. I appreciate you asking.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets","Terrific, that's great to hear. If I could, one of the areas that I believe one of your competitors hit a speed bump on was the fact that GPUs were being used for cryptocurrency algorithms. Is this a market that you view as something that NVIDIA should be servicing, are you targeting your products at that and is it something that we should take into our thinking?","Jen-Hsun Huang","There are several things about that event that's really interesting. First, the fact that you could run an arbitrary and newly developed cryptocurrency algorithm on a GPU says something about the programmability of a GPU now. That's one of the things that \u2013 of course cryptology, cryptography is very important, of course encryption and decryption for security long-term will be very important, and GPUs will increasingly become important in the development of those algorithms.","However, we really didn't benefit very much from people who were doing I guess bitcoin mining, and the reason for that is because if it's just one application, if it's somebody who is using that one application, they don't really care about the gaming experience, they didn't buy the platform for gaming, they didn't buy the platform for workstations or design, I would say that NVIDIA GPUs are not the most performance per dollar efficient in the market.","As a component, if you will, as a commodity component, we're not the most competitive in that they. And maybe that was a blessing, maybe it wasn't, but I think in the final analysis I don't think we were particularly the best choice for somebody who would like to bitcoin mine. When they were done, they resold the graphics cards in the marketplace, and I guess in a lot of ways I'm kind of happy that that didn't happen to us.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, great, I appreciate the color there. My last one for you is really having to do with sort of the structure of the Company. You've been reliant on a single source for your foundry since inception. You're pretty much at a scale now that might make you say, we really should have a second source supplier here. Is there some sort of a catalyst that makes you or some level at which you feel you really do need to bring on a second supplier of wafers?","Jen-Hsun Huang","We look at every foundry that's available in the world and there aren't that many that is competitive enough to be able to earn our business. So we competitively look at every single opportunity every single time. We've been fortunate to partner with GSMC for a very long time, they are a fantastic, fantastic partner, they continue to be, and quite frankly we've been well-served by that partnership. But we look at the competitive landscape on a node by node basis. And so, we have our eyes wide open and we keep all of our partners as competitive as they can be.","Chris Evenden","Thanks, Doug.

I'll now turn the call over to Simona Jankowski, Vice President of Investor Relations, to begin your conference.","Simona Jankowski - NVIDIA Corp.","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to NVIDIA's conference call for the first quarter of fiscal 2019. With me on the call today from NVIDIA are Jensen Huang, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Colette Kress, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","I'd like to remind you that our call is being webcast live on NVIDIA's Investor Relations website.

Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements.","During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO Commentary, which is posted on our website.","With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.","Colette M. Kress - NVIDIA Corp.","Thanks, Simona. We had an excellent quarter with growth across all our platforms led by gaming and datacenter. Q1 revenue reached a record $3.21 billion, up 66% year-over-year, up 10% sequentially and above our outlook of $2.9 billion. Once again, all measures of profitability set records, with GAAP gross margins at 64.5%, operating margins at 40.4% and net income at $1.24 billion.","From a reporting segment perspective, Q1 GPU revenue grew 77% from last year to $2.77 billion. Tegra Processor revenue rose 33% to $442 million.","Let's start with our gaming business. Revenue was $1.72 billion, up 68% year-on-year and down 1% sequentially. Demand was strong and broad-based across regions and products. The gaming market remains robust and the popular Battle Royale genre is attracting a new wave of gamers to the GeForce platform.","We also continue to see demand from upgrades with about 35% of our installed base currently on our Pascal architecture. The launch of popular titles, like Far Cry 5 and Final Fantasy XV continued to drive excitement in the quarter.","Gamers are increasingly engaging in social gameplay and gaming is rapidly becoming a spectator sport, while the production value of games continues to increase. This dynamic is fueling a virtuous cycle that expands the universe of gamers and drives a mix shift to higher end GPUs.","At the recent Game Developers Conference, we announced our real-time ray tracing technology, NVIDIA RTX. Ray tracing is movie quality rendering technique that delivers lifelike lighting, reflections and shadows. This has long been considered the holy grail of graphics, and we've been working on it for over 10 years.","We look forward to seeing amazing, cinematic games that take advantage of this technology come to the market later this year, with the pipeline building into next year and beyond. And we expect RTX, as well as other new technologies like 4K and virtual reality, to continue driving gamers' requirements for higher GPU performance.","While supply was tight earlier in the quarter, the situation is now easing. As a result, we were pleased to see that channel prices for our GPUs are beginning to normalize, allowing gamers who had been priced out of the market last quarter to get their hands on the new GeForce GTX at a reasonable price.","Cryptocurrency demand was again stronger than expected, but we were able to fulfill most of it with crypto-specific GPUs, which are included in our OEM business at $289 million. As a result, we could protect the vast majority of our limited gaming GPU supply for use by gamers. Looking into Q2, we expect crypto-specific revenue to be about one-third of its Q1 level.","Gaming notebooks also grew well, driven by an increasing number of thin and light notebooks based on our Max-Q design. And Nintendo Switch contributed strongly to year-on-year growth, reflecting that platform's continued success.","Moving to datacenter, we had another phenomenal quarter with revenue of $701 million, up 71% year-on-year, up 16% sequentially. Demand was strong in all market segments and customers increasingly embraced our GPUs and CUDA platform for high-performance computing and AI. Adoption of our Volta architecture remained strong across a wide range of verticals and customers.","In the public cloud segment, Microsoft Azure announced general availability of Tesla V100 instances joining Amazon, IBM and Oracle. And Google Cloud announced that the V100 is now publicly available in beta. Many other hyperscale and consumer Internet companies also continued their ramp of Volta, which delivers five times the deep learning performance of its predecessor, Pascal.","Volta has been chosen by every major cloud provider and server maker, reinforcing our leadership in AI deep learning.","In high-performance computing, strength from the broad enterprise vertical more than offset the ramp down of major supercomputing projects such as the U.S. Department of Energy's Summit system. We see a strong pipeline across a number of vertical industries, from manufacturing to oil and gas, which should help sustain the trajectory of high-performance computing next quarter and beyond.","Traction is also increasing in AI inference. Inference GPU shipments to cloud service providers more than doubled from last quarter. And our pipeline is growing into next quarter. We dramatically increased our inference capabilities with the announcement of the TensorRT 4 AI inference accelerator software at our recent GPU Technology Conference in San Jose.","TensorRT 4 accelerates deep learning inference up to 190 times faster than CPUs for common applications, such as computer vision, neural machine translation, automatic speech recognition, speech synthesis and recommendation systems. It also dramatically expands the use cases prepared with the prior version. With TensorRT 4, NVIDIA's market reach has expanded to approximately 30 million hyperscale servers worldwide.","At GTC, we also announced other major advancements in our deep learning platform. We doubled the memory of Tesla V100 to 32 GB VRAM, which is a key enabler for customers building virtual networks for larger data sets. And we announced a new GPU interconnect fabric called NVIDIA NVSwitch, which joins up to 16 V100 GPUs at a speed of 2.4 terabytes per second or five times faster than the best PCIe switch.","We also announced our DGX-2 system, which leverages these new technologies and is updated, fully optimized software stack to deliver a 10x performance boost beyond last year's DGX. DGX-2 is the first single-server capable of delivering 2 petaflops of computational power. We are seeing strong interest from both hyperscale and enterprise customers and we look forward to bringing this technology to cloud customers later this year.","At our Investor Day in March, we updated our forecast for the datacenter addressable market. We see the datacenter opportunity as very large, fueled by growing demand for accelerated computing in applications ranging from AI to high performance computing across multiple market segments and vertical industries. We estimate the TAM at $50 billion by 2023, which extends our previous forecast of $30 billion by 2020.","We see strong momentum in the adoption of our accelerated computing platform and the expansion of our development ecosystem to serve this rapidly growing market. About 8,500 attendees registered for GTC, up 18% from last year. CUDA downloads have continued to grow, setting a fresh record in the quarter. And our total number of developers is well over 850,000, up 72% from last year.","Moving to pro visualization, revenue grew to $251 million, up 22% from a year ago and accelerating from last quarter, driven by demand for real-time rendering, as well as emerging applications like AI and VR. Strength extended across several key industries, including public sector, healthcare and retail.","Key wins in the quarter included Columbia University, using high-end Quadro GPUs for AI, and Siemens, using them for CT and ultrasound solutions. At GTC, we announced the Quadro GV100 GPU with NVIDIA RTX technology, capable of delivering real-time ray tracing to the more than 25 million artists and designers throughout the world.","RTX makes computational intensive ray tracing possible in real time, when running professional design and content creation applications. This allows media and entertainment professionals to see and interact with their creations with correct light and shadows and do complex renders up to 10 times faster than a CPU alone.","And the NVIDIA OptiX AI denoiser built into RTX delivers almost 100 times the performance of CPUs for real-time noise-free rendering. This enables customers to replace racks of servers in traditional render farms with GPU servers at one-fifth the cost, one-seventh the space and one-seventh the power.","Lastly, automotive. Revenue grew 4% year-on-year to a record $145 million. This reflects the ongoing transition from our infotainment business to our growing autonomous vehicle development and production opportunities around the globe. At GTC and Investor Day, we made key product announcements on the advancement of autonomous vehicles and established a total addressable market opportunity of $60 billion by 2035.","We believe that every vehicle will be autonomous one day. By 2035, this will encompass 100 million autonomous passenger vehicles and 10 million robo taxis.","We also introduced NVIDIA DRIVE Constellation, a platform that will help car companies, carmakers, Tier 1 suppliers and others developing autonomous vehicle test and validate their systems in a virtual world across a wide range of scenarios before deploying on the road.","Each year, 10 trillion miles are driven around the world. Even if test cars can eventually cover millions of miles, that's an insignificant fraction of all the scenarios that require testing to create a safe and reliable autonomous vehicle.","DRIVE Constellation addresses this challenge by enabling cars to safely drive billions of miles in virtual reality.","The platform has two different servers. The first is loaded with GPUs and simulates the environment that the car is driving in, as in a hyper real video game.","The second contains the NVIDIA DRIVE Pegasus autonomous vehicle computer, which possesses the simulated data, as if it were coming from the sensors of a car driving on the road. Real-time driving command from the DRIVE Pegasus are fed back to the simulation for true hardware-in-the-loop verification.","Constellation will enable autonomous vehicle industry for safety test and validate their AI self-driving systems in ways that are not practical or possible with on-road testing.","We also extended our product roadmap to include our next-generation DRIVE autonomous vehicle computer.","We have created a scalable AI car platform that spans the entire range of autonomous driving, from traffic jams, pilots, to level 5 robo taxis. More than 370 companies and research institutions are now using NVIDIA's automotive platform. With this growing momentum, we remain excited about the intermediate and long-term opportunities for our autonomous driving business.","Now moving to the rest of the P&L, Q1 GAAP gross margins were 64.5% and non-GAAP was 64.7%, records that reflect continued growth in our value added platforms. GAAP operating expenses were $773 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $648 million, up 25% year-on-year.","We continue to invest in key platforms driving our long-term growth, including gaming, AI and automotive. GAAP net income was a record $1.24 billion and EPS was $1.98, up 45% (sic) [145%] (15:33) and 151% respectively from a year earlier. Some of the upside was driven by a tax rate of 5% compared to our guidance of 12%. Non-GAAP net income was $1.29 billion and EPS was $2.05, both up 141% from a year ago, reflecting the revenue strength as well as gross margins and operating margin expansion and slightly lower tax.","Our quarterly cash flow from operations reached record levels at $1.45 billion. Capital expenditures were $118 million.","With that, let me turn to the outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2019. We expect revenue to be $3.1 billion plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 63.6% (sic) [63.3%] (16:26) and 63.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points.","GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $810 million and $685 million, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP OI&E are both expected to be income of approximately $15 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 11%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $130 million to $150 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO Commentary and other information available on our IR website.","In closing, I'd like to highlight a few upcoming events for the financial community. We'll be presenting at the JPMorgan Technology Conference next week on May 15 and at the Bank of America Global Technology Conference on June 5. We will also hold our Annual Meeting of Stockholders online on May 16.","We will now open the call for questions. Simona and I are here in Santa Clara and Jensen is dialing in from the road. Operator, would you please poll for questions? Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question is from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.","Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. First, I had a question on gaming seasonality. It's usually down pretty decently in Q1. It was obviously flat this time as you were trying to fill up the channel. Now that's done. I was just wondering what the supply demand dynamics as well as like any thoughts on crypto might mean for typical \u2013 the seasonality into Q2 versus what would be typical where it would usually be down \u2013 or usually be up pretty decently. How are you looking at it? And this is a question for Colette.","Colette M. Kress - NVIDIA Corp.","Jensen, why don't you start on the question for Stacy and I'll follow-up afterwards after you speak.","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","Okay. Hi Stacy, so let's see. Q1, as you probably know, Fortnite and PUBG are global phenomenons (sic) [phenomena] (18:51). The success of Fortnite and PUBG are just beyond comprehension, really. Those two games are a combination of Hunger Games and Survivor has just captured imaginations of gamers all over the world. And we saw the uptick and we saw the demand on GPUs from all over the world.","Surely, there was scarcity as you know. Crypto miners bought a lot of our GPUs during the quarter and it drove prices up. And I think that a lot of the gamers weren't able to buy into the new GeForce as a result. And so we're starting to see the prices come down. We monitor spot pricing every single day around the world. And the prices are starting to normalize. It's still higher than where they should be. And so obviously, the demand is still quite strong out there.","But my sense is that there's a fair amount of pent-up demand still. Fortnite is still growing in popularity. PUBG is doing great. And then we've got some amazing titles coming out. And so my sense is that the overall gaming market is just really, is super healthy. And our job is to make sure that we work as hard as we can to get supply out into the marketplace. And hopefully, by doing that, the pricing will normalize and the gamers can buy into their favorite graphics card at a price that we hope they can get it at. And so I think there's a fair \u2013 I mean the simple answer to your question is Fortnite and PUBG. And the demand is just really great. They did a great job.","Operator","Your next question is from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.","Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I wonder \u2013 Colette had talked about the inference doubling in sales quarter-over-quarter with cloud. Can you just talk about where you're seeing the early applications for inference? Is that sort of as-a-service business or are you looking at internal cloud workloads? And just any color you can give us on where you guys are sitting in the inference space. Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","Sure hi Joe. So as you know, there are 30 million servers around the world. And they were put in place during the time when the world didn't have deep learning. And now with deep learning and with machine learning approaches, the accuracy of prediction, the accuracy of recommendation has jumped so much that just about every Internet service provider in the world that has a lot of different customers and consumers are jumping onto this new software approach. And in order to take this neural network \u2013 and the software that's written by deep learning in these frameworks are massive software. The way to think about these deep neural nets is it has millions and millions and millions of parameters in it and these networks are getting larger every year. And they're enormously complex. And the output of these neural nets have to be optimized for the computing platform that it targets.","How you would optimize the neural network for a CPU or a GPU is very, very different. And how you optimize for different neural networks, whether it's image recognition, speech recognition, natural language translation, recommendation systems, all of these networks have different architectures and an optimizing compiler that's necessary to make the neural network run smoothly and fast is incredibly complex.","And so that's why we created TensorRT. That's what TensorRT is. TensorRT is an optimizing graph neural network compiler. And it optimizes for each one of our platforms. And even each one of our platforms has very different architectures. For example, we invented recently \u2013 reinvented the GPU and it's called the Tensor Core GPU, and the first of its kind is called Volta. And so TensorRT 4.0 now supports, in addition to image recognition, all of the different types of neural network models.","The answer to your question is internal consumption. Internal consumption is going to be the first users. Video recognition, detecting for inappropriate video for example all over the world, making recommendations from the videos that you search or the images that you're uploading. All of these types of applications are going to require enormous amount of computation.","Operator","Next question is from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on the strong growth and the consistent execution. Jensen, I have two questions about the datacenter, one, from a growth and the second from a competition perspective. So from the growth side, you guys are doing about, say, $3 billion or so annualized but you have outlined a market that could be $50 billion. What needs to happen for the next inflection? Is it something in the market that needs to change? Is it something in the product set that needs to? How do you grow and address that $50 billion market, right, because you have only a few percent penetrated today in that large market. So what needs to change for the next inflection point?","And then on the competition side, as you are looking at that big market, how should we think about competition that is coming from some of your cloud customers, like a Google announcing a TPU 3.0 or perhaps others looking at other competing technologies? So any color on both sort of how you look at growth and competition would be very helpful. Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","Thanks, Vivek. First of all, at its core, this is something we all know now, that CPU scaling has really slowed. And if you think about the several hundred billion dollars worth of computer equipment that's been installed in the cloud, in datacenters all over the world, and as these applications for machine learning and high-performance computing approaches come along, the world needs a solution. CPU scaling has slowed.","And so here is the approach that we pioneered a decade and a half ago called GPU computing. And we've been determined to continue to advance it during this time because we saw this day coming and we really believe that it was going to end. I mean, you can't deny physics. And so we find ourselves in a great position today.","And as Colette already mentioned, we have something close to 1 million developers on this platform now. It is incredibly fast, speeding up CPUs by 10, 20, 50, 100 times, 200 times sometimes depending on the algorithm. It's everywhere. The software ecosystem is just super rich. And as Colette mentioned, there's already almost 1 million developers around the world that's grown 70% year-over-year. And so I think at the core, it's about the fact that the world needs a computing approach going forward.","With respect to our ability to address the TAM, there are three major segments. There's more than that, but there's three major segments. One is of course training for deep learning. The other is inferencing and TRT 4 is intended to do just that to expand our ability to address all of the different types of algorithms, machine learning algorithms that are running in the datacenters.","The third is high-performance computing and that's molecular dynamics, to medical imaging, to earth sciences, to energy sciences. The type of algorithms that are being run in supercomputers all over the world is expanding. And we're doing more and more of our product designs in virtual reality. We want to simulate our products and simulate its capabilities in simulation in this computer rather than build it in the beginning. And then the last category would be graphics virtualization.","We've taken with GRID and our Quadro Virtual Workstation and now with NVIDIA RTX, we turned the datacenter into a powerful graphics supercomputer. And so these are the various applications and segments of datacenter that we see. I think in the case of training, we're limited by the number of deep learning experts in the world.","And that's growing very quickly. The frameworks are making it easier. There's a lot more open source and open documentation on sharing of knowledge. And so the number of AI engineers around the world is growing super fast. The second is inference. And I've already talked about that. It's really limited by our optimizing compilers and how we can target these neural network models to run our processors. And if we could do so, we're going to save our customers enormous amounts of money.","We speed up applications. We speed up these neural network models 50 times, 100 times, 200 times over a CPU. And so the more GPUs they buy, the more they're going to save. And high-performance computing, the way to think about that is, I think, at this point, it's very clear that going forward, supercomputers are going to get built with accelerators in them. And because of our long-term dedication to CUDA and our GPUs for acceleration of all these codes and the nurturing of the ecosystem, I think that we're going to do super well in the supercomputing world. And so these are the different verticals.","With respect to competition, it all starts with the core. And the core is that the CPU scaling has slowed. And so the world needs another approach going forward. And surely because of our focus on it, we find ourselves in a great position. Google announced TPU 3.0 and it's still behind our Tensor Core GPU. Our Volta is our first generation of a newly reinvented approach of doing GPUs. It's called Tensor Core GPUs. And we're far ahead of the competition and \u2013 but more than that, it's programmable. It's not one function. It's programmable.","Not only is it faster, it's also more flexible. And as a result of the flexibility, developers could use it in all kinds of applications, whether it's medical imaging or weather simulations or deep learning or computer graphics. And as a result, our GPUs are available in every cloud and every datacenter, everywhere on the planet and which developers need so that \u2013 accessibility, so that they could develop their software.","And so I think that on the one hand, it's too simplistic to compare a TPU to just one of the many features that's in our Tensor Core GPU. But even if you did, we're faster. We support more frameworks. We support all neural networks.","And as a result, if you look at GitHub, there are some 60,000 different neural network research papers that are posted that runs on NVIDIA GPUs. And it's just a handful for the second alternative. And so I'd just kind of gave you a sense of the reach and the capabilities of our GPUs.","Operator","Your next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you so much. Jensen, I had a question regarding your decision to pull the plug on your GeForce Partner Program. I think most of us read your blog from last Friday. I think it was, so we understand the basic background. But if you can describe what led to this decision and perhaps talk a little bit about the potential implications, if any, in terms of your ability to compete or gain share. That will be really helpful. Thank you so much.","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","Yeah. Thanks for your question, Toshiya. At the core, the program was about making sure that gamers who buy graphics cards knows exactly the GPU brand that's inside. And the reason for that is because, we want gamers to \u2013 the gaming experience of a graphics card depends so much on the GPU that is chosen.","And we felt that using one gaming brand, a graphics card brand, and interchanging the GPU underneath causes it to be less \u2013 causes it to be more opaque and less transparent for gamers to choose the GPU brand that they wanted. And most of the ecosystem loved it. And some of the people really disliked it.","And so instead of all that distraction, we're doing so well. And we're going to continue to help the gamers choose the graphics cards, like we always have, and things will sort out. And so we decided to pull the plug because the distraction was unnecessary and we have too much good stuff to go do.","Operator","Next question is from C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI.","Sajal Dogra - Evercore ISI","Hi. This is Sajal Dogra calling in for C.J. Muse. Thank you for taking my question. So I had a question on HPC. TSMC, on their recent call, raised their accelerator attach rate forecast in HPC to 50% from mid-teens. So I would love to get further details on what exactly NVIDIA is doing to software services, et cetera, that's kind of creating this competitive positioning in HPC and AI basically. And then, if I could ask a follow-up basically in benchmarks. So, there's been some news on AI benchmarks whether it's Stanford DAWNBench et cetera. So I would love to get your thoughts on A, the current state of benchmarks for AI workloads and B, your relative positioning of ASICs versus GPUs especially as we move towards newer neural networks like RN and GAN, et cetera. Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","Yeah, thanks for the question. Well, HPC. First of all, at the core, CPU scaling has stalled and it's reached the limits of physics. And the world needs another approach to go forward. We created the GPU computing approach a decade and half ago. And I think at this point, with the number developers jumping on, the number of applications that's emerging, it's really clear that the future of HPC has accelerated. And our GPU approach, because of its flexibility, because of its performance, because of the value that we create that as a result of the throughput of a datacenter, we save people so much money just in cables alone, often times, more than pays for the GPUs that they buy. And the reason for that is because the number of servers reduced dramatically. And so I think the future of HPC is about acceleration and the NVIDIA CUDA GPUs are really in a great position to serve this vacuum that's been created.","With respect to benchmarks, you might have seen that earlier this week, we released three speed records: the fastest single GPU, the fastest single computer node, a definition of a computer node is something that fits in a box that runs one operating system, one node; and one instance, one cloud instance. We now have the fastest speed record for one GPU, one node, and one instance.","And so we love benchmarks. Nothing is more joyful than having a benchmark to demonstrate your leadership position. And in the world of deep learning, the number of networks is just growing so fast, because the number of different applications that deep learning is able to solve is really huge. And so you need a lot of software capability and the versatility of your platform needs to be great.","We also have a lot of expertise in the company in software. I mean, NVIDIA is really a full stack computing company, from architecture, to system software, to algorithms, to applications. We have a great deal of expertise across the entire stack. And so we love these complicated benchmarking \u2013 benchmarks that are out there. And I think this is a great way for us to simplify our leadership position.","I think long-term, the number of networks that are going to emerge will continue to grow. And so the flexibility of ASICs is going to be its greatest downfall. And if someone were to create a general-purpose parallel accelerating processor like ours and had it designed to be incredibly good at deep learning, like recently what we did with our Tensor Core GPU, which is a reinvented GPU, and Volta is the first one, it's going to be hard. It's going to be expensive. And we've been doing it a very long time. And so I think this is a \u2013 it's a great time for us.","Operator","Next question is from Blayne Curtis with Barclays.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks for taking my question. Jensen, maybe \u2013 I wanted to ask on inference side about edge inference and beyond autos when you look at sizing that TAM, what are the other big areas that you think you can penetrate with GPUs in edge inference besides autos?","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","Yeah, Blayne. The largest inference opportunity for us is actually in the cloud and the datacenter. That's the first great opportunity. And the reason for that is there's just an explosion in the number of different types of neural networks that are available. They're image recognition, there's video sequencing, there's video, there's recommender systems, there's speech recognition, speech synthesis, natural language understanding.","There are just so many different types of neural networks that are being created. And creating one ASIC that can be adapted to all of these different types of networks is just a real challenge. And by the time that you create such a thing, it's called a Tensor Core GPU, which is what we created. And so I think that the first opportunity for us in large-scale opportunity will be in the datacenter and the cloud.","The second will be in vertical markets. The vertical market that you mentioned is self-driving cars. And we see a great opportunity in autonomous vehicles, both in the creation of autonomous vehicles. And I mentioned that before, between now and the time that we ramp our AV computers we call DRIVE, we're going to be selling a whole lot of servers, so that the companies could develop their neural network models for their self-driving cars, as well as simulating in virtual reality their various test drives, as well as testing their neural network and their self-driving car stack against billions and billions of miles of saved up pre-recorded videos.","And so in the vertical markets, we're going to see inference both in the datacenter for developing the self-driving car stack as well as in the self-driving cars themselves. Now, in the self-driving cars, the ASPs for Level 2 could be a few hundred dollars to a Level 5 self-driving car, taxi or driverless taxi being a few thousand dollars.","And I expect that driverless taxis will start going to market about 2019 and self-driving cars probably somewhere between 2020 and 2021.","And I think the size of the market is fairly well modeled. And the simple way to think about that is I believe that every single \u2013 everything that moves someday will be autonomous or have autonomous capabilities.","And so the 100 million cars, the countless taxis, all the trucks, all the agriculture equipment, all the pizza delivery vehicles, you name it. Everything is going to be autonomous. And the market opportunity is going to be quite large. And that's the reason why we're so determined to go create that market.","Operator","Your next question is from Tim Arcuri with UBS.","Timothy Arcuri - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. I actually wanted to go back to the question about seasonality for gaming in June. Normal seasonal sounds like it's up mid-teens for June in gaming. But obviously, the comps are skewed a little bit because of the channel restock and the crypto stuff. So does the guidance for June assume that gaming is better or worse than that mid-teens normal seasonal? Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","We're expecting Q2 to be better than seasonality, if I understand your question. We're expecting Q2 to be better than Q1. And we're expecting Q2 to be better than seasonality. Did that answer your question?","Operator","Your next question is from Atif Malik with Citi.","Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking my question and good job on the results. And I'd have a question for Colette. Colette, first thank you for breaking out crypto sales in the OEM line and guide for us. I have a question on your gross margins. Your gross margins have been expanding on product mix, despite component pricing headwinds on the DRAM side. When do you expect component pricing to become a tailwind to your gross margins?","Colette M. Kress - NVIDIA Corp.","Thanks so much for the question. When you think about our gross margins, just over this last quarter, as you know, we were working on stabilizing the overall supply that was out there in the market for consumer GPUs.","We benefited from that with a higher gross margin as we filled and completed that. You've seen us absorb a significant amount of the component pricing changes that we have seen, particularly around the memory. We're not here to be able to forecast generally when those pricing of those components will stabilize.","But we believe in terms of the value added that our platforms provide, the components are an important part of finishing that. But I think we have tremendous amount more value that we are adding in terms of the software on top of our platforms, which is enabling our gross margins.","Operator","Your next question is from Chris Caso with Raymond James.","Chris Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yes, hi. Thanks for taking the question. My question is the progress on the deployment of Volta into the cloud service providers. You talked in your prepared remarks about the five deployments, including the Google beta. Can you talk about how soon we can expect to see some of those remaining deployments? And of those already launched, how far are they along? I guess, to say proverbially, what inning are we in, in these deployments?","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","Yes. So first of all, Volta is a reinvented GPU. Volta is the world's first GPU that has been designed to be incredibly good at deep learning. We call it the Tensor Core GPU.","It still retained all of the flexibilities of all \u2013 everything that CUDA has ever run is backwards compatible, with everything that runs on CUDA. But it has new architectures designed to be incredibly good at deep learning. We call it a Tensor Core GPU. And that's the reason why it has all of the benefits of our GPU but none of the ASICs can catch up to it. And so Volta is really a breakthrough.","We're going to be very successful with Volta. Every cloud will have it. The initial deployment is for internal consumption. Volta has been shipping to the cloud providers, the Internet service companies for the vast majority of last quarter, as you guys know. And they're using it internally. And now they're starting to open up Volta for external consumption of their cloud customers. And they are moving as fast as they can. My expectation is that you're going to see a lot more coming online this quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","Hi, thanks for taking my question. I had a question about the DGX family of products. Our own fieldwork is indicating very positive reception for DGX. And I was wondering, Jensen, if can you help us understand, the high-growth we've seen in the datacenter business, to what extent is that being driven by the DGX. And when DGX-2 starts to ramp in the back half of the year, is this something that kind of layers on top of DGX \u2013 does DGX-2 layer on top of DGX, are they going after different segments and you're kind of segmenting the market with these two different products? Any color on how to think about those two products would be helpful. Thank you","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","Hey Colette, could you give me a brief version of that? It was kind of crackling on my side.","Colette M.

Can you hear me better now?","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","Yeah, much better, Mark.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","Okay, sorry about that, I'm at the airport. So the question was on the DGX family of products. Our own fieldwork indicates a very positive reception. I was wondering Jensen, if you could help us understand the high-growth you've seen in the datacenter market how much is DGX contributing to that. And then when DGX-2 starts to ramp in the second half of the year, how do we think about DGX-1? Does it replace the DGX \u2013 the original DGX, or going after different segments, or do they layer on top of one another? Any color on that would be helpful. Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","I see. Thank you. DGX-2 and DGX-1 will both be in the market at the same time. And DGX is a few hundred million dollar business. It was introduced last year. So its growth rate is obviously very high. It's designed for enterprises where they don't \u2013 they need to have their computers on-premise, but they don't want to build a supercomputer. And they don't have the expertise to do so.","And they would like to pull a supercomputer out of a box, plug it in and start doing supercomputing. And so DGX is really designed for enterprises. It's designed for car companies; it's designed for healthcare companies doing life sciences work or medical imaging work. We recently announced a project called Project Clara, which basically takes medical imaging equipment, virtualizes them, containerizes the software and turns it into a \u2013 and most medical imaging equipment today are computational and they \u2013 a lot of them run on NVIDIA CUDA anyways.","We can put that into the datacenter, we can virtualize their medical instruments and it gives them the opportunity to upgrade the millions of instruments that are out in the marketplace today. And so DGX is really designed for enterprises and we're seeing great success there. It's really super easy to use and it comes with direct support from HPC and AI researchers at NVIDIA. And the answer to your question at the end is both of them will be in the marketplace at the same time.","Operator","Next question is from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets.","Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey guys. I'm actually going to go to a more nitty-gritty question just on the financial side, just to make sure I'm understanding this right. So the OEM beat was pretty material given a lot of crypto revenue. Is it still the case that OEM is materially lower gross margin than your corporate average at this time?","Colette M. Kress - NVIDIA Corp.","Sure, I'll take that question. Generally, our OEM business can be a little bit volatile. Because remember, OEM business incorporates our mainstream GPUs as well as our Tegra integrated.","So we have development platforms that we sell on some of the Tegra piece of it.

So your competitor thinks that just 10% of their sales were from crypto or like $150 million, $160 million. And you guys did almost $300 million there. And perhaps I think there could actually be some in gaming as well, which would imply that you guys have two-thirds or more of that market?","So I guess what's going on there? Is there a pricing dynamic that's allowing you to have such share there, or do you think it's your competitors that don't know what's actually being sold to miners versus gamers? Why such implied share in that market? Thanks.","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","Well, we try to as transparently review our numbers as best we can. Our strategy is to create a SKU that allows the crypto miners to fulfill their needs and we call it CMP. And to be \u2013 as much as possible, fulfill their demand that way.","Sometimes, it's just not possible because the demand is too great but we try to do so. And we try to keep the miners on the CMP SKUs as much as we can.

Riley FBR, Inc.","Thanks for sneaking me in and congratulations on all the financial records in the quarter. Jensen, I just wanted to come back to an announcement that you made at GTC with ray tracing. Because the technology looked like it was very high fidelity and I think you noted at that time that it was very computationally intensive. So the question is as we think about the gaming business and the potential for ray tracing to enter that platform group, what does it mean for dynamics that we've seen in the past, for example, the ability to really push the high end of the market with high end capability, 1070 Ti launched late last year, it was very successful. Does this give you further flexibility for those types of launches as you bring exciting and very high end technology to market? Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","Yeah, I appreciate it. NVIDIA RTX is the biggest computer graphics invention in the last 15 years. It took us a decade to do. We literally worked on it continuously for one decade. And to put it into perspective, it's basically film rendering, cinematic rendering except it's in real time.","It merges the style of computer graphics, rasterization, and light simulation, what people call ray tracing as well as deep learning and AI, merged it into one unified framework, so that we can achieve cinematic rendering in real time.","What it currently takes is a server about a few hours, depending on the scene, it might take as long as a full day, take a few hours to render one frame.","So it takes a server, one node of a server, several hours to render one frame. And in order to render 30 frames per second, just imagine the number of servers you need. If you take several hours per frame and you need to render 30 frames per second in order to be real-time, it basically takes a high-performance computer, a supercomputer, a render farm, that's why they call it a render farm, it's a full datacenter designed just for rendering.","And now we've created NVIDIA RTX which makes it possible to do in real time. We demonstrated RTX on four Quadro GV100s. It takes four of our latest generation Volta Tensor Core GPUs to be able to render 30 frames per second, the Star Wars cinematic that people enjoyed. And so the amount that we saved, we basically took an entire datacenter and reduced it into one node. And we're now doing it in real time.","And so the amount of money that we can save, people who create movies, people who do commercials, people who use film rendering to create the game content, almost every single game is done that way. There's quite a bit of offline rendering to create the imagery and the textures and the lighting. And then there are of course, architectural design and car design, the number of applications, the number of industries that are built on top of modern computer graphics is really quite large. And I'm certain that NVIDIA RTX is going to impact every single one of them.","And so that's our starting point, is to dramatically reduce the cost of film rendering, dramatically reduce the time that it takes to do it and hopefully, more GPU servers will be purchased. And of course, better content will be created. Long-term, we've also now plotted the path towards doing it in real time. And someday, we will be able to put RTX into a GeForce gaming card and the transformation to the revolution to the gaming industry will be quite extraordinary. So we're super excited about RTX.","Operator","Your next question is from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein.","Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for fitting me in for my follow-up. This is a question for Colette. I want to follow-up again on the seasonality. Understanding the prior comments, normal seasonal for Q2 for gaming would be up in the double digits. Given your commentary on the crypto declining in Q2, given your commentary on just the general drivers around datacenter and the Volta ramp, I can't bring that together with the idea of gaming being above seasonal within the context of your guidance envelope. So how should I reconcile those things? How are you actually thinking about seasonality for gaming into Q2 within the context of the scenarios that are currently contemplated in your guidance for next quarter?","Colette M. Kress - NVIDIA Corp.","Sure, Stacy. Let me see if I can bridge together, Jensen, and then some comments here. Unfortunately, they're moving quite fast to the next question, so I wasn't able to add-on.","But let me see if I can add-on here and provide a little bit of clarity in terms of the seasonality. Remember in Q1, we outgrew seasonality significantly. We left Q4 with very low inventory in terms of in the channel. We spent Q1 working on establishing a decent amount of inventory available.","We wanted to concentrate on our miners separately. And then you can see we did that in terms of Q1 by moving that to OEM and moving that to cryptocurrency only boards. So we left Q1 at this point with healthy overall channel inventory levels as far as where we stand.","So that then takes you now to Q2. But if we overshot in terms of seasonality in terms of Q1, we don't have to do those channel fill dynamics again as we get into Q2. But we do have demand out there for our gamers that we can now address very carefully with the overall inventory that we now have available.","So putting together, Q1 and Q2 together, yes, we are within normal seasonality, again, for a guidance. And we'll see how we'll finish in terms of the quarter. But you should be in that range.","So, yes, from a normal seasonality, at a year-to-date inclusive of Q2, yes, we're on that overall seasonality. Always keep in mind, generally, our H2s are usually higher than our overall H1s, and that's what you should think about our overall guidance.","Gaming is still strong. We have to comment that our overall drivers that have taken us to this place over the last three to five years with phenomenal growth and our ability to grow that overall market is still here and all of those things are together. We just had a few quarters in terms of making sure that we get the overall channel correct and put our miners separately.","I hope that clarifies in terms of where we are, in terms of gaming seasonality.","Operator","Your last question comes from Will Stein with SunTrust.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi. Great. Thank you for taking my question and squeezing me in. The question relates to the supply chain challenges that you talked so much about in the gaming end market.","I'm wondering if there's something particular to that end market that is making the shortages concentrated there, or are in fact other end markets in particular, the datacenter end market, also somewhat restricted from what growth they might have achieved if there weren't the shortages that are out there. And maybe talk about the pace of recovery of those. That'd be really helpful. Thanks so much.","Colette M. Kress - NVIDIA Corp.","Let me start off here, and I'll have Jensen finish up on the last part of that question. But overall, our datacenter business did phenomenal. Volta is doing extremely well. And even now with 32-bit, we're seeing tremendous adoption throughout.","Again, remember it's very different than the overall consumer business. You have significant amount of time for qualification and that is moving extremely fast, based on a lot of other industries and their ability to qualify. So no, there is not a supply challenge at all in terms of our datacenter. And our overall growth in datacenter, we're extremely pleased with in terms of how the quarter came out.","I'll turn it over to you, Jensen, and you can answer the rest of the part of it.","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","Yeah. The reason why miners love GeForce is because miners are everywhere in the world. One of the benefits of cryptocurrency is that it's not any sovereign currency. And it's in the digital world, it's distributed. And GeForce is the single largest distributed supercomputing infrastructure on the planet.","Every gamer has a supercomputer in their PC. And GeForce is so broadly distributed, it's available everywhere. And so GeForce is really a good candidate for any new cryptocurrency or any new cryptography algorithm that comes along.","We try the best we can to go directly to the major miners. And they represent the vast majority of the demand. And to the best of our ability, serve their needs directly and we call that C&P (1:02:21) and that's why it's not called GeForce, they're called C&P (1:02:25). And we can serve those miners directly, hopefully to take some of the demand pressure off of the GeForce market.","Because ultimately, what we would like is we would like the market for GeForce pricing to come down, so that the gamers could benefit from the GeForces that we built for them.","And the gaming demand is strong. I mean, the bottom line is Fortnite is a homerun. The bottom line is PUBG is a homerun. And the number of gamers that are enjoying these games is really astronomic as people know very well.","And it's a global phenomenon. These two games are equally fun in Asia as it is in Europe as it is in the United States. And because you team up and this is a Battle Royale, you'd rather play with your friends. So it's incredibly social. It's incredibly sticky.","And more and more \u2013 more gamers that play, more of their friends join, and more of their friends join, more gamers that play. And so it's this positive feedback system, and the guys at Epic did a fantastic job creating Fortnite. And it's just a wonderful game genre that people are really enjoying.","And so I think at the core of it, gaming is strong and we are looking forward to inventory normalizing in the channel so that pricing could normalize in the channel, so that gamers can come back to buy the GeForce cards that has now been in short supply for over a quarter. And so the pent-up demand is quite significant. And I'm expecting the gamers to be able to buy new GeForces pretty soon.","Operator","Unfortunately, we ran out of time. I will now turn it back over to Jensen for any closing remarks.","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","Let's see here. Is it my turn again?","Colette M. Kress - NVIDIA Corp.","Yes, it is.","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","Okay. We had another great quarter, record revenue, record margins, record earnings, growth across every platform. Datacenter achieved another record with strong demand for Volta and AI inference. Gaming was strong. We are delighted to see prices normalizing and we can better serve pent-up gamer demand.","At the heart of our opportunity is the incredible growth of computing demand of AI just as traditional computing has slowed. The GPU computing approach that we've pioneered is ideal for filling this vacuum. And our invention of the Tensor Core GPU has further enhanced our strong position to power the AI era. I look forward to giving you another update next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. Thank you, guys, for joining.

(Operator Instructions)","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Chris Evenden. Sir, you may begin your conference.","Chris Evenden","Thanks Albert. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to NVIDIA\u2019s conference call for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. With me on the call today from NVIDIA are Jen-Hsun Huang, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Colette Kress our CFO.","After our prepared remarks, we will open up the call to question-and-answer session. Please limit yourself to one initial question with one follow-up.","Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that today\u2019s call is being webcast live on NVIDIA\u2019s Investor Relations website and is also being recorded. A replay of the conference call will be available via telephone until February 19, 2014 and the webcast will be available for replay until our conference call to discuss our financial results for our first quarter of fiscal 2015.

For a discussion of factors that could affect our future financial results and business, please refer to the disclosure in today\u2019s earnings release, our Form 10-Q for the fiscal period ended February 27, 2013 and the reports we may file from time-to-time on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission","All our statements are made as of today, February the 12, 2014 based on information available to us as of today and except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements. Unless otherwise noted, all references to market research and market share numbers throughout the call come from Mercury Research or Jon Peddie Research.","During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our release, which is posted on our website.","So, let\u2019s begin. Revenue came in well above our outlook driven by high-end PC gaming. Our GeForce business benefited from the launch of many excellent graphically intensive games including Call of Duty: Ghosts, Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag and Batman Arkham Origins.","In Asia Blade and Soul has proved hugely popular. It has very high system requirements relative to the vast majority of games played in China, which is a very promising development that is driven GeForce GTX sales there.","The PC gaming market is now launched in console gaming or mobile gaming according to TSC intelligence. The same format makes revenue from graphics intensive PC games will approach $20 billion this year.","We\u2019ve recently added a physical charter [ph] blade to enable gamers to save and share their best moments. They\u2019ve already saved over 3 million clips. If this seems like a niche application, consider that Twitch TV, which exists the string game play to global audience and leverage shader play with actually the fourth largest generator of internet traffic in the U.S. for the week ending February 3rd. That put it on Netflix but ahead Hoodoo and Amazon.","On the special side of the business, Tesla has established its position at the center of the high performance computing market. This quarter we Tesla partnership with IBM, possibly the biggest name in supercomputing. According IDC 32% of all HPC computing systems are build by an IBM.","Having IBM\u2019s world spanning sales force pitching Tesla is a natural consequence of the agreement. But perhaps is more interesting that IBM is looking to apply GPU acceleration across its entire portfolio of enterprise applications, potentially opening up very significant new market for us.","The top ingredient supercomputers are now powered by Tesla GPU accelerators and it is the fastest supercomputer in Europe. And only this week Ansys announced for the fluid dynamics application is now accelerated by Tesla. Ansys fluid is the world\u2019s most widely used commercial HPC application. More than 40,000 companies worldwide depend on Ansys in industries from consumer products to civil engineering. We lost the Tesla K40 this quarter. It has doubled the memory of past products and we are seeing a lot of interest from consumer internet companies as we expand our market footprint into big data analytics, the topic we will explore further at our investor day next month.","GRID is our GPU accelerated cloud computing platform. Our invention of the virtual GPU gives OEMs a major weapon to help drive virtualization across every aspect of the enterprise, including desktop PC applications. The number of GRID trials continues to grow strongly up 46% from last quarter. Enterprise IT purchases have a long buying process, but they are long-term and we are looking forward to share more when the time comes.","In mobile we launched our latest Tegra system on chip at the CES Show in January. Tegra K1 is our first mobile processor to incorporate the capital GPU Architecture and is the first mobile processor to deliver PC class graphics. This means we can leverage our investments and those of others in the PC and console ecosystems. For example on Epic's Unreal Engine 4 now runs on Tegra K1. PC and console game developers can port modern AAA Titles to android platforms powered by Tegra.","And developing android as a major game platform is an important element of our strategy and we are excited about Unreal Engine running on Tegra K1. so too is Tim Sweeney founder of Epic Games and developer of the Unreal Engine. He said he didn\u2019t think the industry would be at this level on mobile for another three or four late years. Tegra K1 is quite literally game changing.","During on CES event we showed android running on a 64-bit Tegra K1. The CPU was our own custom Denver call and it is the first time anyone, who had publicly shown android running on a 64-bit chip. We expect devices based on the 32-bit version of Tegra K1 to ship in the first half of 2014 and 64-bit of devices in the second half.","Along with PC graphic features Tegra also brings CUDA to mobile with 192 fully programmable processor cores. So, it can be used the greatly accelerated applications like image recognition or computational photography. For tablets and phones we can imagine a future with devices that see your face and adapts to your moods or open a browser in response to adjust you.","For cars however the implications are quite startling. At CES we demonstrated K1 recognizing in real-time the white lines on a road from a video feed. It simultaneously identified other vehicles ahead and traffic signs at the side of the road. These capabilities are the fundamental building blocks at the Advanced Driver Assistance Systems that manufactures will include in future cost, with all these CES keynote where Jen-Hsun spoke, one of that vehicles drove itself on to the stage at now we announced that Tegra K1 will power it\u2019s product to driving and self parking initiatives.","Specialty analytics expects the market for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems to be worth around $15 billion by 2016 with a CAGR of 23%. As he also announced for this next generation in-vehicle systems will be powered by Tegra. these include a revolutionary high resolution digital cockpit with 3D graphical displays that we\u2019ll start shipping later this year as an automotive grade smart display winning android for integrated passenger entertainment. increasingly, the driver of AKAI is surrounded by pixels and the quality of those pixels communicates as much about the car as once did in light walnut and hand stitched leather graphics matters.","Repeatedly, Audi\u2019s Chief Engineer Electrical Electronics noted that 90% of the innovation in automobiles today involves history of electrical and electronics NVIDIA\u2019s automotive initiative is focused squarely at this car revolution. as we start fiscal 2015, we have 64% of the PC discrete graphics market, 81% of workstation graphics units and Tesla in pilot projects at 44% of all HPC sites. these numbers are from Mercury, Odyssey and Intersect360 respectively.","Tegra 4 has shipped in tons in China and our motive has been certified by both AT&T and Vodafone, our automotive business has a $2 billion pipeline and we\u2019ve laid the foundation for the next generation of in-car electronics and advanced driver assistance. GRID our first product obviously in the enterprise desktop is being evaluated at hundreds of sites worldwide.","And with that I would like to turn it over to Jen-Hsun.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well before we turned it over to Colette, let me first make a comment about an organization change. Many of you know that Rob Csongor has been recently assigned by me to head of our automotive business. Rob Csongor was previously your contact along with Chris in IR. I decided to put Rob Csongor in charge of automotive because it is becoming a very large business and very fast growing business and also very important business. in fact, before I tasked Rob to head up Nvidia\u2019s corporate marketing worldwide, Rob started the automotive business and to now that he ran it for several years and now that it is becoming quite a sizable business with great important to us in customers all over the world, I have asked Rob to take range back again and run our automotive business. He will report directly to me with the new automotive group","Chris will become the lead of IR and many of you most of you in fact, know Chris very well. In addition to his masterful ability to read I just love to listen to him read, he also is one of the people in the graphics industry with extremely long tenure, he knows this market like the back of his hands, he grew up with this market and to long before he was in IR, he was an product marketing and so he knows this industry very deeply and he knows our company very deeply.","I know that many of you have reached out to me and over the years recognized how wonderful it is to work with Chris and I think all of you would be delighted that he is setting up our IR team now.","Okay, so with that I\u2019ll hand it over to Colette.","Colette Kress","Thanks, Chris and Jen-Hsun. hello, everyone. Let me provide some details on the quarter and full-year results. Revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 was $1.14 billion up 9% sequentially and 3% year-over-year. Revenue results were well above our outlook for the quarter, reflecting stronger than expected growth in GeForce, GTX, desktop and notebook GPU sales.","The GPU business revenue was $947 million, up 8% from last quarter and 14% year-over-year. The GPU revenue increased from last quarter led by desktops and notebook GPU sales. On a year-over-year basis, the increase reflected nearly 50% growth in GeForce, GTX, GPU sales as our products were well positioned for the overall gaming market segment demand.","Also Quadro workstations grew 4% and Tesla for high performance computing was up more than 20% year-over-year. Customer evaluations of our GPU accelerated Quadro technology GRID continue to grow at a fast pace. The Tegra processor business grew 18% from Q3 to $131 million led by increased volumes for Tegra mobile devices, primarily from Tegra 4 sales to Xiaomi for their M3 smartphones. Tegra infotainment systems for auto increased more than 60% from the year-ago quarter.","Revenue for fiscal 2014 was $4.13 billion, down 3.5% strengthen our high-end GeForce GPUs, Quadro, Tesla and Tegra for automotive products was partially offset by a decline in the market for desktop PCs and notebooks, which drove a decrease in volumes of our lower priced mainstream GPUs. The transition from Tegra 3 generation to Tegra 4 generation of products also contributed to the decline.","For the quarter, GAAP gross margins was 54.1% non-GAAP gross margin was 53.8%. The gross margin percent was slightly below our outlook for the quarter as a mix of Tegra and high margin GPU products was different reflecting the higher than expected revenue. Gross margin continues to reflect the growth in volumes and stable average selling prices of higher margin GeForce, GTX, GPUs and strong sales of Quadro and Tesla.","Tegra platforms have lower gross margins than most of our GPUs. so as the mix can fluctuate our gross margin quarter-to-quarter. For the full year, GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin reached record highs at 54.9% and 55.1% respectively. GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter was $452 million; non-GAAP operating expenses were $408 million. Operating expenses came in below our outlook and incorporated leveraged expenses and a slowdown in employee hiring for the quarter.","GAAP interest expense for the fourth quarter included an incremental $7 million related to the convertible debt offering, $2 million for the coupon interest and $5 million for the debt discount amortization. We expect ongoing quarterly interest expense related to the convertible debt to be about $11 million for quarter, $4 million of coupon interest and $7 million of debt discount amortization.","GAAP net income and EPS for the quarter were $147 million and $0.25 per share, reflecting sequential growth of more than 25% as revenue increased and operating expenses were contained. Now turning to some key balance sheet items, as previously announced, we completed a convertible debt offering in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 for $1.5 billion with the net proceeds to be used primarily for the repurchase of common stock and quarterly dividend payments. We repurchased 2.3 million shares for $37 million in the fourth quarter and a total of 62 million shares for $887 million for the full fiscal year 2014. More than 10% of our shares outstanding have been repurchased since the beginning of fiscal 2014.","Cash dividend paid during the fiscal year totaled $181 million. Total capital return to shareholders in fiscal 2014 was $1.68 billion. Cash flow from operating activities was $401 million in the fourth quarter of the full-year and was $835 million for the full year.","Depreciation and amortization expense for the fourth quarter amounted to $55 million. Capital expenditures were $66 million. In fiscal 2014, we leased and occupied an office building within the boundaries of our main Santa Clara campus and it has balanced the workspace need for our current Santa Clara staff. Given that this additional space meets our present needs, this gives us the opportunity to refine the design for the previously announced new campus building to optimize for functionality and cost.","Now turning to the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2015. As you will recall, we provide guidance for just the next quarter out, which we believe is helpful to articulate where future business growth opportunities are. Following the strong revenue results in Q4, our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2015 is expected to be $1.05 billion plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be approximately 54.2% and 54.5% respectively.","GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $454 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $413 million, nearly flat with the levels of Q4 as we work to optimize and leverage, the level of spend to address our growth initiatives.","GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for the first quarter and annual fiscal 2015 are both expected to be 20%, plus or minus 1%. If the U.S., R&D tax credit is renewed, the tax rate is expected to be 16%. As previously announced, our capital return strategy for fiscal year 2015 includes plan to return $1 billion to shareholders through stock repurchases and cash dividend. Thus in the first quarter, we intend to continue the repurchase of our outstanding shares.","With that, let me turn it back to Chris.","Chris Evenden","That concludes our prepared remarks. We\u2019ll answer questions, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Ian Ing with MKM Partners. Please go ahead.","Ian L. Ing \u2013 MKM Partners LLC","Yes. Thanks for taking my question. So in GeForce, I mean is it possible you\u2019re seeing some strength from console users, switching to PCs there is this ongoing major console transition, not all that compatible, it seems like some of the game pedals, if you listen to game staff might have disappointed?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yes. I\u2019m not sure about that. But I think the Megatrends associated with gaming is relatively clear now. The PC platform is the only open-platform for gaming and GeForce is obviously, very strong within that. The open-platform allows you to do things to support joiners that are massively online that are free to play that have micro transactions for in-game commerce and because its an open platform its supported in every country, its supported in China, its supported in Russia and we know there are people who love playing games globally.","And also because of the global ability to now develop games of different joiners and different cultures, we are seeing that games is a global phenomenon now and so there is a fair number of fundamental dynamics that\u2019s driving PC gaming growth and then the one that you mentioned recently is important as well, its important because for the first time, for the very first time in history the architecture of a game console is exactly the same as the architecture of a PC, although a PC is still more advanced, its more open, its more flexible the game console titles that are developed these AAA titles with such enormous production value the developers can take them the modern \u2013 the state of the art or next generation game consoles at the same do they take at the PCs.","And its great for them because there are only a couple of 2 million, 3 million next generation consoles, but there is already a couple of 100 million installed base of PCs and so they protect themselves that way, this generation of transition is really much more friendly to the game developers and as a result its much better for PCs as well.","Ian L. Ing \u2013 MKM Partners LLC","And as my follow-up it\u2019s in mobile. So as we look pass Chinese New Year, can you talk about Tegra 4 seasonality and diversification and when we expect Tegra 4 iWin?","Chris Evenden","Well the next catalyst for Tegra driver, growth driver comes from two places, one of them is TK1, Tegra K1. Tegra K1 is the first time that we\u2019ve brought our state of the art GPU architecture to Tegra and it\u2019s such a great discontinuity with a 192 fully programmable processor cores that we decided to rename it to Tegra K1 and to reflect this discontinuity. The other component of Tegra K1 is our 64-bit custom Denver processor, people have been really excited about this processor for some time, because they know what we are building I guess and at this point based on what I know about the market and what is coming Denver is likely to be the most advanced 64-bit ARM processor in the world. And so Tegra K1 will as Chris mentioned earlier start to ramp in the first half and it will ramp further in the second half. So that\u2019s one growth catalyst.","The second is T4i and our modem products, devices with modem in it and we are still on track on that, there is nothing new to report today, we have mentioned earlier that late in Q \u2013 late Q1 or early Q2 is when we expect deices to be announced and I\u2019m looking forward to that and it is still on track.. And the third growth catalyst is our automotive business, it has grown to be quite a large business and at a time when the car industry is really going through a renaissance, just as the phone became a smartphone, TVs are becoming Smart TVs, these cars becoming or getting revolutionized by computing technology and we are seeing our application processors being used initially in infotainment. We recently made a big breakthrough and have our processors drive the digital cluster, which for the automotive industry, the cockpit is really important grounds and because it\u2019s so vital to the driver experience, they\u2019re very protective of it. We have demonstrated our graphics technology and our software stack is capable of supporting such mission-critical application, it became a second growth driver for us and now the third, which is using supercomputing technology and the CUDA GPGPU that we invented for autopilot and self-driving cars. And so those are the near-term growth catalysts for the Tegra business and I\u2019m looking forward to that.","Ian L. Ing \u2013 MKM Partners LLC","Thanks, again.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Wang with Evercore Partners. Please go ahead.","Patrick Wang \u2013 Evercore Partners","Great. Thanks. Hey, Jen-Hsun, I\u2019m just curious when you look at the Tegra integrated SOC side of things, how do you view that, I mean how important is the integrated SOC when you think about or I guess with regards to your vision for Tegra going forward?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Hi Patrick. First of all, mobile is more than phones, and that\u2019s just really important to remember and we\u2019re starting to see it now. Mobile is both a device, short for phones it\u2019s also a technology, people kind of gave it name of application processor that\u2019s an SOC built for low power applications and people call that mobile, mobile technology. And so the mobile is more than phones. Tegra is designed with a mobile technology sensibility, but it has an application space that\u2019s more than phones. We\u2019ve only really targeted the superphone segment since the beginning.","Our core market, our core targets are tablets, gaming set-top boxes, gaming smart TVs and automotive. Those are really our core target markets for Tegra. And we build the right products for the right time for those markets and that\u2019s really our focus. Maybe, another way of saying it is what is our non-focus and our non-focus is mainstream phones. We\u2019ve always been very clear about that and our focus is plenty of growth opportunity for us and it\u2019s an area where we can add value and where the unique capabilities of our company and now with Tegra K1 where we\u2019ve brought the world\u2019s best GPU, it\u2019s years ahead of the competition to the Tegra market. The Tegra opportunity, so we\u2019re really excited about that.","Patrick Wang \u2013 Evercore Partners","Got it. That makes sense. My follow-up, I wanted to talk a little bit about GRID, I think it\u2019s probably the business line of yours that\u2019s my favorite one. Can you give us a milestone that we should look forward to over the next couple of quarters here, clearly there\u2019s a lot of demand for virtualizing graphics NVIDIA, but we could just kind of maybe plan a couple of things we should look for? Thanks.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yes, I appreciate that Patrick; it\u2019s one of my favorites too. And this is an invention that has taken about seven years to do. As you know, revolutionized enterprise computing is very, very hard. The software compatibility challenges, the infrastructure compatibility challenges are truly great and you have to be backwards compatible with since the beginning of time. And GRID, GRID has really achieved some really great milestones and in fact, you\u2019re seeing it all the time now. now internally we are tracking trials, we have several hundred trials around the world, it has grown a lot and it grows every single week, you know that the number of OEMs that are following it and supporting it around the world.","Just as it today Vmware and Google announced that there would be streaming desktop applications to devices. You could see that the industry wants to virtualize everything, we\u2019ve been able to virtualize storage, we\u2019ve been able to virtualize networks, we\u2019ve been able to virtualize servers, but we\u2019ve not really been able to virtualize every aspect of desktop computing. And by been with virtualized desktop computing you could put applications of any kind in the cloud and make it available to anybody anywhere and so turning enterprise PC or commercial PC into a service if you will is quite liberating for enterprises around the world.","And so I\u2019m quite excited about this and you are seeing milestones being announced all the time and so this is of course a new area for us its taken us several years to get here, but this really Nvidia\u2019s first enterprise computing product and it\u2019s the first products that we\u2019ve ever had the benefit of the global enterprise sales force of large enterprise companies selling on our behalf. So I think this is going to be a big opportunity for us.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Mike McConnell \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities. Please go ahead.","Michael McConnell \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities","Thanks. Colette I would like to ask about OpEx, I think most of us are expecting inner models for fiscal 2015 a double-digit increase in OpEx, it looks like you have shown some pretty good controls here looking at guidance for the April quarter, could you give us an update kind of on how you think OpEx is going trend for this fiscal year coming?","Colette Kress","So as indicated, at this we are really looking one quarter out and steady as we go, we do take a hard look at this as we did both in Q4 and in Q1 to really start leveraging and thinking about how well we\u2019ve done on the employees that we have hired and how we can utilize them well. So more to come later, but at this time we just have guidance for Q1. Thank you.","Michael McConnell \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities","Okay and then just one more maybe for Jen-Hsun. Jen-Hsun looking at growth in the your desktop business, it looks like you guys have put a strongest year-over-year growth since fiscal 2008 and I know you have gone through some of the drivers for the gaming market overall. There had been some discussion I think going into the report concerning some shortages that your competitor was experiencing at the high end of the market. I wanted to know how much do you think that benefited growth in fiscal Q4 or do you think it was mostly market driven. Thanks.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yes, first of all I guess I\u2019m not sure. On the other hand our growth year-over-year is greater than their market share in that segment of the market and so we must be growing to market maybe that\u2019s the easiest way to think about it and I think for all, for our own sense of purposes the anecdotal evidence is that we are growing the market every market whether its China, the gaming market is growing and its growing in two ways more and more people are playing games, there are more games that are becoming free to play, and even though it\u2019s free to play you still need a gaming PC to enjoy it. and also this quarter, the work that we did with the game developer, the largest game developer in the world Tencent to produce Blade & Soul was a huge success.","We found together in China that there is a market for high production value games and so high production value usually translates to requiring a great deal of technology. And so you\u2019re also of course, seeing this last holiday, three very important games, in shop on the PC, many of which are also available on game consoles, because of the dynamic that I mentioned earlier. And people are now talking about 100 brand new games coming out to the new generation of game consoles next year. Next year may very well be the year where we see more high production value games than anytime in history for the PC. And so we\u2019re quite excited about the high-end segment.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Suji De Silva with Topeka Capital. Please go ahead.","Suji De Silva \u2013 Topeka Capital Markets","Thanks, guys. Nice job in the quarter. Just a couple of clarification questions on the Tegra 4i. Do you think the superphones will go within modem applications or more integrated, and I know they would be ramping up 64-bit. So I\u2019m curious if kind of the up processor alone is good there in that market. And is the 4i applicable to the other target Tegra market that you described here beyond superphones? Thanks.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well superphone market is really moving fast. And so integration is sometimes a good thing and integrations sometimes hurt you. It\u2019s just a higher risk to integrate four things that are \u2013 that needs to be state of the art at the same time. And so some companies use things like Tick-Tock to articulate the benefit of strategies and methodologies to reduce your risks. Some companies like us, we call them ping-pong and we try to reduce our risk by moving one piece at a time, so then you can innovative on rhythmic and continuous basis even though the market is moving dramatically. And so integration sometimes helps you, sometimes it doesn\u2019t help you. And it\u2019s just hard to say.","Our focus for Tegra is pretty consistent; we care very much about the superphone segment. We care even more about the tablet segment where we can add more value, because we are a performance oriented company, gaming consoles, set-top boxes and of course, automotive where performance and functionality are so important. And so those are really, our target market, some of them can benefit from Tegra 4i, most of them that the large catalyst for our company going with Tegra has always been about bringing our state of the art GPUs to Tegra.","And finally, this season, this last quarter, we were able to announce Tegra K1, which has been a huge endeavor of ours and now we not only brought a state of the art GPU to the mobile market, we also unified the architecture in our company. And so the effort of building Tegra is now even more leveraged than even before. And so we used one unified architecture now, one unified software stack, everything is identical. And so it\u2019s very powerful lever for us to expand our GPU market.","Suji De Silva \u2013 Topeka Capital Markets","Okay, then. For a quick follow-up the gross margin, I know you guys don\u2019t want to guide beyond one quarter, but you\u2019ve done a great job getting gross margin up here. Can you talk about the puts and takes going forward in terms of where gross margin could potentially go and is it really just mix or are there other factors we should be aware of in terms of secular improvements? Thanks.","Colette Kress","Yes. let me comment about the gross margin. as you can see, our businesses tend to differ quarter-to-quarter in terms of that mix. I think our ASPs have been extremely solid over a long period of time. And we do expect that to continue, when we think about our high growth businesses, particularly in the professional, the enterprise and the GRID, which have very nice margins above our overall company average and just seen how those play out as they can be influenced by very large deals.","as you can see, just finishing the Q4 and our overall GeForce GTX business and it\u2019s a tremendous success, did have a change in terms of our overall gross margins. As I spoke, the overall Tegra business has slightly lower gross margins. so again, depending on the volumes of what percentage that business is of our total will have an influence. But we\u2019re extremely pleased in terms of the progress that we made on gross margins for the full year, fiscal year 2014, I mean worth living and then heading into Q1, I think it looks very solid as well.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Thanks, Suji.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jim E. Schneider \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good afternoon and congratulations on strong results. I was wondering if you could maybe address the Tegra business for a moment, can you talk about whether from here, you had expected to decline more or less seasonally than the rest of business in the Q1. and then do you think it\u2019s going to be likely the October quarter that we would see a meaningful pickup by the new generation design wins or do you think it\u2019s \u2013 it is possible it could happen in the July quarter?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yes, Jim first of all, thanks a lot. The growth drivers, the next catalyst for growth for us are the three that I mentioned, Tegra K1 and T4i devices coming to market, and other modem devices coming to market and our automotive business. Those are the three near-term catalysts for growth and they really kick in starting in late Q1, mostly in Q2 and then very largely in Q3. Okay, so but they start kicking in, in late Q1 and in Q2, and very largely in Q3. and so that\u2019s kind of the way to think about it. Overall for our Q1 guidance, seasonality aside we\u2019re growing Q1 year-over-year 10% and so we\u2019re seeing nice growth across the board for the company.","Jim E. Schneider \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","That\u2019s helpful, thank you. I was wondering if you can comment on the \u2013 within the professional space, the Tesla piece in particular obviously, that can be lumpy driven by some specific data center and other large scale deployments. what\u2019s your little visibility on the Tesla piece of business as you have throughout the year?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, these are \u2013 there is partly supercomputing business and they tend to be lumpy; the second part of it is enterprise business and we tend to have visibility out quite a long time; and the third part of it is really about expanding Tesla into new fields of use, one of the most important commercial large scale simulation software packages in the world is answers fluent. I don\u2019t know how many companies use it, but I surely know we use it and most manufacturing companies in the world use it. And this is a piece of software that is vital to the industrial economy. And finally we\u2019ve been able to accelerate in port Fluent and to CUDA. This is a multi-year effort for us. This was a very, very significant announcement. We are supper, supper excited about it. And so this opens up a new field of use, there are applications like that are cropping out of the wood works all over the place. And the reason for that is because I think that accelerated computing with CUDA hasn\u2019t really reached the tipping point that if no longer, whether this computing model is viable, if no longer whether this computing model is going to be around, those are full grown conclusions. It is now how quickly can I port my application so that I can accelerate it and have a competitive advantage.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Caso with Susquehanna Financial Group. Please go ahead.","Chris Caso \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group","Thank you. Just following on from the last question given the comments about some of the Tegra drivers starting here in late Q1; We think that that helps to offset some of the seasonality in the Tegra business such that we take a look at your guidance we should expect the GPU in the Tegra business kind of down in about equal percentage as we look in to the April quarter.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well Chris you know we guide one quarter at a time. And we are quite happy with the guidance that we provided and when Q2 comes along we\u2019ll guide that.","Chris Caso \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group","No, I\u2019m sorry I was referring the first quarter.","Jen-Hsun Huang","With the first quarter Chris, what Colette just guided? What was the question? Maybe Colette can handle it.","Colette Kress","Yes, so as we look into Q1 the overall revenue guidance is about a 10% over the prior year. We were seeing a definite strength year-over-year particularly in our enterprise business, which we will definitely see will continue. Our GPU in terms of what we have seen in terms of GeForce, but we do expect there is a sequential decline from Q4 in overall desktop and notebook shipments. So, that is baked in there from a sequential standpoint. We will see how the quarter goes in terms of Tegra, we feel pretty solid about the levels that we ended in Q4 and what we see heading into Q1. But that\u2019s all take into account into the guidance was 1050 [ph].","Chris Caso \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group","All right that\u2019s very helpful and I apologize if I was unclear with the question. Just as I look forward with the buyback that you have right now. Could you clarify where your onshore cash sits now after you have competed the convert?","Colette Kress","The additional net aspect of the convert as we added 1.5 and we are sitting at about the same amount of U.S. cash as we were before, so we are now probably well over the $2 billion level in the U.S. right now as we are entering into Q1.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Thanks Chris.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.","Kevin E. Cassidy \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on a great quarter. In the quarter though you had said Quadro business was down quarter-over-quarter, was that seasonality or was it just that the third quarter was such a strong quarter?","Colette Kress","I think it can be a little bit of both. As you know in the Q3 we did at time Kevin announced a new product launch at that point and extremely well received, ultra well received as we go into Q4. Not a material change in terms of that sequential decline and we feel very good going into the New Year with that as well. But thanks Kevin.","Kevin E. Cassidy \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great thanks and just with the follow-up. You had a GPU licensing business open for a while and I just want to know if you\u2019ve got anything in the pipeline or any views you can give us for 2014 on the GPU licensing?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yes Kevin. Thanks for the question. You know that NVIDIA is a core technology company and we invented GPU, we invented GPGPU and now we invented for virtualization of GPUs. And our company has over 7,000 patents granted and approved and granted and filed.","And so technology licensing is an important part of our company strategy and is a part of strategy that we\u2019ve implemented for some time. These discussions take long time and it\u2019s always unpredictable and we are patient. We know how important GPUs are. We know how many companies in the world now utilize GPUs and we know how fundamental our technology patents are.","The question that you asked also includes the fact that we on July I think it was last year, we announced that we would also open up our GPU technology. GPU designs to be incorporated in the products of large third-party vertically integrated companies.","And that strategy is very important to us and we are making our latest generation GPUs available to them. And discussions are happening and that will take time. This is not something that happens very quickly because it includes people\u2019s methodologies and designing it into the work flow and so, but we add so much value here. And this is something that I think we have a real great opportunity to find new growth venues for our company.","Kevin E. Cassidy \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yes, thanks a lot Kevin.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Christopher Hemmelgarn \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Congrats for great quarter. This is Chris Hemmelgarn on for Blayne Curtis. One quick question for you Jen today. Could you rank I think you did this last quarter, but just talk about how you would rank all of your growth opportunities in 2014?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yes, Chris first of all thanks. Well, it depends on whether its percentage or dollars. And if it\u2019s dollars I\u2019d say Tegra is up there. And if it\u2019s percentage GRID is up there. If it\u2019s kind of between percentage and dollars I would say Tesla is up there and because Tesla is already a large business.","Tesla and Auto both are large businesses and have large growth opportunities. That\u2019s kind of the way I would do it. And I would say that in terms of dollars, absolute dollars yes, the GTX is up there too. Gaming is up there too. And so it depends on whether we are talking about dollars or percentages.","Christopher Hemmelgarn \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","So, things are pretty good across the board that\u2019s helpful. I guess as a quick follow-up, could you just talk a little more about your long-term expectations for both SHIELD and then products like Tegra K1 is pretty capable, it certainly seems like there are some opportunity to displays console gaming with your noble shifts, just your thoughts long-term there.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yes, well you know that SHIELD is our strategy, its core to our strategy to cultivate to develop gaming on the Android platform we believe that Android is going to be one of the most important computing platforms in the futures, if not already now and its available on every country, it\u2019s available on all kinds of devices and because it\u2019s an open platform allows for open innovation in a lot of industries.","Gaming is very important to us where there are high production value in games; there are typically great demand for GPUs, great demand for visual computing expertise like ours. We could add a lot of value in gaming and so the android market has a lot of phone, but it doesn\u2019t have a lot of gaming, genuinely good gaming platforms and that\u2019s one of the reasons why we decided to build SHIELD.","The reception of SHIELD is really fantastic, people who have used it love it, I am really delighted by the capabilities of our company to build devices and people who have enjoyed it love the build quality. Our \u2013 but its \u2013 we are modest about the revenues from it, we are modest about its distribution, because it\u2019s something that were still learn, but it\u2019s important to our strategy for gaming and at this point there is more and more and more evidence that gaming is going to be very important for android and I\u2019m delighted that SHIELD has been the spear point if you will that makes great games available on android.","Operator","Next question comes from line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Please go head","Ambrish Srivastava \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Hi thank you Jen-Hsun. On GRID could you just provide us the frame of reference, so when you started on this endower versus where you are today. Where you \u2013 has it surpassed all your wild expectations in terms of the trails you are having and then more importantly on the revenue side you mentioned percentage wise its going to grow, but just help us understand when does it become a meaningful portion and then just also in terms of size and I\u2019ll restrict my question, just though it\u2019s a multi part question. Thanks.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Hi Ambrish, the market opportunity for GRID is several different applications, probably the single largest application is enterprise virtualization, enterprise virtualization is a major thrust and has been a major thrust in enterprise IT for the last ten years. Not only is it great for productivity, its great for cost effectiveness, so that you can every agree recourses in a data center, it\u2019s great for manageability, it\u2019s great for security and so but there is a one class of computing in all enterprises that has not been able to be virtualized and that\u2019s your desktop PC and all of the application that are associated with it.","GRID makes it possible for us to now virtualized desktop PC application and literally stream it to you like we stream Netflix to you and we can stream it you from anywhere. And the wonderful think about GRID is it\u2019s compatible with every and any PC application that we know of and so that\u2019s one application.","Another application is cloud gaming, we are delighted that our cloud computing infrastructure is getting more capable, broadband is getting more available, those things are becoming more and more commoditized and overtime it stands to reason we should be able to enjoy even the most heavy PC applications which is games on any device and anywhere you like to enjoy it. And the third, the third has to do with GRID being used for computing in the cloud, it could be used for image processing as more and more videos and images are being uploaded into the cloud our GPUs are incredible at image processing.","So when you think about all of these different applications in aggregate, the GPU could be quite a successful processor for data centers and cloud and so in time it will be quite large, but if you look at where it is today its probably a couple of years behind Tesla. If you think about where we are with Tesla a couple of years ago and now it\u2019s a multi $100 million business, it\u2019s a couple of years behind, but at some point both businesses have the opportunity to be very, very large. Its okay?","Ambrish Srivastava \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Okay. That\u2019s helpful.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Our data center initiatives.","Chris Evenden","Thanks, Ambrish.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland with FBR Capital. Please go ahead.","Christopher Rolland \u2013 Friedman, Billings, Ramsay, & Co., Inc.","Hey guys, congrats on the strong results and thanks so much for letting me ask a question. Can you guys talk perhaps about our cash position; you guys had a ton of cash on your balance sheet before the convert. So perhaps there is not too much of a good thing but can you talk about your minimum cash need, why they might be so high and then talk about your appetite or strategy for acquisitions.","Colette Kress","So cash position was influenced a little bit about where that cash was, so our cash position is about the same if you look at it as a net position, after looking at the convertible that we executed in Q4. the convertible was really to take care of the ability to be able to use that cash in the U.S., so we are sitting on the cash in the U.S. with a full plan to return that to shareholders in fiscal year 2015 and beyond both through our share repurchases program as well as also our cash dividends that we have from a quarterly basis. We don\u2019t necessarily comment on our overall cash needs, we don\u2019t really talk about our overall acquisition or if there was an acquisition at this time. So steady as we go, we feel that the $1 billion return to shareholders in fiscal year 2015 is a very, very solid matching number to our fiscal year 2014 and we\u2019ll talk further after we get through the fiscal year.","Christopher Rolland \u2013 Friedman, Billings, Ramsay, & Co., Inc.","Okay, great just a follow-up there. It kind of seems like maybe you are hinting it maybe something more than $1 billion for 2015, maybe some sort of an acceleration there given the cash and then my actual question is it seems like the sequential revenue drop in 1Q was a little more than many of us has expected. So what is driving the delta there, is it just a function of maybe a weaker than expected PC market and perhaps even sub-seasonal or is there something else going on there?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Chris, I\u2019ll let Colette back on and talk about the cash question again. But let me first comment about Q1. First of all, our GPU position is stronger than anytime in our history, whether it\u2019s GeForce for gaming and all of the innovations we have there and all the groundbreaking work that we\u2019re doing there, whether it\u2019s GRID where we invented virtual GPUs and is now strike right in the middle of enterprise virtualization initiatives all over the world to Tesla, which where we invented GPGPU and using our processors for massively parallel computing.","Our position and our contributions in visual computing is stronger than ever before. And now, with Tegra K1, we brought that exact same state of the art GPU architecture to mobile. And so our position in GPU is just stronger than ever before. We guided what we guided. In Q1, we\u2019re growing relative to last year, 10% and then we\u2019ll come back and see how it turns out.","You have asked a question about acquisition. If you take a look at our company, we were comfortable acquiring, we\u2019re also extremely comfortable innovating. This is one of the most inventive companies I\u2019m sure that you see in technology and we invented some very important and fundamental technologies that influences industries margin wide today. And so we think about R&D and M&A in very similar ways, except unlike many companies we have fundamental ability to be very inventive.","And that\u2019s one of the reasons why our R&D budget is a little higher, but in total aggregate, when you think about the investments that we\u2019ve made in aggregate between R&D and M&A, we\u2019re right there with many companies that our ratio for R&D internal, internal R&D of course, is higher, that\u2019s just because we have some of the world\u2019s best in visual computing. We are the best visual computing company ever and the people how love doing this work want to do their lives work here on this platform and so we\u2019re very flexible with that. And then I\u2019ll hand it back to Colette.","Colette Kress","Yes. Regarding the cash of whether or not, we change our plans, given its really early in the fiscal year, I think we\u2019re comfortable with where we stand at $1 billion but Chris we\u2019ll address it again, as the year goes by. Okay?","Christopher Rolland \u2013 Friedman, Billings, Ramsay, & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks, guys and congrats again.","Colette Kress","Thank you.","Operator","The last question comes from the line of Betsy Van Hees with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.","Betsy Van Hees \u2013 Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Hi, thanks very much for taking my question and congratulations on a great quarter and really strong guidance in what is always a seasonally down quarter and there has been a lot of questions about the guidance, so as I\u2019m looking at it, you\u2019ve guided you are going to be down 10%, 6% and given this is always a seasonally weak quarter for entire industry. Is it fair to say as we look at your GPU business, it\u2019s kind of -- going to kind of be down not much more in the lower end of your range of 6%, but given the seasonality of Tegra and the fact that its so tied to the mobile devices anywhere in this as well as new products going to be announced that is going to be greater than the 10%. Is that kind of a fair way for us to look at it? That\u2019s my first question.","Colette Kress","Yes. Hi, Betsy. Thanks for the question, as we look at Q1, again, the changes between those businesses could definitely occur. You are correct to say that seasonally on the GPU business it usually does come down in Q1 associated with the general desktop and or notebooks. So that\u2019s incorporated in there. We still have some high growth businesses. So those have been not necessarily following the seasonal trends, but we do expect that in terms of the GPU business. And then Tegra as we see right now steady as we go. We are not at this time providing very specific guidance on each of those as we have a couple of ranges for each of those businesses as we look at our guidance.","Betsy Van Hees \u2013 Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks Colette and then my next question Colette is for you on the balance sheet. So you have doing a great job there and especially with the digital inventory continue to go down. So I was wondering if you could remind us what is the healthy levels of days of inventory for you guys. You are at 67 days and is that where you want to run or you want to be lower than that?","Colette Kress","You are correct Betsy that we are at some continued improvement in terms of our overall inventory levels. We watch it quite closely. It really just is a factor of a lot of times in terms of when the availability of our chips are, so we do have to watch that carefully that it may not just always go lower and lower and just based on when we come out with new products, but we are very pleased at least just where this right now and yes we do as the overall finance team watch that quite carefully.","Betsy Van Hees \u2013 Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Right.

Kress - NVIDIA Corp.","Thanks, Arnab. Revenue reached a record in the third quarter, exceeding $2 billion for the first time. Driving this was success in our Pascal-based gaming platform and growth in our datacenter platform, reflecting the role of NVIDIA's GPU as the engine of AI computing.","Q3 revenue increased 54% from a year earlier to $2 billion and was up 40% from the previous quarter. Strong year-over-year gains were achieved across all four of our platforms: gaming, professional visualization, datacenter and automotive. The GPU business was up 53% to $1.7 billion and the Tegra processor business increased 87% to $241 million.","Let's start with our gaming platform. Gaming revenue crossed the $1 billion mark and increased 63% year-on-year to a record $1.24 billion, fueled by our Pascal-based GPUs. Demand was strong in every geographic region across desktop and notebook, and across the full gaming audience, from GTX 1050 to the TITAN X. GeForce gaming PC notebooks recorded significant gains. Our continued growth in the GTX gaming GPUs reflects the unprecedented performance and efficiency gains in the Pascal architecture. It delivers seamless play on games and richly immersive VR experiences.","In Q3, for desktops, we launched the GTX 1050 and the 1050 Ti, bringing eSports and VR capabilities at great value. For notebooks, we introduced GTX 1080, 1070 and 1060, giving gamers a major leap forward in performance and efficiency in a mobile experience. The fundamentals of the gaming market remain strong. The production value of blockbuster games continues to increase. Gamers are upgrading to higher-end GPUs to enjoy highly anticipated fall titles like Battlefield 1, Gears of War 3, Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, and eSports is attracting a new generation of gamers to the PC.","League of Legends is played by over 100 million gamers each month and there is now a Twitch audience of more than 300 million who follow eSports. VR and AR will redefine entertainment and gaming. A great experience requires a high performance GPU, and we believe we're still in the early innings of these evolving markets. Pascal represents not only the biggest innovation gains we've made in a single GPU generation in a decade; it's also our best executed product rollout.","Moving to professional visualizations, Quadro revenue grew 9% from a year ago to $207 million, driven by growth in the high-end of the market for real-time rendering and mobile workstations. We are seeing strong customer interest in the Pascal-based P6000 among digital entertainment leaders like Pixar, Disney and ILM, architectural, engineering and construction companies like Japan's Shimizu, and automotive companies like Hyundai.","Next: datacenter. Revenue nearly tripled from a year ago and was up 59% sequentially to $240 million. Growth was strong across all fronts in AI and supercomputing for hyperscale, as well as for GRID, virtualization and supercomputing. GPU deep learning is revolutionizing AI, and is poised to impact every industry worldwide. Hyperscale companies like Facebook, Microsoft and Baidu are using it to solve problems for their billions of consumers.","Cloud GPU computing has shown explosive growth. Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and AliCloud are deploying NVIDIA GPUs for AI, data analytics and HPC. AWS has recently announced its new EC2 P2 instance, which scales up to 16 GPUs to accelerate a wide range of AI applications, including image and video recognition, unstructured data analytics and video transcoding.","We saw strong growth in AI training. For AI inference, we announced the Tesla P4 and P40 to serve power efficient and high performance workloads respectively. Shipments began in Q3 for the DGX-1 AI supercomputer. Early users include major universities like Stanford, UC Berkeley and NYU, leading research groups such as OpenAI, the German Institute of Artificial Intelligence, and the Swiss Artificial Intelligence Lab, as well as multinationals like SAP.","So far this year, our GPU technology conference program has reached 18,000 developers and ecosystem partners, underscoring the broad enthusiasm for AI. Complementing our major spring event in Silicon Valley, we have organized GTCs in seven cities on four continents. They drew sellout audiences in Beijing, Taipei, Tokyo and Seoul, as well as Amsterdam, Melbourne and Washington D.C., with Mumbai still to come. Along with 400 sessions and labs, we provided training in AI skills to nearly 2,000 individuals through our Deep Learning Institute instruction program.","We also have begun partnering with key global companies to enable the adoption of AI. To implement AI in manufacturing, we announced a collaborative with Japan's FANUC, focused on robots and automated factories. And in the transportation sector, more than 80 OEMs, Tier 1s and startups are using our GPUs for their work on self-driving cars. Our GRID graphics virtualization business continues to achieve extremely strong growth. Adoption is accelerating across a variety of industries, particularly manufacturing, automotive, engineering and education. Among customers added this quarter were Johns Hopkins University and GE Global India.","And finally, in automotive, revenue increased to a record $127 million, up 61% year-over-year and up 7% sequentially from premium infotainment products. NVIDIA is developing an end-to-end AI computing platform for autonomous driving. This allows carmakers to collect and label data, train their own deep neural networks on the video GPUs in the datacenter, and then process them in the car with DRIVE PX 2.","We have also been developing a cloud-to-car HD mapping system with mapping companies all over the world. Two such partnerships were announced this quarter. We're working with Baidu to create a cloud-to-car development platform with HD maps, Level 3 autonomous vehicles and automated parking. We're also partnering with TomTom to develop a AI-based cloud-to-car mapping system that enables real-time in-car localization and mapping.","We've developed an integrated, scalable AI platform with capabilities ranging from automated highway driving to fully autonomous driving operation. We are extending the DRIVE PX 2 architecture to scale in performance and power consumption. It will range from DRIVE PX 2 AutoCruise with a single SoC for self-driving on highways, up to multiple DRIVE PX 2 computers capable of enabling fully autonomous driving.","We also announced a single-chip AI supercomputer called Xavier with over 7 billion transistors. Xavier incorporates our next GPU architecture, a custom CPU design, and a new computer vision accelerator. Xavier will deliver performance equivalent to today's full DRIVE PX 2 board and its two Parker SoCs and two Pascal GPUs, while only consuming a fraction of the energy.","Finally, Tesla Motors announced last month that all its factory produced vehicles, the Model S, the Model X and upcoming Model 3, feature a new AutoPilot system powered by the NVIDIA DRIVE PX 2 platform and will be capable of fully autonomous operation via future software updates. This system delivers over 40 times the processing power of the previous technology and runs a new neural network for vision, sonar and data processing.","Beyond our four platforms, our OEM and IP business was $186 million, down 4% year-on-year. Now, turning to the rest of the income statement. GAAP gross margin for Q3 was a record 59% and non-GAAP gross margin was a record 59.2%. These reflect the strength of our GeForce gaming GPUs, the success for our platform approach and strong demand for deep learning.","GAAP operating expenses were $544 million, including $66 million in stock-based compensation and other charges. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $478 million, up 11% from a year earlier. This reflects head count-related costs for our growth initiatives as well as investments in sales and marketing. We intend to continue to invest in deep learning to capture this once in a lifetime opportunity. Thus, we would expect the operating expense growth rate to be sustained over the next several quarters.","GAAP operating income was $639 million. Non-GAAP operating income more than doubled to $708 million. Non-GAAP operating margins were over 35% this quarter. For fiscal year 2018, we intend to return $1.25 billion to shareholders through ongoing quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases. We also announced a 22% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.14 per share.","Now, turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we expect revenue to be $2.1 billion, plus or minus 2%. Our GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin are expected to be 59% and 59.2%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $572 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $500 million. And GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 are both expected to be 20%, plus or minus 1%.","With that, operator, I'm going turn it back to you and see if we can take some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Your first question comes from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","Thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on a great quarter. I think to start out, Jen-Hsun, maybe if you could help us understand. The datacenter business tripled year-over-year. What's going on in that business that's enabling that to happen? If you could maybe talk about \u2013 I don't know if it's on the technology side or the end market side. And maybe as part of that, you can help us maybe deconstruct the revenues and what's really driving that growth? And I had a follow-up too. Thanks.","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","Sure. A couple things. First of all, GPU computing is more important than ever. There are so many different types of applications that require GPU computing today, and it's permeating all over enterprise. There are several applications that we're really driving. One of them is graphics virtualization, application virtualization. Partnering with VMware and Citrix, we've essentially taken very compute-intensive, very graphics-intensive applications, virtualizing it and putting it into the datacenter.","The second is computational sciences; using our GPU for general purpose scientific computing. And scientific computing, as you know, is not just for scientists; it's running equations and using numerics is a tool that is important to a large number of industries. And then, third, one of the most exciting things that we're doing because of deep learning, we've really ignited a wave of AI innovation all over the world. These several applications, graphics application and virtualization, computational science and data science has really driven our opportunity in the datacenter.","The thing that made it possible, though, the thing that really made it possible was really the transformation of our company from a graphics processor to a general purpose processor. And then, on top of that, probably the more important part of that, is transforming from a chip company to a platform company. What made application and graphics virtualization possible is a complicated stack of software we call GRID. And you guys have heard me talk about it for several years now.","And second, in the area of numerics and computational sciences, CUDA, our rich library of applications and libraries on top of numerics \u2013 numerical libraries on top of CUDA and all the tools that we have invested in, the ecosystem we've worked with, all the developers all around the world that now know how to use CUDA to develop applications makes that part of our business possible. And then third, our deep learning toolkit; the NVIDIA deep learning \u2013 GPU deep learning tool kit has made it possible for all frameworks in the world to get GPU acceleration.","And with GPU acceleration, the benefit is incredible. It's not 20%, it's not 50%, it's 20 times, 50 times. And that translates to, most importantly, for researchers, the ability to gain access to insight much, much faster. Instead of months, it could be days. It's essentially like having a time machine. And secondarily, for IT managers, it translates to lower energy consumption and, most importantly, it translates to a substantial reduction in datacenter cost, whereas you have a rack of servers with GPUs, it replaces an entire basketball court of cluster of off-the-shelf servers, and so a pretty big deal. Great value proposition.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the consistent growth and execution. Jen-Hsun, one more on the datacenter business. It has obviously grown very strongly this year. But, in the past, it has been lumpy. So, for example, when I go back to your fiscal 2015, it grew 60% to 70% year-on-year. Last year, it grew about 7%. This year it's growing over 100%. How should we think about the diversity of customers and the diversity of applications to help us forecast how the business can grow over the next one or two years?","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","Yeah, I think embedded in your question, in fact, are many of the variables that influence our business. Especially in the beginning, several years ago when we started working on GPU computing and bringing this capability into datacenters, we relied on supercomputing centers in the beginning and then we relied on remote workstations, datacenter workstations, if you will; virtualized workstations. And then increasingly, we started relying on \u2013 we started seeing demand from hyperscale datacenters as they used our GPUs for deep learning and to develop their networks. And then, now, we're starting to see datacenters take advantage of our new GPUs, P40 and P4, to apply to operate to use the networks for inferencing in a large scale way.","And so, I think we're moving, if you will, our datacenter business in multiple trajectories. The first trajectory is the number of applications we can run. Our GPUs now has the ability with one architecture to run all of those applications that I mentioned from graphics virtualization to scientific computing to AI. Second, we used to be in datacenters, but now we're in datacenters, supercomputing centers as well as hyperscale datacenters. And then third, the number of applications, industries that we affect is growing. It used to start with supercomputing. Now, we have supercomputing, we have automotive, we have oil and gas, we have energy discovery, we have financial services industry, we have, of course, one of the largest industries in the world, consumer Internet cloud services.","And so we're starting to see applications in all of those different dimensions. And I think that the combination of those three things, the number of applications, the number of platforms and locations by which we have success, and then, of course, the number of industries that we affect, the combination of that should give us more upward directory in a consistent way. But I think the really \u2013 the mega point though is really the size of the industries we're now able to engage. In no time in the history of our company have we ever been able to engage industries of this magnitude. And so that's the exciting part I think in the final analysis.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on a very strong quarter. Jen-Hsun, you've been on the road quite a bit over the past few months, and I'm sure you've had the opportunity to connect with many of your important customers and partners. Can you maybe share with us what you learned from the multiple trips and how your view on the company's long-term growth trajectory changed, if at all?","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","Yeah. Thanks a lot, Toshiya. First of all, the reason why I've been on the road for almost two months solid is because the request and the demand if you will from developers all over the world for a better understanding of GPU computing and getting access to our platform and learning about all of the various applications that GPUs can now accelerate.","The demand is just really great. And we no longer could do GTC, which is our developer conference \u2013 essentially, our developer conference. We can no longer do GTC just here in Silicon Valley. And so we, this year, decided to take it on the road and we went to China, went to Taiwan, went to Japan, went to Korea. We had one in Australia and also one in India and Washington D.C., and Amsterdam for Europe.","And so we pretty much covered the world with our first global developer conference. I would say, probably, the two themes that came out of it is that GPU acceleration, the GPU has really reached a tipping point. That it is so available everywhere; it's available in PCs, it's available from every computer company in the world, it's in the cloud, it's in the datacenter, it's in laptops. GPU is no longer a niche component. It is a large scale, massively available, general purpose computing platform. And so I think people realize now the benefits of GPU and that the incredible speedup or cost reduction, however, basically the opposite sides of a coin that you can get with GPUs, and so GPU computing.","Number two is AI; just the incredible enthusiasm around AI. And the reason for that, of course, for everybody who knows already about AI, what I'm going to say is pretty clear, but there's a large number of applications, problems, challenges where a numerical approach is not available. A laws of physics based, equation-based approach is not available. And these problems are very complex. Oftentimes, the information is incomplete and there's no laws of physics around it.","For example, what's the laws of physics of what I look like? What's the laws of physics for recommending tonight's movie? And so those kind \u2013 there's no laws of physics involved. And so the question is, how do you solve those kind of incomplete problems? There's no laws of physics equation that you can program into a car that causes the car to drive and drive properly. These are artificial intelligence problems.","Search is an artificial intelligence problem. Recommendation is an artificial intelligence problem. And so now that GPU deep learning has ignited this capability and it has made it possible for machines to learn from a large amount of data and to determine the features by itself, to compute the features to recognize, GPU deep learning has really ignited this wave of AI revolution.","And so I would say, the second thing that is just incredible enthusiasm around the world is learning how to use the GPU deep learning, how to use it to solve AI type problems and to do so in all of the industries that we know, from healthcare to transportation to entertainment to enterprise to you name it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Atif Malik with Citigroup.","Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Thanks for taking my question and congratulation. You mentioned that a Maxwell upgrade was about 30% of your (27:01-27:06) roughly two years (27:10) and should we be thinking about like a two-year time where (27:15-27:20).","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","Atif, first of all, there were several places where you cut out and this is one of those artificial intelligence problems. Because I heard incomplete information, but I'm going to infer from some of the important words that I did hear and I'm going to apply artificial \u2013 in this case \u2013 human intelligence to see if I can predict what it is that you were trying to ask.","I think you were \u2013 the baseline \u2013 the basis of your question was that Maxwell, in the past, in the past, Maxwell, GPU during that generation, we saw an upgrade cycle about every two or three years. And we had an installed base of some 60 million, 80 million gamers during that time and several years have now gone by. And the question is what would be the upgrade cycle for Pascal and what would it look like? And there are several things that have changed that I think is important to note, and that could affect a Pascal upgrade.","First of all, the increase in adoption, the number of units has grown and the number of the ASP has grown. And I think the reason for that is several folds. I think, one, the number of gamers in the world is growing. Everybody that is effectively born in the last 10, 15 years are likely to be a gamer. And so long as they have access to electricity and the Internet, they're very likely a gamer.","The quality of games has grown significantly. And one of the factors of production value of games that has been possible is because the PC and the two game consoles, Xbox and PlayStation, and in the future \u2013 in the near-future, the Nintendo Switch, all of these architectures are common in the sense that they all use modern GPUs, they all use programmable shading and they all have basically similar features.","They have very different design points, they have different capabilities, but they have very similar architectural features. As a result of that, game developers can target a much larger installed base with one common code base and, as a result, they can increase the production quality, production value of the games.","The second \u2013 and one of the things that you might have noticed that recently PlayStation and Xbox both announced 4K versions, basically the Pro versions of their game console. That's really exciting for the game industry. It's really exciting for us, because what's going to happen is the production value of games will amp up and, as a result, it would increase the adoption of higher-end GPUs. So, I think that that's a very important positive. That's probably the second one. The first one being the number of gamers is growing. The second is game production value continues to grow.","And then the third is gaming is no longer just about gaming. Gaming is part sports \u2013 part gaming, part sports and part social. There are a lot of people who play games just so they can hang out with their other friends who are playing games. And so it's a social phenomenon and then, of course, because games are \u2013 the quality of games, the complexity of games in some such as League of Legends, such as StarCraft, the real-time simulation, the real-time strategy component of it, the agility \u2013 the hand-eye coordination part of it, the incredible teamwork part of it is so great that it has become sport. And because there are so many people in gaming, because there is \u2013 it's a fun thing to do and it's hard to do, so it's hard to master, and the size of the industry is large, it's become a real sporting event.","And one of the things that I'll predict is that one of these days I believe that gaming would likely be the world's largest sport industry. And the reason for that is because it's the largest industry. There are more people who play games and now enjoy games and watch other people play games than there are people who play football for example. And so I think it stands to reason that eSports will be the largest sporting industry in the world. And that's just a matter of time before it happens. And so I think all of these factors have been driving both the increase in the size of the market for us as well as the ASP of the GPUs for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin with UBS.","Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Jen-Hsun, first question if I could on your comments regarding the GRID systems; you mentioned some accelerating demand in the manufacturing and automotive verticals. Just kind of wondering if you had any thoughts on what inning you're currently in, in terms of seeing a strong ramp-up towards a full run rate for those areas and especially for the broader corporate enterprise, end market vertical also?","As a quick follow-up on the gaming side, I was wondering if you had any thoughts on whether or not there's still a big gap between the ramp-up of Pascal supply and the pent-up demand for those new products. Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","Sure. So, I would say that we're probably in the first at bat of the first inning of GRID, and the reason for that is this. We've prepared ourselves. We went to spring training camp. We came up through the \u2013 they call it the farm league or something like that. I'm not really a baseball player, but I heard some people talk about it.","And so I think we're probably at the first at bat at the first inning. The thing that \u2013 the reason why I'm excited about it is because I believe in the future applications are virtualized in the datacenter or in the cloud. On first principles, on first principles, I believe that data applications will be virtualized and that you'll be able to enjoy these applications irrespective of whether you're using a PC, a Chrome notebook, a Mac or a Linux Workstation. It simply won't matter.","And yet, on the other hand, I believe that in the future, applications will become increasingly GPU accelerated. And so, how do you put something in the cloud that have no GPUs and how do you GPU accelerate these applications that are increasingly GPU accelerated? And so, the answer is of course putting GPUs in the cloud and putting GPUs in datacenters. And that's what GRID is all about. It's about virtualization, it's about putting GPUs in large scale datacenters and be able to virtualize the applications so that we can enjoy it on any computer, on any device and putting computing closer to the data.","So, I think we're just in the beginning of that. And that could explain why GRID is, finally, after a long period of time of building the ecosystem, building the infrastructure, developing all the software, getting the quality of service to be just really exquisite, working with the ecosystem partners, it's really taken off. And I could surely expect to see it continue to grow at the rate that we're seeing for some time.","In terms of Pascal, we are still ramping. Production is fully ramped in the sense that all of our products are fully qualified, they're on the market, they have been certified and qualified with OEMs. However, demand is still fairly high. And so we're going to continue to work hard, and our manufacturing partner TSMC is doing a great job for us. The yields are fantastic for 2016 FinFET, and they're just doing a fantastic job supporting us. And so we're just going to keep running at it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.","Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Thank you very much. Great quarter by the way; I'm still amazed how good this is. Can you talk a little bit about the size of the inference opportunity? Obviously, you guys have done really well in training. I assume penetrating inference is reasonably early on. But can you talk about how you see GPUs competitively versus FPGAs on that side of it and how big you think that opportunity could become? Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","Sure. I'll start backwards. I'll start backwards and answer the FPGA question first. FPGA is good in a lot of things, and anything that you could do in an FPGA if the market opportunity is large, you could always \u2013 it's always better to develop an ASIC. And FPGA is what you use when the volume is not large. FPGA is what you use when you're not certain about the functionality you want to put into something. FPGA is largely useful when the volume's not large, because you can build an ASIC and build a full custom chip that obviously can deliver more performance, not 20% more performance but 10 times better performance and better energy efficiency than you could using FPGAs. And so I think that's a well-known fact.","Our strategy is very different than any of that. Our strategy is really about building a computing platform. Our GPU is not a specific function thing anymore. It's a general purpose parallel processor. CUDA can do molecular dynamics, it could do fluid dynamics, it could do partial differential equations, it could do linear algebra, it could do artificial intelligence, it could be used for seismic analysis, it could be used for computer graphics, even computer graphics, and so our GPU is incredibly flexible.","And it's really designed for \u2013 it's designed specifically for parallel throughput computing. And by combining it with the CPU, we've created a computing platform that is both good at sequential information, sequential instruction processing as well as very high throughput data processing. And so we've created a computing architecture that's good at both of those things.","The reason why we believe that's important is because several things. We want to build a computing platform that is useful to a large industry. You could use it for AI, you could use it for search, you could use it for video transcoding, you could use it for energy discovery, you could use it for health, you could use it for finance, you could use it for robotics, you could use it for all these different things.","So, on the first principles, we're trying to build a computing platform. It's a computing architecture and not a dedicated application thingy. And most of the customers that we're calling on, most of the markets that we're addressing and the areas that we've highlighted are all computer users. They need to use and deploy a computing platform and have the benefit of being able to rapidly improve their AI networks. AI is still in the early days. It's the early days of early days. And so GPU deep learning is going through innovations at a very fast clip.","Our GPU allows people to learn \u2013 to develop new networks and deploy new networks as quickly as possible. And so I think the way to think about it is, is think of our GPU as a computing platform. In terms of the market opportunity, the way I would look at it is this. The way I would look at it is, there are something along the lines of 5 million to 10 million hyperscale datacenter nodes. And I think \u2013 and you guys have heard me say this before \u2013 I think that tree is a new set of HPC clusters that have been added into these datacenters.","And then the next thing that's going to happen is that you're going to see GPUs being added to a lot of these 5 million to 10 million nodes, so that you could accelerate every single query that will likely come into the datacenter will be an AI query in the future. And so, I think GPUs have an opportunity to see a fairly large hyperscale installed base. But, beyond that, there's the enterprise market. Although a lot of computing is done in the cloud, a great deal of computing, especially the type of computing that we're talking about here that requires a lot of data, we're a data throughput machine, the type of computers that we're talking about tends to be one (40:36) enterprise.","And I believe a lot of the enterprise market is going to go towards AI and the type of things that we're looking for in the future is to simplify our business processes using AI, to find business intelligence or insight using AI, to optimize our supply chain using AI, to optimize our forecasting using AI, to optimize the way that we find and surprise and delight customers, digital customers or customers in digital, using AI. And so, all of these parts of the business operations of large companies, I think AI can really enhance.","And then the third \u2013 so hyperscale, enterprise computing, and then the third is something very, very new, it's called IoT. IoT, we're going have a trillion things. We're going to have a trillion things connected to the Internet over time, and they're going be measuring things from vibration to sound to images to temperature to air pressure to you name it. Okay? And so these things are going be all over the world and we're going to measure \u2013 we're going to be constantly measuring and monitoring their activity.","And using the only thing that we can imagine that can help to add value to that and find insight from that is really AI. Using deep learning, we could have these new types of computers. And they will likely be on premise or near the location of the cluster of things that you have. And monitor all of these devices and prevent them from failing, or adding intelligence to it so that they add more value to what it is that people have them do.","So, I think the size of the marketplace that we're addressing is really larger than any time in our history. And probably, the easiest way to think about it is we're now a computing platform company. We're simply a computing platform company and our focus is GPU computing, and one of the major applications is AI.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis with B. Riley & Company.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the stellar execution. Jen-Hsun, I wanted to go back to the automotive business. In the past, the company has mentioned that revenues consist of display and then on the autopilot side, both consulting and product revenues, but I think much more intensively on the consulting side for now. But as we look ahead to Xavier and the announcement that you had made inter-quarter that that's coming late next year, how should we expect that the revenue mix would evolve, not just from consulting to product but from Parker towards Xavier?","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","Yeah, that's \u2013 I don't know that I have really granular breakdowns for you, Craig, partly because I'm just not sure. But I think the dynamics are that self-driving cars is probably the most single most disruptive event \u2013 the most disruptive dynamic that's happening in the automotive industry. It's almost impossible for me to imagine that in five years' time, a reasonably capable car will not have autonomous capability at some level, and a very significant level at that.","And I think what Tesla has done by launching and having on the road in the very near-future here, a full autonomous driving capability using AI, that has sent a shock wave through the automotive industry. It's basically five years ahead. Anybody who's talking about 2021 and that's just a non-starter anymore. And I think that that's probably the most significant bit in the automotive industry. I just don't \u2013 anybody who is talking about autonomous capabilities in 2020 and 2021 is at the moment re-evaluating in a very significant way.","And so I think that, of course, will change how our business profile ultimately looks. It depends on those factors. Our autonomous vehicle strategy is relatively clear, but let me explain it anyways. Number one, we believe that autonomous vehicles is not a detection problem. It's an AI computing problem. That it's not just about detecting objects, it's about perception of the environment around you, it's about reasoning, reasoning about what to do, what is happening and what to do and to take action based on that reasoning, and to be continuously learning. And so I think that AI computing requires a fair amount of computation. And anybody who thought that it would take only 1 watt or 2 watt, basically, the amount of energy of \u2013 well, I'm not even \u2013 one-third the energy of a cell phone, I think it's just unfortunate and it's not going to happen any time soon.","And so I think people now recognize that AI computing is a very software-rich problem and it is a supremely exciting AI problem, and that deep learning and GPUs could add a lot of value. And it's going happen in 2017. It's not going to happen in 2021. And so I think number one. Number two, our strategy is to deploy a one architecture platform that is open that car companies could work on to leverage our software stack and create their network, their artificial intelligence network. And then we would address everything from highway cruising, excellent highway cruising to all the way to full autonomous to trucks to shuttles. And using one computing architecture, we could apply it for radar-based systems or radar plus cameras, radar plus cameras plus lidars, we could use it for all kinds of sensor fusion environments.","And so I think \u2013 our strategy, I think, is really resonating well with the industry as people now realize that we need the computation capability five years earlier. That we \u2013 that it's not a detection problem, but it's an AI computing problem and that software is really intensive. That these three observations, I think, has put us in a really good position.","Operator","And your next question comes from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets.","Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Great quarter across the board. I did want to return to the automotive segment, because the datacenter segment is talked about at length. With the new DRIVE PX platform increasing potentially the ASPs, how do we just think about ASPs for automotive going forward? And if I recall, you guys had about $30 million in backlog in terms of cars, I'm not sure, if possible maybe you can update there as well.","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","Let's see. I guess our architecture for DRIVE PX, Mitch, is at scalable. And so you could start from one Parker SoC and that allows you to have surround camera. It allows you to use AI for highway cruising. And if you would like to have even more cameras, so that your functionality could be used more frequently in more conditions, you could always add more processors. And so we go from one to four processors. And if it's a fully autonomous driverless car, a driverless taxi, for example, you might need more than even four of our processors. You might need eight processors. You might need 12 processors.","And the reason for that is because you need to reduce the circumstance by which autopilot doesn't work \u2013 doesn't turn on, excuse me, doesn't engage, and because you don't have a driver in the car at all. And so I think that depending on the application that you have, we'll have a different configuration and it's scalable. And it ranges from a few hundred dollars to a few thousand dollars. And so I think it just depends on what configuration people are trying to deploy.","Now, for a few thousand dollars, the productivity of that vehicle is incredible as you can simply do the math. It's much more available, the cost of operations is reduced, and a few thousand dollars is surely almost nothing in the context of that use case.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good afternoon. Congratulations on the solid execution and growth. Looking at some of your cloud customers, new services offerings, you guys mentioned AWS, the EC2 P2 platform, you have Microsoft Azure Cloud Services platforms, it's interesting because they're ramping new instances primarily using your K80 Accelerator platform, which means that the Maxwell-based and, the recently introduced, Pascal-based adoption curves are still way ahead of the team, which obviously is a great setup as it relates to the continued strong growth going forward. Can you just help us understand why the long design end-cycle times for these accelerators? And when do you expect the adoption curve for the Maxwell-based accelerators to start to kick in with some of your cloud customers?","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","Yeah, Harlan, good question. And it's exactly the reason why having started almost five years ago in working with all of these large scale datacenters is what it takes. And the reason for that is because several things has to happen. Applications has to be developed. Their hyperscale, which is their enterprise \u2013 their datacenter level software has to accommodate this new computing platform. The neural networks have to be developed and trained and ready for deployment. The GPUs have to be tested against every single datacenter and every single server configuration that they have. And it takes that type of time to deploy at the scales that we're talking about. And so I think that that's number one.","The good news is, is that between Kepler and Maxwell and Pascal, the architecture is identical, even though the underlying architecture has been improved dramatically and the performance increases dramatically, the software layer is the same. And so that's \u2013 the adoption rate of our future generation is going be much, much faster and you'll see that. But it takes that long to integrate our software and our architecture and our GPUs into all of the datacenters around the world. It takes a lot of work. It takes a long time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Yes. Thank you, Jen-Hsun. I just wanted to ask regarding the AutoPilot win, we know that you guys displaced Mobileye, and I was just curious if you could talk about why Tesla chose your GPU and what you can sort of give us in terms of the ramp and timing. And how does this \u2013 how would a ramp like this affect automotive gross margin?","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","I think there are three things that we offer today. The first thing is that it's not a detection problem it's an AI computing problem. And a computer has processors, and the architecture is coherent and you can program it, you can write software, you can compile to it. It's an AI computing problem. And our GPU computing architecture has the benefit of 10 years of refinement. In fact, this year is the 10-year anniversary of our first GPU, our first CUDA GPU called G80. And we've been working on this for 10 years. And so the number one is autonomous driving. Autonomous vehicles is a AI computing problem. It's not a detection problem.","Second, car companies realize that they need to deliver, ultimately, a service, that the service is a network of cars by which they continuously improve. It's like phones. It's like phones. It's like set-top boxes. You have to maintain and serve that customer because they're interested in the service of autonomous driving. It's not a functionality. Autonomous driving is always being improved with better maps and better driving behavior and better perception capability and better AI. And so the software component of it, the software component of it and the ability for car companies to own their own software once they develop it on our platform is a real positive. And real positive to the point where it's enabling or it's essential for the future of the driving fleet.","And then the third \u2013 to be able to continue to do OTA on. And third is simply the performance and energy level. I don't believe it's actually possible at this moment in time to deliver an AI computing platform of the performance level that is required to do autonomous driving and an energy efficiency level that is possible in a car and to put all that functionality together in a reasonable way. I believe DRIVE PX 2 is the only viable solution on the planet today. And so I \u2013 because Tesla had a great intention to deliver this level of capability to the world five years ahead of anybody else, we were a great partner for them. Okay? So those are probably the three reasons.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Canaccord Genuity.","Matthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Jen-Hsun, I make an interesting observation about your commentary that your company has gone from a sort of a graphic accelerator company to a computing platform company, and I think that's fantastic. One of the things that I wonder as maybe AI and deep learning acceleration sort of standardize on your platform, what you're seeing and hearing in the Valley about startup activity and folks that are trying to innovate around the platform that you're bringing up both complementary to what you're doing and potentially really long-term competitive to what you're doing. I'd just love to hear your perspectives on that. Thanks.","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","Yeah, Matthew. I really appreciate that. We see just a large number of AI startups around the world. There's a very large number here in the United States, of course. There's quite a significant number in China. There is a very large number in Europe. There's a large number in Canada. It's pretty much a global event. The number of software companies that have now jumped onto using GPU deep learning and taking advantage of the computing platform that we've taken almost seven years to build and is really quite amazing.","We're tracking about 1,500. We have a program called Inception. And Inception is our startup support program, if you will. They can get access to our early technology, they can get access to our expertise, our computing platform, and all that we've learned about deep learning we can share with many of these startups. As they're trying to use deep learning in industries from cyber security to genomics to consumer applications, computational finance to IoT, robotics, self-driving cars, the number of startups out there is really quite amazing.","And so our deep learning platform is a real unique advantage for them because it's available in a PC. So you can \u2013 almost anybody with even a couple hundred dollars of spending money can get a startup going with a NVIDIA GPU that can do deep learning. It's available from system builders and server OEMs all over the world, HP, Dell, Cisco, IBM, system builders, small system builders, local system builders all over the world. And very importantly, it's available in cloud datacenters all over the world.","So, the Amazon AWS, Microsoft's Azure cloud has a really fantastic implementation ready to scale out. You've got the IBM Cloud, you've got Alibaba Cloud. So, if you have a few dollars an hour for computing, you pretty much can get a company started and use the NVIDIA platform in all of these different places. And so it's an incredibly productive platform because of its performance. It works with every framework in the world. It's available basically everywhere. And so, as a result of that, we've given artificial intelligence startups anywhere on the planet the ability to jump on and create something. And so our \u2013 the availability, if you will, the marketization of deep learning, NVIDIA's GPU deep learning, is really quite enabling for startups.","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks very much. It was really impressive that 60% growth in your gaming revenues. So does this imply that there was a 60% jump in cards that are being sold by online retailers and retail stores or does the growth reflect new channels through which NVIDIA gaming products are getting to customers?","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","It's largely the same channels. Our channel has been pretty stable for some time. And we have a large network. I appreciate the question. It's one of our great strengths, if you will. We cultivated over two decades a network of partners who take the GeForce platform out to the world. And you could access our GPUs, you can access GeForce and be part of the GeForce PC gaming platform from literally anywhere on the planet.","And so that's a real advantage and we're really proud of them. I guess you could also say that Nintendo contributed a fair amount to that growth. And over the next \u2013 as you know, the Nintendo architecture and the company tends to stick with an architecture for a very long time. And so we've worked with them now for almost two years. Several hundred engineering years have gone into the development of this incredible game console. I really believe when everybody sees it and enjoy it, they're going be amazed by it. It's really like nothing they've ever played with before. And of course, the brand, their franchise and their game content is incredible. And so I think this is a relationship that will likely last two decades and I'm super excited about it.","Operator","We have no more time for questions.","Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.","Well, thank you very much for joining us today. I would leave you with several thoughts that, first, we're seeing growth across all of our platforms from gaming to pro-graphics to cars to datacenters. The transformation of our company from a chip company to a computing platform company is really gaining traction.","Now you could see that the results of our work as a result of things like GameWorks and GFE and DriveWorks, all of the AI that goes on top of that, our graphics virtualization remoting platform called GRID to the NVIDIA GPU deep learning toolkit, are just really, really examples of how we've transformed a company from a chip to a computing platform company.","In no time in the history of our company have we enjoyed and addressed an exciting large markets as we have today, whether it's artificial intelligence, self-driving cars, the gaming market, as it continues to grow and evolve and virtual reality. And of course, we all know now very well that GPU deep learning has ignited a wave of AI innovation all over the world.","And our strategy and the thing that we've been working on for the last seven years is building an end-to-end AI computing platform, an end-to-end AI computing platform, starting from GPUs that we have optimized and evolved and enhanced for deep learning to system architectures, to algorithms for deep learning, to tools necessary for developers, to frameworks and the work that we do with all of the framework developers and AI researchers around the world, to servers, to cloud datacenters, to ecosystems and working with ISVs and startups, and all the way to evangelizing and teaching people how to use deep learning to revolutionize the software that they build. And we call that the Deep Learning Institute, the NVIDIA DLI.","And so these are some of the high level points that I hope that you got, and I look forward to talking to you again next quarter.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

My name is Enrika, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the NVIDIA Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Rob Csongor, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin your conference.","Rob Csongor","Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to NVIDIA's Conference Call on Third Quarter of Fiscal 2013 Results. With me on the call today from NVIDIA are Jen-Hsun Huang, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Burns, Interim Chief Financial Officer.","After our prepared remarks, we will open up the call to a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that today's call is being webcast live on NVIDIA's Investor Relations website and is also being recorded. A replay of the conference call will be available via telephone until November 16, 2012, and the webcast will be available for replay until our conference call to discuss our financial results for our fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. The content of today's conference call is NVIDIA's property and cannot be reproduced or transcribed without our prior written consent.","During the course of this call, we may make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of factors that could affect our future financial results and business, please refer to the disclosure in today's earnings release, our Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended July 29, 2012, and the reports we may file from time to time on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","All our statements are made as of today, November 8, 2012, based on information available to us as of today and, except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements. Unless otherwise noted, all reference to market research and market share numbers throughout the call come from Mercury Research or Jon Peddie Research.","During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our financial release, which is posted on our website.","With that, let's begin. We are pleased to report that NVIDIA achieved record revenue and record gross margin in the third quarter, driven by strong demand for our energy-efficient Kepler GPUs and Tegra 3, the world's only 4-PLUS-1 mobile quad-core processor. Our strategies to reinvent our company are driving growth. They are: first, create the most energy-efficient processors; second, invent mobile and cloud-computing technologies that will grow us beyond the PC; and third, create solutions for special-purpose PC markets, where we can make a significant contribution such as gaming, design, media and entertainment and GPU-accelerated computing.","This quarter, we not only grew our PC business. We also significantly increased our business beyond the PC: in tablets, quad-core phones, data centers and automobiles. NVIDIA processors rolled out in Q3 in a range of new devices and settings, from Google's Nexus 7 tablet and Microsoft's Surface to Oak Ridge National Laboratory's new supercomputer and Tesla's latest electric sedan, which was just named Car of the Year by Automobile Magazine.","3 years ago, non-PC revenues were 7% of total revenues. This quarter, they grew to a record 30%. Our notebook GPU business recorded a second consecutive record quarter.","In the premium segment, we increased market share with Kepler as part of the Ivy Bridge design cycle. Consumers are also now starting to realize that a great tablet is better than a cheap PC. Because of Tegra, Android and Windows RT, the entry-level PC market is now a new opportunity for us. Our desktop GPU business increased again this quarter. With improved supply now available, we delivered Kepler into the volume PC gaming market. With the majority of gamers using graphics cards that are below the recommended specifications of the wave of new games coming out, Kepler is a great upgrade for the millions of PC gamers around the world looking to play Assassin's Creed III, Far Cry 3 or Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 this Christmas holiday.","Our Professional Solutions business was up, driven by a record quarter for Tesla. In Q3, we shipped more than 18,000 NVIDIA Tesla K20 GPU accelerators to Oak Ridge National Laboratory for their new Titan supercomputer. With 50 million CUDA cores working together, these new Kepler-based GPUs delivered 90% of Titan's 20 petaflops of peak processing performance, making Titan the fastest open-science supercomputer in the world.","While the Quadro business was roughly flat quarter-to-quarter, it was down from last year, consistent with softness in the global workstation market. Our strategies to grow better than the market include new Kelper Quadro products to refresh Romley-based workstations in the latter part of the year, as well as new capabilities like Maximus, enabling both modeling and simulation in one workstation.","In addition, this quarter, we also announced the industry's first cloud-based GPU that delivers workstation graphics capabilities to any screen. Built on the Kepler architecture, the cloud-based NVIDIA VGX K2 GPU will allow engineers and design professionals to work anywhere on virtually any device and still have access to the computing and graphics performance of a GPU-powered workstation.","Tegra had another record quarter, driven primarily by the emergence of Tegra 3 as the applications processor of choice for many of the world's most popular tablet. According to Strategy Analytics data, market share for Android tablets grew in Q3 to 41% from Q2's 29%. Tegra 3 is now powering a number of Android tablets, including the highly successful $199 Google Nexus 7. It also began powering Windows PCs with the launch of Windows RT devices. These include Microsoft's revolutionary Surface, Lenovo's IdeaPad Yoga 11 and the ASUS Vivo Tab.","Additionally, new Tegra 3 smartphones were released in important markets. Of note, AT&T announced that they will be launching the new HTC One X+, the first Tegra 3 LTE phone to ship in the U.S. market. And ZTE announced the U950 quad-core smartphone, which delivers Tegra 3 to a new price segment for the China smartphone market. This segment is about 30 million to 40 million units large.","NVIDIA's automotive business also delivered a record quarter and continued its steady growth, as a growing number of leading auto brands choose Tegra to drive their infotainment and navigation systems.","With that, let me hand the call over to Karen.","Karen Burns","Thanks, Rob. We had record revenue this quarter of $1.2 billion, up 15.3% quarter-over-quarter and 12.9% year-over-year. As in the second quarter, revenue was driven by strong demand for our Kepler GPUs in desktops and record performances by our notebook and Tegra products.","We also achieved record gross margin on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Our GAAP gross margin was 52.9%, up 1.1 percentage points sequentially and up 0.7 point year-over-year.","Our non-GAAP gross margin was 53.1%, up 1.1 points sequentially and up 0.6 point from a year earlier. These record margins reflect the continued transition to Kepler GPUs from our previous Fermi generation and a mix more weighted to high-end segments.","GAAP OpEx was $384.4 million, and non-GAAP was $344.8 million, both better than our outlook. GAAP OpEx was down quarter-over-quarter due to the absence of a non-recurring charge of $20.1 million in Q2 related to our announced charitable contribution. Non-GAAP OpEx, which excluded this charge, was up slightly from the prior quarter, driven by planned strategic hiring and higher engineering-related costs, offset by lower compensation costs, including FICA, and reductions in discretionary expenses.","These results contributed to GAAP net income of $209.1 million, a 75.6% increase over the prior quarter and 17.3% year-over-year. That's equivalent to $0.33 per diluted share, which was up 73.7% sequentially and 13.8% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $245.5 million, up 44% sequentially and 13.1% year-over-year. That's $0.39 per diluted share, which was a 44.4% increase sequentially and 11.4% year-over-year.","Revenue results by business segment were as follows. Our GPU business was up 10.7% sequentially and 14.7% year-over-year. This was due to the continued launch of our new Kepler desktop products and our OEM partners launching new Ivy Bridge platform for notebook.","Our Professional business was up 12.4% sequentially due to the first shipments of our new Kepler-based Tesla products, supporting the new Titan supercomputer. Year-over-year, our Professional business was down 4.2%. The strength in Tesla year-over-year was partially offset by the weak economic conditions impacting demand for our Quadro products.","Our Consumer business was up 35.7% sequentially and 27.6% year-over-year on the strength of our Tegra business.","Inventory in our desktop channel business remains stable at levels we believe are healthy. DSO was 34 days, down 5 days from the prior quarter. Accounts receivable and DSO decreased in the current quarter despite the increase in revenue as a result of shipment linearity and strong collections.","DSI was 69 days, down 1 day from the prior quarter. We increased inventory by $41.8 million from the prior quarter, largely for production builds of our Kepler GPU products in support of expected demand, offset by declines in our Fermi-based GPUs.","Our GAAP outlook for the fourth quarter is as follows: revenue of $1.025 billion to $1.175 billion; gross margin of 52.9%, flat from third quarter; OpEx of approximately $400 million; and a tax rate of 20%, plus or minus 1 percentage point.","For non-GAAP, we expect the following differences from our GAAP outlook: gross margin of 53.1%, flat from Q3; and OpEx of approximately $359 million, which excludes stock-based compensation and certain other charges related to acquisitions in the aggregate of approximately $41 million.","We expect our tax rate to be approximately 19%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. Depreciation and amortization are expected to be in the range of $58 million to $60 million and capital expenditures of $60 million to $70 million. Diluted shares are expected to be approximately 629 million.","Lastly, we are very pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has approved the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend and has also approved the extension of our existing share repurchase program to December 31, 2014. The quarterly dividend of $0.075 per share is equivalent to $0.30 per share on an annual basis and approximates an annual yield of about 2.4% based on yesterday's closing stock price of $12.61.","We have increased our cash by $305.2 million this fiscal year, with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the current quarter of $3.43 billion compared to $3.13 billion at Q4 fiscal 2012.","We are committed to return cash to our shareholders and made this decision based on our strong cash position and the high confidence we have in our business to continue generating future cash.","Thanks, Rob.","Rob Csongor","That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question does come from Alex Gauna with JMP Securities.","Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","I was wondering if you could speak to underlying fundamentals right now on the PC business. I know that you're taking share, but to the extent that you can maybe address how you see seasonality extending into Q1, and I was wondering if you could also speak to that same effect in your enterprise business.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, the P -- you're right that we're gaining share, our fundamentals are better than ever. Our GPU position is better than ever whether it's GeForce or Quadro for workstations or Tesla for high-performance computing. We're increasing share. Our position is better than ever, and -- but the end market is uncertain. The PC end market is uncertain as you've seen in other businesses. And so we're going to take a rather cautious approach to our outlook.","Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","I'm wondering if maybe you can address with your modestly down sequential outlook, where do you think you're baking in the most conservatism and where could be the greatest opportunity for upside surprise?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, if you look at year-over-year -- look at this quarter year-over-year, the business that had underperformed all the other business was our Quadro business. And that's related to enterprise weakness, but it's also associated with the fact that Romley, the server platform, was delayed by some time for workstations. It's in the process of ramping now. And we think that, that held back some purchases of new workstations as people waited for this new platform. It's surely a lot better than the previous generation. And so, hopefully, as Romley gets out into the marketplace with the new Kepler GPUs, we're going to see the workstation market recover. But the end markets, whether it's notebooks or desktop, our expectation and our outlook is that it's softer than we had originally predicted.","Operator","Your next question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Jen-Hsun, just curious from your perspective, what's contributing to the uncertainty in the PC market?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, we're not seeing anything unusual than anybody else. The end markets are softer than this time last year. If -- I guess, I'm surprised that you asked at all, although I think the overall market seems to indicate that the holiday season for PC sales is a little softer than expected. And it's global. It's not particularly related to one particular geography. But China is softer. Europe is softer. The U.S. is -- seems okay. But the vast majority of the end markets appear to be uncertain.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","The reason I asked the question is, from Intel's perspective, they've highlighted the macro, as well as the fact that some of these other devices like tablets are eating into the PC TAM. But curious from your perspective, if you see one issue being a bigger issue -- a bigger problem than the other.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, our view of the PC TAM is that it is being eaten by tablets. And the reason for that is because a great tablet is surely better than a cheap PC. And these days, the tablets are so versatile. And many of them are transformable and have hybrid tablet, as well as notebook usage models. And now with the Surface -- Microsoft Surface and Win RT, the distinction between a PC -- a cheap PC and a great tablet is all but disappeared. And in fact, we see our tablet business grew 100% year-over-year. And so I think that the PC market, especially the cheap PC market -- but we don't really play in the cheap PC market. The low-end part of the cheap PC market is all integrated. And so our opportunity is to replace and going into that marketplace with the Tegra processors and the tablets that we serve. So for us, the vast majority of uncertainty is just end market of PC.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And just as a follow-up, I was hoping you could give us a sense of how aggressive you plan to be with the buyback over the next 2 years.","Jen-Hsun Huang","We haven't decided. I assume that you're pleased with the dividend, and we're surely pleased by that. And our Board of Directors has extended our stock buyback plan to 2014, as Karen had said. And so we'll evaluate it from time to time, and we'll be in the market.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Wong with Wells Fargo.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","First, quick administrative one. You're guiding for GAAP operating expenses to rise sequentially in the January quarter even though your revenues are coming down. So is there a big jump in R&D? And where does that come from?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Our big jump in R&D comes from really 2 places. One, we're in the process of going to market with our next-generation mobile processor. And that's a -- we're really excited about that next-generation processor, and we're ramping very hard. The second part is our 4G LTE modem. In order for us to really gain a larger footprint in smartphones, we have to integrate 4G LTE modem into our application processor. This is a brand-new market for us. Although we are already shipping some quantities of discrete LTE modems, the vast majority of the marketplace is really integrated. And so our -- we have a next-generation application processor integrated with a next-generation LTE. And this quarter, we hope to tape out and race it to market. And so our OpEx has increased so that we can invest in that initiative. It's obviously a very, very large market opportunity for us, and so we're very quite bullish about it.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And actually, related to that, can you give us some feel for what proportion of Tegra are tablets rather than smartphones? And do you expect Tegra for Windows RT tablets to be up or down in the January quarter?","Jen-Hsun Huang","We expect -- I'll go backwards. We expect the tablet sales to be down in the January quarter because most of the tablets go into -- we shipped most of the tablet processors into manufacturing for our OEMs for their holiday build. Overall, our tablets are up 100% year-over-year. Our Tegra processors overall is up about 50% year-over-year. And so that gives you a sense that the vast majority of the Tegra growth has come from tablets, and Super Phones has been relatively stable. And one of the reasons why we are so interested in integrating our application processor with a 4G modem, so that we can expand the reach of our application processors into Super -- into more of the smartphone marketplace. This is really a great opportunity for us. Because if you think about the number of companies in the world that can combine a world-class CPU, a world-class GPU, a 4G modem and has the expertise and the complicated software stacks necessary to partner with all of the companies on the various computing devices, there aren't really that many companies. And this is a great opportunity for us, and so we're investing aggressively to get 4G into our product line.","Operator","Your next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Maybe to start off, can you just give us more color directionally what your 3 segments are going to be trending in the fourth quarter?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Let's see, I think the -- we're expecting our overall business to be down. And there are really 2 drivers of that, that the -- we're being cautious about the PC end markets. The entire -- we're seeing relatively similar behavior across each one of the regions. Although our position is better than ever in GPUs and in our workstation business, the PSP business, as well as our Consumer business where the Tegra business is, we're expecting some amount of end market softness. The second thing I've just -- I explained to David that the tablet will be down, even though the devices that we're in are incredibly successful. The Nexus 7 is selling super well. And the Surface and the Win RT devices are really exciting. And, however, the vast majority of the builds for the holidays have to happen for the holidays. And so we shipped more proportionally to them in Q3 than in Q4. But overall, year-over-year, the tablet has doubled. And the overall Tegra business has increased 50%. And so I think that we'll see how the market -- the end markets do. And nobody's going to know until it's done. So but if it does well, we're really well positioned to take advantage of it.","Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And then on the desktop GPU side, it looks like you had solid growth there in the third quarter. And I know that a big percentage of this business is tied to gaming. In the U.S., we've seen several new and much-anticipated game releases. I could clearly see that as a big demand driver for the team. But the team has often talked about the gaming environment in Asia as being an even bigger driver for your GeForce products. So maybe you can just spend a little bit of time, kind of highlighting what are some of that trends in Asia that are responsible for -- what were responsible for kind of the solid demand trends for your Kepler-based products in the second half of this year.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yes. In fact, our GeForce business has been growing steadily, and it remains robust. The driver for that, of course, is PC gaming. The gaming marketplace is very, very large. And each one of the regions has a slightly different dynamic. Here in the West, we're going to see a couple of really huge titles coming out. Call of Duty is coming out this holiday season, Far Cry is coming out, and Assassin's Creed is coming out. And the anticipation is really great for those. In China, the dynamics are rather different completely. On the one hand, there are no game consoles really in China, so the PC is the game console of China. And the second dynamic is their discovery of free-to-play, massive online, multiplayer online games that are free to play. And that people can enjoy with easy access and play it and pay as they go. All they need to have is a great GeForce card, and they can enjoy just about all the games they can play. And so I think the global PC gaming marketplace is quite vibrant. And we'll just take a cautious look as we -- cautious posture going into Q4, as we're uncertain about the end markets. But if the end markets prove to be healthy and prove to be good, we're well positioned to take advantage of it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James.","Brian C. Peterson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","This is Brian Peterson in for Hans. Could you talk about 28-nanometer supply, if that was a limitation at all this quarter, and what impact that may have on your January quarter outlook?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, the 28-nanometer yield and 28-nanometer supply situation have both improved substantially. And so we feel pretty good about the balance of supply and demand at the moment.","Operator","And your next question comes from Mike McConnell with Pacific Crest.","Michael McConnell - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Looking at -- just backing into the number for Tegra for fiscal Q3, I come to about $165 million. Is that the ballpark for Q3?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Roughly.","Michael McConnell - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then looking at the $30 million, call it, order backing into that, that you got from Oak Ridge, is that a onetime item? Or is that expected to continue into F Q4, onetime order, as you say?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, supercomputers are built once -- one at a time. But there are other supercomputers that are going to be built around the world, if that's what you mean. Kepler is just ramping for supercomputing, for high-performance computing. And so Oak Ridge and the Titan was the first supercomputer we built into. And we've been planning on this for over a year. And so that was a very significant challenge for us. And it says something, that the world's largest supercomputer would have chosen the Kepler GPU to power 90% of its computation. And we're hoping that Titan is going to deliver some amazing breakthroughs in science. This is the largest open-science supercomputer in the world. This is the fastest open-science supercomputer in the world. And it also -- it was also the first supercomputer that we delivered Kepler to. At this point, we have supercomputers all over the world that we need to go build out. The run rate for Kepler is about 2x the run rate of Fermi 1 year ago. And so this is -- it really shows that people understand now that GPU-accelerated supercomputing, or GPU-accelerated high-performance computing is really the most energy-efficient and also dollar-efficient way of computation. And so I think we're starting to see that we're about reaching the tipping point of accelerated computing here. And we're really excited about it. It's been quite a journey and quite an investment. But now CUDA is impacting every aspect of our business. In Tesla, you could see the progress there we just talked about. CUDA is also making it possible for workstations and design applications to design and simulate at the same time. CUDA is also making it possible for our PC gaming GeForce to be able to use simulation for special effects and to materials and dynamics in the virtual world. And so CUDA is -- has proven to be a real lift for our entire GPU business. And I would go so far as to say that, because of CUDA, we have kept the GPU continuing to grow into more and more applications, and as a result, continue to grow the business.","Karen Burns","I just want to be clear. Just on your first question, just a clarification. As we disclosed in the CFO commentary, the CPB increase quarter-over-quarter, that's almost entirely Tegra. So I think your number was understated.","Michael McConnell - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, Jen-Hsun, just one longer-term question on Tegra. A few of us attended ARM's Tech Conference last week. And there was a session with Samsung. And they were pretty straightforward that with Exynos, they're going to be looking at more of a merchant strategy going forward. And they also expressed some pretty strong interest in Windows RT. As you look at the competitive landscape next year for Tegra, and just the resources that Samsung has, their own fabrication facilities, does that alter your view of the competitive landscape at all, when you kind of think about Samsung potentially getting involved in this business segment?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, Samsung is surely a formidable company. And to most customers, Samsung is just downright scary. And you've heard Asia's posture about Samsung. And so I think that our focus is pretty simple. We have to continue to stay ahead of them technologically, and we have the capability to do so. We're one of the few companies in the world that has the ability to do so in the area of computing. Number two, we are a neutral and a friendly partner for all of the companies that Samsung competes against. And in most of these devices that you're talking about, it's not a -- it's not like selling a DRAM. It's about -- it's like collaborating to build computers. And so it's engineers working hand-in-hand with other engineers. And so if there's concern about trade secrets, if there's concerns about confidentiality, we are one that they have no concerns about. And so we're not going to win everywhere. But as you know, Tegra is a small business. This is -- we still have an opportunity to grow well over 50% each year. And surely, as we look into next year, between our next-generation processor, the new segments that we're in and the fact that we're going to introduce our own 4G-integrated modem processors, I think our growth opportunity is still pretty exciting.","Operator","Your next question comes from Daniel Amir with Lazard Capital Markets.","Daniel L. Amir - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions here. First of all, just from a housekeeping perspective, on the tax rate here, how should we be looking at the tax rate into next year? And then I have one follow-up.","Karen Burns","The tax rate is as we disclosed, as far as our best outlook next year, who knows? I mean, we just got the elections done and we'll see what Congress does and what the our new President will be able to drive.","Daniel L. Amir - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then kind of to follow up a bit to the previous question, I mean, where do we stand kind of in Project Denver? I mean, what's kind of the latest there? What's your thought a bit about how the ARM market will develop and kind of NVIDIA's position there?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, Project Denver is a 64-bit processor. And it's a full-custom v8 64-bit processor with some exciting secret sauce. And we haven't revealed much about it. There are no 64 bits processors shipping today, as you know. And v8 was just announced. The next 64-bit was just announced. And so, I guess, the only thing I could tell you is Denver is going great.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","That was a good response. At least, you gave your perspective to Mike's question, but I just wanted to follow up on that a little bit. The analogy between the tablet market and the PC market, it -- correct me if I'm wrong, in the PC market, you had refreshes and -- between you and AMD. And you would, on the back of your architecture, you would win a socket and lose a socket. And that could last 1.5 year, but when I look at the tablet market, so you got a marquee design win, Google 7, Nexus 7 and then the 10 goes back to Samsung. Is there anything different here that you can drive that can lead to more sustainability of design wins, and not just Google, just kind of broadly? And again, I wanted to just put that out there that you guys have done a good job and not sitting idly and targeting, going after the mobile space and expanding your TAM. And then my quick follow-up, Jen-Hsun, if I may, the low-end TAM you mentioned, how big is that TAM for you on the low-end PC side that you did not address before?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, I could tell you what our focus is. Our focus is to build the world's best mobile computers. And to do that, you need to have a great SoC, you need to have a great GPU, and you need to have extraordinary software capability. And there are multiple platforms: there's Android, there's Android phones, there's Win RT, there's Linux, there's Chrome, there's Windows 8 phone, there's quite a few platforms. And we have the capacity as a company, both technologically as well as resources, to be able to partner with many of these companies, these ecosystem owners, to build these great computers. And you're right, we're not going to win them all. But as you can see, we win our fair share. And we're winning more and more every day. We won about 100% more this year than we did last year. And my hope is that we'll win even more next year. And every time we expand the reach of our company into new platforms, and this year was Win RT, it really expanded the reach of our company and expanded our growth. And so we're just going to keep -- stay focused on that. And one of the attributes of our company is technology leadership. You can trust us, to partner deeply with us, to build these complicated devices. And I think that's a real virtue. With respect to the size of the PC TAM you're alluding to, and what I also believe and now what the world has seen, that a great tablet is every bit better than a cheap PC. And that is the reason why tablets are gaining the favoritism of consumers all over the world. It's easier to use, it's more delightful to use, and it's more useful. And the cheap PC market represents probably a couple of hundred to 200 million units a year. The vast majority of the world's PCs are affordable PCs, as you know. They're cheap PCs. And that segment is now wide open, as these mobile processors have become more and more capable. And you know that disruption comes from the bottom. The disruption comes from the bottom because the volumes are so high. In just 2 years' time, this year, we'll probably ship around 30 million Tegra processors. And that just happened in the blink of an eye. And that's -- and yet there's enormous markets ahead of it. And so once an instruction-set architecture like the ARM CPU reaches critical mass and the developers all focus on it, it becomes more and more valuable. And it becomes more useful. And as more companies drive and compete in this ecosystem, in this marketplace, we make the SoCs better and better. And before you know it, it disrupts the market above. And the market above is -- directly above the tablet is the cheap PC market. And so that's a big opportunity for us, especially now with Win RT. And so I'm super excited about it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Craig Ellis with Caris & Company.","Unknown Analyst","This is Brett Perry [ph] here for Craig. Obviously, within Tegra, you're doing well in tablets. Can you talk a little bit about the smartphone mix you have in there and design wins maybe that you have compared to -- I think you've referenced 30 before?","Jen-Hsun Huang","We -- this year, for Super Phones, we did about as well this year as we did last year. Last year, we had Motorola, we had LG, we had some others. This year, we had the benefit of working with HTC; Fujitsu, the #1 in Japan; ZTE; and with Wayne, our next-generation processor, we will have even more. And so each year, we're able to gain the trust and develop the reputation to work with more and more smartphone companies. And so we're going to continue to expand in that segment. It -- for us to really grow in the smartphone marketplace, as you know, we need to really integrate a modem. And that's one of the reasons why we -- well, that's the reason why we bought this really great company called Icera. And we have 4G LTE now certified at AT&T data side. And we're in the process of working on voice. Now one of the reasons why our OpEx is high -- increased for next quarter is our increased investment in our integrated application processor in 4G from product. And so if we can get that to market soon, and which we hope, we'll be able to expand our smartphone opportunity quite dramatically. And now that we have the software stack developed with each one of the phone companies, the opportunity could be quite significant for us.","Unknown Analyst","And then on the GPU side, could you talk about the trends you're seeing? But then, obviously, I think ASP should probably be up within the GPU. By how much that was up compared to units in the quarter?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Maybe Karen could tell you the exact numbers. But overall, the -- with the exception of Quadro, which was down year-over-year -- it was down year-over-year not because we lost any share, not because ASP was down. In fact, ASP was stable. Gross margin was stable. Our position in that marketplace is better than ever. The workstation marketplace was just generally soft. Two reasons, as I mentioned earlier, I think the end market was soft and the delay of the Romley platform, workstation platform, caused some delayed buying in the marketplace. But overall, the GPU marketplace was -- our GPU business was up about 15% year-over-year. And I think -- I would think that the ASPs was up.","Karen Burns","Yes. So volume was fairly -- I mean, we had an increase in volume, but I think the bigger piece is we're selling more Kepler GPUs. And those are at higher ASPs than our older-generation Fermi. So as far as the mix in GPU, it's much richer. So yes, ASP higher overall.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dale Pfau with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Dale Pfau - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Could you talk a little bit about the integration of the voice stack on your Icera baseband with your applications processor? Other companies historically have struggled with this. Could you tell us where you are? And if you're still on track to introduce your Grey to the market here in, what, the first calendar quarter, I think, originally was where you're going to do it?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Backwards, Grey is on tract. And we have already shipped a voice stack on our Icera modem. We shipped it with ZTE. And our focus now is really move -- and that's the 3G data modem, 3G stack. We're now moving all of our focus to 4G and LTE. And so it is a very significant effort. And we have been endeavoring there for some time now. And we're quite enthusiastic about going to market with Grey.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank Securities.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","In the Consumer business, and more specifically in the Tegra business, Jen-Hsun, how do you think about balancing the profitability versus the growth as you go forward in that?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, we've been investing in Tegra now for a few years. But mobile computing, as you know, is the future of computing. There is no computing beyond mobile computing in the future. Every computer will be mobile. And so this isn't really a question about we're expecting to be more or less profitable in Q3 or Q4. This is really about the future of the industry. And we, for all of the good fortune and good decisions, have gotten ourselves in a pretty great place in mobile computing. And I think that we have now an opportunity to integrate our 4G modem and expand deeper into the smartphone market; continue to execute our roadmap; and because of the enormous implications of Win RT, give us the opportunity to grow into the PC marketplace. The future of cheap PCs is really tablets, great tablets. They're likely be Win RT tablets. They could be -- they may very well be Android tablets. I could even imagine them being Chrome tablets. And so these are -- and these tablets have keyboards, of course, so they're sometimes touch tablets, sometimes they're a notebook. But I think we all recognize now that this is likely the future of the computer industry. And so I think we find ourselves in a really exciting time. And Win RT just went to market. I'm really excited about it. We're seeing people using it all over. And next year, I think we're going to see even more. And so this is pretty exciting stuff.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And I guess, as my follow-up, just sticking with the Tegra side and some of the modem comments you made earlier. As far as the -- either the voice side of LTE or the fully integrated side, is there any sort of benchmarks timing-wise that we can look forward to as to when you expect those products to be available?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, we're taping out products now. We're taping out products, our integrated product now. And that's really the product that, that in about a year's time frame, will really, really matter to get us into a larger part of the smartphone market. In the meantime, we're also ramping into the marketplace our next-generation application processor. And so we're looking forward to a new generation of Super Phones that will be in. And so but the real big opportunity is going to come with integrated 4G modem, a processor that we internally call Grey.","Operator","Your next question comes from Raji Gill with Needham & Company.","Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions on Tegra, if I can. You talked about developing an integrated baseband in that processor to compete against Qualcomm, I would presume, which is the dominant player there. If you look at where Qualcomm is positioned in terms of its end customers, obviously, they have Apple, and they're benefiting from that. How do you intend to kind of take share away from Qualcomm in the market? And how do you look at the market in smartphone, which bifurcated between the high end, which is Samsung and Apple; and the low end, which is ZTE and Huawei, how do you look at the smartphone market? And how do you position your products relative to the competition?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yes. First of all, thank you very much, Raji. I think, first of all, we have already taken share from the mobile processor companies. The fact that Tegra is already a multi-hundred-million-dollar business on its way to being much larger is taking share from someone. And so we're brand new to this marketplace. And we've only been in it for 2 years. And so this is -- we're obviously -- we're clearly holding our own. Our position is where computing is richest. If computing and a general-purpose computing platform is -- matters, if performance matters, technology leadership matters, I think we can make a real contribution. When you think about integrated modems, you're right that more companies are becoming vertically integrated. That's going to affect all of us. Samsung's desire, probably based on some questions earlier, is not to buy chips from other companies -- any companies. And so -- but we don't have Samsung as a customer today and nor do we have Apple, and so we have nothing to lose. But there are many other customers that I think are going to be pretty terrific to work with. And whether it's global Tier 1s, the global brands, whether it's LG or ZTE or HTC or Sony or Fujitsu or -- I mean, there's a large list of global phone brands that we love to partner with and that we're partnering with. There's also China. The dynamics of China is very, very different than the dynamics of the rest of the world. They have many different modem standards. They have a very large number of phone companies. And we have the software engineering capacity to be able to partner with them and to help them build amazing phones. And so I surely see what you see that there are vertical integration, and that's -- they will continue to do that. However, there's a very large market of hundreds of millions of phones that we can go and make a contribution to.","Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Very good. Just one last question. As you look to fiscal year 2014 on the Tegra side, any thoughts in terms of kind of what the mix could be between tablets and smartphones? And along those lines, do you see kind of ARM-based Tegra processors in the notebook market gaining some traction in fiscal year '14 or calendar '13?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Sure. We have several segments for Tegra. There's Tegra Android phones, there's Tegra Android tablets, there's Tegra Win RT, PCs, and there's Tegra automotive. The car is the most mobile computer of all. And people know that all the cars want to incorporate computers for all kinds of reasons, whether it's infotainment, navigation or driver assistance. And this is an area where we can add an enormous amount of value. And next year, I think you're going to find that -- we're going to find that auto is likely to be its first $100 million year. Win RT is likely to be much larger next year than this year. And Tegra tablet will continue to be quite a rich business for us. And then there's the Tegra phones. So if you look at it from that perspective, tablets and automotive, the Android tablet, Win RT tablet and automotive will represent a -- the largest proportion of the overall Tegra business. And then the year after that, I hope that, with our integrated modem, Tegra could be a much larger part of the business. And with respect to PCs, tablets are the modern PCs.","Operator","And your next question comes from Craig Berger with FBR Capital.","Craig Berger - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I wanted to ask on the 28-nanometer Kepler GPUs. I mean, the pricing has been great. The gross margin seem to have been good. Can you help us understand what are the factors that might impact gross margins for that product, which way you think they'll be going as presumably yields improve as way for cost decline and I get -- I guess, ASPs decline? How do we think about GPU margins going forward? And also, how much is Fermi versus Kepler?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, pricing is stable. Pricing is stable because our position in the market, in the market that we serve, is better than ever. A lot of people see our GPU business as a components business selling into PC. But that is part of it. We sell GPU components to notebook OEMs. And there, the margins are much tighter. However, the other parts -- the vast majority of our GPU's profits come from, what Rob called earlier, the special-purpose PCs, PCs that are built for PC gaming. Gamers build it for PC gaming. This is our GPU architecture, our GPU stack, the software that we dedicate to games. And the work that we do with game developers all over the world makes the GeForce architecture the best in the world for PC game. The work that we do with workstations, whether it's automotive, manufacturing, digital content creation, digital broadcast, the augmented reality imagery that you saw on CNN for the election where the virtual sets look so real, it's almost like the broadcaster or the commentator was inside a pretty amazing room, all of that stuff is done using NVIDIA's Quadro GPUs. That's very software-intensive. And the vast majority of the value we deliver is software. And then, of course, high-performance computing with Tesla, tools, compilers, libraries, the computational mathematicians we have all around the world to help people optimize their software, the solution architects that are out in the field working with large customers like Oak Ridge National Labs, so that we can help them build their supercomputers. These businesses, the Tesla business, the Quadro business, the GeForce PC gaming business, are incredibly software-intensive. And there, our margins are very good, and the pricing is stable. And the reason for that is because we add a lot of value. And so my expectation is, as we continue to solidify our positioning in the marketplace and we continue to add value to our customers, the pricing should be stable.","Craig Berger - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Jen-Hsun, did you say how much was Fermi versus Kepler in the quarter just ended?","Jen-Hsun Huang","I didn't, but go ahead.","Karen Burns","Well, we don't really disclose that. The point I was making before is it's -- like Jen-Hsun said, the price is stable, depending on the segment your in. So if you're in a high-end segment, you have a certain ASP. And then, the only point about Fermi is, as we move through a new generation, the older generations go further down the stack. So they are lower ASPs.","Craig Berger - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then as a follow-up question, can I ask one on the baseband efforts? It sounds like you're getting close to taping out an integrated part. I'm assuming that's 4G LTE. Are there specific geographies you're going to be targeting first? Obviously, the world is a big place. They all require different software stacks. And just what's your rollout strategy there as you go against much larger competitors?","Jen-Hsun Huang","We'll start with the U.S. We're nearing sampling of a discrete 4G LTE modem, and then we're taping out an integrated 4G LTE modem -- integrated 4G LTE application processor. And that's the reason why we are increasing our investments.","Okay. I think that's what we have time for today. We look forward to talking to all of you next quarter about our Q4 results.

Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements. During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO commentary, which is posted on our web site.","With that let\u2019s start. Third quarter results were strong, with record revenue and improved performance in each of our businesses. Our focus on creating platforms for PC, mobile and datacenter is paying off. Our PC gaming platform benefited from the enthusiastic reception of our new flagship GeForce GTX gaming processors based on Maxwell. Our 10th generation GPU architecture, Maxwell sets new standards for performance and power efficiency, introducing a range of new features for gamers and game developers. Real time dynamic global illumination is a lead forward in replicating the true interaction of light in the gaming environment. Other new technologies render games at higher frame rates with very low power, heat and noise.","Both the desktop versions of these processors, the GTX 980 and the GTX 970 and their notebook counterparts have won extraordinary support from reviewers. Forbes wrote of our new GPUs: They are higher performing and more power efficient than the previous generation and design win abound. That\u2019s pretty much a trifecta in the mobile market. Commenting the desktop versions, Hardware Canucks called the GTX 980 a market changing graphic card that is back stopped by an impressive GPU architecture. We launched Maxwell in a groundbreaking event for the gaming community called Game 24. This live stream 24 hour celebration included gaming tournaments, modding competitions and celebrity commentators. As it moved across the globe, all along the way we drew more than 1.3 million Twitch viewers in 120 countries.","In the mobile platform space, the SHIELD tablet, the latest extension of our SHIELD family of devices enjoyed solid demand during the quarter. The ultimate tablet made for gamers, it features the extreme performance of Tegra K1 mobile processor and the precision control of the SHIELD wireless controller. SHIELD tablet sales have extended into many worldwide markets and the 32 gigabyte LTE model has been recently added to the lineup. Very soon SHILED tablet will be upgraded to Google\u2019s latest OS, Android 5.0 Lollipop.","Tegra K1 was also featured in the Google Nexus 9 tablet launched last month in a 64 bit version. Powered by our project Denver CPU, Tegra K1 is the first ARM processor for Android to take advantage of the Android 5.0 support for 64 bit architectures. Tegra K1 is also now in Chromebooks from Acer and HP. Tegra technology continues to make strong headway in the automotive segment as well. Last month Paris Auto show, Honda announced that three of its popular models will come standard in the European market with a Tegra based infotainment and navigation system. This marks the first in-vehicle infotainment system to use the Android operating system running on Tegra.","Tegra will enable Honda Connect to deliver a touchscreen experience like the intuitive experience you'd experience from a phone or tablet with crisp graphics that respond instantly to gestures like pinch, zoom, and swipe, but is designed for safe operation in a car. Honda now joins Volkswagen in our stable, but mainstream auto brands relying on Tegra, complimenting luxury brands like Audi, BMW, Lamborghini and Tesla Motors.","Our enterprise businesses also had a strong quarter, benefiting from new products and industry trends that fuel demand for them. Our Quadro professional solutions, including processors based on the new Maxwell GPU architecture are enjoying the fast ramp up of any Quadro product in our history. They are being shipped by all of our major OEMs and adopted by global enterprise companies. This new line up provides up to two times improvement in application performance and data handling capability.","In the datacenter platform space, NVIDIA GRID graphics virtualization continues to gain momentum. Thousands of companies have come forward worldwide to experience cloud based GPU accelerated virtual desktops through our tri-grid online demonstration. Also a program we launched in August with VMware for early customer access to GRID virtualized GPUs is drawing wide global interest.","Initial customers include aircraft maker Airbus, the international construction group CH2M Hill, and healthcare provider MetroHealth. Other early notable GRID customers include Villanova University and Halliburton. Our Tesla accelerated datacenter platform continues to grow as HPC customers and cloud service providers deploy large Tesla powered systems.","Fueling Tesla growth is the rapid rise of machine learning, particularly among mobile web service companies like China Baidu [ph] that are standardizing on Tesla as their common platform. As noted in the story, in the current issue of Wired GPUs are exceptionally well suited for parallel processing tasks, like speech recognition, image, and natural language processing. IBM unveiled its first open power based system featuring Tesla GPU accelerators which can significantly enhance Java, Big Data and technical computing applications.","IBM announced plans to accelerate their enterprise applications using Tesla GPUs, including their nearly pervasive IBM DV2 with blue database software. We are excited about this month's Supercomputing 2014 conference New Orleans, where we will be demonstrating the latest breakthrough in supercomputing and visualization based on our Tesla accelerated computing platform.","Now let\u2019s take a more detailed look at the financials. Revenue growth year-over-year was driven by strength of GeForce GPUs for gaming related to our launch in Q3 of Maxwell GTX GPUs as well as the strength in datacenter GPUs and Auto Infotainment Systems. GPU business revenue grew 13% from a year earlier. Revenue from GeForce GPUs for gaming desktops and notebooks grew 36%, fueled by continued strength PC gaming, including Maxwell.","Within this segment, gaming notebooks performed particularly well, more than doubling from year-ago levels. Tesla for high performance computing increased strongly, representing another record quarter of revenue driven by large project wins with cloud service providers and government customers. Quadro revenue remained strong, with our new product platform launched in August, delivering industry leading graphics and rendering performance.","Tegra processor sales grew 51% from a year-ago, led by auto infotainment systems, mobile devices, embedded systems and the onset of the SHIELD tablet sales. Auto Infotainment systems revenue nearly doubled year-over-year. Revenue was up 11% from the second quarter of fiscal 2015.","Moving to gross margins. GAAP gross margins was 55.2%, in-line with our outlook for the quarter, down 90 basis points from last quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 55.5%, also in-line with our outlook and down 90 basis points sequentially. The gross margin reflected continued strength in our GPU margins for PC platforms, inclusive of the product transition to Maxwell based GPUs for the desktop, notebook and workstation. Our margins from the above mentioned PC platforms and datacenter and cloud GPUs were partially offset by the impact of Tegra processor margins, which are lower than the Company\u2019s overall average.","GAAP operating expenses for the third quarter were $463 million, in line with our outlook and up 2% from Q2. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $415 million, lower than our outlook and inclusive of legal fees associated with our litigation against Samsung and Qualcomm. The operating expense discipline reflects continued management of our investment in both R&D and capital expenditures to enhance our return on invested capital.","GAAP operating income was $213 million up 51% from the prior year\u2019s third quarter, reflecting strong revenue growth from higher margin GPUs and contained operating expenses. GAAP net income was $173 million, up 45% from a year earlier driven by increased operating profit from strong revenue and margins. GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.31 increased 55% from $0.20 per diluted share in the year-ago quarter, reflecting net income growth and share repurchases.","Now turning to some key balance sheet items. During the third quarter we paid $46 million in cash dividends and repurchased 16.8 million shares under a structured repurchase agreement entered into during the quarter. During the first three first quarters of fiscal year \u201915, we paid a $140 million in cash dividends and repurchased 44.2 million shares. As a result we have returned to shareholders $950 million during the first three quarters of fiscal year \u201915.","Since the restart of our capital return program in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, we have returned approximately 2.17 billion. This return represents 136% of our cumulative free cash flow for fiscal years 2013, 2014 and 2015 to date and reflects the acceleration of our capital return program from cash generated in prior years.","As we transition into fiscal year \u201916 as part of our ongoing commitment to deliver shareholder value through capital return, we are pleased to announce our intention to return approximately $600 million to shareholders through ongoing quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases in fiscal year 2016.","Accounts receivable at the end of Q3 were $563 million up from $470 million in Q2. The sequential increase was primarily due to the mid-quarter launch of our Maxwell based GPUs and the late quarter project shipments in our database business, compared with last quarter. DSO at quarter end was 42 days, up from 39 days in Q2.","Inventory at the end of Q3 was $408 million, up from $387 million in the prior quarter. The sequential increase included the ramping of Maxwell based GPUs coupled with decreases in products based on previous-generation architectures. DSI at quarter-end was 68 days, down from 73 days at the end of Q2.","Cash flow from operating activities was $216 million, up from $96 million in the prior quarter and from $162 million a year earlier. Our operating cash flow grew 33% year-over-year reflecting higher net income from revenue growth and contained operating expenses, partially offset by higher accounts receivable. Free cash flow was $176 million in the third quarter. Depreciation and amortization expense amounted to $55 million, capital expenditures were $40 million.","Now turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. We expect revenue for the fourth quarter to be $1.2 billion, plus or minus 2%. The year-over-year growth is reflective of our continued strength in gaming for the PC, the notebook and mobile platforms. Additionally, we expect growth from our enterprise platforms.","Our GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 55.2% and 55.5% respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. The gross margin outlook is in line with our gross margin results in Q3, as high end GTX GPUs and datacenter results will contribute to the strong gross margins.","GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $470 million and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $422 million, inclusive of legal fees associated with our litigation against Samsung and Qualcomm. Excluding these legal fees, we expect operating expenses to remain near Q3 levels.","GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 are both expected to be 18%, plus or minus 1%. This estimate is a percentage point lower than our previous outlook and is consistent with our tax rate in the third quarter, excluding any discrete tax events.","We are pleased with our record revenue for both the quarter and year-to-date with strength across all platforms and businesses. Profitability, as measured by earnings per diluted share, increased 55% for the first nine months of fiscal 2015 compared with the prior year. Our 10th generation GPU Maxwell displayed a strong showing with stellar reviews and an innovative launch. We continue to embark on large engagements in datacenter and cloud with outstanding partners, IBM, HP, Dell, Citrix and VMware. Auto continues to gain ground with continued wins, including Honda this quarter. Tegra K1, through SHIELD and Nexus 9 continues to be praised for its technology achievement and expansion of Android gaming.","We continue our transformation into a business focused on visual computing platforms, allowing us to realize continued success in consumer PC and mobile gaming as well as in cloud datacenters, supercomputers, professional design and automobiles.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now take questions. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow up.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions]. And the first question comes from the line of Stephen Chin with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Stephen Chin - UBS Securities","First question I have is just to go deeper on some of the PC gaming trends [indiscernible]. Could you talk a little bit about how much strength you saw from a seasonal perspective for PC gaming and how much of it might have been from the new Maxwell product launch?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yes, Stephen. First of all, you know that the gaming business is expanding globally. And we\u2019re seeing great strength in Asia. We\u2019re seeing great strength in developing countries. We\u2019re seeing incredible enthusiasm around MOBA, which is an online battle arena gameplay style. It\u2019s crossing over from being just video games to now being e-sports. And so the cultural implication of video games is getting greater and greater.","There are several factors that drives our gaming business. One is whenever we see a really exciting new game come to market, games like Assassins Creed or Batman or some of the amazing Ubisoft games that we\u2019ve been seeing, Battlefield, Call of Duty, these incredible franchises that has millions of followers.","And the second factor is whenever we introduce a new GPU architecture that is a huge leap from previous generations. Right now one of the most exciting things going on is driving beyond 1080p. 4k monitors are getting more and more cost effective. And without something like Maxwell, it's really hard to enjoy the full fidelity of a 4k display.","And so these things all contribute. But I think at the highest level, gaming is just expanding globally. And now with Maxwell and a brand new architecture that gives us a huge leap from previous generation, we\u2019re going to draw people out to upgrade to Maxwell so that they can take their gaming experience to the next level.","Now for the near term, Q3 of course we benefited tremendously from the Maxwell launch. Overall for the year, PC gaming for us was up over 30%. And so that gives you a sense of how PC gaming is expanding. Going into Q4, you\u2019re going to see some pretty amazing franchise titles coming out. It's the holiday season. And so we\u2019re looking forward to quite a good year in PC gaming. But overall PC gaming is expanding.","Stephen Chin - UBS Securities","Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. And for my follow up, just to touch upon the GRID business, so you mentioned the early customer access program for GRID with VMware. Any thoughts on the timing for how long that qualification cycle might take? And what kind of I guess brand profile we might expect going into next year for GRID and Tegra as a whole? Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, our datacenter business overall had a record quarter. And we\u2019re seeing expansion in our datacenter business in multiple ways. And I appreciate you recognizing GRID. We entered into a partnership with VMware to support early adaptors of vSphere, which is supporting our GRID Virtual GPU technology. With this VMware and GRID platform, NVIDIA GRID platform, you can now virtualize all of enterprise, all the way out to the clients, and you can make it possible for the most graphics intensive applications. Whether new or legacy PC applications, you can now virtualized it, stream the graphics to any heterogeneous device that your company decides to support.","And we\u2019re seeing enthusiasm all over the world. In fact, since we announced this collaboration with them to develop the market together, we\u2019ve seen thousands of companies try GRID. It\u2019s easy to try. You might want to try it yourself. Just type in try GRID on the web and it will take you to a Web site and will download a small client and you can enjoy with the GRID experience and see what it\u2019s like. We have thousands of interested companies. We\u2019ve selected many around the world. Many of them are very large enterprises, who have several different needs. Some companies because their campus is quite large, and so it\u2019s hard for IT departments to support all of the various workstations and PCs that are scattered all over campus. Universities are the same way. Sometimes it\u2019s because the workforce has large fluctuations. Maybe they use a lot of contractors, maybe it\u2019s because students graduate every year. And so there's a lot of different reasons why virtualizing the enterprise desktop is incredibly valuable to these companies.","As usual, enterprise validation and certification take some time. And so I don\u2019t know -- I can\u2019t give you a particular schedule, but I can tell you that the trials are going really well. And now because of VMware, we can now engage 90% of the world\u2019s virtualization opportunities and the size of opportunities that we\u2019re now looking at is getting larger and larger.","Colette Kress","Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley","Following up on the gaming question; the more than doubling in notebook gaming. Can you give us some context around that? That seems like a big growth rate. Is that a global phenomenon or is that kind of more regional and what do you think is driving that strength?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Thanks a lot Joe. For the very first time in history we\u2019ve been able to get a GPU architecture that is able to do in a notebook form factor, achieve a level of performance that is on parity, on par with desktop PCs. This is a really-really big deal. In a thin notebook, Maxwell GPU, because it\u2019s two times the performance power factor compared to Kepler, which is already the most energy efficient GPU we\u2019ve ever built and the most energy efficient GPU in the world today, we lapped by a factor of two. And as a result we\u2019re able to bring to the notebook form factors, a level of performance that\u2019s on par with desktop.","Now gamers don\u2019t have to choose. It\u2019s really just the matter of what kind of platform you\u2019re enjoying. And we know that a lot of people like laptops. So it's just that for gamers, until now, they\u2019ve not been able to gain access to that level of performance without Maxwell. So this is a big deal for us and we\u2019re quite excited about the Maxwell ramp and it's just beginning to ramp. My expectation is that we\u2019re going to continue to grow the notebook gaming business for some time here.","Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley","And then also on the client GPU business, can you talk a little bit about pricing? And it seems like your competitor hasn\u2019t had the success you guys have had and it sounds like it\u2019s being relatively price aggressive. They\u2019ve talked about that. Can you just talk about the pricing environment and does that competitive dynamic affect you guys at all?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, it\u2019s really related to value I think. Our strategy with GeForce has really moved away from a component pricing model for several years. And it\u2019s the reason why the value that is received by our gamers and appreciated by gamers continues to grow. We\u2019ve really taken much more of a software rich approach. Even though our GPU architecture is now far and away the best in the world, it\u2019s the most energy efficient, it's the highest performance. It has amazing technology like VXGI that was just announced recently. Although at the foundational technology, it is far and away the best, if you look at the software environment, what we call the GFE, the GeForce experience console that\u2019s on top, we really think about the GeForce as a GeForce gaming PC platform now. The software intensity of it is quite high. If you have GeForce Experience, your ability to enjoy games at it fullest is really incomparable. And so I think that people don\u2019t choose component A to component B anymore. Overtime we see a lot more return customers and once you get on the GeForce platform, you tend to stay on the GeForce platform. And our goal is just keep adding more and more value to the GeForce gamers that are to join the GeForce platform to earn their loyalty over time, and I think we're doing really good job there. I'm really proud of the team for their work here. And the results kind of show it.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst ","This is Shankar on behalf of Vivek. I have a question regarding the attach rates in traditional PC market. Do you see the declining attach rates in traditional PC to become a drag at some point? And if so, what kind of impact do you expect to see?","Jen-Hsun Huang","PC OEMs represent about less than 25% of our GPU business and much less than 25% of our overall business already. And within that there are some moving parts. PCs are becoming thinner and lighter, in some cases and as result they tend to not have GPUs attached. In some cases the PCs are becoming application specific PCs, like gaming notebooks, in which case the GPU not only is attached but the GPU becomes quite powerful indeed. On the other hand, workstation notebooks are growing. And so there's a lot of different moving parts, but I would say the mainstream commodity notebook PC, we have been seeing lower and lower GPU attach for quite a long time and it\u2019s not a surprise to us.","Unidentified Analyst ","Got it. On the datacenter cloud market, the recent market adoption of HPC as a core processor with Intel Xeon processors, do you see that as a stumbling block towards growing your datacenter and cloud revenue?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well FPGAs have been around for 30 years and they've been used all kinds of applications, far and wide in all kinds of areas. GPU accelerated datacenters is really quite a new phenomenon. And the benefit of a GPU accelerated datacenter is that the amount of total computational resource you could bring to bear is really quite amazing. It\u2019s not really practical, not really logical that one person or small team designing an FPGA could achieve the level of computational throughput that the NVIDIA R&D department with thousands and thousands of engineers, refining a singular architecture called CUDA over the years [indiscernible]. So it\u2019s not logical that that could happen. And then secondarily in CUDA, programming our GPUs is far, far, far easier than programming an FPGA. The R&D cost is a lot lower. The rate or iteration is much higher. And so that\u2019s one of the reasons why Tesla has yet another record quarter. The number of platforms that support Tesla is growing all over the world and I think it\u2019s a foregone conclusion that accelerated computing could add a lot of value in many areas of computing.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan","Looking into your revenue guidance for Q4, can you just tell us if your GeForce PC gaming segment is growing quarter-over-quarter and maybe that\u2019s potentially being offset by your PC OEM business? Jen-Hsun, as you mentioned, we just had the big launch of Call of Duty Advanced Warfare. We've got the Assassin's Creed launch coming up soon. We've got several other blockbuster games in November. So I would assume that your PC gaming is up sequentially in January, but wanted to get your thoughts.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yes, Harlan I appreciate that. We're expecting our gaming platforms and our enterprise datacenter platforms to be up quarter-to-quarter. Those are benefitting from both industry adoption of our platforms, as well as the fact that we are going into a brand new product cycle with Maxwell. We're also expecting our OEM business to be down sequentially, but our guidance reflects all that.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan","And then as you mentioned continued strength in enterprise, we\u2019ve got the [indiscernible] microprocessor ramp going into datacenters and HPCs. It was about 10% of the mix for Intel in Q3. One of the first big adopters, like I said does tend to be HPC and datacenter. So the question is how much of this is contributing to the strength in Tesla and potentially your GRID based products or is it more just sort of with Tesla and GRID, just prior design wins that are finally starting to ramp or maybe a combination of both?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well Tesla and GRID are both delivering record numbers at the moment, and they're driven by the fact that the enterprise adoption of our platforms are increasing. But in the grand scheme of things, they are still a small percentage of the world\u2019s overall servers. And so my sense is that those matters are important but they\u2019re not significant. Most of our adoptions tend to be related to new applications or an OEM certifying a new server for GRID, and there's a whole bunch of servers being certified right now, or a cloud datacenter service -- a service provider who is able to deploy their service using machine learning service or a natural language processing service or a music tagging service or some service that requires our GPUs deployed into production. And so those tend to the large reasons why we grow, more so than the microprocessor that it's attached to.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays Capital. Please proceed with you question.","Chris Hemmelgarn - Barclays ","This is Chris Hemmelgarn on Blayne. Congrats on a good quarter. First, I was curious, with Intel\u2019s new Broadwell platform looking to launch late first half -- some point in the first half of Q -- of next year, are you guys, I guess concerned about any more pronounced seasonality in Q1 ahead of that product launch or would you expect kind of just general typical seasonal trends this year?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Our OEM business is just a smaller and smaller part of our overall business driver. Most of the platforms that we offer engage specific vertical markets, whether it\u2019s gaming or high performance computing or enterprise virtualization or the cloud services with service providers who are the automotive industry. And so these verticals tend to be much more important in how we think about our business. We also see now that our OEMs or our OEM partners go into a new product cycle when we launch a new product. And so when there's a new Maxwell GPU recently, every notebook OEM in the world offered a brand new gaming notebook, irrespective of the rest of the platform and the reception of those notebooks have been fantastic.","It\u2019s been so successful for us in the notebook gaming business, that for the very first time HP and Lenovo, both joined our GeForce gaming platform and offered gaming notebooks under their own brands. And so we\u2019re excited about the work that we\u2019re doing here. We\u2019re seeing more and more this type of dynamic as we continue to transition our Company\u2019s business model from components business attached to other components to a platform model, where we engage vertical markets where we serve.","Chris Hemmelgarn - Barclays ","And I guess follow-up, just turning to automotive business, obviously going quite well for you. You\u2019ve highlighted strength in infotainment this past quarter. It sounds like in December the new Tesla launching is going to support some type of autonomous driving. You guys had mentioned that at your last Analyst Day, I believe that that was one big opportunity for Tegra. I was just curious as to where you thought we were hitting a point where that could be a meaningful driver? You talked about the auto business doubling in consecutive years. Do you see some of these new opportunities \u2013 I guess a continued path for growth beyond that? Just kind of interested in your general thoughts?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, we came into automotive industry because we think that the car is going to contain some of the powerful computers that we have and the future of the car is going to have computing in and not just infotainment, but the entire digital cockpit will be drive by computers and because of better and better auto-piloted capabilities, the car will become quite rich in supercomputing capabilities over time. And so this -- just in general, the car industry is quite a rich opportunity for our computing focus. Whether it's seeing around the car using visual computing technologies, or presenting information to the driver in all kinds of rich ways, whether it\u2019s Infotainment or your digital cockpit or heads up display or other technologies in the future, visual computing is going to play a huge role in the future of cars. So we\u2019re quite excited about the opportunities there.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Rajvindra Gill with Needham & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Rajvindra Gill - Needham & Company","Congratulations on very good results. Question on the GRID traction. In the past you talked about some design engagements and some metrics around that. I was wondering if you could perhaps update us a little bit on the trajectory of GRID in the enterprise as they begin to realize the leverage of cloud based visual computing.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well we continue to track it. We\u2019re over a 1,000 trials around the world. And we\u2019re going to focus our energy, because we now have OEM partners and virtualization platform partners like VMware and Citrix who all have sales forces that are out there selling the platform now. We\u2019re going to focus our energy to continue to evangelize GRID and to help the top customers, the top and the large engagements adopt GRID in trial and doing their trial performance of GRID.","And so we\u2019re going to continue to track them and the number of opportunities continue to grow. I just mentioned earlier, as we partnered with VMware to take vSphere around the world, the number of customers who have come out to ask to be early adopters and to be part of the trial program is really quite exciting. And we put a web self-trial service up on the cloud called Try GRID and I encourage you all to try it. Thousands and thousands of companies have come out to try it. And so I think it stands to reason that enterprises around the world would like to virtualize their entire enterprise. It\u2019s more secure. It\u2019s more cost effective. It allows for a mobile work force, and in many industries quite a dynamic work force. The work force could ramp up and down pretty dramatically from season to season and because they work with a lot of contractors, they could be onsite and off and change quite rapidly.","And so GRID virtualizes all of their workstations and PCs and makes it a lot easier for enterprises to support their dynamic work force. And so there's a lot of different reasons why GRID is just a really fantastic extension of the entire enterprise virtualization movement. And so it\u2019s the reason why all of these OEMs are supportive of GRID and why they\u2019re taking it to market.","Rajvindra Gill - Needham & Company","And my follow up question, on the fourth quarter revenue guidance, you had mentioned that the gaming platforms would be up sequentially and enterprise datacenter would be up sequentially. So that would imply that the Tegra business is down sequentially, in order to hit the numbers for the midpoint of the guidance. Just wondering is that's just normal seasonality that you\u2019re seeing in Tegra for Q4 or if there's any other issues that are going on there? If you could elaborate on Tegra going into Q4, that would be helpful. Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, our strategy is to continue to advance our own platforms that are addressing these local markets. And when I said the gaming platform was going to be up sequentially, I meant that our PC desktop, our PC notebook and our SHIELD gaming platforms would all be up sequentially. They would each all be up sequentially. Our OEM business will be down sequentially and part of it is PC OEMs and part of it is device OEMs.","Colette Kress","Operator, do we have another question? Operator, can you hear us? We can\u2019t hear you.","Operator","Sorry about that. Technical difficulty. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Guana with JMP Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Alex Guana - JMP Securities","Jen-Hsun, I know earlier that you addressed the issue of Broadwell being a little slower to market. But I'm kind of curious from a process technology perspective. Does the trouble that Intel is having with 14 nanometer mean anything to you as you work to bring FinFET technology to market? Does it make you nervous about your own timelines or does it make you more excited that you\u2019re going to be in a position to maybe compete with a like for like transistor technology in the 2015 timeframe?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, first of all, we have a lot of different levers. I\u2019ve been asked in the past about Moore's Law and I believe in Moore's Law. But Moore's Law is not just about physics. Moore's Law is also about architecture and innovation. And it\u2019s really in the final analysis about performance and it's really into final analysis about clever ideas. And if you take a look at Maxwell, Maxwell improved on Kepler by a factor of two times on the performance power factor. That\u2019s really quite substantial and arguably unheard of. That\u2019s incredibly -- that\u2019s much faster than Moore's Law.","And so I believe in continued improvement in that area and that we have continue to add value through architecture, through design, through process and the combination of all that through software. All of those are levers for us. We\u2019re excited about the next generation of FinFET. The way that we deal with that that, you know that we've had quite a few scars in the past as we ramped up new process technology and we\u2019ve been better and better and better at it.","And the reason why is because we have just an extraordinary team in advanced technology group working deeply with our foundry partners and ensuring through real creation of test chips and rigorous test methodologies and development methodologies that ensure that when we are ready to ramp that the processors are ready for us. And I can tell you that for the next couple of nodes, I feel pretty good about it because of that work.","Alex Guana - JMP Securities","Okay. And you touched on what I also wanted to talk about Maxwell in the market right now. I'm wondering, can you give me an example or us an example I should say of some of the gaming titles or the evolution of the industry that\u2019s starting to take advantage of Maxwell\u2019s capabilities right now? And I'm wondering if the clear advantage Maxwell has in the market is leading into any progress on the licensing front? Thanks.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Every gamer who buys Maxwell will immediately benefit from Maxwell, in literally every single game they play. And they will enjoy in one of three ways. If you are a desktop gamer and you\u2019re playing one of the most advanced games out there, you\u2019re going to benefit. And it\u2019s likely that you have a GTX 560 or GTX 660 or GTX 760 or GTX 670. There are 10 million gamers who have GPUs that are GeForce\u2019s that are installed in their systems that can benefit from a Maxwell upgrade.","And when they install Maxwell, they\u2019re going to get the benefit of that 2x. They\u2019re going to either get better visual quality at the same frame rate or much higher frame rate at an even better and bigger quality. And so there's a lot of different ways they can enjoy that. If you are a notebook gamer, Maxwell allows you to enjoy desktop level of performance for the very first time in your laptop.","And then even if you had a game, and this is what\u2019s really cool about Maxwell. Even if you have a game that already is running at 60 frames per second on your 1080p monitor, the thing that\u2019s really cool about Maxwell is that we can now render to effectively a 4k resolution on our chip and we\u2019ll display it at 1080p on your monitor. And so all of a sudden your 1080p monitor improves in fidelity, as if you had a 4k monitor. So there's a lot of different ways that you can enjoy it.","Our licensing discussions are very active. And we have many in important stages. And I think at the highest level, the way to think about why we add value to several players in the industry is that the mobile device market is really commoditizing. And by adding NVIDIA GPU to their SoC, they can differentiate head and shoulders above the rest of the industry. And although there's a lot of different ways to differentiate, having the best processor in your mobile device is arguably the first way and arguably the best way of doing it. And so I think Maxwell surely adds value in that process. Tegra K1 adds an enormous amount of value in helping to validate the importance of our GPU and mobile applications. And so all of that helps.","Colette Kress","Operator, next question? Operator, we\u2019re having a challenge hearing you. Can we get the next question?","Operator","Sorry about that. Technical difficulties. Our next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James","Congratulations guys. Couple of questions there. On process node migrations, also to Alex question, what\u2019s the roadmap on the GPU side of the equation? Are you going to skip 20 nanometer and go straight to FinFET?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Hans, we haven\u2019t announced our next generation products yet. And so we've got lot of great surprises for you guys and I'm excited about our next generation GPU. But right now we're enjoying ramping Maxwell. This is a brand new product cycle, and I don\u2019t remember our product cycle in our Company\u2019s history where we've had the lead that we have, the richness of applications in the gaming industry that we're ramping into, nor the number of vertical markets that we now serve, from gaming to design to cloud to high-performance computing, that we now serve that we're ramping this architecture into. And so Maxwell is unquestionably at this point a home run and we're just savoring the moment and ramping the living daylights out of it.","Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James","Okay, fair enough. And then as a follow-up Jen-Hsun. The game console guys have had a good year of a new product cycle to them. How do you compare this cycle for them versus PC gaming and Android gaming for that matter.","Jen-Hsun Huang","I would say that the early adaptors of the game console market will enjoy every single platform. I've got everyone. And they'll have the PC, they'll have game consoles. But my sense is that the game console platform is not likely to enjoy the hay days when it was really unambiguously the only and the best game platform to enjoy games. It's just not true anymore. There are just too many other ways to enjoy games.","The PC has become the world\u2019s largest game platform. China, the developing countries around the world, PC is a piece of platform they already own. They can upgrade it two, three, four times without having to change the basic platform. So the total of cost of ownership of a game PC is quite attractive. And the games are incredible. And so PC has become unambiguously the largest platform in the world today. Tencent is the largest game company. You could see how they're doing. And then of course, mobile. How can we ignore the largest operating system in the world, Android and why it won\u2019t become a premier game platform is beyond imagination really. And so I think that there's too many other ways to enjoy games now, for the game console to enjoy the hay days of the past. But we'll see. The thing that I do know is this, without any question is that the PC is continuing to expand the number of titles. Great titles are coming to the PC. It's is continuing to grow and the quality of titles is growing up ever so fast. And then mobile gaming is going to be right around the corner.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Sanjay Chaurasia [ph]. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Jen-Hsun, one question on Tesla. Some of your peers who are participating in the HPC market, they are highlighting some increased visibility. I was just wondering if you could give us any color on your visibility into Tesla. It has proven to be a little bit lumpy in the past. I was just wondering what kind of visibility you are seeing in this environment today?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, the number of applications that run on Tesla is growing and that is not a lumpy factor and it\u2019s continuing to grow. The number of customers of Tesla is growing. The number of industries that Tesla is servicing is growing. I think what really is happening is that it is now conventional wisdom that the accelerated computing model that we invented with Tesla is going to be a very important model for computing for as long as we see now. And when we go to Supercomputing this year and I hope that all of you keep an eye on it; I think Supercomputing is going to help us understand where accelerated computing fits in the psychology of computing around the world.","I think it really is at the tipping point if not past, that accelerated computing can play a very important role in the whole field of computing. There's some applications where accelerating computing just utterly, utterly shines. Of course imaging is an area that accelerated computing does incredibly well. The number of applications related to understanding images and processing images, from satellites, from cameras all over the world, from smartphones from all over the world, understanding images is going to be just, if not the killer app, one of the major killer apps that we're looking at. This is a global phenomenon with all kinds of interesting applications. So high performance computing, accelerated computing at this point is really quite synonymous and I think that all the visibility that you see is just confirmation that we are down the right path.","Unidentified Analyst ","And you earlier said that obviously Tesla is a very small percentage of overall compute in datacenter. In that sense what is the kind of growth profile you have in your mind? How do you see this business growing over the next two to three years?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, I think that someday all datacenters will be accelerated and because we\u2019re starting from a very small base, it explains why Tesla is one of our largest growth opportunities. And for two consecutive quarters, we\u2019ve now seen record quarters and the number of partners that are supporting Tesla is growing and the depth of which they support Tesla is increasing. And so I think Tesla is going to be a large business over time and I would be very surprised if there are important or large datacenters anywhere in the world that aren\u2019t somehow accelerated by GPUs.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.

My name is George, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the NVIDIA financial results conference call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, February 11, 2015.","I will now turn the call over to Ms. Colette Kress, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer with NVIDIA. Ms. Kress, you may begin your conference.","Colette M. Kress","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to NVIDIA's Conference Call for the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2015. With us on the call today from NVIDIA is Jen-Hsun Huang, President and Chief Executive Officer. I'd also like to introduce Arnab Chanda, who joined us last week, as the Head of Investor Relations. Arnab and Raj will closely work to support the investment community.","I'd like to remind you, today's call is being webcast live on NVIDIA's Investor Relations website. It is also being recorded. You can hear a replay by telephone until February 18, 2015. The webcast will be available for replay up until the next quarter's conference call to discuss Q1 financial results. The content of today's call is NVIDIA's property. It cannot be reproduced or transcribed without our written prior consent.","During the course of this call, we may make forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of factors that could affect our future financial results and business, please refer to the disclosure in today's earnings release, our most recent Form 10-Q and the reports that we may file on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All of our statements are based as of today, February 11, 2015, based on information currently available to us. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements.","During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You may find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO commentary, which is posted on our website.","With that, let's start. We achieved record revenue for the fourth quarter and the full year, with impressive growth in each of our markets' specialized platforms. NVIDIA's strategy of creating an ecosystem in gaming, enterprise graphics, accelerated computing and automotive continues to make excellent headway. Our gaming platforms grew more than 30% year-on-year and accelerated in the fourth quarter, driven by our 10th-generation Maxwell processors and the vibrant gaming market.","Launched in September, our GeForce GTX 980 and 970 GPUs continue to be enthusiastically received. The Maxwell architecture provides new capabilities such as real-time, dynamic, global illumination, which simulates the true interaction of light with the environment and is the most energy-efficient GPU architecture ever created. We added to our lineup the GTX 960, which brings Maxwell to $199, what we see as the gaming market sweet spot. Powered by 1,024 CUDA Cores, it plays even some of the most demanding titles on 60 frames per second on full HD displays and it leaves plenty of headroom for over-clockers. The GTX 960 will let gamers enjoy the latest games at quality and performance greater than even the best gaming consoles at half the price.","There are now more than 50 million PCs with GeForce Experience, our application for the gaming ecosystem that optimizes the user settings for each title and enables players to record and share their victories. In the month of November alone, GeForce Experience users downloaded our drivers over 30 million times. GeForce Experience brings the simplicity and the community benefits of the console to the PC.","NVIDIA powered the holiday season's 2 best-reviewed Android tablets, the Google Nexus 9 and our own SHIELD Tablet, which are based on our Tegra K1 processor. More than a dozen media outlets recommended SHIELD in their holiday gift giving guides. Over the course of the quarter, SHIELD, which has pioneered a premium gaming experience for tablets, became one of the very first devices to be upgraded to the Google's latest OS, Android 5.0 Lollipop.","The NVIDIA GRID graphics virtualization platform continues to gain momentum. More than 300 companies worldwide tested the product in recent months and experienced the benefits of GPU-accelerated virtualization. They range from large institutions such as the University of Southern California, leading manufacturers such as Airbus and Lockheed Martin and defense proprietors like Raytheon. Enterprise virtualization leaders continue to deploy GRID. Just last week, VMware rolled out the latest version of its vSphere virtualization software, including full support for our GRID vGPU graphics virtualization technology.","Quadro professional graphics continue to maintain market leadership. Refreshed in Q3, the lineup is now being shipped in all major OEMs. For the sixth year in a row, every film nominated for an Academy Award for special effects was made using Quadro.","Our accelerated computing platform performed very strongly. Tesla's revenue growth from a year ago exceeded 50%, as HPC customers and cloud service providers continue to deploy large GPU-powered systems. These provide deep learning capabilities that help enable our amazing capabilities, like voice recognition and natural language processing. Using Tesla, our customers have seen dramatic benefits in application performance, radically reducing run times.","During the quarter, we introduced the Tesla K80 Dual-GPU, our new flagship Tesla offering. It provides nearly twice the performance and double the memory bandwidth of its predecessor, the Tesla K40. A single server with Tesla K80 delivers the same performance as 8 servers with our old Fermi generation GPU accelerators for a range of applications. A powerful endorsement of Tesla came just ahead of the recent Supercomputing 2014 Show. The U.S. Department of Energy announced that its next generation of supercomputers will utilize Tesla GPU accelerators in conjunction with our powerful new NVIDIA NVLink high-speed interconnect technology. These systems will be deployed at Oak Ridge and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. We'll be at least 3x faster than today's most powerful systems. These supercomputers will serve scientists across our nation in every field of science to accelerate their research for the next 20 years.","Finally, NVIDIA's automotive platforms remain on a sharp upward trajectory, registering better than 80% growth on the year. More than 7.5 million cars with our technology are now on the road, up from 4.7 million a year ago.","At CES, we announced NVIDIA Drive, a computing platform for next-generation advanced driver assistant systems and digital cockpits. NVIDIA Drive makes driving safer and more enjoyable by introducing surround vision and auto valet capabilities. Its cockpit computing platform includes 3D navigation systems, natural speech and image processing capabilities, dramatically transforming the automotive user interface. NVIDIA Drive is the first car computing platform, utilizing advances in deep learning. Drive will leverage our dramatic advances in deep learning for voice, language and image recognition to enable surrounding and situational awareness in cars. We believe deep learning is the key enabling technology to continue advancements and autonomous driving capabilities.","At the heart of NVIDIA Drive is the recent announcement of Tegra X1, a 256-core super chip with over 1 teraflops of floating-point processing power built on the same Maxwell architecture. Rolled out only months earlier for high-level gaming, Tegra X1 provides the computational horsepower, computer vision and graphic capabilities for cars that can see and learn.","Now let's take a more detailed look at the financials. Fourth quarter revenue increased 9% year-over-year to a record $1.25 billion. Growth was driven by strength in gaming, data center, cloud and auto.","Fourth quarter revenue was up 2% sequentially. The GPU business grew 8%, helped by Maxwell GPUs and the seasonal increase in consumer PCs. Overall, Tegra processor sales decreased 33%, as growth in our automotive and SHIELD devices was more than offset by lower revenue from smartphone and tablets. Fiscal 2015 revenue grew 13% to a record $4.68 billion. In our GPU business, revenue grew 13% in Q4 from a year earlier. Revenue from our PC gaming platforms rose 38% due to the popularity of our high-end Maxwell-based GTX GPUs.","Tesla GPUs [ph] for accelerated computing increased strongly, driven by large project wins with cloud service providers.","Tegra processors declined 15% from -- in Q4 from a year ago, as smartphone and tablet designs reached the end of their product life cycle. This was partially offset by the increased revenue from auto infotainment systems, which more than doubled, and from SHIELD devices.","Moving to gross margins. GAAP gross margin was 55.9%, above our outlook for the quarter and up 70 basis points from last quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 56.2%, also above our outlook and was up 70 basis points sequentially. Strength in margins from gaming and accelerated computing was partially offset by those from Tegra processors and certain inventory provisions for prior Tegra architectures.","For fiscal 2015, GAAP gross margin was 55.5%, and non-GAAP gross margin was 55.8%. These full year record levels were led by the strength of our high-end GPUs for gaming and accelerated computing.","GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $468 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $420 million, in line with our outlook and inclusive of legal fees associated with our litigation against Samsung and Qualcomm. For fiscal 2015, GAAP operating expenses were $1.84 billion, and non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.66 billion. The low single digit growth from the previous year represents discipline from our continued management of our investments in both R&D and capital expenditures to enhance return on invested capital.","The U.S. Federal R&D tax credit was reinstated for calendar 2014. For the full year, the GAAP effective tax rate was 16.5%; non-GAAP was 16.9%, incorporating the U.S. Federal R&D tax credit.","For the fourth quarter, GAAP net income was $193 million, up 31%, driven by increased operating profit from strong revenue and margins. GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.35 increased 40% from a year ago quarter, reflecting net income growth and share repurchases. For the full year, GAAP net income was $631 million, up 43%, and GAAP earnings per diluted share were up 51% from a year earlier.","Now turning to some key balance sheet items. During the full fiscal year of 2015, we paid $186 million in cash dividends and repurchased 44.4 million shares for $814 million. As a result, we returned to shareholders $1 billion during fiscal 2015. Since restarting our capital return program in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, we have returned approximately $2.22 billion to shareholders. This represents 111% of our cumulative free cash flow for fiscal year 2013 through '15, reflecting the acceleration of our capital return program from cash generated in prior years.","In November of 2014, we announced our ongoing commitment to deliver shareholder value through capital return, with the intention to return approximately $600 million to shareholders through ongoing quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases in fiscal 2016.","Accounts receivable at the end of the quarter were $474 million, down from $563 million in the prior quarter. Inventory at the end of the quarter was 483 million, up from 408 million in the prior quarter. This sequential increase included the ramping of our new Maxwell-based GPUs and Tegra-based SOCs and SHIELD devices.","Cash flow from operating activities was $443 million, up from the $216 million in the prior quarter, reflecting higher net income and the annual payment from Intel. Free cash flow was $412 million in the fourth quarter.","Depreciation and amortization expense amounted to $54 million. Capital expenditures were $31 million.","Now turning to the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. We expect revenue for the first quarter of 2016 to be $1.16 billion, plus or minus 2%. Growth year-over-year is expected from our key platforms, gaming, data center and cloud and automotive. Our GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 56.2% and 56.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. The gross margin outlook is slightly higher than our Q4 performance, driven by our gaming and accelerated computing platforms. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $478 million, with non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $425 million, inclusive of legal fees associated with our litigation against Samsung and Qualcomm. Excluding these legal fees, we expect to maintain our operating expense levels near Q4 levels. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 are expected to be 20%, plus or minus 1%, excluding the benefit of the U.S. Federal R&D tax credit, which expired December of 2014.","In summary, we are pleased with our record revenue for the quarter and the full year, which reflects strength across our platforms and businesses. Profitability as measured by earnings per diluted share increased 51% in fiscal 2015, as our revenue and gross margin growth continued to outpace our investment.","This concludes our remarks, and we will now turn it back to the operator for questions. Please be sure to limit your questions to one with one follow-up. Operator?","[qa\/>","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore. He's with Deutsche Bank.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","[Audio Gap] the strong results and guidance. I guess the first question, Jen-Hsun, one for you on the Tegra side of the business. I know that can be inherently lumpy in how it operates, but can you talk about what you envision the biggest drivers in fiscal 2016 will be to get that business on a growth trajectory versus the year-over-year drop that it's currently running at?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yes, Ross. First of all, thanks. Our strategy for Tegra is the focus on automotive, gaming. And wherever opportunities arise in OEMs, we surely will entertain it, but our fundamental focus is automotive and gaming. And you already heard Colette say that our automotive business nearly doubled year-over-year. Our gaming business is really strong, and we have some exciting things that we'd love to share with you at the -- in the near future. But that -- those are our 2 focuses for Tegra. And if you look at the opportunities that we're pursuing in the area of automotive, obviously, more and more cars are becoming computerized cars. And at CES, we announced a brand new platform called Drive. And Drive is basically a mobile super chip, a mobile super computer, with a ton of software on top. And it provides for 3 basic functionalities: The first is a very advanced digital cockpit. You know that we're incredibly good at computer graphics, and the things that we can do in the car with more and more displays showing up in the car is pretty wonderful. The second is a technology called surround vision. Beyond surround view, which is basically cameras connected around the car, surround vision not only allows you to see the images from the videos around the car, but also create a virtual environment around it and, using computer vision technology, keep your car alert of the surroundings. And the third is using a technology called deep learning that has been revolutionized recently and it's something that we're very much at the center of. Using deep learning, we can do voice processing, natural language processing and understanding of imagery so that the car can be more situational and environmentally aware. All of those technology -- technologies that I just described, we believe, will help pave the path to the self driving car. In the area of mobile, the gaming -- in the area of mobile gaming, the gaming market, as you know, is huge and is growing quite rapidly internationally. It's about a $70 billion business now. We know that mobile cloud is probably one of the most important disruptions in the history of computing, and yet there's really no computer gaming architecture that serves mobile cloud very well. And that's what SHIELD is all about, to create the platform that allows mobile cloud to bring gaming to a lot more people. And we think that by doing so, we'll be able to engage a much, much larger part of the overall gaming market than just PC gaming, okay? So our Tegra business model is about focusing on automotive and gaming.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. I guess, as my follow-up, a bigger-picture question for the GPU side of the equation. You talked about the GeForce business being up 38% year-over-year, and GPUs, as an entirety, were up 13%. Is there any color you can provide just into the size of the buckets within your GPU segment so we can get the little more granular in how we model those very disparate growth rates, whether it's the 4 segments you break out in your segment definition and the CFO commentary? Or any other color you give, that would be helpful.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Our -- we serve 4 markets: gaming, automotive, enterprise graphics and high-performance computing and cloud computing. Those are the 4 major segments that we -- 4 major markets that we serve. GPUs serve gaming, enterprise graphics and cloud. Gaming, as we've said earlier, has grown, as you mentioned, 38% year-over-year. Our enterprise graphics business, the workstation business, is relatively flattish. However, our enterprise virtualization -- virtualized graphics platform called GRID about doubled year-over-year. And our Tesla business, which is our accelerated computing business about doubled year-over-year. The PC OEM business declined. The PC OEM business represents, I would say, low-teens maybe approximately part of our overall business. We've been talking about its decline for some time now. And this year, again, it declined. Obviously, the PC OEM business, representing umpteen percent of our overall GPU business, represents a substantially lower part of its profits because the gross margins at OEMs tend to be much lower. But nonetheless, it declined year-over-year, okay? So looking at those segments then, gaming grew, enterprise grew, cloud computing and high-performance computing grew, OEM business -- PC OEM business declined from a low umpteen percent level, okay?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Shankar Subramanian - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is Shankar on behalf of Vivek. Just a follow-up on that GPU breakdown. Could you give a color on what's the -- based on the guidance given for Q1, how do those individual segments kind of play out?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Sure. We guided seasonally down. And of course, as usual, we'll see how it turns out. But if you look at the position of each one of our platforms, our position in gaming is very strong. The gaming market globally is quite robust. We're still seeing gaming growth all around the world, and the production value of games is increasing all the time. And whenever the production value of a game increases, it requires more GPU performance. For the very first time in history, a game console has come out that uses essentially a PC architecture, and its performance is substantially higher than the average PC performance. And so as a result, we see a lot of adoption to our higher-end GPUs, and that's good. We also expect that the Tesla platform continues to be quite robust. We know now that GPUs are wonderful processors for massively parallel applications like deep learning. Deep learning could be used for voice recognition, natural language processing, image recognition, video tagging, all kinds of interesting applications that are made possible because of cloud computing and because there are so many sensors and images and voice being uploaded into the cloud. That's one of the drivers for Tesla, and the Tesla business has doubled year-over-year from a fairly large base now. My expectation is that this coming year, Tesla will remain on that trajectory, and I hope that Tesla will grow very nicely this coming year. GRID, another part of our GPU business, is all about enterprise virtualization. Because of GRID, we're now able -- companies are able to now virtualize beyond the data center all the way to the end-user computing device. For the very first time, it is now possible to virtualize graphics-intensive applications and make it possible for people to enjoy their applications wherever they are. So now you can be virtualized, it can be more secure, you can be more mobile, enjoy graphics on any device. That platform is growing nicely. A year ago, we had about 400 trials. Today, we have well over 1,000. And recently, the most -- the largest enterprise virtualization company in the world, VMware, has integrated GRID into vSphere, and it has been -- it has gone to production, and so we're seeing quite a bit of momentum from that production release. So these platforms are all growing nicely, and I expect this year to help drive our growth.","Shankar Subramanian - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. So I just have a follow-up on the autos business. I know you have -- you talked about different products and features that you have been working on, and those seem to be kind of the -- maybe a high-end side of auto. But can you talk about the products that you have for the mid and low end because it looks like that might be the area where the scale is. And also talk about how you are -- you plan to increase the gross margin for auto systems [ph]. Because it looks like it's in the low 30s if I just back out all the numbers based on your reported numbers.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, the answer to the second question I know better than the answer to the first, so I'll just answer that one first. The way to add -- the way to increase our gross margins is to continue to innovate and increase the amount of value-added that we bring. And if you recall a long time ago, a long time ago meaning about 10 years ago, NVIDIA's gross margins was about 30-some-odd percent. And over time, we made the platform more and more software-rich. Today, our gross margins are surely much, much higher than 35%. And so my expectations is to do the same on the NVIDIA Drive platform. It's intensely software-rich. I think somebody said that today, a car is about 10% software, but soon, the car will be about 80% software, and I think that's right. I think that's right. I mean, in the future, with electric cars, you have obviously still very sophisticated drivetrain and such, but the car is going to be largely a computer with software. And that's where we can add an enormous amount of value, and that's what Drive is all about. Adding value through a very powerful processor, of course, but most of the capabilities I described from the digital cockpit to surround vision, to deep learning is all about software. It's all the software that runs on top of TX1. So that's #1. On your question about high-end versus midrange, I believe that more and more of the car's value will be delivered through software. And if you have to deliver it through software, then the processor underneath it is obviously more and more important. And my expectation is that great computing platforms will extend well into midrange into the low-end part of the marketplace. And that's just -- that's a belief. And just as I believed a long time ago, that the car is going to be one of our most sophisticated computers, which is obviously, at this point, coming true, my sense is that it's going to continue to go down that path, and we're going to see a lot more computation capability inside the car. To the point where I actually believe that every car will have a good processor, the high-end cars will have many good processors.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay. He's with Canaccord Genuity.","Matthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","I think the first one, Jen-Hsun, you made some interesting comments earlier about the need for, I guess, a fairly virtualized mobile gaming experience. I assume you're meaning across desktop tablets, smartphone, cloud, et cetera. One of the things that strikes me is, obviously, there's the suit going on between yourselves and Qualcomm, Samsung, et cetera. And your market share within the mobile graphics business when you think about smartphones is fairly small from a hardware perspective. So do you see that changing dramatically going forward? And if not, do you see the gaming mobile device market bifurcating from like the traditional smartphone market going forward?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yes, Matt, thanks a lot for that question. First of all, mobile is much more than phones. Mobile is a fundamentally new way of designing computers, and I believe that mobile will impact almost every segment of computing as we know it. It'll impact refrigerators. That's not a phone. It'll impact drones. That's not a phone. It'll impact earrings. That's not a phone. It'll impact watches. That's not a phone. It'll impact game consoles that is not a phone. It'll impact cars, and that's not a phone. I think mobile is going to be important in all kinds of computing devices. When I say mobile, that's what I mean. I don't mean mobile as in the mobile phone. Mobile technology is really important. I also believe that mobile cloud in combination is one of the most powerful computing forces that the computer industry has ever known. Because of mobile cloud, we've been able to extend the capabilities and the benefits of computing to billions of people, whereas in the PC area, we were able to benefit hundreds of millions of people. And yet no one has yet created a game platform around mobile cloud, the technology of mobile cloud, the power of mobile cloud, the architecture of mobile cloud, so that we can extend gaming not to tens of millions of game console users, but billions of users. I think that that's the great opportunity. And I don't have anything to announce today, but that's what we're trying to endeavor. So I appreciate you asking that question. I think it's going to be a really big opportunity for us.","Matthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","As a follow-up, this one is for Colette. Obviously, you guys have done a great job in returning cash to shareholders and announcing new plans for the next fiscal year. Maybe as the last fiscal year ends, maybe you could update us on your onshore and offshore cash balances, if you could and any perspectives on the difference in cash flow onshore and offshore.","Colette M. Kress","Thanks, Matt, for the question. Again, we are looking at a cash balance lower than where we ended at fiscal year '14, due to our $1 billion return through shareholders, but also the increase in cash flow. Nothing has materially changed in terms of our cash flow from international and our cash flow in the U.S. So again, the majority of our cash flow tends to arrive from international overall operations. We have about the same mix of overall U.S. cash versus international cash, a little lower than where we ended at the end of fiscal year '14. But we feel very confident with our overall capital return program for fiscal year 16 and the overall cash flow prospects, so I think we're well aligned there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Wong. He's with Wells Fargo.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Can you give us some idea what percentage of Tegra is now automotive? And just a clarification, when you say that automotive infotainment more than doubled year-over-year, do you mean all automotive? Is there some other segment than infotainment or -- yes.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Most of our automotive today is infotainment. Some of -- more people are starting to do what Audi had done with their really amazing virtual cockpit, where infotainment and digital clusters merged into one. And digital clusters is much harder than infotainment. And so with Tegra, with our automotive platform, we're able to easily merge the 2. And so you'll see some more examples of that in the future. But initially, it's a largely infotainment, some amount of digital clusters, if that's your question. And between automotive and SHIELD, our gaming platform, that represents the vast majority of Tegra now.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And you also mentioned Tesla more than doubled from an already substantial base. Can you give us some idea of the size of Tesla today?","Jen-Hsun Huang","I'm sorry? Tesla?","Colette M. Kress","Tesla.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Tesla, yes.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Tesla is several hundred million dollars -- is multiple hundred dollars now.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","On a quarterly basis?","Jen-Hsun Huang","On an annual basis. And it grew -- nearly doubled year-over-year so...","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland. He's with FBR Capital Markets.","Christopher Rolland - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Can you guys talk a little bit about your eventual move to 20 nanometers? And it seems like you guys are staying on 28 for perhaps a bit longer than you have prior nodes. And if you are staying here for longer, is it safe to assume that you can get some gross margin uplift year-over-year?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, let's see. We're always moving to the next node. And Tegra X1, the mobile super chip that we announced at CES, is 20 nanometer, and so we're always moving forward. But the equation is much more complicated than that, and the reason for that is because we have the ability because of the fact that we architect and innovate from architecture all the way to software, we have the ability to improve our performance and efficiency and features on all of those dimensions. We can improve at the architectural level using the same process. We can innovate at the design level using the same process and same architecture. We can innovate at the process level. We can innovate at the software level. We can innovate at the algorithm level. And because we control all of that, we have the ability to move the needle forward in multiple dimensions. And so if you look at Maxwell, Maxwell is an unbelievable energy-efficient processor. And because of the energy efficiency of Maxwell, not only did we make all of GeForce higher performance, lower power, quieter, we were also able to take that GPU just a few months later and put it into a Tegra X1, and the performance is really quite shocking. And so we could innovate on multiple levels as a company. That's one of the benefits. But overall, we're moving forward all the time in process technology.","Christopher Rolland - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay, great. And then also at CES, love the automated driving stuff, but I was a little confused on the way that you're positioning yourself in that market, particularly sort of you against or either with Mobileye. I mean, I talked to one person, they say you're going head-to-head. I talked to another person, they say you're partnering. And I talked to another person at the booth who said that you guys are really enabling third parties to go after Mobileye. So how do you think about yourself positioning yourself in that market? Are you really going after them there?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Oh, wow. I appreciate that question. I think it's a great question, and the answer is actually really simple. I mean, we are in 2 different things. We make 2 different things, and so we're very complementary. Mobileye, think of it as a computer vision signal processor ISP, if you will. It's connected to the camera, and they do wonderful work in computer vision in that area. The Drive platform is a computing platform. Just as a phone has an ISP as well as the application processor, in this case, we're the application processor, if you will. This application processor has been designed to be incredible in the 3 areas that I talked about, digital cockpit, surround vision and deep learning-based computer vision. And so many of the customers -- in fact, most of the customers that I know, where there is ADAS work being done, we're both involved. And so we're connected to many Mobileye devices, and we're delighted by that. But even if you're able to detect images and objects, you still need to do something to process that information, and we can do it -- we could reconstruct the surround environment. We still have to drive infotainment in the digital cluster. And of course, we could apply higher-level deep learning algorithms to figure out what to do with the objects that you detect. And so I see ourselves very, very complementary. And of course, because we're a general-purpose processor and it's 1 teraflops of computing, we can do a lot of things for computer vision. And that's probably where people are questioning the overlap. But from where I see it, we're very complementary.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis. He's with Barclays.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Jen-Hsun, just want to follow up on in terms of the auto opportunity, just your dollar -- how is your dollar content progressing? You're talking about selling modules, multiple processors and then more importantly, monetizing the software. And then if you could talk about some of the timing here, I think the auto OEMs have become a little quicker. Where are you today in terms of the generation of products you're selling, Tegra 3 or K1? And when could you see some of these more advanced systems actually hitting revenue?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yes, I really appreciate the question, and you're exactly right. The dynamics are that more and more of the value of a car is going to have to go into its computing -- the heart and soul of its computing platform. And our expectations about our computer car and the software capabilities we can bring to bear over mechanical, electronic type of widgety things is going to grow substantially. Second, the fact of the matter is you can't spend 5 years designing a car anymore. Consumer electronics moves way too fast. People's expectations are set by what they have in their phones, and so you've got to move faster. And the most progressive car companies are moving at the speed of light now. They've taken their design cycle from 5 to 3, and I think I'm seeing them moving down to 2, potentially 1. And so this is going to be a brand new automotive industry. And the third thing that you mentioned is the content. Well, if you think about cars as a chip opportunity and it's an application processor opportunity like an infotainment like a smart phone, then, of course, it's in tens of dollars. But I actually see the car as a multi-thousand dollar computer opportunity. Some are one computer, some are many computers. And we're a computer company. We're a visual computing company. We are software-rich. All of the applications that I mentioned, the capabilities I mentioned are all software, we provide the entire BSP. We're one of the few companies in the automotive industry that can provide literally end-to-end solutions, and that's what Drive is about. Drive is a computer platform, software and all, and we provide capabilities across-the-board, okay? So I see the car, long term, as quite a large opportunity for us, not a chip opportunity because we're not a chip company anymore.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And just to reflect quickly on gross margin. I think you mentioned gaming as the tailwind for gross margin. Is that more a function of just Maxwell and pricing or you're actually seeing gaming not down as much seasonally? And then as you look out the rest of the year, how should we think of that tailwind?","Colette M. Kress","Yes, thanks for the question. So our gross margin guidance is just for Q1. We do see seasonal effects as we usually go from Q4 to Q1. We believe gaming is still a driver just due to the mix of the type that we're selling into the market, and we've also talked about accelerated computing and cloud also as a driver of our guidance in Q1.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JP Morgan.","Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Maxwell is driving a solid sum expansion into the notebook market. I think you guys started to see that in Q3, with that segment up 2x year-over-year. Customer gaming notebook platforms were pretty visible during the holiday season. So I apologize if I missed this, but how much did the notebook gaming business grow for you guys in Q4? And maybe, Jen-Hsun, if you can just help us quantify where the attach rates could go and how much this expands your GPU gaming opportunity.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yes, I really appreciate the question. Maxwell made it possible. So first of all, the background. Maxwell made it possible, for the very first time, the ability to put a high-end GPU in a laptop and deliver a desktop-quality experience. So you can now get a laptop with a GeForce in it and have -- and run AAA titles at 1080p and at quality levels and frame rates higher than the state-of-the-art game consoles. That's pretty amazing. You can now just have a nice and thin laptop, and it's better than a game console. It's better than a game console. And so people are quite excited about that. Maxwell made that possible. We see this business growing well over 100% per year at the moment simply because it's off of a small base. This has been an underserved part of the market for some time. We've really welcomed just about every company in the world -- laptop company in the world into this opportunity, from ASUS to MSI, GIGABYTE. Recently, even HP came into this. And I say even because, of course, HP is largely focused on enterprises, and yet this opportunity is so significant that their notebook business decided to jump into the GeForce platform. Of course, Dell; of course, Alienware; or course Razer. We're just seeing a lot of support from every notebook maker in the world because this is an unserved -- underserved market, if you will, and with the tech -- with the Maxwell energy efficiency, for the first time, we're able to deliver an experience that, quite frankly, is pretty amazing. And so where do I see the attach? I guess, I don't think about attach anymore, and the reason for that is because PC OEM business is not really our focus in the sense that it's already umpteen -- a low umpteen part of our business. The way we think about that business is, that's really a gaming business. And how big can it be really is a function of how many gamers are there in the world. And I think the numbers are actually quite substantial, are really quite substantial. So I see this as a growth opportunity for some time.","Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then, Colette, nice job on your part and on the team's part on the OpEx discipline in Q4 and here in Q1. How should we think about the OpEx trajectory for the remainder of the year?","Colette M. Kress","Yes, we really just are here to focus on our Q1 guidance and what we can see at this time. When we get further into the year, we'll talk about the full year. But again, we do just want to balance our Q1 with the investments that we need to make with, again, looking at the efficiencies across the org and what we can do. So I think that's a consistent theme. And you've seen us play that out in fiscal year '15, and our guidance for Q1 is about that same.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sanjay Chaurasia with Nomura.","Sanjay Chaurasia - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Jen-Hsun, one question on your GRID GPUs. I -- my impression was that you were very excited about the upcoming VMware release, and it has G8, obviously. I was just wondering if you -- does it give you better visibility in terms of upcoming deployments? And do you see that all the challenges that remain for the customers that were trialing GRID, they're really to deploy that? Or you see there are some missing pieces still? I just wanted to get some color on that.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, with VMware's integration, we're now able to engage probably some 80% of the world's enterprises. Just about anybody who has virtualized their enterprise had done so with VMware's technology. And so I think that this is a really big deal. And if you look at our trials, we went from about 400 last year at this time to well over 1,000 this year this time. Our revenues doubled. My sense is that there's no reason for that pace to slow, and we'll see how it turns out. But I would think that my intuition would be kind of like yours, that, if anything, you've got to accelerate. But there's really -- the most important thing about enterprise virtualization all the way to the client is to have deep integration with VMware, and we've done that, and they've done a great job. They've been a great partner.","Sanjay Chaurasia - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And as a follow-up, Jen-Hsun, you guys indicated some large project wins with cloud service provider on Tesla's side. Could you give us some color on what exactly is the use case? You did talk about deep learning and image processing. I just wanted to understand a little bit, if you could give us more color. And where exactly are you on that ramp? Is that kind of a lumpy deployment that you saw or is that something very early in the ramp and we could continue to see that grow?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yes, a lot of these projects are quite confidential, but I'll highlight 2 that have been public. Baidu announced that they built a supercomputer based on Tesla for deep learning, and it's used for natural language processing, translations in real-time from language to language, image recognition. Another one that was public, I just saw yesterday -- and this is actually quite a monumental event. The event is, for the very first time, for the very first time in history, a computer is able to understand images better than humans. This is a milestone event in the development of neural nets, the development of computer vision, and it was announced by Microsoft yesterday. A human has -- the best human has the ability to detect and make errors on about 5.1% of the time or recognize 95% of the images that they are presented. For the very first time in history, a computer is now able to recognize over 95%, better than a human. That, I think, is really quite a record. We will remember this day for a long time and look back on it. And they also said that their deep neural nets were trained using NVIDIA GPUs. And so you could see -- these are couple of the examples, and they were public about it. In the coming event, there's a GTC coming up. It's on March 15?","Unknown Executive","17.","Jen-Hsun Huang","17th, I'm sorry, March 17, our annual GPU Technology Conference. This year, we'll going to highlight deep learning and computer vision. I really, really encourage people who love computer technology to come and see some of the largest computer companies and most influential computer designers in the world talk about using GPUs in these areas. It's just a huge event, and this is going to be the largest GTC we've ever held. It's right here in San Jose, and this could be the Mecca for deep learning.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rajvindra Gill with Needham.","Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Could you just talk a little bit about your transition to a platform company? You definitely, over the last few years, have transformed from a component supplier to more of a platform-based business, where you're getting higher margins. I'm just wondering kind of where we are in that development cycle. And how do you look at the overall business model over the next 3 to 5 years for the company?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yes, I really appreciate the question. First of all, if you look at our company 10 years ago, 10 years ago, we were 100% PC OEMs largely. Maybe it wasn't 100%, but it was close. And now we're less than, we're only umpteen percent, substantially less than 20%. And so the company has been -- has been transitioning to this new model with our own platforms, largely software, and they serve 4 vertical markets. These 4 vertical markets have a characteristic that really, really benefits from great visual computing technology. And those 4 vertical markets, as I've mentioned, is gaming, is automotive, is enterprise graphics and is high-performance computing and cloud computing. And our PC OEM business is continuing to decline because PCs have largely become good enough, and it's fragmented. Most people use their PCs for information access, for working, and some people use it for gaming. And so for those gaming markets, we serve those. But for most of the generic and mainstream PCs, we've largely been out of those for some time. And so if you look at our business, it's now really focused on serving these 4 markets with our market-specialty platforms, and so I really appreciate that. The gross margins are obviously higher because it's very software-rich. If you extracted out the PC OEM business and just looked at those 4 segments, our gaming business, I think somebody mentioned, was growing at over 30%. Our automotive business has doubled. Our Tesla cloud computing business has doubled, and enterprise computing, our GRID business, has doubled year-over-year. And so those value-added, highly differentiated platforms are really growing nicely, and it's more than making up for the decline of our PC OEM business, which, as a result, our margins also increase. And so now you're starting to see the dynamics of the business, and it basically works like that.","Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","So very good. And last question for me with respect to GRID. So I was wondering if you could maybe update us on the design engagements with GRID in 2014 relative to, say, 2013. And as you continue on this trajectory, can you talk a little bit about how the enterprises are beginning to realize the leverage that a cloud-based visual computing architecture enables? And when do you think -- because the installed base is very large, as you've mentioned. And do you think this year will be the inflection point or are we already past the inflection point and you think we're going to start to see more acceleration of this cloud-based digital system?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yes. Well, there's -- let me break that question down into a couple of pieces. One, the number of OEM platforms that we were designed into, that we were designed into, was about 50 last year. It's almost 100 this year. About 50 this time last year, about 100 this time -- at this time. The number of trials we had last year was about 400. The number of trials we have here is about 1,000 plus. And the difference -- and I think the difference going forward for this coming year, when we stand here and look at this coming year backwards, I believe that what we're going to see is because of our now-completed integration with both VMware and Citrix and the fact that every single enterprise OEM has now adopted GRID and that GRID is making its way through just about every enterprise -- every company in the world as they get to be familiarized with them, I believe that this year could be a very important year for GRID. Now the second question that you asked is what are some of the things that people found are benefits of GRID, and I would say that there are several. The first one, the very first one is, of course, mobility. Mobility as in the sense that you can now access your PC applications from anywhere you happen to be, on any device you happen to be on. And so whatever device you have, all you have to do is have a browser and -- or an application, a receiver, if you will, a receiver application from VMware and Citrix, and you remote back into your PC. And every graphics application is perfectly compatible. The performance is wonderful, and it's where you left off, okay? So one is mobility. Second, for the benefit of the IT department, is security. No more digital downloads. The computer has now moved to the data center. The computer has moved to the data center, where the data is, so that you don't have to move the data to the client. I think that that's going to be an utter transformational event for security. And then the third is collaboration. Because more and more of us are working on the same data set and the data has become quite large, the ability to move the computer, if you will, to the data prevents all of us from having to download large data to our own client and become out of sync. And so now we can collaborate on the same data set because our computers are all right there in the data center. There are many other benefits, but these are the 3. I mean, I've also heard great stories. In Japan, one particular car company wanted to move all the workstations into the data center because it's dangerous to have so many heavy things in such tight environments. And during earthquakes, it's harder for them to manage all those different computers. And so they just have a mandate, push it all out into the data center. Another one, because of flexible workforces, this is now in Europe, large car companies do a lot of outsourcing. And because they work with different Tier 1s from a lot of different industries, it's hard for them to collaborate with them by having -- without having all their engineers of the Tier 1s of the subcontractors move on-site. And so now with GRID, they can actually have the computer be remotely accessed off-site in a secure way without digital download of the data, and the engineers, their subcontractors, can literally be everywhere. There are all kinds of anecdotal stuff. IT departments of colleges. Colleges are the perfect example -- another example. They have a large number of computers, but the computer per square meter is very, very low because, as you know, colleges are very large in campus. And then also, the people come and go. They only stay for a couple to 3 years by definition. And so in that particular case, putting all of the workstations in the data center has tremendous benefits to the IT department. So I hope that answers your question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin with UBS.","Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Jen-Hsun, if I could ask -- first ask about the gaming business in terms of PCs. In fiscal Q4, can you talk a little bit more about geographically how demand was across the developed markets as well as the emerging markets?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yes, Stephen. Our largest market is China. As you know -- as you probably are -- could guess, GeForce is the largest game platform in China, and the reason for that is because it's a market that historically hasn't had access to game consoles. It's still extremely important, given how extremely expensive consoles are. And of course, most of the titles are from the West, and most of the titles that people enjoy in China tends to be multiplayer. It tends to be role-playing games. It tends to be Internet-based games. And so though China still remains our largest market, the fastest-growing market is probably Southeast Asia. These developing countries -- developing markets, excuse me, developing markets, then they get to a certain point in their computer history and Internet history, all of a sudden, the gaming market booms. And in that area, Southeast Asia, we know now the economies have become sufficiently vibrant because of the outpouring of opportunities from China. Those local regional economies have now become quite large and quite vibrant, and we're seeing the same thing now as we saw 5 years ago in China. We're seeing the same developments in Southeast Asia. So I would say that Southeast Asia is still -- is probably the fourth largest region, but it's the fastest-growing region by far. And then, of course, the U.S. and Europe are both quite vibrant.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alex Gauna with JMP Securities.","Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","I was wondering, Jen-Hsun, if you could update us on what's going on in the licensing front. Perhaps comment on it if it's getting to the point where it might provide a tailwind to gross margins this year. Or if not this year, when?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, our licensing discussions are ongoing and quite rigorous. And the thing that is, of course, very important to note is that we are unquestionably the world leader in digital computing. And we have created so much modern computer graphics it's almost hard to make -- even make a list of it anymore, fundamentally from the invention of the GPU to modern general-purpose computing, GPUs like CUDA and others. The type of work that we're doing is obviously pioneering, and it's very important to many markets. We're open to licensing technology to companies who would like to exercise their own design and build their differentiated products, but protecting our IP is extremely important to our company. We're in discussions. Of course, the most public discussion is the one with Samsung and Qualcomm, and we're looking forward to some of the developments that will be happening in just a few more months. And so I look forward to reporting on the developments in that area in the next several quarters.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Ian Ing with MKM Partners.","Ian Ing - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Could you talk about your foundry strategy a little bit? I mean, TSMC, a good supplier, but not considered the best FinFET out there. Would you consider diversification being something you'd evaluate?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, first of all, TSMC is a fabulous supplier. And number two, their FinFET technology is excellent, and we've been evaluating it. And we -- of course, we do test chips, and our test chip technology is incredibly rigorous, and we take it very, very seriously. This has come from the years of learning that and working with advanced process nodes and fast process ramps. We take it incredibly seriously. So we're working with TSMC on FinFET now for a couple of years, and so we have quite a bit of confidence in their ability to deliver amazing FinFET transistors. I guess with respect to that, we always look to look at all foundries, and TSMC remains our most strategic, of course, and they're going to continue to be a very, very important partner for us for the foreseeable future.","Colette M.

Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Arnab. Second quarter revenue was $1.15 billion, up 5% from a year earlier and well above our forecast of $1.01 billion. Growth was driven by our GTX gaming platform's continued momentum, the gaming markets underlying strengths, and increased automotive sales.","Viewed from a segment perspective, GPU revenue was $959 million, up 9% year-over-year. Tegra processor revenue was $128 million, down 19% from a year earlier.","In the face of challenges on both the macro and semiconductor fronts, NVIDIA is executing well. Helped by our sharp focus and strong market positions, our strategy for creating platforms for gaming, enterprise graphics and virtualization, HPC and cloud, and automotive continues to serve us well as visual computing becomes increasingly more important in these industries. In Q2, these four platforms contributed 85% of our revenue, up from 68% a year earlier.","First, let's start with gaming. A market that's global and growing. Sales of PC gaming systems this year are estimated at $28 billion, with continued expansion expected; eSports, professional online gaming competitions is now a major entertainment category, with a growing audience of 130 million. This week's championship tournament of Dota 2 offers a purse of $18 million compared with $10 million for the PGA Open golf event, and there are now over 80 million people enjoying multiplayer online battle arena games, twice that of three years ago.","Our gaming revenue rose 59% year-on-year to $661 million. This exceptional performance reflects the buoyant gaming market as well as the continued strength of our Maxwell-based GeForce GPUs for the enthusiast and performance categories. The newly launched flagship GTX 980 Ti has received outstanding reviews. AnandTech, for example, called it the card that all other high-end video cards are measured against. Across all regions gamers are flocking to advanced GPUs to play enormously popular games with high production values like Grand Theft Auto V and Witcher 3. Demand is also being driven by excitement around new gaming technologies including 4K, VR and DirectX 12.","During the quarter, we rolled out SHIELD Android TV, a revolutionary device that connects your TV to an infinite world of infotainment. The world's first 4K smart TV, SHIELD was created for a new age of television, where movie, music, games and apps are delightfully simple to enjoy on one platform. SHIELD is the first of the next-generation smart TV devices. The first were streamers like Chromecast and Roku, the next will feature 4K powerful processors and rich app stores. We are excited to take SHIELD globally as supply comes online and exciting applications become available.","Moving to enterprise; our enterprise graphics and virtualization revenues declined 14% year-on-year to $187 million. Our Quadro business was hampered by the weak refi cycle and workstation market. We look forward to launch in the year's second half of workstations based on Windows 10, Intel's Skylake and new Quadro GPUs.","We continue to make good headway with our GRID virtualization platform, which enables companies to deliver graphic-rich applications like design tools from Adobe and Autodesk to employees on any device anywhere. The number of GRID customers has more than tripled in the past year to over 300 from a broad range of industries. Among the more than 40 customers added this quarter are the University of Southern California; Textron, the maker of Bell Helicopters; and Gensler, the global architectural firm. Nearly a quarter of the Fortune 100 are now in trials or in deploying GRID.","In HPC and cloud, revenue declined 15% year-on-year to $62 million, reflecting lumpiness from major deep learning projects. We strengthened our offerings in the rapid growing field of deep learning, building on momentum from our March GPU Technology Conference.","We launched digits two, (7:30), GPU accelerated software, the double's deep learning performance for data scientists and researchers. Deep learning adoption continues to grow with multiple developers for voice recognition platforms serving vast numbers of consumers. We are now engaged with more than 3,300 developers and companies interested in this area. Moreover, nearly 30,000 professionals on LinkedIn identified themselves as having proficiency in CUDA, our language for programming GPUs.","In addition, GPU computing in the cloud continues to gather momentum with multiple leading cloud services providers offering GPU computing resources. We are also excited by the opportunities presented by President Obama's call last week for the U.S. to build an exascale supercomputer, one 30 times faster than today's most powerful systems. Just as GPU technologies are being used to build the pre-exascale computers coming online in the years ahead, we believe they will be important for exascale.","Finally, automotive revenue rose 76% year-over-year to $71 million. Momentum here continues with new design at new and existing customers. Hitting the road this quarter in North America, for example, is Audi's TT sports car, which features a full digital dashboard powered by Tegra. In addition to our infotainment cockpit business, we are working with more than 50 companies interested in using NVIDIA DRIVE PX in their autonomous driving efforts.","Last quarter, we announced our intention to sell or wind down, our Icera modem operations. In the absence of a viable buyer, we are winding it down. Accordingly, we have incurred this quarter $103 million in restructuring charges, net of tax.","GAAP gross margin was 55.0% and incorporates our warranty provision for SHIELD tablet. Non-GAAP gross margins was 56.6%, in line with our outlook. Margins were slightly lower than the previous quarter as the strength of GeForce GTX revenue was offset by a lower mix of enterprise and accelerated computing GPUs.","GAAP operating expenses for the second quarter were $558 million, inclusive of $89 million of restructuring and other expenses associated with the wind down of Icera modem operations. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $421 million, including litigation charges slightly below our outlook.","GAAP net income was $26 million and GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.05 including $0.19 charge for Icera and $0.02 charge for the recall. Non-GAAP net income was $190 million, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.34. Earnings grew 13% year-over-year.","Now turning to some key balance sheet items. In Q2, our cash and marketable securities balance was $4.51 billion. During the second quarter, we paid $52 million in cash dividends and $400 million associated with an accelerated repurchase agreement. As a result, we returned an aggregate of $452 million to shareholders following $99 million in the first quarter.","Now turning to the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. We expect revenue for the third quarter of 2016 to be $1.18 billion, plus or minus 2%. We remain excited about our business prospects. Gaming continues to accelerate, and 4K, VR, Windows 10, and a pipeline of exciting games will lift it further. GPU accelerated data centers are expanding. Deep learning is a new, exciting application. And the market for car computers is expanding. We have excellent positions in each of these growth markets.","Our GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 56.2% and 56.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. This outlook is slightly below Q2 margins, reflecting our product mix.","GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $484 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $435 million. We expect fiscal 2016 non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately flat with fiscal year 2015, excluding litigation costs, which are anticipated to be in the range of $70 million to $90 million as we defend our intellectual property.","GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 are expected to be 22% and 20% respectively, plus or minus 1%. The above GAAP outlook amounts exclude restructuring charges, which are expected to be in the range of $15 million to $25 million in the second half of fiscal 2016.","We will now open the call for questions. Operator, will you please poll for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please proceed.","Harlan L. Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good afternoon. And solid job on the quarterly execution. If I look at the pipeline of blockbuster games coming down the pipe in October and November, Rainbow Six, Fallout 4, Black Ops 3 and so on, I mean, this is shaping up to be a stellar year for new game releases. And then on top of that GTX 980 Ti seems to be doing very well in the market. Why wouldn't we expect more seasonal growth in the business here for October? I guess the question is maybe offsetting that, are you guys still seeing headwinds in the enterprise and cloud or PC OEM segments in Q3?","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Harlan, there are several, I would say, four major drivers in the gaming industry. The first one is blockbuster titles, as you mentioned. The install base of game platforms is growing, so greatly that developers can now invest an enormous amount into production value of great games.","In the second half you're going to see some pretty amazing games. I mean, you didn't mention Star Wars. Myself along with everybody else are practically out of our minds waiting for it. And I think this is going to be a huge game. Call of Duty, of course, Assassin's Creed, of course. Metal Gear Solid is going to be huge. The second half of the year, we're going to see some really huge games.","The second dynamic is just eSports; eSports is probably the most social gaming platform that we have. And the reason for that is because you want to play with your friends. And it's also a form of gaming where milliseconds could make the difference between winning or losing, so performance of your platform matters a great deal. And it's a solely PC phenomenon. And it's a global phenomenon. In just a few years' time, eSports has doubled to almost 100 million gamers around the world. And this is, as I mentioned, is social. And so therefore, the network effect is quite important. And that's why you can imagine it doubling in just a few short years. And the larger the numbers, it just seems like the larger the numbers become.","And the third driver for gaming this holiday season is the combination of several platforms coming together, finally. 4K is here. The pricing is fantastic now. Windows 10 is great. And the Skylake platform from Intel is going into production now.","And then the fourth driver is a driver that we all have heard a great deal about, and surely the experience is as wonderful as the promise, is VR. And VR will go into production the second half of the year.","Each one of these drivers are a pretty large scale. And so, I would agree with you that my expectation would be that gaming is going to continue to grow, and high-end gaming particularly is going to grow nicely. The guidance that we provided is guidance that we think makes sense at this time. And then, we'll report on how it turns out at the end of the quarter.","Harlan L. Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for that Jen-Hsun. And then, the team has got this great pipeline of auto design wins. And with the new model changeover that's happening now that you guys mentioned in your prepared remarks, how is this expanding the number of new models that are rolling out here in the second half of the year, that are using the Tegra platform, and that you'll also be recognizing revenue on a go-forward basis? I guess what I'm trying to figure out is, is auto contributing to the growth in Q3 and second half of this year?","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Let's see. Well, auto is growing over 70% a year. We have eight million cars on the road now. We have 30 million more cars coming with our Tegra platform in it. And our recent initiative of utilizing deep learning in our CUDA processors, the Tegra processors, for autonomous driving is really gaining a lot of traction. We're now in engagement with about 50 companies around the world developing autonomous vehicles. The advantage that we have is the ability to capture camera inputs from all around the car.","In addition to other sensors from lidar to radar to sonar. And sensor fusion is just such an important part of autonomous driving that this Tegra platform, we call it the DRIVE PX platform, is really incredibly valuable to the car companies. And so, we're developing autonomous driving vehicles with many of them at the moment.","And so, I expect the car business to continue to grow and hard to exactly to say how it's going to do the second half. It depends on how many cars get sold. But there's no question at all that year-over-year, the growth is going to be steady. And it's going to keep going for several years.","Harlan L. Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks a lot, Jen-Hsun.","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, thanks a lot, Harlan.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin with UBS. Your line is open. Please proceed.","Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Jen-Hsun, first one for you, if I could, in terms of VR, as you mentioned that some of the new products will go into production early this year, but as far as a bigger demand inflection for that technology goes, approximately when would you think that would be really taking off in terms of unit volumes and also helping to uplift your GPU business further?","And related to that, just given that you have a lot of development on the software side, as well as on the hardware products in terms of your SHIELD products, does it make sense for NVIDIA to go more vertically integrated for VR products?","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","So, the first question is, it's hard to say, but we know that several hundred thousand development kits were sold of the Oculus glasses. And if we just take a couple 200,000 to 300,000, they tend to require higher end GPUs because you're driving stereo. You need to have extremely low latency and you need to have 90 frames a second, so that you don't see flicker, all right.","And so, those factors combined requires you to have a relatively high-end GPU. Several hundred thousand new high-end GPUs at several hundred dollars apiece adds up a bit. And that would be for the first year. It's hard to say exactly how big the VR market becomes ultimately, but if you've had a chance to try it, it's really a whole new experience. Being immersive just doesn't begin to explain how wonderful it is.","And so, I think the buzz around VR, from all the people that have experienced it and the content developers that have spoken so highly of it, is consistent with the reality at this point. It's taken many years, well, many decades, frankly several decades to have brought VR to this point, and I think it surely looks like it's ready.","To the question of what can we do more in VR, there's quite a bit that we can do in VR and we're working with Oculus and we're working with Valve to really integrate the entire rendering pipeline, the entire experience into a seamless one. That's an extraordinary amount of work to do already. In the other industries, we're going to see a lot of adoption in VR. This is an area where our work station business, our Quadro business is going to get a really great lift.","And the reason for that, of course, is being able to see and experience a product in virtual reality before you manufacture it. And so, whether you're designing a building, or designing a car, or creating a showroom, the ability to be able to put on VR and experience it before you build it is quite an extraordinary benefit. And so, we're going to see some exciting adoption in the design community as well. So, there's plenty of work to do, plenty of innovation at the rendering layer for us to do. And so, I think that's plenty for now.","Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you for that, Jen-Hsun, and as my follow-up for Colette, on the OpEx side for the October quarter, can you talk about some of the puts and takes for the OpEx spend and what the main driver for the sequential increase for non-GAAP OpEx is? Thank you.","Colette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Stephen. So, when we look at Q3, Q3 has a couple key things in it, as we get ready for the holiday season, revenue-related OpEx, as we think of marketing and others, is also in our Q3. It is also the time that we take the opportunity to look at the salaries of our employees. So, our overall salary increases for worldwide do take place in Q3.","Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya calling from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Please proceed.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you for taking my question. Very good results, very good growth in gaming, but, Jen-Hsun, I just wanted to go back to the quarter you reported, I'm wondering what changed versus your original expectations, were you just too conservative before or what changed in the quarter to really create this kind of positive surprise, and how are you making sure there is no buildup of excess inventory, given just broad macro conditions seem so volatile right now?","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, well, answering the second part first. We monitor sell-out in the channel literally every day. And so, that's how we manage inventory. We don't manage inventory on sell-in, we manage inventory on sell-out. And so, having our own specialized platforms, instead of selling into OEMs gives us a lot more visibility, frankly, than we've ever had before.","As you know, we really changed our business model from a company that sold components to PC OEMs and OEMs, mobile OEMs. We're now focused on specialized platforms for specialized applications, and we have identified four applications where we could add a lot of value. And in each one of these four applications, we're so much closer to the marketplace that the visibility is just surely better.","If you go back to the first part of your question, I think 90 days ago, just about everybody was rather uncertain about what was happening. There were a lot of changes going on around the world. Surely, there's still changes around the world, but for...","(25:09 \u2013 25:19)","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Vivek, I think your plane is here.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Oh, sorry. Sorry. Please go ahead.","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","That's all right. It's all right. It's all right. So anyways, it's just that was the best we could do at the time and we provided the best judgment we had and it turned out to have been much better than that.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Jen-Hsun, as my follow-up, could you talk about your average content in the car? Where is it now? Where can it get to? Because I think you mentioned the 30 million cars. I think you have mentioned 25 million before. And if I take the 30 million cars and I'll tell you (25:58), it means it's roughly 10% share of all the cars that are sold in a given year, so you're penetrating just the high-end of the car. So, please talk about (26:12) what the direction is, if you could quantify that would be very useful. And then in terms of penetration, is it just the high-end or are you able to get into the midrange and on the mass market as well? Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, we're trying to win as much as we can, while delivering value to the customers that we select. And our value proposition, as you can imagine, tends to be where visual computing is really important. And it could be because of large surround and dynamic infotainment systems, virtual cockpits, where you've got a digital dashboard and it's rich and it's moving and infotainment's integrated into it and maps integrated into it. It might have several virtual machines that are running at the same time, so that infotainment and digital clusters are not integrated into one computer, and it provides a safety among itself. It could be in the future several computers inside the car, some in the front, some in the back, as displays become more affordable and people's expectation for rich graphics continues to grow.","You could expect us to have infotainment systems, virtual clusters, as well as drive computers, that are used for driver assistance or autonomous driving. And so, there's a lot of different ways that a computer is going to be included in cars. I think largely the trend is very, very clear that in the future, the best way to add value to products is to connect them to the Internet and make them computerized, make it a software-defined product. And I think your car's going to become a software-defined car. And the amount of processing inside will continue to grow at an exponential level. And as a visual computing company, we think we could add a lot of value here.","And so, I think our software content is going to continue to grow. This isn't like our parents' car industry anymore. This is really a computerized car industry. And cars are going to be supercomputers in the future.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And one last one for Colette, if I may. Cash is almost 40% of the market cap now (28:37) lot of buybacks. I'm wondering, Colette, is still that's the best use of the cash or are there other options for the large cash that you've built up? Thank you.","Colette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks for the question. We tend to look at our cash balance, net of our debt as well, as we have about $1.5 billion outstanding debt. And then with our synthetic lease that we also just completed, we'll add on top of that. So, our net is probably a pretty good, a better barometer of what percentage of our value is associated.","We've looked at our capital return program heavily. We are excited at the amount that we are returning this year, close to $800 million, which is nearly in the high percentage of our free cash flow. And we'll continue to look of opportunities for our cash, whether that be investment in the business, more capital return, and\/or M&A. Thanks for the question.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Deepon Nag calling from Macquarie Research. Your line is open. Please proceed.","Deepon Nag - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Yeah, thanks a lot for taking the question. Looks like the GTX 980 Ti had a very strong quarter. And based on third-party best, again it looks like it's extremely competitive with high bandwidth memory parts from your main competition. And I think it's something we all underestimated just the value of your software and the advantage that game provides you, despite maybe some technological changes on the silicon. And maybe you could talk about your GPU roadmap for next 12 months, 18 months and whether you think your software advantage could actually allow you to maintain share even before or without an architectural change.","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Deepon, first of all, I appreciate the comment about the software, we are really, really proud of our software. And in the final analysis, a computer is not just a bunch of silicon, a computer is silicon and software and algorithms and system software and all kinds of stuff in the middle, and you can't just be a good transistor slinger, if you will, and you have to create, ultimately, a great experience.","And in the final analysis NVIDIA is a visual computing company, which is everything that includes architecture and silicon and system software and algorithms and deep understanding of applications and everything in the middle and being able to optimize it across the entire stack, so, first of all, I appreciate that comment. However, it turns out that it's not solely because of our software that the Maxwell architecture delivers so much performance, even though the memory that we use is relatively available.","And the reason for that is, because Maxwell includes a ground-breaking piece of memory technology inside the chip that compresses, reorders and does amazing things, so that we effectively received 1.5 times our bandwidth through amplification of compression and others. And so, it's a brand-new technique that has taken us several years to create, and as a result, we got a lot of effective bandwidth out of Maxwell because of that.","The benefit of doing this approach, of course, is that we can scale it across the entire family of Maxwell GPUs, all the way from the TITAN X to the GTX 980 Ti to the GTX 980, to the GTX 970, to the GTX 960, and so we can take it all the way to the mainstream because of this technique.","I think your question about long-term roadmap, I like to reserve the opportunity to surprise you with some new products in the future. However, one thing that I can tell you is this, and I think maybe you're alluding to it, people have observed us increasing performance 2X every year and a half for quite a long time. Two times, maybe even a year's timeframe. And we defied Moore's law.","Well, the reason for that is because Moore's law isn't a transistor law necessarily, Moore's law is an innovation law, and we can innovate across multiple layers, from architecture to the silicon, to the silicon design, to all of the system components around it, to the algorithm on top, to the system software that you mentioned just now, great software. We can innovate across so many layers independently and together that we can bring value to the marketplace irrespective.","For example, you were probably alluding to the fact that we stayed on 28-nanometer for quite a long time, and we did. And yet during that time, we increased performance by a factor of four to five in one node. And so, I expect that we'll be able to continue to do that.","Deepon Nag - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. Thanks a lot for that. And maybe if I can talk about the workstation in the Tesla business. It seems like it slowed down a little bit in Q2 and, obviously, Tesla a lot of high-performance computing in cloud, customers are very lumpy in their purchases, but how should we think about the growth for the entire year, and if you expect some kind of acceleration either in Q3 or Q4?","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, we saw some slowdown in enterprise buying as other people have. And I would say that in the case of our workstation platform, it probably was also postponed because the new platform architecture from Intel was delayed by a little bit.","And Skylake is a really excellent platform, it has a higher speed connectivity, it has the ability to support more memory and including DDR4 memory and in the space of workstation supported data set is very, very large and moving data in and out of the computer is so important, having that connectivity and IO capability is really important. And so, I think that along with everybody else, we're all delighted that Windows 10 is now out and Skylake is now ramping up production and hopefully the OEMs can launch a new line of great workstations.","Long-term the way to think about it is this, and the way I look at it is Quadro is all about design and creativity, and there's no question that more and more people are using digital approaches to design things and create products. And so, so long as people design and create in digital, it's going to be a growth opportunity for Quadro.","As for Tesla, it is a growing business, but it's still a lumpy business. And the reason for that is because every so often a data center comes in or a supercomputer comes in and buys tens of thousands of chips and to outfit a data center or outfit a supercomputer and so we're going to expect to see lumpiness. But the trend is clearly, clearly, is clearly visible. That accelerated computing is the way to the future.","In fact, I don't think that we've ever experienced something like this, but President Obama, this last week, signed an executive order that multiple agencies in the government will collaborate with education and industry to create an exascale computing platform.","Now, just to put that in perspective, exascale is literally 30 times faster than the fastest supercomputer we have in our country, and with President Obama's executive order, we're going to be able to create not only the world's fastest supercomputer, but 30 times faster than what we currently have in the United States. Now, just to help you understand some of the sentiments around that executive order, it's really to help the nation find a path forward in the post-Moore's law era and it says it so explicitly.","In order to achieve an exascale computing capability in some reasonable time, without power going through the roof, let me just give you one example, in order to reach approximately one exascale in the next several years or half decade, we would need a power plant \u2013 if we just used CPUs alone, we would need a power plant of about a billion watts; that's effectively powering a computer with a nuclear power plant. However, using accelerating computing which is the way the TITAN supercomputer \u2013 which is the fastest supercomputer in America today powered by 18,000 NVIDIA GPUs, that consumes only 10 megawatts to 20 megawatts, which is about the power envelope, if you will, of a supercomputer today.","And so, what we're going to do is, we're going to really endeavor to continue to advance in accelerated computing. It's very clear now this is the path forward and for many applications, whether it's life sciences, research or energy research or work in big data and artificial intelligence, that this approach to computing is really a fantastic way forward. And so, I'm very enthusiastic about Tesla.","Deepon Nag - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thanks.","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Deepon Nag - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Terrific.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann calling with Raymond James. Your line is open. Please proceed.","Hans C. Mosesmann - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks. Hey, Jen-Hsun, can you give us the rundown on the competitive dynamics over the past quarter on the auto side? There's lots of players that are out there and it gets a little confusing, so if you can give us a rundown and who are the real guys long-term that could emerge as a competitive dynamic for you guys? Thanks.","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, let's see how to answer that. I guess there's several different places in the automotive industry where innovation is happening. I think largely infotainment is a relative commodity. It is possible to build infotainment systems relatively easily; however, a virtual digital cluster, where the digital dashboard, the mapping system, the infotainment system all unifies into one virtual display. That is relatively complicated work, and the reason for that is because there's several operating systems at play, it's a very powerful virtual computer, virtual machine that's running. And the quality of software needs to be utterly exquisite; otherwise problems in one functionality like infotainment system could cause all kinds of trouble for you with your digital clusters, so that's an area where we're doing a lot of very good work and we're finding a great deal of interest. And our software capability and the performance of our processors is a real advantage.","Another place where we see a lot of traction is autonomous driving. In the first implementations, of course, it is driver assistance, observing something, an object in front of the car and applying the brakes if the car's not slowing down. That's relatively easy to do. But that's far, far, far away from autonomous driving. Autonomous vehicles are going to require sensor fusion, radar's going to get involved, lidars will get involved in the future, sonars get involved, of course, and cameras all over the car.","And so, this particular approach of autonomous driving, autonomous vehicle I think is a rather promising approach and is recognized around the world as a reasonable (40:42). And so, where sensor fusion comes in, the processing capability of Tegra and CUDA connected with smart cameras is a really wonderful approach going forward, and so that's one of the reasons why we're engaged with just about every autonomous platform that I know of anyways and the DRIVE PX is really doing well there.","Hans C. Mosesmann - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, thanks a lot, Hans.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava calling with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please proceed.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi, thank you. And Colette and Jen-Hsun if I missed it I apologize, I'm just trying to get a little bit more of my arms around the guidance for the third quarter. Based on the comments that you've provided, sounds like PC gaming will be up Q-over-Q and then auto's up, but what about PC OEM and the enterprise business? Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, the PC OEM and the enterprise business, there are reasons to be optimistic. In the PC OEM business, of course, Windows 10 has come out and before it came out there's really no reason to buy a PC in advance of it. Skylake is out, and both of these platforms should contribute to growth. But, we'll see how it turns out. We don't control the PC OEMs, and we stay very close to them and whatever opportunities comes our way we'd surely be delighted with it.","With respect to enterprise, I guess your guess is as good as ours and when the enterprises come back and purchase. I think our position with workstations, Quadro visualization is surely excellent and our position with accelerated computing with Tesla is surely excellent. Both of them are highly differentiated in the marketplace and their niche is very clear and the value we deliver is very clear. And so, when the enterprise comes back and buy, I think we're going to do very well. So, I think the answer is, we should just wait and see.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","For both Tesla and for Quadro, Jen-Hsun?","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Both of those are highly dependent on enterprise buying cycles and enterprise purchases. And so I think, as I mentioned, I'm optimistic about both of them, I'm enthusiastic about both of their positions. And with respect to the guidance, the best thing to do is just wait and see.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rajvindra Gill calling from Needham and Company. Your line is open. Please proceed.","Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC","Yeah. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the good results in light of the tough macro environment.","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC","Given your new segment reporting or relatively new segment reporting, it kind of represents kind of a transformation in your business. You didn't give out the PC OEM revenue, but if I just back into it, it does seem like the PC OEM revenue is down another 50% year-over-year, if I did it correctly, after falling about 40% year-over-year in Q1. So, now the mix of the business is where PC OEM is now only 15% of sales down from, say, 30% of sales, at the start of last year. So, I just wanted to get a sense of is that correct? And the new growth segments, if you could talk a little about what's going on in gaming and auto because gaming and auto and enterprise are now almost 85% of revenue.","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Raj, first of all, I appreciate the observation. If you look at it year-to-year, and I would just use rough CEO math here, year-to-year, our OEM business, PC OEM business and mobile OEM business are down nearly $200 million. Yet, the company grew about $50 million, which basically says that the specialized platform strategy and these four applications, these four markets that we've targeted, have made up, and some, the decline of OEMs.","The benefit is even better than that, of course, as you surely would know. The resilience of the business is greater. The value that we add to the marketplace is much, much greater, which will eventually reflect itself in gross margins. The business model is more resilient, and our end market engagement is much deeper. And so, I think in just about every possible way, it's a hard quality business, it's a more resilient business, and it's a business that our shareholders, frankly, would enjoy better long-term.","It gives us much larger growth opportunities; whereas a long time ago, I guess maybe a couple years ago, people asked why we could grow a $4 billion graphics business in a market that was only $4.8 billion large. Well, nobody would think twice if we could grow into $100 billion gaming market. And so, if we could add more and more value to a much larger end market, I think it's just a much better company. And I think that's all, you're observing is the transformation, the successful transformation, of our business model from a component business model to OEMs to a platform model with a specialty in an area that is related to visual computing.","Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC","And just as a follow-up to that point, your gaming segment is now 57% of sales versus 38% of sales this time last year. And the growth rate actually accelerated year-over-year from Q1 to Q2. And I think what the market underappreciates is the gaming market itself and how fast that's growing. So, I was wondering if you could discuss, you did a little bit before, but why is the gaming market so robust and is there anything going on by region? Any color there as well in addition to your commentary earlier in the call?","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","There are several dynamics that are happening. And it's very, very mathematical. The first dynamic is the size of the market is growing and it's driven a lot by eSports and MOBA. This is a type of game that's quite viral and it is also very social. And it has the ability to grow to larger numbers whenever we reach larger numbers. And it has a network effect. And the reason for that is because you want to play with your friends. And if two of your friends are already playing a particular game and you want to hang out with them, and when they're playing, they're talking, and they're enjoying each other's company, they're hanging out, then the third friend's going to get invited and the fourth and the fifth and before you know it just about all your friends are playing. And so it tends to work in a social effect and it grows from large numbers.","The second is the production value of games. I don't know if you've noticed or not, they're almost cinematic now. And that's made possible because of the rich algorithms that we put on top of our GPUs, we call GameWorks, because of our GPUs. And when the production value is high, it consumes a lot more GPU. It's very different than movies. A Blu-ray movie, whether it's beautiful or not so beautiful, is basically Blu-ray. But for computer games, in order to have beautiful games, you need more powerful GPUs, and so that's very mathematical.","And the third is 4K displays is a lot more pixel than 1080p, 8 million pixels over 2 million pixels. It's a lot more pixels. And the number of pixels we can process is directly related to the power of the GPUs. And then all of a sudden, you add VR on top of that. And so, you need very high-resolution displays. You need two of them because you're in stereo and you also want to render it at a much, much higher frame rate. Instead of 30 frames a second, you want to render it at 90 frames a second. And so, it's times two times three. And so many of these type of experiences are driving the GPU adoption upward. And we're definitely seeing that trend. So, both the larger market and increasing adoption of higher end GPUs. And that's what you're basically seeing.","Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC","Excellent color. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank Research. Your line is open. Please proceed.","JiHyung Yoo - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, Jen-Hsun. Given that gaming is slated to grow up over 20% year-on-year this year, how should we think about growth longer term? And Colette, how can we think about the gross margin impact from the growth of gaming?","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","That's a good question, Ross (sic) [Ji Yoo] (50:35). And let's see, how do you think about it? I guess the way I think about it is, it's related to the number of gamers. It's related to the production value of games. And so long as the number of gamers continue to grow and the number of gamers have practically doubled in MOBA in the last three years to almost 100 million gamers. And yet 100 million gamers is not that many gamers in the context of people who watch television. And we know that just about every young adult is a gamer today. And so, it stands to reason that gaming is going to be a very, very large industry. And almost everybody is going to game. It's about $100 billion today. It's hard to say exactly how big it's going to get. But it's hard for me to imagine that it would stay at $100 billion.","And so, those things hopefully will continue to drive the growth of gaming. And our dedication to the space, the investments that we've made over the course of nearly two decades in the space, has really put us in this opportunity to benefit from this growth. Okay. Go ahead.","Colette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And then further on your question of gross margins for gaming, we reviewed our gross margins by our market platforms on our Analyst Day, really kind of highlighting the success of our strategy in these platforms. And so many of them have higher gross margins than our company average.","So, yes, we can benefit from gaming, which does have a slightly higher gross margin company average right now. Of course, there's always mix factors that come into play each quarter. But it does help contribute to our great success that we've been showing on our gross margin over the last couple quarters.","JiHyung Yoo - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. And sorry, yes, this is Ji Yoo for Ross Seymore. As for the follow-up question, you discussed the lumpiness of spending from customers in deep learning. We've seen CapEx cuts from the likes of cloud customers. So, what are you hearing from cloud customers in terms of slowing of their data center and cloud build-outs for the year? Or are they cutting CapEx in other areas besides data center and cloud?","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","I really appreciate that question. In fact, we see the most success when there's pressure on CapEx. And it seems counter intuitive, but the reason for that is this: the consumption of flops, and the need for fast searches, whether it's voice search, natural language processing and translation of voice, image search, transcoding of images, when you send video up in one resolution, they want to maybe store it or transcode it or stream it in a different resolution.","The ability to take poor video and enhance it, herky-jerky video, and all of a sudden you stabilize the video and make it beautiful. All of that video processing and all of that search is going to require the data center to be much, much more powerful.","And the benefit of GPUs is that by adding GPUs, you don't have to incur a great deal of expense, but you can increase the performance of your data center tremendously. Let me give you the case in point: we increased the performance of the Oak Ridge supercomputer by a factor of 10. By a factor of 10, with just 18,000 GPUs. It was a retrofit. The most powerful supercomputer in our nation today, it's a retrofit. It's a retrofit of an existing supercomputer.","And so, if you could imagine retrofitting data centers with GPUs, it would increase the throughput, the computational throughput, arguably by a factor of 10 just like we've done for the Oak Ridge supercomputer. And as a result, the CapEx doesn't have to go up very much. So, that's one of the benefits of acceleration. It takes advantage of your current infrastructure, and you can improve its capability by upgrading it with a GPU.","JiHyung Yoo - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Please proceed.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks very much. What percentage of desktops sold currently do you consider to be gaming desktops? And what would be the answer for notebooks?","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","David, I'm not sure \u2013 one more time, what is...?","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Well, you're talking about...","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","In dollars, the gentleman earlier had already decoded our OEM sales. Our PC OEM sales represents only a few percentage of our total revenues now.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","No.","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","And so, that's a way to think about it. And gaming, of course, is a very large percentage of our revenues.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","No, but I'm not talking about your revenues. I'm talking about the overall market, if one considers the market of desktops. So, what percentage of units of desktops do you consider gaming, that are taking up your gaming GPUs?","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","I see. Very good question. Incredibly small, surprising. And the reason for that is this: most gamers buys a PC and then upgrades it maybe three, four cycles. Does that make any sense to you? They buy our GeForce cards directly from ETAIL, they take it home, they pull it out of the box, they install it into their computer, and sometimes they cut a hole in it, so that it can see the graphics card. Sometimes they paint the chassis with car paint, so that they can personalize it, fall in love with it, and they upgrade it for years to come.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Great. And on a second matter, Tesla. I think last quarter you kindly provided us the revenue. I think it was $79 million. What was it this quarter?","Colette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It was \u2013 hold on \u2013 in our thing. It is $62 million this quarter.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much.","Colette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You're welcome.","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome, David.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Gauna with JMP Securities. Your line is open. Please proceed.","Alex D. Gauna - JMP Securities LLC","Thanks for getting me in. And congratulations on the strong quarter. Jen-Hsun, I'm wondering, you talked about 50 incremental designs in a driver assist, as well as maybe 30 more million units. Does that 50 more customers totally encompass that 30 million, or is there more on top of that to come? Thanks.","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, thanks for the question, Alex. Most of the 50 are new customers. And the reason for that is because the number of companies that are working on autonomous driving cars are not just necessarily car companies.","Car companies are going to invest in more and more autonomous capabilities. However, there are many companies who are creating autonomous cars that could be used as a service. And so, you're going to see the car industry bifurcate in some really exciting and interesting ways. On the one hand, car companies are going to make cars more capable and safer and more joyful to drive.","On the other hand, you're going to see new startup companies, and maybe exciting startup companies, that create fleets of autonomous vehicles that are operated as a service. And so they come at the world very differently. And autonomous vehicles come in a lot of shapes and forms. They're not all passenger cars. And so, this is an area of a lot of very exciting development. And we're working with a lot of them because we have a platform that was really designed to fuse computer vision cameras from all around the car as well as radars and lidars and sonars, and be able to do path planning and all of those kind of capabilities that you're going to need for an autonomous vehicle.","Alex D. Gauna - JMP Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Congratulations again. Great quarter.","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, thanks a lot, Alex.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sanjay Chaurasia calling from Nomura Research. Your line is open. Please proceed.","Sanjay Chaurasia - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Hey, Jen-Hsun. One question on the gaming growth. If I look at combined discrete GPU market between NVIDIA and AMD, if my estimates are right, AMD lost roughly 300 million in discrete GPU market from 2014 to 2015. And you are gaining 300 million, roughly. So, if I look at the whole discrete gaming market between both of you, it would appear it's stable. So, how do I reconcile this and the commentary that the gaming is growing for you? Is it growing for the \u2013 between both of you or is it growing for you? I just wanted to understand how would you reconcile this?","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, you know AMD's business a lot better than I do, surely. But I can't imagine the math working out. The GPU business is larger than it has ever been. And so, I can't imagine that being a share gain. And the applications that we're in are applications that have never been conceived as before. And so, I can't imagine it being something that's a shared gain matter. And so, whether it's in deep learning, whether it's the growth of MOBAs, the number of gamers around the world that are engaging in eSports and MOBA is surely an increase.","The gaming market in Southeast Asia's growing, the gaming market in Latin America is growing, the gaming market in China continues to grow even through a slower economy. People are just getting born and they grow up and one day they discover that their other friend's game, and they get into gaming and so I think the number of gamers of the next-generation is more than the gamers of the previous generation. And I think all of that is very logical and it's kind of sensible. And so, that's kind of how we see it. And we're really not correlated at all to anything that AMD's doing anymore. Not that I...","Sanjay Chaurasia - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay. As a follow-up question on GRID, so you're at several thousands of customers and just wondering what feedback, what issues, concerns that you have seen that may be taking longer for it to ramp?","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","I appreciate that. Thanks for that opportunity to answer the question. Enterprise trials surely takes a long time, but the benefit of an enterprise business is that it remains sticky for a very long time. This time last year we've deployed 100 customers and today we've deployed 300 customers.","Our partnership with VMware is on full steam. You probably heard from their conference call and their commentary how enthusiastic they are about end user computing. And since Horizon supported vGPU in the last couple of quarters, the engagement across the board is just incredibly high and the pipeline is very healthy.","And so, I think this is an area in enterprise computing that's just going to take time and this is a long-term bet, but there's no question in my mind that the value of virtualizing an enterprise end-to-end, because of heterogeneous computing, because of security, because data is getting so large, it is better to keep it in the data center, and because people's work styles are more mobile and more flexible than ever, these dynamics are not going to go away.","And virtualization of the PC applications that are not going to go away either that are relied upon by enterprises all over the world, virtualizing those applications is really the right way to go forward in modernizing your company. And so, I have a lot of enthusiasm and faith in this product line and it appears that the rest of the IT industry is equally excited about it.","Sanjay Chaurasia - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Great. Thanks so much, Jen-Hsun.","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis with B. Riley & Co. Your line is open. Please proceed.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking the question and congratulations.","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Craig.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Jen-Hsun, just starting off with a higher level question that cycles back to Analyst Day. At Analyst Day, you highlighted four platforms with secular growth dynamics to them. With some of the softness that we've recently seen in the macro, does that have any impact on the growth that you would expect intermediate term from those four platform groups; gaming, auto, enterprise, and HPC and cloud?","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, the interesting thing is wherever an enterprise gets involved, we are surely affected by slowdown. However, when our products are bought and sought out one at a time, we tend to experience what the large industry would experience. So, in the case of gaming, it's a consumer product, it's a consumer market. And people buy the product not because they can afford it, necessarily. They buy the product because they want to play the game. And so, when a new game comes out and it's too good not to play, something like Star Wars or something like Call of Duty or something like League of Legends, it's just too good not to play. People will find a way to afford one of the GeForce graphic cards.","And in the case of cars, the car industry is moving forward in autonomous vehicles and cars are becoming more and more computerized and irrespective of the economy, the high-end segments of the car market seems to be doing quite well. And maybe oil prices have something to do with that as well, but we're seeing just a really exciting adoption in the higher end segments of the market where new technology is really transforming the car.","And then with respect to deep learning, I think the jury is now, well, I was going to say, it's pretty clear now that deep learning has an opportunity to make a real difference in computer science. Using a large amount of data to write the software itself is a pretty astonishing development.","And our GPU business is making it practical to train networks that are trained and taught by just an enormous amount of data, has really opened up this field for rapid innovation. And so, we're seeing a lot of excitement there. And so, these platforms that we talked about I think are exciting and making contributions on fundamental levels, and I'm hopeful that we'll continue to grow through the rest of the year.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Thanks. The follow-up is for Colette. Colette, on the base band wind down, can you just provide some more detail with regards to what you'd expect with the cost for that coming out of the system? I understand that you've said you're going to reinvest that and there's legal expenses this year, but can you give us a few more time lines related to that exit?","Colette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, we had started a good portion of the wind down of the business in Q2. We are still working on shutting down that piece, so we have a couple pieces which is reflective of our restructuring charges that we planned for Q3 associated with it. So, we're just nearly done, but we still have a couple open issues that we're working through on that.","As related to what we are going to invest in, as we've talked about on the call, we talked about the deep learning, really thinking about the automotive business, and of course, in terms of gaming and those investments to assure where we are well positioned for going forward. However, our overall plan, excluding the overall litigation expenses is to still be flat OpEx year-over-year with fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015. Just to give you a little bit of color in terms of what we're planning on there and if you have anything further just let us know.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Just a follow-up there. Will restructuring charges conclude in the fiscal third quarter or will they carry into the fourth quarter?","Colette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Again, it's a little hard for us to determine that. We commented on them mainly as the second half as we are still working through with those employees on their exit. So, I can't conclude that they would be in Q3 and they may move into Q4.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland with FBR Capital Markets & Co. Your line is open. Please proceed.","Christopher Adam Jackson Rolland - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Hey, guys. So looks like stand-alone GPU purchases and pure gaming products, they're becoming a larger percentage of sales and mix, particularly as discrete GPUs kind of mix down here. So, should we be looking at Q4 differently now? Does the holiday season have more impact now than it's had in prior years? And could this be a year where we get better than typical seasonality?","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think we ought to just enjoy a seasonality first and then we'll come back and comment on it. What really drives our business, what really drives our business are the games that come out, the quality of the games, the production value of the games, and the global growth of gaming.","United States is not very much a \u2013 well, let me just say opposite. United States is very much a game console market. And the reason for that is very clear. We have the benefit of family rooms and people have their own bedrooms. But around the world, especially markets that are just developing and growing, the PC platform is a platform that every family needs and every individual needs anyways, and so they tend to be a PC gaming market.","And in addition to that, because of eSports and MOBA, which is very clearly the most exciting area of gaming today, that is largely a PC phenomenon. And so, those are really the factors that drive our growth. And this second half of the year, we're really fortunate to have some amazing, amazing titles coming out whether it's Star Wars or Call of Duty, Assassin's Creed, Metal Gear Solid, these are franchise titles with just an enormous number of players that are waiting for it, and so I'm looking for it as well and hopefully it will drive for a good season.","Christopher Adam Jackson Rolland - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Great. In autonomous driving, your main competitor some consider a monopoly in the space. They're only spending maybe $40 million a year in R&D. You spend probably 30 times that in your total company and I'm pretty sure you'd feel comfortable spending multiples of that just on the autonomous driving segment. So do you guys see this as an opportunity for you guys kind of lower hanging fruit here? How should we view spending, how you're thinking about this, and just a smaller one, how do we sort of split your R&D between software and hardware spend in the area?","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, well, we don't spend all that on autonomous driving, of course. We're a visual computing company with four platforms and one of our platforms is autonomous driving or Drive, which is our car platform.","Our approach to \u2013 the current market for what is called ADAS, driver assistance, relies on a smart camera, if you will. It's a camera that can detect objects. And objects of a certain list. And in the future, autonomous driving is surely more than detecting objects, and it will surely require more than cameras. You can't drive in the dark. You can't see in the dark if you can't see. You know, and so having cameras alone is not good enough. And for cars using lidars and using radars and sonars and cameras all over the car, that is what the industry calls sensor fusion to realize insight by fusing the input of multiple sensors.","And in our case, we're going to use deep learning the same approach that we've been using for much of the work that we do and that's been talked about in deep learning to assist and to help realize this vision of an autonomous vehicle.","Along the way, of course, we're going to have all kinds of capabilities. And the benefit of our approach is \u2013 it's very compatible with smart cameras. And so, most of the platforms that we're in today, in fact, are harmoniously working with smart cameras that are either home grew or bought from a third-party. And also processing on our platform. And so, we see it as a compatible path to the future. And the road to autonomous driving is \u2013 there's lots of innovation yet. And your last question was, Chris?","Christopher Adam Jackson Rolland - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Yeah, just in terms of your spend on that part, call it ADAS in autonomous, what's software and what's hardware, how do you sort of split that out or think about it?","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, just the company largely is a software company and the reason for that is because we're about algorithms. And if you look at the company, although we're well-known for building some of the most complex processors in the world, that represents probably about a third of our engineers. Two-thirds of our engineers are algorithm experts and computational mathematicians and system software experts and so on and so forth. And so, that's pretty consistent in ADAS as well. We're about two-thirds software.","Christopher Adam Jackson Rolland - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please proceed.","Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk about DirectX 12. What kind of impact you think that might have. I know these things don't come along that often, but does that have a strong impact in any one short period, or is that sort of more drawn out over time?","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Boy, I cannot wait for DirectX 12. And the reason for that is DX12 has been re-architected particularly in the geometry perimetive part of the pipeline. It can now process geometry with much, much lower load on the CPU than ever before. And so, the benefit is that we're going to be able to pump through a lot more geometric fidelity, a lot more geometry processing into the GPU. And so, you're going to see just much, much more beautiful graphics.","On the other hand, it takes a lot of pressure off the CPU. And the CPU can now be used for other type of tasks, network more players and deal with scenes that has a lot more characters, maybe more artificial intelligence algorithms, and making your opponent, if you will, the computer opponent smarter. And so, you're going to be able to do a lot more things with DX12. I'm super excited about it.","Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. And then I just have a question. You guys have talked in the past a little bit about using FPGAs to accelerate servers versus graphics. Given the importance that Intel's placing now on FPGA server acceleration, how do you see the value proposition of Tesla in that same space?","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think that, first of all, I guess, at this point a foregone conclusion that accelerated computing is an essential part of future scaling in the what is called, the post- Moore's law era. And accelerated computing can come in a lot of different forms. An FPGA is a configurable computer, and so if you don't have that many different types of algorithms, and you can afford the expense and the difficulty of designing an FPGA, you can get results. It's basically designing your own customer chip that runs slower because ASICs are faster. But still, you're designing a customer chip.","On the other hand, a GPU is not about designing, it's about programming. And so, if you have large different types of algorithms, you're changing your algorithms on a regular basis, the throughput that you get with a GPU that we've built, which is arguably already the most complex that any processor has ever been built anyhow. And so, it gives you a lot more flexibility. And so, these are all spectrums, if you will, of accelerated computing. But, the thing that is really fantastic is finally on a very, very large scale and across the industry the recognition that accelerated computing is the path forward.","Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore. Your line is open. Please proceed.","C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI","Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, Jen-Hsun, when you look at PC gaming and strength and sustainability into the back half, it looks like you came in about 150 million more than what you were thinking at least initially for the guidance. I'm curious if there's any sort of color you can provide there in terms of mix, higher ASP strength geographically?","And then looking at the second half of the year, first half fiscal 2016's growing about 40% year-over-year. How should we think about the second half versus the first half, particularly given those four drivers that you outlined at the early part of the call?","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, let me answer the second one first and maybe Colette can help you with the first one. On the second one, the thing that I feel much more confident in answering is our position in the market and the health of that market.","I am pretty sure that gaming is a large-scale phenomenon and growing. I'm pretty sure that MOBA is a social network, that when you're playing games, you're hanging out with your friends, and when some of your friends are hanging out on MOBA, you've got to join it, otherwise you don't get to hang out, and so the reason why these large markets get larger.","The benefit of a very large market is that finally developers, publishers, can invest several hundred million dollars in building a new game of extraordinary production value and launch it into a very large market. The benefit of a large production value game to us is that it needs really, really great GPUs.","And so, those positive feedback systems, those positive feedback effects, are things that I understand very, very well. Now, how's the seasonal buying in the second half and exactly how many percent and how many we're going to sell it's kind of harder for me to tell. But, I do know that our gaming business is quite robust.","On the other stream, I know what I know about the autonomous vehicles and the processing that is necessary to achieve and realize that dream and where we are on that dream. We're still quite a ways from it, in fact, to do something that we can really, really count on.","And then on accelerated computing, I'm pretty confident at this point that accelerated computing has reached a tipping point, in that it has been recognized around the industry and globally that this is a very good approach forward, both for supercomputing, already adopted by our nation's fastest supercomputer, but and also the recognition by the presidential initiative to adopt methods to bring exascale to the marketplace in the next several years. Accelerated computing will surely be required. And so, I think that those things I feel very strongly about and I think it's pretty clear our position within each one of those are very good.","Colette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. And to help answer your question regarding our performance in the quarter on gaming and how well it did and where did it come from in terms of is that ASP, is that volume, is it region?","And the answer to that is yes, yes, and yes. The value that we delivered in our high GTX cards were truly well received by the market. That high value affords us a great ASP and a great revenue growth. We've seen tremendous volume over this quarter as well, which has helped us; but thirdly, which I think is important, is all regions from a sell-through are also performing very well.","C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI","Very helpful. Thank you.","Colette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I think with that we have one more question for the group. Operator, if we can take that last question.","Operator","Certainly. The last question comes from the line of Matthew Ramsay with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open. Please proceed.","Matthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Thank you very much and congrats on the quarter. Thanks for squeezing me in. Jen-Hsun, as you may appreciate, there's been a little bit of angst in the investor community regarding the Chinese consumer, given all that's gone on over there in the stock market et cetera and it seems like your gaming business has obviously done quite well and maybe you could talk a little bit about the concentration of your gaming business that maybe ends up in China and how the trends are playing out in that market overall, because it seems you guys are doing much better than folks might appear? Thanks.","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I appreciate the question. About 40%, I guess. Just shy of 40% of our total gaming business is in China. The Chinese market is surprisingly resilient, because most of the games are free to play. It is probably one of the most affordable form of entertainment that you can possibly imagine.","And, as I mentioned earlier, these networked games are really social environments. They're social networks. One of the reasons why Tencent grew so fast in China. Once the social network gets traction, it grows faster than linear. And so, there's some reasons why the Chinese market is more resilient, the gaming market is more resilient than expected.","We're also seeing a shift to higher end GPUs in China. Some of that probably has to do with the dramatic change in improvement in production value of games in China. There was a time when the Chinese games were enjoyed and fun. However, the production values weren't very good, but now if you take a look at the Tencent games, the production value are absolutely phenomenal. They're beautiful. They're artistic and in those cases require a lot more GPU capability. And so, we're seeing multiple dynamics happening in China and they all seem to be quite healthy.","Matthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","All right, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. I will now turn it back to the speakers for their closing remarks.","Jen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, everybody, and I'll talk to you next quarter.","Colette M.

And we believe that due to the later timing of Ivy Bridge rollout this year, the lion\u2019s share of market share gains are still to come in the third quarter.","Our desktop GPU business was also up this quarter from strong GeForce GTX sales. Up to now, due to supply limitations, we have only been able to address the enthusiast market.","Finally, we\u2019re able to bring Kepler to the core PC gaming market. From our data of the global install base, roughly 80% of gamers have graphics cards that are below the recommended specifications of the wave of new games coming out in the second half of the year. Kepler is the perfect upgrade for the millions of PC gamers around the world. Kepler will soon be flowing into our professional businesses.","Our Professional Solutions business was down slightly in the second quarter from the previous quarter but with the recent introduction of the Tesla K10 and K20 GPU for high-performance computing, we anticipate growth again for Tesla starting next quarter as it begins to ship.","Tegra had a record quarter. As you and the press have obviously noted, Tegra 3 is showing up in some of the world\u2019s most exciting mobile devices and the businesses is ramping. Google recently announced and launched to tremendous response the Nexus 7, the world\u2019s first $199 quad-core 7-inch tablet. The Nexus 7 runs the newest version of Android 4.1, Jelly Bean. It is the perfect device for the hundreds of millions of consumers who use Android phones and would like to enjoy the same content on a larger display.","Microsoft this quarter, unveiled its own Windows RT powered tablet called Surface, again driven by a Tegra processor. A groundbreaking mobile device powered by Tegra 3 was Fujitsu\u2019s ARROWS X, the world\u2019s first quad-core LTE smartphone, which began shipping into Japan.","Tegra processors also began shipping in automobiles this quarter, powering Tesla Motors\u2019 Model S 17-inch touch screen infotainment and navigation system, the largest ever in a passenger car. Tegra also powers its all-digital instrument cluster. For drivers, the system provides larger, more-readable maps and a beautifully rendered instrument cluster that can be personalized from the multi-function steering wheel.","With that, let me hand the call over to Karen.","Karen Burns","Thanks, Rob. Revenue of $1.04 billion increased 13% quarter-over-quarter meeting the high-end of our outlook. Driving this strong demand for our desktop \u2013 driving this were strong demand for our desktop GTX GPUs and record quarters for our notebook and Tegra products. GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 51.8% and non-GAAP was 52%, representing an increase from Q1 of 1.7% and 1.6 percentage points respectively. Improved 28-nanometer supply enabled us to ship more of our Kepler GPUs in the high-end segment.","GAAP OpEx was $401.1 million and non-GAAP was $342.5 million, both much better than our outlook. GAAP OpEx was up on our announced charitable contribution of $25 million. Its net present value of $20.1 million was charged to OpEx as a nonrecurring item. Non-GAAP, which excluded this charge, was down from the prior quarter benefiting from lower discretionary expenses. These results contributed to GAAP net income of $119 million, a 97% increase over the prior quarter equivalent to $0.19 per diluted share, which was up 90%. Non-GAAP net income was $170.4 million, a 75% increase from Q1, equivalent to $0.27 per diluted share, a 69% increase.","Revenue results by business segment were as follows. Our GPU business was up 15% sequentially due to the strong demand for our desktop performance and enthusiast products, and growing notebook share as the industry continues to move to the Ivy Bridge platform.","Our Professional business was down 8% sequentially due to continued weak economic conditions in Europe and the slower ramp of Romley platforms. Our Consumer business was up 36% on the strength of our Tegra business.","While we continue to be supply constrained, our GAAP outlook for the third quarter is as follows: revenue of $1.15 billion to $1.25 billion; gross margin of 51.8%, flat from the second quarter; OpEx of approximately $390 million. We expect our tax rate for the quarter to be 20% plus or minus 1 percentage point.","For non-GAAP, we expect the following differences from our GAAP outlook: gross margin at 52%, flat from Q2; OpEx of approximately $350 million, which excludes stock-based compensation and certain other charges related to acquisitions in aggregate of approximately $40 million. Depreciation and amortization are expected to be in the range of $57 million to $59 million and capital expenditures of $30 million to $40 million. Diluted shares are expected to be approximately 630 million.","Rob Csongor","That concludes our prepared remarks. We\u2019ll now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Vivek Arya.","Vivek Arya","Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering, last year you had two very good quarters with Tegra in July and October to be followed by a quarter of some inventory adjustment. Are conditions different this year? Should we expect it to play out similarly this year?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, we wouldn\u2019t have guided what we guided if we didn\u2019t have faith and confidence in the Tegra growth. The difference I guess may be more important to talk about is this year, I think that it is relatively clear that the Android tablet, particularly Nexus 7, the Transformers from ASUS they\u2019re doing really well.","And the reason for that is because it has taken us some time to get the cost, the functionality and the quality of the experience really, really good. You now know that there are hundreds of millions of Android phones around the world and whereas the first tablets when they first came out were introduced with the Honeycomb operating system, the Honeycomb operating system was very different from the Android phone operating system at the time.","But now with Jelly Bean and Ice Cream Sandwich, the applications and the investments that you make in your Android phone, all of those applications just magically show up on your Android tablet and so this Android tablet is a really wonderful, higher resolution and larger format display for you to enjoy your content when you\u2019re not running around, when you\u2019re sitting at home. And so if you haven\u2019t had a chance to try the Nexus 7 I really urge you to. It\u2019s the first thing I use in the morning and it\u2019s the last thing I use at night. And it\u2019s really wonderful that all of the applications and all of my content stay synchronized between my One X phone and the Nexus 7 tablet.","And so I think that the momentum of the products that we have are much stronger. Our position in the market is much stronger. And we\u2019ll see how these devices do in the marketplace. But at the moment, we\u2019re quite confident in their position in the market.","Vivek Arya","Thanks, Jen-Hsun. And just for my follow up on the Professional Solutions business, how much of it is macro? How much of it is Romley delay? How much are product specific issues? When should we expect that to pick up? Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, Quadro and Tesla are unique in the marketplace and we\u2019ve gained share if anything. So the market position of Quadro and Tesla are very good. Their value proposition are very unique and the people that buy Quadro and Tesla buy it because they need it. It\u2019s not a discretionary expense. They need those products. During times when the economy is a little slower and right now, as you know, the economy is rather slow in Europe and in China that affects people\u2019s enterprise consumption. So that\u2019s a factor.","The other factor is the Romley platform launch. It\u2019s a very important platform. And it started out in servers and it\u2019s in the process of moving into workstations and I\u2019ve got a lot of confidence in Intel\u2019s execution. They will ramp up those workstation platforms and the OEMs are all fully charged up to ramp up those workstation platforms. And then on top of that we have the Kepler GPUs that are flowing into Quadro and flowing into Tesla and so I think the trajectory is good and I think things will work itself out.","Vivek Arya","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Patrick Wang.","Patrick Wang","Great. Thanks for taking (inaudible). The first question, I wanted to ask you about GPU. You talked about being \u2013 still being in a supply challenged environment. I\u2019m just curious how much business you feel like you might\u2019ve left on the table? And separately, if you could talk about the trajectory of your 28-nanometer supply and whether or not you feel like your shortages are going to subside this quarter?","Jen-Hsun Huang","We have no idea how much business we left on the table. And we expect to be supply constrained throughout the quarter. We\u2019ve taken the supply constraints in consideration for our guidance. And if the supply situation comes in the way we expect, we\u2019ll have some upside. And I know that TSMC is working as hard as they can for us and so we\u2019ll report on what we learn at the end of the quarter. Thank you.","Patrick Wang","Great. Thanks. And just as a quick follow up I wanted to ask about your plans on having an integrated solution. I think that some of your other competitors out there are trying to ramp at least an integrated processor baseband solution. What are your plans there? Are you guys still on track to really introduce, I guess, codename Grey, sometime in the next couple quarters here?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, there\u2019s only one integrated LTE solution in the world today and I think it\u2019s pretty clear that going forward, in order to build a world-class phone and a top-tier phone, you need to have a world-class application processor which includes great CPU and great GPUs.","And you need to have a world-class software stack. These phones are increasingly becoming computers. It\u2019s not just a telephone anymore. And so having a software stack that allows you to concurrently use all of the wonderful things that we\u2019ve come to know our phone and more is really, really hard to do. And there are very few companies that provide that today. And the third of course is a state-of-the-art modem and baseband.","And that is exactly the reason why we bought a company called Icera. And our intention is to integrate those three major pieces to provide a really great platform for our customers. We haven\u2019t announced when Grey is going to be available in the marketplace, but we\u2019re working as hard as we can for it and when we do introduce it, it would, as you\u2019d expect and as the reason why you\u2019re asking, expand our market position and expand our market potential tremendously.","Patrick Wang","Great. If I could squeeze in one quick last one. Congrats on the very strong guidance for the third quarter here. Can you help us understand which parts of your business may be growing above or below that 15% sequential rate that you provided? That\u2019s it for me. Thanks so much.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yeah, first of all, thank you. The GPU business is growing. GeForce is growing faster than the sequential rate. Tegra is growing much faster than the sequential rate. And the reason those two, you could probably guess, is because Quadro is not growing as fast as the sequential rate. Okay. Thank you.","Patrick Wang","Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Glen Yeung.","Glen Yeung","Thanks for letting me ask a question. I wanted to ask little bit about China. When you guys initially discussed Tegra 3 wins you\u2019d mentioned that China was a big component of that. And wanted to just get a sense from you how you think that business will ramp? Is it white box or branded names? And what kind of ASPs of phones will you be selling into?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yeah, we\u2019re just now ramping into the China, what we call the affordable superphone segment. Basically, all of the capabilities of today\u2019s superphone but really engineered for affordability and Tegra 3 has such a great reputation, the software stack is really exquisite and so we\u2019re quite excited about it. There are many phones being created right now. A couple of them have been announced and we\u2019re expecting them to ramp shortly. We still expect China to be a big market opportunity for us.","If you look at the overall market, the U.S. is very LTE-centric. Korea is very LTE-centric. It\u2019s very important to have LTE and we don\u2019t have a very good position there until our i500 standalone LTE modem starts \u2013 goes into production and when our integrated solution goes into production. Until then, our target is really focused on the superphone and the premium phones in the non-LTE parts of the marketplace and that would be Europe, that would be Asia and China. And so, we still expect those to be really terrific markets for us.","Glen Yeung","Jen-Hsun, just to follow up there when you are creating an affordable superphone, obviously there\u2019s a price implication on the BoM. How much of a role do you play in that versus other components in the phone that \u2013 where they can make different choices?","Jen-Hsun Huang","We\u2019re a relatively small component overall for these phones and so it\u2019s not a factor yet.","Glen Yeung","Okay. And then one last quick question on the non-Apple tablet market, you alluded to the idea that you do see momentum there and it sounds like that momentum is better than last year. I guess really just trying to get a sense of your confidence level there, how much bigger perhaps you think the opportunity is, not necessarily for you but for the market, the non-Apple market this year versus last year?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, I think we found the position. For every product, if you want to be like another product and something like iPad, it\u2019s not particularly a smart, smart strategy. But the Nexus 7\u2019s value proposition is not to be a cheaper iPad. It\u2019s to be a peripheral or a companion device for someone who\u2019s really invested in the Android operating system. And the Nexus 7 finally, from a tablet perspective, made it really, really easy for you to enjoy and to synchronize all of your content that you\u2019ve already invested in for your Android phone to just magically shows up on your Nexus 7 device. It tells \u2013 just picks up where I left off when I\u2019m reading a book. All of my music is there. All my books are there. All the readers are there. It\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s the same e-mail. It\u2019s just fantastic.","And so when I\u2019m traveling, when I\u2019m running around during the day, I use my One X and when I get home I turn on my Nexus and I just pick up where I left off. And so, I think that the value proposition is just much more clear now and the build quality is fantastic. ASUS did a fantastic job. Google did a fantastic job with Jelly Bean. Google Play is really easy to use.","Magazines are there. Books are there. Movies are there. And so, I think it\u2019s taken this long to really build a platform that adds value to Android users. And so that\u2019s the value proposition. It\u2019s not an alternative to an iPad. It\u2019s really a device that enhances the user experience for someone who\u2019s an Android user and there happens to be hundreds of millions of Android users. And so I think this is a \u2013 I think the niche is really well met and I think they\u2019ve done a really good job.","Glen Yeung","That\u2019s a good answer. Thanks for that, Jen-Hsun.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yeah, thanks a lot, Glen.","Rob Csongor","By the way, appreciate all of the questions, but just to make sure that we give everybody an opportunity to ask a question I\u2019d just like to ask let\u2019s keep it to one question with one follow on.","Operator","Your next question comes from James Schneider with Goldman Sachs.","James Schneider \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Congratulations on the strong results. I was wondering if you could quantify for us in the quarter in Q2 how much was the increase in desktop versus notebook in the quarter? And then do you expect desktop or notebook to be up more for Q3?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Desktop and notebook were both up strongly in Q2. And we expect both of them to yet again be up strongly in Q3. In the case of notebook GPUs, we\u2019re ramping \u2013 you probably know that Ivy Bridge ramp was delayed because the market was kind of soft.","And now, Ivy Bridge is ramping up strongly and our market share for Ivy Bridge is the best we\u2019ve ever had and the reason why it\u2019s the best we\u2019ve ever had is because the Kepler GPU is really the best GPU we\u2019ve ever created and its energy efficiency is just so fantastic that the market demand for it is really strong, so we expect to gain share and we expect to ramp up Ivy Bridge in Q3.","In the case of desktop, there are several factors working in our favor. One is the PC gaming marketplace is just really, really, really strong. PC gaming is a vibrant segment. All the game developers are talking about it. It\u2019s a platform where free to play has become very important and whether here in the United States or China or Europe, we\u2019re seeing strength in PC gaming. And we\u2019re about to introduce and we just started ramping into it, our Kepler GPU that is targeted squarely at the gamers. And the segment starts out at about $99.00 and goes all the way up to about $249.00.","And those segments, we haven\u2019t been able to address until now. And we\u2019ve not been able to address it because we just haven\u2019t had enough supply. And now that the supply is starting to catch up and gives us enough supply to launch into that segment and that segment is just dying for Kepler, and finally we\u2019re be able to bring Kepler to them.","And then lastly, Q2 was quite a shock in the system. We had \u2013 or Q1 was quite a shock in the system. We had the convergence of a couple of issues. One of them was the shortage of 28-nanometer supply. And that was very surprising to us and to a lot of people. And the second issue was the flood in Thailand that raised the cost of disk drives, which affects the desktop market, as you know. And both of those issues are working themselves out. And so we got a lot of positive momentum driving the desktop market. And the market is really, really strong. We\u2019re feeling a lot of positive momentum right now.","James Schneider \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Great. And then as a follow up, obviously the Tegra business very, very strong, as you mentioned. Could you maybe share with us any updated expectations in terms of Tegra revenue for the year? I think you previously guided to 540. Is it safe to say you\u2019ll exceed that this year?","Jen-Hsun Huang","We\u2019re comfortable with that this year.","James Schneider \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Great. Thanks very much.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yep. Thank you very much, Jim.","Operator","Your next question comes from Raj Seth with Cowen & Company.","Raj Seth \u2013 Cowen & Company","Hi. Thank you. Jen-Hsun, in the context of the prior question about modem integration, etcetera, downstream, wondering about your view on connectivity technologies, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, etcetera. How important do you think that is or not important for you over time to own those technologies? Thanks.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Integration is always a good thing. Integration\u2019s a good thing. If you look at connectivity a multi-function connectivity chip goes for something along the lines of about $3.00, $3.00 to $4.00, but an LTE modem is $20.00 to $25.00. And so the important thing is to focus on the important thing first and so we\u2019ve taken off a big bite and we\u2019re working on LTE integration and so I\u2019m quite excited about the integrated version.","There are very few companies in the world that have the ability to build an integrated platform based on a world-class application processor, a world-class software stack and a world-class modem and that\u2019s \u2013 they are three things that are very, very hard to do and I think we\u2019re one of those companies that can pull it together and when we get that done, we\u2019ll think about other things. But those are really by far way, way, way more important than everything else.","Raj Seth \u2013 Cowen & Company","Yeah, thanks. As a quick follow up could you comment on attach rates if you\u2019ve seen any material shift there, kind of what the trend line on attach rates is notwithstanding the share gains you\u2019re seeing on Sandy Bridge of course?","Jen-Hsun Huang","We see no change in attach rate.","Raj Seth \u2013 Cowen & Company","Great. Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yep. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Shawn Webster with Macquarie.","Shawn Webster \u2013 Macquarie","Great. Thanks. Good job all across-the-board there, guys.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Thank you.","Shawn Webster \u2013 Macquarie","On the graphics side you mentioned that you had a mix shift that helped you in the quarter relative to your 15% sequential increase in GPUs. I was wondering if you could add some color on what units did versus pricing sequentially.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Units were up, and pricing was probably up too. And the reason why we know that is because we experienced very strong growth in the enthusiast and the performance segment. Yet in the entry segment, the disk drive shortage and disk drive prices are, although it\u2019s getting better, the mainstream part of the marketplace is still slower than usual. That part of the marketplace is picking up, but in Q2 the strength was mostly in the performance and the enthusiast side. We just couldn\u2019t build enough.","Shawn Webster \u2013 Macquarie","So was the pricing up more than the units in Q2?","Jen-Hsun Huang","I think units and pricing were both up. But I would think that pricing is up more.","Shawn Webster \u2013 Macquarie","Okay. And then just as a quick follow up to some of the supply constraints on 28, do you have any view on when that\u2019s going to normalize in terms of getting the 28 back on track and being able to have normal lead times?","Jen-Hsun Huang","We\u2019re expecting to be supply constrained throughout this quarter. And then we\u2019ll report on that in Q4. But obviously it\u2019s a combination of allocation, yield and the market demand. And so those are a lot of variables. So far market demand seems very strong. And we\u2019re selling into a marketplace with quite a bit of pent-up demand for Kepler. Yields are improving.","And we\u2019d like them to improve even faster because when you improve yield faster with our wafer buy business model that we talked about some three quarters ago, your units grow and your margins grow. And so we really need TSMC and they\u2019re working really, really hard to improve yield because it\u2019s good for everybody and so we need them to really focus on that.","Shawn Webster \u2013 Macquarie","Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yep. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James.","Hans Mosesmann \u2013 Raymond James","Thanks. Congratulations, guys. Jen-Hsun, a question on Windows RT in terms of the ramp in the second half: can you give us a sense of the possible split between your Android-related platforms and RT for Tegra? Thanks.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, it\u2019s a little early for us to talk about Windows RT. I think all of the Windows RT questions really ought to be targeted at Microsoft right now because they haven\u2019t even really launched it. They\u2019d be more than delighted to answer that.","Hans Mosesmann \u2013 Raymond James","But the ramp is \u2013 how about this, the ramp that you\u2019re having I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re having some a ramp into those platforms as we speak. Is that as expected? Is it better than expected or any flavor there? That would be helpful. Thanks.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, what I can say about Surface RT is that we were all, including all of you, really blown away by the announcement of Surface RT. I think they\u2019ve done an amazing job and it\u2019s a really, really cool device. And so I can\u2019t say that I saw that coming. I was very positively surprised and I think so was everybody else.","Hans Mosesmann \u2013 Raymond James","Very well. Thanks.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yep. Thanks a lot, Hans.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kevin Cassidy was Stifel, Nicolaus.","Kevin Cassidy \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus","Thanks, and congratulations on the quarter.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Thank you.","Kevin Cassidy \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus","Can you give us an update on your virtualization efforts both the VGX and the GRID?","Jen-Hsun Huang","We are working very, very closely with our partners. The VGX is targeted at enterprise. Our partners there would include the virtualization companies, Citrix, VMware and Microsoft. The OEMs that we would be working with there are the best OEMs in the world the enterprise space. And we announced that Cisco would be working with us and so we\u2019re really excited about that work. And so all of us are working on integrating software, building servers, and introducing them to customers and so on.","On the GRID side, that\u2019s targeted at gamers and cloud gaming is really quite the buzz. One of our partners was bought by Sony recently. Gaikai has been a long-time partner of ours and a development partner on GRID and they were bought by Sony recently, so that\u2019s really exciting.","Now they have quite large financial backing and of course a rich library of content to bring to it. And so, we\u2019re working with the service providers on that side. We don\u2019t have any more to announce at that moment, but we\u2019re very busy working on it.","Kevin Cassidy \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus","Okay. And you\u2019d mentioned that you expected some growth in that product group in the next quarter. Is that part of it or is that just going to be the HPC segment, or will it be the virtualization segment also? Do you expect revenue that quickly?","Jen-Hsun Huang","I think that we will see some shipments this year but I would expect that most of these servers will go-to-market and ramp next year in Q1 of next year. We have plenty to ship this year and I\u2019ve got \u2013 I could use all the supplies for everything else and so we have plenty to do already.","Kevin Cassidy \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus","Okay, great. Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yep.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vijay Rakesh with Sterne, Agee.","Vijay Rakesh \u2013 Sterne, Agee","Yeah, hi, guys. Good quarter here. Just wondering on the Tegra 3, what\u2019s your split between tablets and handsets? And I think I might have missed this but did you guys say you\u2019re going to integrate baseband down the road here?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Thank you, Vijay. Our split on Tegra for tablets versus phones is more tablets than phones. And my sense is that it\u2019s going to stay that way. And the reason for that is because I really feel that the market has held nice positions for alternative tablets, nice positions with really great value proposition, a really good reason to buy it and really affordable and really exquisitely made. And so, I think we\u2019re finally seeing the convergence of all of these wonderful things in non-iPad tablets. And so, we\u2019re delighted by the early success and the demand out in the marketplace for the tablets that we\u2019re in.","I think tablets is likely to be a strong growth opportunity for us, as we had hoped and as we had worked on. A lot of people think that the tablet market in just a few more years will be as large as the entire PC mobile market and based on the information from people that use our tablet today, I really wouldn\u2019t be surprised by that. And so if we can protect and even grow from our current position of tablets, I think this is going to be a very, very large part of our overall business.","Vijay Rakesh \u2013 Sterne, Agee","Got it, great. Thanks.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yep. Thanks a lot, Vijay.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Caso with Susquehanna Financial.","Chris Caso \u2013 Susquehanna Financial","Thank you. So I wonder if you could talk a bit about seasonality for the January quarter and obviously you don\u2019t want to give guidance now, but given that there\u2019s a lot of sort of atypical things happening in the October quarter, you\u2019re still supply constrained, Windows 8 comes out at the end of the quarter, how should that affect what we\u2019d see as typically seasonal patterns into the January quarter?","Jen-Hsun Huang","You\u2019re absolutely right. It\u2019s too early to comment on January. We have so many new things to introduce. I think there is seasonality, there\u2019s market share, there\u2019s supply and there\u2019s new products and so that\u2019s enough variables, enough elements to consider for when we get there. But I\u2019m hoping that supply would be even more improved. I\u2019m hoping that yield would be much more improved. I\u2019m hoping that the market is reasonably robust. But mostly I\u2019m excited about the new products that we\u2019re going to ship.","Chris Caso \u2013 Susquehanna Financial","Okay, great. And as a follow up, given what you said about 28-nanometer supply improving further and the yields improving further, how should we think of that with respect to gross margins? Is there still some increase available on the gross margin line as a result of those elements?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yeah, back in the good old days, this is three quarters ago, when we started going into wafer buying, our margins are now very, very affected by improving yields. It is a very large lever and if there\u2019s anything that we can do to improve yields, it should be all hands on deck and there\u2019s just a lot more room to improve 28-nanometer yield to the 40-nanometer level.","And so what that says is that as we ramp further and further into 28-nanometer and as we improve yield, it should improve our margins. And the leverage, as you can tell, would be quite significant. And so we should be all hands on deck to improve yield. TSMC is already all hands on deck to improve yield. Nothing could be a greater lever for their ability to increase supply for all of their customers.","Chris Caso \u2013 Susquehanna Financial","Great. Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang","So everybody\u2019s interests are all perfectly aligned.","Operator","Your next question comes from JoAnne Feeney with Longbow Research.","JoAnne Feeney \u2013 Longbow Research","Thanks, and congrats on a real nice quarter, guys.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Thank you, JoAnne.","JoAnne Feeney \u2013 Longbow Research","Yeah, a question for you really, Jen-Hsun, just about your vision of these Android tablets. I understand the easing of barriers to adoption with the similarity of phones, but one thing we\u2019re seeing with iPads is a lot of adoption in businesses, particularly services businesses. So perhaps you could give us a sense of whether you think these Android tablets are likely to remain consumer devices? And what proportion you guys are modeling at least for the maybe percentage of users that might want to add a tablet in addition to their Android phone? So what are you thinking about in terms of your market opportunity?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, I think it\u2019s taken us a year-and-a-half to really even build something that appears that the market really loves. And we\u2019ve taken \u2013 during this year-and-a-half we\u2019ve worked on some \u2013 gosh, 60 tablets, maybe more. And we didn\u2019t give up on it because we believed in the future of it. And I think that people recognize now that we have a lot of expertise in building these and the tablets that we\u2019ve built are really, really delightful. And so I\u2019m really excited about the fact that the positioning of Android tablets is now finally resonating with the marketplace. If you have an Android phone, you ought to go get yourself an Android tablet because all of your content just shows up.","And I think if we could \u2013 if we use that \u2013 if we extrapolate it from that, surely it\u2019s going to be a very large market. But we\u2019re just going to have to wait and see how it develops. But I\u2019ve got a lot of confidence in the ecosystem and our sales ability to build even greater tablets based around Android. And you can just imagine all the things that people are now doing as they hit this tablet. It\u2019s just going to be really wonderful. So I think the positioning of Android tablets is spot on.","Now in terms of enterprise, there\u2019s a couple of ways to make tablets much more delightful for enterprise users. I don\u2019t use my tablet at the office because there\u2019s just too many incompatibilities. And for me it\u2019s important for me to be able to see every number on the spreadsheet; just several of the numbers on the spreadsheet is not enough for me. And so I need to see all the numbers. And I need to see all the graphs. I need to see all the charts. It\u2019s too important to me. And there\u2019s just no reason for me to make that compromise. And there\u2019s a couple of ways to provide that.","One is obviously Office and then the other is to virtualize it, which is the way Citrix does it. And Citrix and VMware and RemoteFX makes it possible for us to remote the entire PC experience to any device. And that\u2019s the reason why we created VGX and I\u2019m very excited about the work that we\u2019re doing there. It has a real potential of freeing up all of our employees so that they can use whatever device they like and still be able to get 100% compatibility. So there\u2019s a couple of ways to do that, putting Office on a tablet, the pure Office version, and then putting the PC in the server and remote and virtualizing.","JoAnne Feeney \u2013 Longbow Research","Okay. Thanks for that. And then could you perhaps give us some thoughts about your operating expenses? They\u2019ve remained rather elevated. This is an investment stage in the new business, so that\u2019s understandable. But is this something where you feel like you need to hang on to this level of cost and you just hope to grow into these operating expenses or do you envision maybe coming to a point where you\u2019ve made the investments so R&D expenses will eventually fall?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Nothing would give me more joy than for us to be able to invest even more. We have more ideas than we can invest in right now and we\u2019re trying to invest as thoughtfully and in a measured way. But as you mention, we\u2019re in the process of reinventing our company. We\u2019re the only computer technology company that has made its way from the PC industry to the mobile industry. And now we have a real position in the mobile space, whereas there were \u2013 just one year ago, I think there was an analyst report that showed some 48 application processor companies in the world and we weren\u2019t even on it. And now, we\u2019re probably number two.","And so I think we\u2019re making really good progress in making our way into the fastest-growing segment of the computer industry. And I think as a computer technology company I can\u2019t imagine why, I can\u2019t imagine how long-term you could have a sustainable advantage if you\u2019re not one foot in the computer industry and one foot in the mobile computer industry. It\u2019s just too important not to be in these two segments. And so we made some investments. We\u2019re making investments to reinvent ourselves and I think that reinvention is really, really paying off.","JoAnne Feeney \u2013 Longbow Research","So it sounds like we should expect you to grow into those operating expenses over some time?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yeah, we hope to grow our top line. I think Q2 was a good start. Q3, we\u2019ve guided to another quarter of growth and we\u2019ll take it from there.","JoAnne Feeney \u2013 Longbow Research","Any hint you\u2019d like to give us on where you might find your OpEx percentage, say, four or six quarters from now?","Jen-Hsun Huang","I have no idea.","JoAnne Feeney \u2013 Longbow Research","Okay. Thanks.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Arnab Chanda with Avian.","Arnab Chanda \u2013 Avian","Thanks. Jen-Hsun, just a couple of quick questions. First, historically I think, I remember your works Professional business actually had significantly higher margin than your other two businesses. Now you\u2019re getting mix moving towards your GPUs and you\u2019re still actually improving gross margins. Could you talk about that? Is that because of the new business model with TSMC? Is that because your cost structure is much better? If you could talk a little bit about that? Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Well, Kepler is a real margin driver and so when we ship enthusiasts, when we ship performance, those are all margin drivers. But you\u2019re right that Quadro and Tesla were both down and they both have the highest margins and also because they\u2019re the highest value and the most software-intensive parts of our business. They have much higher margins and they were both down. And so the other businesses made up for their margins and more. But it\u2019s the current business model and I prefer a die buy, to tell you the truth, and it\u2019s just because it\u2019s simpler for us and it\u2019s more predictable for us.","But now that we\u2019re in the wafer buy model we just have to put a lot more intensity into yield improvement. And yield was better in Q2 than it was in Q1. We\u2019re expecting it to be better in Q3. And so we just we really have to drive the living tar out of it and be all hands on deck. It is a very, very important earnings driver for us. And we\u2019re still far away from where we need to be. And where we were before was higher than this and so 28-nanometer overall is still dragging our gross margins as a company. But we need to \u2013 we have our sights on much higher margins than this.","Arnab Chanda \u2013 Avian","Great. And then I guess for the Tegra business, obviously one year has made a huge difference. Clearly it seems like nowadays people will agree there is a market for Android tablets. Could you talk about \u2013 you said phone versus tablet you\u2019re focusing more on tablets, or you think that\u2019s where the growth comes from. To the extent you can give us some qualitative idea on Windows 8 or Windows RT I guess I should say; are you talking about multiple design wins? Is it a significant contributor for Q3? And how do you see that progressing? I would really appreciate that. Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang","We have 3 design wins on Windows RT. And I think Microsoft announced \u2013 well Microsoft announced theirs. ASUS announced theirs. And I don\u2019t think the third has been announced yet. So I won\u2019t announce it for them.","In the near term, tablets will be an important driver for us and the reason for that is because our segment of the phone marketplace is mostly focused on superphones and the performance phones. In order for us to grow much, much more, we have to integrate a very important piece called the LTE modem and so we have to integrate that and that\u2019s the reason why we bought Icera and when we do that, when we achieve that, our market opportunity grows substantially. It\u2019s many times larger than the current phone segments that we target. And so I think that in the next several quarters our primary focus is going to be continued smartphones or superphones and premium phones, and then of course ramping all of these tablets that we\u2019ve been designed into.","Arnab Chanda \u2013 Avian","Thanks, Jen-Hsun. It seems like your years of investment are finally paying off.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Thank you very much, Arnab.","Operator","Your next question comes from Craig Berger with FBR Capital Markets.","Craig Berger \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Nice job on the quarter. I know you guys earlier in the year talked about 30 handsets on Tegra. Do you have any update for us there? How many of those handsets are now out on the market? How many might still be coming in the second half?","Jen-Hsun Huang","There are many that have already come out from HTC; The European models, the Chinese models, the Asian models, the U.S. model is coming out soon, I think. There\u2019s the LG phones, the Fujitsu phones and now we\u2019re in the process of ramping the phones that are indigenous to the Chinese market. We\u2019ve ramped the ZTE phone.","That\u2019s also a global phone and we\u2019re in the process of now ramping the superphones in the Chinese market. And so \u2013 but as you know, the real focus is to make sure that we build these phones as wonderfully as we can. I\u2019m just incredibly proud of the work that we did with HTC on the One X. It\u2019s just an exquisite phone. And so we just made \u2013 if we made a whole bunch more like that I think we\u2019re going to be in good shape.","Craig Berger \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","Great. And the follow-up question is on the professional side of the business. How do we think about Quadro going forward? And can you also give us any update on your enterprise Tesla operations? Thanks.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Quadro\u2019s position is better than ever. Our market share and our market position is the highest it\u2019s ever been. The technologies and the capabilities we\u2019re bringing to that marketplace we were just at SIGGRAPH this week and you might\u2019ve seen some of the announcements. The work that we\u2019re doing around Quadro plus Tesla to accelerate the design workflow is really revolutionary and people are just so excited about it because I was just reading a report today about one particular company that took a month-and-a-half to create a particular shot and is now able to do it literally in two days.","So whether it\u2019s rendering or video compositing or simulation in creating those shots and most shots today have so much computer graphics in it and advertising and HD advertising is a very big part of the work that we do with Quadro. It\u2019s really revolutionized how people produce videos. And so the work that we\u2019re doing there is better than ever. And I have every confidence that as soon as the economy gets better or even if it doesn\u2019t get better, eventually people will have to upgrade their workstations because it\u2019s at the core of the work that they do. It\u2019s the creative part of their company.","And so irrespective of the economy at some point that people will have to come back and buy new workstations. I think part of it is people waiting for Romley to launch. They\u2019re ramping up into the workstation space and I think that the ramp is just now ramping up. So I have every confidence that once those things get settled down that the enterprise customers will come back and buy again.","Craig Berger \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","And, Jen-Hsun, one more. You guys have a lot of cash. Got any plans for that cash?","Jen-Hsun Huang","The only plans that we have ready to announce right now is to make a lot more cash.","Craig Berger \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","Very nice. Thank you.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Thanks, Craig.","Operator","Your next question comes from Raji Gill with Needham & Co.","Raji Gill \u2013 Needham & Co","Yeah, thanks. And congrats as well. On the Tegra business it seems that most of the growth that occurred in the second quarter was coming from the tablet builds and it appears that, that\u2019s going to continue into the third quarter as well. I was wondering if you can give me any insight in terms of sell-in versus sell through. Any sell through rates you can talk about?","Jen-Hsun Huang","Let\u2019s see. The first observation that you need is that most of the growth came from the tablet segment and in Q3 we expect to have even more tablets for the production. And so I don\u2019t know that I have much more insight than that. And we\u2019ll come back and report it as soon as we can. I think the highlight is just the market reception of these tablets have been better than any tablet that we\u2019ve ever (inaudible).","Raji Gill \u2013 Needham & Co","And just last question on the graphic card side that business is growing well in light of a very tough PC environment and you expect that to grow in the third quarter. So are you seeing kind of a resurgence in PC demand given the Ivy Bridge ramp corresponding with the Ultrabook Windows 8 or is it primarily market share gains, new product, customers? Can you elaborate a little bit further on that?","Rob Csongor","Hey, Raji, could you please mute your phone? We\u2019re getting a lot of noise on it. Thanks.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Thank you, Raji. A couple of growth drivers for us in GPUs. One of them of course is the notebook design wins on Ivy Bridge and Ivy Bridge was going to ramp in Q2 and it ended up ramping in Q3. And so that\u2019s one growth driver. Our market share is going to be higher, the attach rate is stable, and Kepler is just a really wonderful GPU for notebooks because it\u2019s so energy efficient. The other growth driver is desktop. We\u2019re not seeing anything different than other people from a demand perspective, but it\u2019s important to realize that desktop for us is not the same as OEM desktop.","The vast majority of our GPU for desktops are sold to gamers. There are, hard to say exactly how many hard-core gamers around the world but it\u2019s many, many tens of millions.","And people estimate it somewhere around 50 million to 100 million core gamers around the world. And they upgrade their GPUs every couple years. And I think that Kepler is the best GPU we\u2019ve ever built. It\u2019s the best GPU the industry has ever built and it\u2019s the best GPU in the industry today and so everybody has been anticipating the Kepler GPU for the gamer segment and we haven\u2019t been able to ramp into it because the demand or because the supply just didn\u2019t allow us to do it until now and so we\u2019re going to be quite enthusiastic ramping Kepler into the gamer market and the reception has just been fantastic.","Rob Csongor","Operator, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Yes, sir. Your final question is going to come from Suji De Silva with ThinkEquity.","Suji De Silva \u2013 ThinkEquity","Hi, guys. Nice job on the quarter and the guidance. Just to follow-up on that last question, with the constraints on 28-nanometer is that impacting more the OEMs or the channel you just talked about Jen-Hsun? If it is the channel, is there the potential there\u2019s pent-up demand as that becomes available?","Jen-Hsun Huang","For desktop GPUs our desktop market, the OEM market is actually very small and it\u2019s consistent with anybody\u2019s observations. I mean we don\u2019t buy desktop PCs very much from Tier 1 OEMs anymore. It\u2019s mostly and yet the desktop PC market is really quite vibrant and the reason for that is because gamers build their own PCs and there are tens of millions of gamers all over the world.","And so I think, one, that the market is very different than people expect. Two, what drives the gamers are two things. One, great games and there are just some wonderful games coming out now and PC gaming is really surging. From a technological perspective, from a game play and interest perspective, it\u2019s surging past game consoles.","And then secondarily, the Kepler GPU is just so fantastic. It\u2019s the best GPU we\u2019ve ever built. And compared to what the current installed base is, it is so far superior that I think gamers have been clamoring for it. And yet, until now, the most affordable Kepler is about $400. It\u2019s only been available for enthusiasts \u2013 enthusiasts and scientists. And finally we\u2019ve been able to bring that, bring the price down to the level of a gamer \u2013 PC gamer and a volume that allows us to support the ramp.","Suji De Silva \u2013 ThinkEquity","Okay and then on share on the notebooks and Ivy Bridge, in the past you\u2019ve peaked around 65%, 70%. Do you think you can go above that with the Kepler product given the competitive landscape at this point?","Jen-Hsun Huang","I\u2019m not really sure. Give me a chance to see how it turns out and then we\u2019ll come back and report it.","Suji De Silva \u2013 ThinkEquity","Okay, great. Thanks, guys.","Jen-Hsun Huang","Yep. Thank you very much.","Rob Csongor","Okay, thank you, everyone. That\u2019ll do it for today. We look forward to talking to you about our Q3 results. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect."]}}
