Welcome to the Ralph Lauren First Quarter Fiscal 2019 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions on how to ask a question will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mrs. Evren Kopelman. Please go ahead.","Evren Kopelman","Good morning and thank you for joining Ralph Lauren first quarter fiscal 2019 conference call. With me today are Patrice Louvet, the company's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jane Nielsen, Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions, which we ask that you limit to one per caller.","During today's call, we will be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws, including our financial outlook. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees, and our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.","Our expectations contain many risks and uncertainties. Principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from our current expectations are detailed in our SEC filings. To find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our financial results, you should refer to this morning's earnings release and to our SEC filings that can be found on our Investor Relations Web site.","And now I will turn the call over to Patrice.","Patrice Louvet","Thank you, Evren. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. We're pleased to report first quarter fiscal 2019 results that reflect progress on our next great chapter's strategic growth plan that we shared with you at our investor day, in June.","We're encouraged by this start to the new fiscal year, as first quarter results showed improvement in both the top and bottom line. A few of our team's key achievements this quarter included high single-digit growth in our average unit retail globally, double-digit growth in Asia, our key growth region, and digital commerce up high single digits. This solid start enables us to modestly improve our outlook for the year. Our long-term plan is based on our three guiding principles, first to put the consumer at the center of everything we do. Second, to elevate and energize our brands, and third, to balance growth and productivity. With these principles in mind we are focused on executing our five key strategies.","First, win over a new generation of consumers. Second, energize core products and accelerate high-value underdeveloped categories. Third, drive targeted expansion in all regions and channels. Fourth, lead with digital across all activities. And fifth, operate with discipline to fuel growth. Let me take you through the progress we've made in the first quarter across these initiatives, starting with the first one, win over a new generation of consumers. Our goal is to recruit millions of new consumers into our brand each year. To achieve that we're continuing to increase our marketing investment and shift our spend to digital channels that matter most to consumers today.","In the first quarter, we increased our marketing spend by about 20% to last year. Our primary communication was our Spring Polo campaign featuring our iconic white Polo shirt. We told our brand's story in a fresh way that drove results. Sales of our Polo shirts in the first quarter outpaced our overall revenue trend, and were up double digits in men's. We also continue to drive interest and excitement among our target consumers through limited additional launches. In the first quarter, we continue to leverage our iconic heritage and deep archives to launch CP93. This collection originally launched in 1993 and celebrated the America's Cup sailing race.","Marketing communication utilized both archival assets and a newly shot campaign to celebrate the heritage, while generating new excitement for the updated capsule collection. The collection performed well with many styles selling out within days. We also continue to leverage the power of cultural events and influencers. This came to life recently at Wimbledon at the end of the first quarter. As the official outfitter of the event, we amplified our sponsorship and increased our reach on digital and social media through celebrity dressing and events with influencers. For example, British actress, Poppy Delevingne, took over Polo's Instagram stories and shared her stylish take on Wimbledon.","Other celebrities including Emma Watson, Gemma Chan, Luke Evans, Eddie Redmayne, Eason Chan, F4, and Coco Lee, all wore Polo to the event. We generated over six billion total impressions globally from extensive social media presence. As we said at our investor day, our influencer and celebrity strategy spans various parts of culture, from artists, to movie starts, to athletes. This diverse group of influencers represents different aspects of our brand and engages different consumer segments. In the world of sports, we renewed our sponsorship agreement with top professional golfer, Justin Thomas, who will continue to serve as brand ambassador or Polo Golf. And we also launched a new RLX collaboration with Billy Horschel.","In the entertainment world, at the Met Gala, in May, in New York several celebrities were dressed in our brand, including Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Lily Aldridge, Priyanka Chopra, Kerry Washington, Shailene Woodley, Ansel Elgort, Jimmy Fallon. Our spring '18 Purple Label campaign featured Japanese actor and pop star Akira across a combination of digital, print, and outdoor media.","Now, moving on to our second key initiative, energize core products and accelerate high-value underdeveloped categories. In our five-year plan, we expect half of our growth will come from core product categories, with the other half driven by high-value underpenetrated categories. We believe the key to energizing the core and driving a differentiated point of view in the marketplace is to combine Ralph and our creative team's iconic brand vision with deep insight and understanding of consumers around the world. This approach is gaining traction as our renewed core styles and icons drove a sequential improvement in our sellout trend in key categories for the spring-summer season.","Performance was led by our Polo brand in both men and women's. We saw product successes in our core items where we brought newness and interest through the addition of novelty like embroidery, print, and color blocking as well as refreshed fabrics and increased functionality. Within our core, strong categories in men's included Polo shirts, woven shirts in both our oxford fabric and the newly-introduced natural stretch poplin, and our new chino pants with stretch fabrications. In women's Polo, dresses are trending well with consumers responding to our long shirt dresses in a number of different styles. Customization also continued to help energize our core product offerings.","We had a popup custom shop at Wimbledon that offered exclusive prints as part of our Wimbledon capsule collection which sold through very well. In addition, our new small format store in Beverly Center in the Los Angeles market has a successful create-your-own shop that already represents approximately 10% of the store's sales. We also made progress on building out underdeveloped categories that has significant growth potential across all brands. These include denim, wear to work, auto wear, footwear, and accessories. Starting with denim, a fabrication that is core to our brand and where consumers have told us they expect us to play.","Building off of the strong momentum of fiscal year '18, our sales in denim were up mid single digits in the first quarter, outpacing total company revenue growth. We saw traction in all channels of distribution with updated fits, washes, and lighter weight fabrications in both men's and women's. Auto wear was another strong category where lighter weight and functional fabrics in both casual weekend and wear-to-work styles for spring-summer drove growth. First quarter auto wear sales were up high single digits year-over-year across our brands. Our improved merchandizing is driving full-price sell-through and lower discounts. In the first quarter average unit retail was up 8% across our direct-to-consumer network. We're making encouraging progress across multiple fronts on product. And we are pleased with the improving consumer response that we're seeing.","Moving on to our third key initiative, drive targeted expansion in all regions and channels. We're focused on building a compelling and competitive ecosystem that includes digital distribution, new small format stores, and renovated stores and shops to drive comp growth. As we discussed at investor day, international is a key growth opportunity for the company as we are underdeveloped in markets like China and select European countries. Mainland China is our largest near-term opportunity, and our momentum in this region continued in the first quarter. Revenue in China was up over 25% in constant currency in the quarter, including over 40% growth in Mainland China.","Our digital business in China continued to grow rapidly through Tmall, JD.com and WeChat. This growth was supported by targeted marketing through social media and influencer engagements. On the store front, we opened seven new points of distribution in China in the first quarter, and we're on track to open more than 50 stores for fiscal 2019. Our new small store formats are performing well. As we continue to expand and raise our brand awareness, we are on track to achieve our long-term goals of reaching $500 million of revenue in five years in China.","Another key element of our distribution strategy is provide a consistent, elevated experience across all channels. To achieve this we continue to improve the quality of our distribution through our store and shop refresh programs globally. We are elevating our distribution and our brands through improvements in fixturing, lighting, layout, and visual merchandising. We continue to see a good return on our investments with these projects.","Moving on to our fourth key initiatives, lead with digital. Our overall digital business including our directly operated sites, department store.com, pure players and social commerce was up 7% globally in the first quarter. This was driven by 24% growth in international with North America up slightly. We expect to drive an acceleration of our overall digital growth as our directly operated North American digital flagship returns to growth.","In the first quarter, this business showed a significant sequential improvement with a 2% decline versus the high teen declines we reported last year. We expect our site to return to growth in the second quarter as we reposition it as our most important flagship door and continue to improve the consumer experience.","In the first quarter, we added improved product detail pages, 360 degree product videos, delivery date estimate and automated product recommendations among other enhancements. In Europe, we also continue to elevate and improve our digital presence. In the first quarter we upgraded the technology platform are directly operated digital flagship, similar to what we implemented in North America last fall. The new site offers a significantly improved consumer experience, including enhanced search tool and filters more engaging in easier to shop product pages, more personalized predictive recommendations and a streamlined checkout.","We also continue to drive market share gains within digital at our key retail partners and in our core categories globally. For example in Europe, we ran high impact campaigns with 21 partners across the region. This included the department store websites and key online pure play customers like Asauce, Zalando, Yuk's, Mr. Porter, and Boost. The digital campaigns showcase the versatility of our polisher and how to style it.","This significantly increased our brand visibility and drove sales growth. In Asia, we launched Polo on T-mobiles luxury pavilion during the quarter. We also launched a mini program on WeChat which is a digital popup shot featuring the CP93 collection. In addition we executed a successful Polo branded sticker campaign on Japan's main social messaging app, line which more than tripled our followers.","Finally, let me touch on our fifth key initiative operate with discipline to show growth. In the first quarter, we continued to challenge every cost and improve our efficiencies. This enabled us to fund the significant increase in our marketing investment while expanding operating margin and increasing operating profit. Adjusted operating expenses, excluding marketing and the impact of foreign currency were up less than 1% in the first quarter.","We also continue to make progress, implementing a more efficient, streamlined end-to-end process. Discipline in our product assortments and inventory drove improved SKU productivity and full price selling. This resulted in higher AURs in gross margin. We increase that flexibility and efficiency of our global supply chain which is critical in today's rapidly-changing environment. While the terrace announced so far has a minimal impact on our business. We are keeping a close eye on developments.","We believe our strong global supply network should help mitigate the long-term impact of potential scenarios. In closing as we execute our next great chapter plan and we are encouraged by our early progress and the continued improvement in the underlying trends in our business. Our teams around the world are embracing our new strategic framework and are focused on executing with excellence. Ralph and I continue to be inspired by their passion and commitment every day.","With that, I'll turn it over to Jane and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions.","Jane Nielsen","Thank you, Patrice, and good morning everyone. Our first quarter results were strong and showed continued progress on strengthening the brand and driving execution. Our key initiatives are delivering strong AUR growth, lower discount, higher gross margin, and operating profit growth. First quarter revenue increased 3% on a reported basis and 1% in constant currency. This was above our guidance driven by strong performance in Asia and the benefit of wholesale shipment timing in both Europe and North America.","Asia revenue grew 16% in constant currency in the quarter. Our initiatives across product, marketing and shopping experience are resonating strongly in this region. And give us increased confidence in our strategy for Asia and our other region.","In the quarter, we saw higher sale through on spring summer product lead by mid single-digit growth in the Polo brand. Adjusted Gross margin expanded a 120 basis points in the first quarter and a 110 basis points in constant currency benefiting from reduced discount rate and favorable product mix.","Adjusted operating margin in the first quarter was 11.1% up 90 basis points to last year on a reported basis and 70 basis points in constant currency. In the first quarter, we stepped up our marketing significantly off to a low base last year. Planned investment in marketing was up over 20%.","For the full-year, we are planning marketing to grow high single to low double-digit with incremental growth in the second quarter to support the global amplification of our 50 anniversary fashion show. We are progressively increasing marketing investment towards our long-term goal of approximately 5% of sale. We plan to fund the majority of the increase to productivity to achieve our operating margin expansion goals.","Moving on to our segment performance, starting with North America, revenue was down 2% in the first quarter and comps were 3% in constant currency. Adjusted operating margin was 22.9% representing a 150 basis points increase to last year. Importantly, and similar to last quarter all channels contributed to gross margin improvements in the first quarter.","Let me review the North America results across channels, first, our directly operated e-commerce business, second our stores; and third, our wholesale business. Digital commerce comp in a directly operated site in North America declined 2% in the first quarter. As expected, this presented a significant sequential improvement in our trend.","As Patrice mentioned, we are repositioning RalphLauren.com as the most important flagship door. As part of our strategy execution, we are continuing quality of sales initiatives on our e-commerce site at a more moderate pace. Full price sales on the site were up about 5% in the quarter. AUR was up 9% and discount rate was down 300 basis points till last year. As we continue to reduce the penetration as deep markdowns in the business.","Moving on to our stores, brick-and-mortar comps in North America were down 3% in the first quarter. The timing of Easter pressured comp growth by approximately three points in North America this quarter. Therefore, the underlying comp was about flat excluding that impact.","As we mentioned last quarter, Easter compressed total company comp by approximately one point in Q1. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter of 2019 Easter will negatively impact North America comp by about three points and total company by about one point.","At a more macro level foreign tourist sales were flat till last year in the first quarter, less robust than the 7% growth in the fourth quarter reflecting currencies fluctuations.","Moving on to North America wholesale, the first quarter revenue decline of 1% reflects a significant sequential improvement. This is partially driven by an intentional shift in timing of some of price shipments, the benefited Q1, but negatively impacted Q4. As we mentioned last quarter, our department store spring, summer 2018 season-to-date sellout improved sequentially and we expect continued improvement in the fall season as we benefit from shop renovations and evolved product and marketing.","Importantly, in the wholesale channel, our digital wholesale business continues to grow with share gains in men's and kids. As a reminder, our revenue trend in North America wholesale will look more challenging in the second-half of the year. This is due to the timing of off-price shipments with significant declines planned in the second-half and the ongoing impact of Bon-Ton. Our focus remains on building high quality growth with our partners in the North America wholesale channel.","Moving on to Europe, revenue increased 8% on a reported basis and 2% in constant currency in the first quarter. Adjusted operating margins were flat, but were down 10 basis points in constant currency driven by challenges at our factory stores. In the retail channel, European comps were down 8% in constant currency with growth in digital commerce more than offset by declines in our stores.","We upgraded our European digital commerce platform for our directly operated business at the end of the first quarter. We leveraged learning from the North America conversion last fall to manage the business successfully ahead of the transition resulting in strong sales in Q1.","However, as anticipated, we did see some disruption from our transition, which impacted the start of the second quarter. Bricks-and-mortar comps specifically in our outlet stores continue to be pressured by inventory, traffic and product assortment challenges. We continue to work to elevate our brand and distribution and saw progress in our AURs in Europe retail, with AUR growth of 9% in the first quarter.","We are implementing a number of changes in our product assortments and promotion structures to improve the traffic and conversion trends in these outlet stores. We expect these initiatives will start impacting the business in the second-half of fiscal '19.","Wholesale revenue in Europe increased 13% in constant currency in the first quarter partially benefiting from a shift in shipment timing. This will negatively impact second quarter revenue. We believe our underlying trend in the channels is low to mid single-digit growth, which we expect to return to this level in the second-half of the year. We continue to see momentum in our wholesale digital business growing double-digits in the first quarter and expanding market share.","Turning to Asia, revenue was up 19% on a reported basis and 16% in constant currency in the first quarter. We saw a strong performance across every market in Asia including 10% growth in Japan, over 40% growth in mainland China and over 20% growth in greater China, all in constant currency.","Our product and marketing initiatives are resonating well in this region. And we continue to increase our digital efforts in engagement with local influencers and celebrities. For example, our Polo shirt campaign generated over a billion impressions as we continued to build key celebrity partnerships. Comps in Asia increased 6% in constant currency in the first quarter continuing the positive trend from fiscal '18.","We drove strong double-digit comp growth across our digital business. We expect further comp growth in Asia as we continue to upgrade our distribution network and increase our marketing initiative to amplify and elevate the brand. We also continued to drive quality of sales in Asia. In the first quarter, average unit retails were up 10% and discount rates were down.","Adjusted operating margin was up 280 basis points to last year in the first quarter in Asia and at 290 basis points in constant currency. We will continue with prudent quality of sales actions in Asia. We are encouraged by our top line growth and our ability to leverage our investments to drive steady operating margin expansion.","Turning to our store suite, we continue to improve our retail network through the closure of underperforming locations and opening new stores with improved adjacencies and productivity. During the first quarter, we opened 14 standalone stores and 12 concessions. We closed two standalone stores and 11 concessions ending the quarter with 484 standalone stores and 633 concessions on a global basis.","Moving on to the balance sheet, in this quarter and throughout this year, we continue to strengthen our balance sheet and return capital to shareholders, reflecting the operational progress we are making. We ended the quarter with $2.1 billion in cash and investments up from $1.7 billion at the end of last year's first quarter. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $587 million compared to $590 million last year.","Inventory increased 3% on a constant currency basis at the end of the first quarter reflecting investments to support our European factory initiatives and direct-to-consumer expansion. We expect inventory growth by yearend to be slightly ahead of our sales. This will support our DTC expansion and adjustment efforts to restore inventories in select channels following significant pullback. Consistent with our commitment to return cash to shareholders, this quarter we raised our dividend by 25% and repurchased $100 million of our shares.","Now I'd like to turn to guidance for the full-year in the second quarter of fiscal '19. As a reminder, this guidance excludes restructuring and related charges. For the full fiscal year '19 while it is still early in the year we now expect revenues to be down slightly in constant currency. This is based primarily on our Q1 results. We continue to expect the decline in North America and growth in our international business.","Foreign currency is expected to have a minimal impact on our revenue growth for fiscal '19. We expect our revenue trend will be more challenging in the second-half of the year versus the first-half. This is due to heavier planned reductions in off-price shipments in Q3 and Q4; timing of wholesale shipments that benefited Q1 and the lack of an Easter holiday in Q4. Excluding these factors, we expect to see continued improvement in our trend. We now expect operating margin for fiscal '19 to be up 40 to 60 basis points in constant currency. This will be driven by about 75 basis points of growth margin expansion.","Foreign currency is expected to have minimal impact on operating margin for fiscal '19. This guidance reflects our solid performance in the first quarter and our view of the underlying trends as we execute the next great chapter plan.","In addition, this year we will see the one-time benefit of our repatriation activity in our interest income of $35 million to $40 million and interest expense of approximately $25 million to $30 million in fiscal 2019. For the second quarter of fiscal '19, we expect revenues to be flat to down slightly. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by approximately 30 to 50 basis points in the quarter.","Operating margin for the second quarter of fiscal '19 is expected to be up about 30 basis points to last year in constant currency. Foreign currency is estimated to be a slight benefit to operating margin in the quarter. We continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $275 million in fiscal '19 focused on consumer-facing initiatives that have demonstrated a proof of concept and healthy rates of return including stores, digital and marketing. We now expect our effective tax rate for fiscal '19 to be approximately 21%. The second quarter of fiscal 2019 tax rate is estimated at approximately 22%.","In closing, as I said at investor day, in June, we are building the right foundation. We are focused on executing our next great chapter plan, and we are beginning to see progress across our growth initiatives. Inspired by Ralph's creative vision, our teams around the world are delivering. And this quarter demonstrates that we are on the right path toward long-term sustainable growth and value creation.","With that, let's open up the call to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Laurent Vasilescu with Macquarie Capital. You may ask your question.","Laurent Vasilescu","Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Your digital commerce results showed improvement in Q1. Can you talk about the drivers and what you expect for growth in FY '19? And separately, Jane, another gross margin beat. Can you parse out the gross margin drivers for the quarter, and how should we think about the gross margin cadence for the next few quarters?","Jane Nielsen","Sure.","Patrice Louvet","Hey, good morning, Laurent. Well, first of all, I appreciate the fact that the first question is on digital, and it's one of our core strategy is to lead with digital. And so a couple of things, one is we did make good progress this quarter on digital commerce with sales up 7% versus last year. Particularly strong growth in international, right, we were up 24% in international. And we had slight growth in North America. As we talked at the investor day, the way we look at digital commerce is really through kind of four lenses. First one is our own sites or ralphlauren.com, the second one is departmentstore.com, which is a significant channel, third are pure players, and then fourth is social commerce.","So let me just give you a quick perspective on each one. So starting with our own site and think of this -- this is roughly half of our digital commerce business. Our own site, around the world, the growth was up slightly in Q1. And what we're particularly proud of is the acceleration in the North American site. Last year we reported significant declines throughout the entire year. We're still down Q1, but only down 2%. And we look forward to next quarter when we'll be able to, I think, to report actually growth on this site, which I think we've all been really hard for to achieve, so good progress there. We improved functionality and brand presentation on our U.S. site, and we will continue to drive that.","As far as U.S. is concerned, I think you've heard in our prepared remarks, we upgraded our platform, basically replicating what we did in the U.S. a few months ago. And we're also quite hopeful that we'll see much stronger consumer engagement moving forward in Europe. So that's our own site.","And as far as departmentstore.com is concerned and pure players, let me lump them together just to simplicity purposes. We actually grew double digits in Q1 across that channel. And obviously market share growth is very important for us, and we gained market share in our key categories across the key players. So that business is probably another -- the balance of the 50% that I talked about for our own site. And then finally we are ramping up on social commerce. It's still a negligible part of our business, but as we talked during investor day we believe this will become a significant part of digital commerce moving forward.","We had our first real activity in China actually through the mini program we did on WeChat, which we focused specifically on our CP93 limited edition. So think of that as -- it's basically a digital popup store, and we saw very good consumer response there. So you're going to see us ramp up our activities on the social comments front as well. So that's kind of the perspective across the four channels. As we look out to the balance of the fiscal year we actually expect to accelerate our pace of growth in digital commerce and deliver high single-digit growth across the full-year with double-digit growth internationally.","And then Jane, I guess on gross margin.","Jane Nielsen","Yes. Good morning, Laurent. On gross margin, Q1 was strong. It was ahead of our expectations. We went into this quarter, June is a highly promotional quarter. And we were able to pull back on our promotion levels and discounts. That was the number one driver of our 120 basis point growth margin expansion. The other driver was some favorable product mix that we saw across the business. And so those were very encouraging. I think you saw it in our AUR increase of 8%, that it really was a strong quarter in terms of being driven by promotional pullback and quality of sales initiative.","As I look forward to FY'19, we are expecting to be in about the 75 basis points of gross margin expansion. That will be driven -- continue to be driven by the pullback in promotions and discount levels. But there are two factors that we expect to become increasing pressures. One is increasing product costs. We expect that to become a headwind of about 30 basis points as we move through the quarter, it was about a 20 basis point benefit in Q1. And we continue to expect that FX switches from a tailwind to a headwind in the back half. FX was about 10 points of benefit in Q1, but should be a headwind by the time we get to Q4.","So as I think about the cadence of gross margin as we move through the year I think it'll remain -- we were slightly out ahead in Q1. It should be about consistent in two and three with our guidance range. And then the most challenging quarter in terms of gross margin is Q4 when we face FX headwinds and some increased product cost pressure.","Next question, please.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question.","Michael Binetti","Hey guys. Good morning, and congrats on a nice quarter. Let me just ask you about AUR for a second. That continues to be up pretty nicely, you've mentioned it a few times. And that's even though you had some pretty meaningful off-price shipments added in the North America side, I guess, or at least a shifting of some of those shipments.","Jane Nielsen","Yes.","Michael Binetti","I know you mentioned June was a highly promotional quarter, so maybe that impact is less through the year. But how much of the AUR increase that we're seeing at this point, this late in the quality of sales game is from initial price points versus the ongoing reductions in promotionality or off price? And then if I could just add a second, maybe some context around that sequential acceleration in the North America wholesale business, it's not lost on us. You gave us a nice new table to look at by channel there. But that was, I think, about a 20 percentage point increase quarter-to-quarter. I know you had some timing shifts with off-price, but also we see some new distribution in places like Amazon and Urban Outfitters for the Chaps brand. So, maybe you could help us isolate a couple of the drivers or maybe just size a few of those drivers so we can understand that big acceleration?","Jane Nielsen","Yes, so why don't I start with AUR, and then we'll move on to sort of the wholesale timing and cadence. AUR progress was really broad-based, and really is an indication of the work that we're doing to improve both our promotional stance, but also the work that we're doing on merchandizing and product. As we're seeing the largest driver is still our pullback from promotion, but we are seeing benefit of assorting into higher price points. We saw that come through both in North America and the international business, in retail, and in our digital business.","And so really across the board strong AUR growth, really a bit out ahead of where we expected the business to be, but we expect AUR growth is a part of our strategy, as I called out during investor day. And so we continue to expect that we'll see AUR expansion. But largely, Michael, to your point specifically it's mostly our quality of sales work.","As we look at our overall wholesale business, we really have a dynamic going on here that in the first half of the year we, especially in this quarter, we moved some of our off-price shipments to out of Q4 last year, into Q1 and Q2 this year. And so that is that sum of the acceleration that you're seeing in overall wholesale, we think the underlying trend in our North America wholesale business is down mid single-digit. We, while we got some benefit from shipment timing the pressures still remain in terms of challenging traffic trends, some of our quality of sales work that we continue to do, some door closures and bond time, I expect that you'll start to see -- we'll call out the underlying trend. We expect our full-priced wholesale business will improve sequentially as we move through the year.","Again, there's some choppiness that'll go on, but the underlying trend will improve. And then as you look in Europe there's some shipment timing going around. We expect that that businesses' underlying trend is up low to mid single-digit. And as we come into the second half you'll start to see those underlying trends normalize because we'll be through some of the shipment timing.","Next question, please.","Operator","The next question comes from Matthew Boss with JP Morgan Chase. You may ask your question.","Grace Smalley","Hi, good morning. This is Grace Smalley on for Matt Boss, thank you for taking my question. Just on the North America same-store sales, I think in brick-and-mortar trends may have decelerated very slightly relative to last quarter, even once you ship out the Easter shift. Is that fair? And if they were out can we think about what drove that? Thank you.","Patrice Louvet","Good morning, Grace. Yes, that is correct. Our North America brick-and-mortar comp slowed from Q4. So down three reported, if you exclude the Easter impact it's actually basically flat versus last year. A couple dynamics, one if you look at actually the base period we were working against a much tougher comp. Q1 last year was down four, whereas Q4 was down 12. The second piece is we did see a shift in tourist business. While our tourists' sales were up 7% in Q4, they were flat in Q1. And we see that as being driven by some of the currency fluctuations that we have all observed. But what you can expect from this business is actually continued improvement on the overall comp trends. If you look at it over time, we are progressively strengthening from a comp standpoint, and that's generally what we expect for the balance of the fiscal year as our new product and new marketing activities kick in.","Jane Nielsen","Next question, please.","Operator","The next question comes from Heather Balsky [ph] with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question.","Q \u2013 Unidentified Analyst","Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions.","Jane Nielsen","Heather, good morning.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning. I was hoping first, you guys seem pretty confident in ecommerce turning in the second quarter. Could you speak to quarter-to-date trends? And then with regards to Europe and the turnaround there, can you just elaborate a little bit on the changes you're making in terms of the merchandizing? Thanks.","Patrice Louvet","So, listen, we can't give you quarter-to-date perspective. I can give you some perspective on what drove the improvement in Q1 in North America being a little more granular than the earlier question from Laurent. One, we stabilized the new platform, right. We launched the new platform last fall, during the holiday period. We had to work out some kinks as we worked the transition. We've now done the majority of that. Two, is we've really strengthened the functionality of the site. Being very consumer-centric, understanding what the consumer expects from the site. And so that ranges from delivery timings, to ratings and reviews, to 360 video on the product and so on which we know is resonating well with the consumer.","Three, is the brand presentation as a whole is better, right. And we want this to be our global flagship. And we know we still have work to do to elevate the brand presentation, but we made progress in Q1. And obviously we've also lapped some significant discount rate reductions. And so we're getting to a more normalized situation. We will continue to improve our quality of sales on the site. There's still work to be done, but our AUR growth was healthy, I think it was 5%. Our discount rate is down 300 basis points, so we're also making progress on the quality of sales front. And so you can expect all that to continue. We are cautiously optimistic. We obviously need to execute. But I think a lot of the interventions we're making both from an operational and consumer-facing standpoint is resonating with the consumer.","Jane Nielsen","Yes, Heather, I would just add that we also really encourage with the full price growth that we see on our e-commerce site and that was up 5% this quarter, which is -- they're encouraging.","Evren Kopelman","Next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray. You may ask your question.","Erinn Murphy","Great, thanks, good morning. I guess I had a question on Europe. I would love to hear kind of what you're seeing broadly in that market in particular it sounds like you guys are still working through a few assortment challenges, so specific on that and then secondly as it relates to the broad promotional environment in Western Europe, have you seen any changes as you've moved through the middle of the year now? Thank you.","Jane Nielsen","Yes, so what we're seeing in Europe on our side is the environment is a little bit more challenged. We saw some pressure in the foreign tourists sales overall in Europe. This quarter what we saw was that for interest activity was down about 15%. While we look at that relative to last year we're down about 6% that is a pressure overall in Europe as we look at our business specifically we have seen some challenge in our European outlet business.","While we believe that foreign tourists are an impact there we also believe that our own assortment had gotten to basic. And that we need to get back into stock on seasonal newness and innovation newness that's part of our inventory build of this quarter and we expect in the second-half, that you'll start to see improved trends in our own business. We've done a lot of work this quarter and will continue to do a lot of work in quality of sales, so we step back from promotional levels. We do see that environment to be somewhat promotional as we move through this quarter.","Patrice Louvet","And I think as we're talking earlier if you look at the various channels, so you've covered that the factory outlet situation obviously on the .com side we are in the middle of implementing our new platform, so we see encouraging signs, work to do but encouraging signs so we expect that to actually accelerate and as far as wholesale is concern while as you mentioned generally are we did have timing impacts with Q1. The overall health of our wholesale business in Europe is actually good and the team is doing some really good work there, so our key opportunity and challenged to work on really is the quality of sales force that we're doing for factory. Erinn we missed, we didn't hear your second question or we didn't hear it clearly?","Erinn Murphy","Well, the second part was just on the promotional environment. I think Jane had that just kind of broadly it sounded like it would be picking up a little bit in the back half of the quarter but that was my second part of the question.","Patrice Louvet","Okay, thank you.","Evren Kopelman","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. You may ask your question.","Omar Saad","Thank you. Good morning nice to see the lot of the defense initiatives you guys putting in really playing out in terms of the margin in the AURs, wanted to ask maybe for an update on the product side, what you're excited about where you think you are in terms of getting the product where you want to be across different channels and the different sub brands and opportunities you're excited about on the product side coming up, I don't know if [indiscernible]. Thank you.","Patrice Louvet","In general, we are right where we expect it to be from a product evolutions standpoint. We're feeling good about number of categories. If you look at our results in this past quarter we actually saw growth both in men's and women's with the focus on Polo and across most of our apparel categories, so this is pretty broad-based in terms of improvements what we're seeing is our focus on icons is really paying off, so let's obviously job one for all of us continue to drive our icons.","The second element is the renewal of our core is beginning to run to resonate with consumers a combination of both adding novelty, right things like embroidery things like printing is resonating well and also we freshen our fabrics pushing a greater focus on functionality again being consumer-centric and being clear on what the consumer is expecting from us, so stretching our C notes we mentioned that in our prepared remarks is resonating well with the consumer.","Our denim products are actually also doing well. We had good momentum last fiscal year, we are building on that momentum this first quarter with mid single-digit growth or outerwear business, which is another focus category for us. It was a high single-digit, so where we focus and we are being really disciplined in terms of what we want to drive our activity on, we are seeing positive response from the consumer.","To your question on brands where we are seeing the greatest progress at this point is Polo. But we are also seeing improvements on Lauren, so encouraged by that. So I say listen, the game plan is kind of on track but we know still have work to do and we are really focused on making sure we are bringing the vision to life and being true to who we are while connecting clearly with what the consumer expects from us across the markets, right? And Jane touched on this earlier. Some of our products, what's resonating maybe different in China than it is in wholesale North America and we are making sure we are adapting to the local needs and expectations of the consumers we are targeting.","Evren Kopelman","Next question, please?","Operator","The next question comes from Alex Wallace with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.","Alex Wallace","Good morning. Thank you for the question. I wonder if you could help us with an update on your strategic initiatives in the U.S. market. In particular an update on the strategy and LA and now that you are few months into region refresh. And also the refresh of some of the department stores in the market, I was wondering if you've seen a material discrepancy between those stores, it could be refreshed and the control group.","My second quarter was product cost, I just wanted to follow-up on a question from Smalley earlier. You gave us a hopeful color on the progression of the impact of product cost on a gross margin. I was just wondering if you could break that down a little bit in terms of the drivers of that, how much of that is in a proactive quality improvement, how much of it is commodity industry headwinds and so on? Thank you.","Patrice Louvet","Sure. Good morning, Alex. I think Jane and I will talk to you on this one. As far as LA is concerned, so really elevating the entire LA ecosystem is really the strategy there. We started in May indeed, yeah it's very early there as far as, so I'm always cautious to draw any conclusions a weeks and but if you push me I would say early indicators are encouraging, we are seeing growth in LA market that's slightly ahead of what we are experiencing across the country. We are also seeing from a consumer standpoint that we are attracting a new younger consumer, so we are quite encouraged by those early signs.","And then, we actually saw also an acceleration of our digital commerce business in the region. So the headline thought on this is so far so good. Frankly, I wouldn't take any of this to the bank yet, I think we are in very early stages of implementation but we are seeing encouraging signs including with our new small format store in Beverly Center as you know, as we look ahead we really want to expand our brick-and-mortar footprint through small format stores, more productive, more dynamic, more flexible, better connected and few weeks in to the opening of that store we are actually also seeing encouraging response from consumers.","Then on the improvement of wholesale refreshers, so we are continuing to do that. We are continuing to see benefits from doing that. We have a great partnership with our lead wholesale partner who is focused on upgrading their top 50 doors and we are working really hand-in-hand with them on driving those top 50 doors, remember which actually are in the Los Angeles region. And I think we are also thinking to what's the next phase of upgrades as our partner looks to expand that program. So across the board continuing to drive that, seeing return on investment for those upgrades and getting a solid consumer response.","Jane Nielsen","And Alex, on product cost, let me pass it into to the two buckets of your questions, what we are seeing on our elevated product is that we are able to get both AIR and AUR increases to whole market as we elevate the product, so that's the good news, it challenges and I was pointing out are really centered in key input areas like polyester, cotton gown, some wage inflation as soon as some freight cost that are manifesting themselves as you competed, tight U.S. market trucking capacity.","Now we are working with our suppliers to offset some of these costs to look how we work through air freight reductions to improve our freight cost. But that's really the center pressure points that we are seeing in overall product cost.","Evren Kopelman","Next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from Rick Patel with Needham & Company. You may ask your question.","Rick Patel","Good morning everyone, and congrats on the progress early in the year.","Jane Nielsen","Thanks.","Rick Patel","I have a couple of follow-ups on Omar's product question. So the first one is you have five underpenetrated categories and it looks like you are making some pretty good progress with outerwear and denim. As we think about the other three categories ready-to-wear, footwear, accessories, do you expect to see an acceleration at some point in fiscal '19, or is that going to be an out year event?","And then, my second question is really around some of these product drops. They've obviously been very successful and they draw a lot of interest in the brand. As we think about the future, can these ever become big enough to be growth drivers on their own with the right inventory investment and how frequently can you recycle some of your more successful ones like Snow Beach without hurting the brand appeal?","Patrice Louvet","Great questions, Rick. So as far as the underdeveloped categories are concerned, we have good momentum on denim and outerwear, and actually Wear To Work, I didn't mention that; we are off to a nice start on Wear To Work both on men and women with much more to come, and yes, some of it will impact this fiscal year on Wear To Work. On the footwear and accessories piece, that one as we talked during Investor Day, it's going to be a slower burn, because we got work to do on building our capabilities and making sure we have right design capabilities, right merchandizing capabilities, right sourcing plan and obviously we are great teams in place doing that work now. So I don't know that you will see a lot -- a significant impact in fiscal year '19. Obviously, we are driving all five, but I think well you'll see the strongest progress is going to be denim, outerwear, and Wear to Work.","As far as the drops are concerned, yes, they had worked really well for us. So we are excited about that. We are very -- I'm going to address your second point first; we are very careful on frequency, right, because the risk is you exhaust the consumer and then it loses all its interest and excitement. So we think we have the right pace, we have some exciting things coming in the fall, so that we will be announcing in I guess a couple of months, so we will be keeping that frequency, we will not accelerate it. And then, we are also thinking how do we expand to our woman's business because most of our drops are actually -- all of our drops so far have been focused on men and women deserve special drops too, although it will probably be a different, different approach to it.","As far as size, I would not expect these to be big enough to drive the overall numbers from a pure sales standpoint, right, these are marketing activities first and foremost. Similar to what we do with the Olympics is not about driving sales of that specific capsule, it's about leveraging this capsule to tell the brand story, to bring Ralph's vision to life in a new fresh way. And that's how we view this. So we like the sales performance, we are obviously excited when things sellout within hours of days, but the fundamental objective is part of our storytelling for the brand and to really make sure that we are bringing newness and freshness in a different perspective on the overall brand.","Evren Kopelman","All right, we will take one final question.","Operator","The last question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. You may ask your question.","Ike Boruchow","Hey, good morning everyone. Let me have my congrats; Jane just two quick ones for you on Europe, we know about the European website re-platforming and it sounds like it should be a little bit of a headwind in the near term, could you help us how to think about European e-comp comps in the second quarter, it sounds like this should be negative but just kind of want to understand that a little better. And then, you mention the tourism was down 15% in Europe this quarter. I'm just curious how that compares to what you saw three months ago.","Jane Nielsen","Sure, so why don't I start with the expectations for Europe e-commerce, I do expect that e-commerce will be down sort of mid single-digit in the second quarter. And then, I expect in the second-half to be back to growth and it's really from what we are seeing from transition as we look at some of the redirects and affiliates and email setup that those will have sort of a compressive pressure in the second quarter. What we were seeing in foreign tourist sales sort of in the -- in Europe specifically in the fourth quarter was about down 20 and that was worst than we saw in the Q4 '17 and so we are looking at this down 20, down 15. The Euro did the pressure from I think foreign currency lightened a bit as we moved into the first quarter and foreign tourists tend to drag a bit as they don't follow currency trends precisely, but over time. So not unexpected, but a little bit of abatement from pressure in Europe as we as moved into the first quarter.","Ike Boruchow","Thank you.","Patrice Louvet","Good. Thank you. Well, listen, thanks to all of you for joining the call. As I think you can tell Ralph and I and Jane and the whole team are encouraged by the progress we are making as we implement our new strategic framework. And so now everyone is laser-focused on bringing up to life around the world, so we can get consumers excited about our brand across channels. We look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thank you, and have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the Ralph Lauren first quarter fiscal 2019 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation.

Instructions on how to ask a question will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mrs. Evren Kopelman. Please go ahead.","Evren Kopelman","Thank you for joining Ralph Lauren fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2018 conference call. With me today are Patrice Louvet, the company\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jane Nielsen, Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions, which we ask that you limit to one per caller.","During today\u2019s call, we will be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including our financial outlook. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees, and our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.","Our expectations contain many risks and uncertainties.

To find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our financial results, you should refer to this morning\u2019s earnings release and to our SEC filings that can be found on our Investor Relations website.","And now I will turn the call over to Patrice.","Patrice Louvet","Thank you, Evren. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today\u2019s call. We\u2019re pleased to report fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2018 results that delivered on our commitments. Revenue was ahead of our expectations, driven by a solid fourth quarter and operating margin was at the high-end of our plan for both the quarter and the year.","We\u2019re on a journey to establish a healthy foundation to get the company back to sustainable long-term growth and value creation. In fiscal 2018, we made strong progress on this journey, as we executed on our key strategic initiatives and closed the year with a clear game plan, a strong balance sheet and an engaged team focused on executing with excellence. We look forward to sharing our long-term growth and value-creation strategy and financial outlook at our Investor Day on June 7.","Before we review our recent progress, Ralph and I would like to welcome our new Board members: Mike George, who joined the Board last week; and Angela Ahrendts, who has agreed to join us in August. We\u2019re excited about the new capabilities and experiences they will each bring to our Board.","Angela needs little introduction. From her time successfully leading Burberry as CEO to the work she is doing transforming Apple\u2019s retail arm, she will bring invaluable perspective and experience to bear as we move through our own transformation. Mike, who is CEO of Qurate, the parent company of QVC, HSN, zulily and others, brings deep experience in driving growth and value creation through very unique and evolving retail channels globally.","Now let me take you through the progress we\u2019ve made in fiscal 2018 across our four key initiatives, which include: first, elevating our brand by improving quality of sales, distribution and product; second, evolving our product, marketing and shopping experience to increase our reach and appeal with new consumers; third, expanding our digital and international presence; and fourth, working in new ways to drive productivity and agility. I will focus most of my commentary on full-year fiscal 2018 results and Jane will cover more of the fourth quarter performance.","So starting with the first initiative, elevating our brand by improving quality of sales, distribution and product. In fiscal 2018, we drove growth in our average unit retail through discount rate reductions and sales mix. AUR was up 4% across our direct-to-consumer network with growth in every quarter and in every region. We improved the quality of our distribution by continuing to close lower productivity and off-equity doors in both retail and wholesale.","In fiscal 2018, we closed approximately 25% of our U.S. department store points of distribution and 31 directly operated retail stores. While these closures are largely complete, we will continue to progressively reduce our penetration in the off-price channel.","However, the negative impacts from the off-price reduction to our sales performance will not be as significant going forward as it was in fiscal 2018. At the same time, we\u2019re expanding our store network, especially in international markets, where we are underpenetrated with new small-format stores that are highly productive. Combined, these actions are repositioning our overall store base to deliver high-quality future sales growth. All of these actions led to strong adjusted gross margin improvement of 290 basis points for the year with solid increases every quarter.","Moving on to our second key initiative, evolving our product, marketing and shopping experience to increase our reach and appeal with new consumers.","In each of these areas, we\u2019re focused on combining Ralph\u2019s and our creative team\u2019s iconic brand vision with deep insight and understanding of consumers around the world.","Starting with products. We continue to drive assortment discipline with improvements in the clarity of our product message and SKU productivity. For fiscal 2018, revenue per SKU increased 16% and gross profit per SKU was up 22% to last year. Our spring season-to-date performance continued the improvement in trends we experienced during fall and holiday.","We saw product successes in our core items, where we brought newness and excitement through the addition of novelty, like embroidery and printing, as well as refreshed fabrics and increased functionality. Polo led our brand sales performance. Our best sellers included a modernized version of our men\u2019s Polo sweatshirt featuring a technology-infused double-knit fabric. We also had good sell-through with our updated take on our Classic Oxford shirt with a garment died fabrication, representing a fresh interpretation.","Outerwear was another positive area, where lighter weight and functional fabrics in both casual weekend and Wear To Work styles drove growth. In addition, our new read and react graphic T-shirt program was effective with a quick turnaround from consumer test to shop floor.","In women\u2019s Polo, details like souvenir embroidery on our iconic military jacket added interest. And in Lauren, our sweater jackets, where we added multiple silhouettes and button options, were bestsellers. We also built on our limited edition successes in the fourth quarter with the launch of our Snow Beach collection in January, which draws on our deep and authentic heritage.","The original Snow Beach collection was introduced in 1993, and many pieces became iconic collector\u2019s items. Similar to our successful Stadium launch last September, Snow Beach sold out within hours and helped to drive excitement around our brand.","Lastly, in product, we also continued to make progress on building out underdeveloped categories that have significant growth potential across our brands. Last quarter, we talked about denim as one of these categories, where our consumer research showed that we have a clear basis to win.","Our sales in denim were up 9% for the year and 13% for the fourth quarter, driven by updated fits, washes and lighter-weight fabrications. So, as you can see, we\u2019re making encouraging progress across multiple fronts on product and we\u2019re pleased with the improving consumer response that we are seeing.","Moving on to marketing. In fiscal 2018, we significantly increased our marketing investment in campaigns and assets with strong potential to better align our spend with the industry norm. Marketing spend was up 10% for the full fiscal year to $241 million. This growth was driven by increases in digital and social media, as we shift marketing investment to the channels that matter most to our consumers today.","One of the key elements of our marketing strategy is adopting a more consumer-centric approach. We recently completed a major global consumer research study that provided important insights that we\u2019ll share with you at Investor Day in a couple of weeks. These learnings will enable us to be much more precise about how we engage specific consumer groups in order to make our marketing investments more effective and efficient. We had several major marketing events in the fourth quarter that drove significant consumer engagements for the brand.","Starting with our sponsorship of the Winter Olympics. We generated 6 billion media impressions from extensive social media presence with key American athletes and outfitting the U.S. Olympic Team with the high-tech heated jacket. Our February fashion show was a successful media event with 3.2 million global live views. We built anticipation and amplification on social with 3.3 billion global media impressions.","The Snow Beach limited edition in January successfully leveraged social media through a robust campaign on Instagram and key influencers such as Chance the Rapper and Zayn.","And lastly, our spring Polo campaign featuring our iconic white Polo shirt was integrated across various touchpoints, from Instagram, Facebook and Snapchat to ralphlauren.com and our stores. We\u2019ll be able to share more perspective on this campaign on our next earnings call.","We also continued to build our influencer and celebrity coverage, spanning various parts of culture from artists to movie stars to athletes. Awards season dressing included Shailene Woodley at the Golden Globes, Emma Watson and Eiza Gonzales at the Academy Awards, Jay-Z at the Grammy Awards Pre-Party and Mandy Moore and Yara Shahidi at the Screen Actors Guild Awards.","In sports, Polo ambassador and current number 1 golfer in the world, Justin Thomas, and Olympic athletes, including the Shibutani siblings represented our brand in the athletic arena. Internationally, we continued to partner with celebrities and other key social media influencers, including Gloria Tang and Wenwen Han in China, Jessica Jung in Korea and Akira in Japan in the fourth quarter. This diverse group of influencers represents different aspects of our brand and engages different consumer segments.","Finally, in terms of upgrading our shopping experience, both in stores and online, we invested in our store environments around the world. For example, in North America, we refreshed over 80 of our top department store shops in fiscal 2018 through improved fixturing, lightning, visual merchandising, product presentation and layout. The new environment is updated with a fresh, lighter aesthetic with improved product presentation focused on our core items, as well as growth categories like denim.","The refreshed shops also enable easier navigation for consumers and provide a more coherent brand experience. This has driven improved sales and margin versus control doors and pretest trends. We plan to accelerate and broaden these activities in fiscal 2019 across all channels globally.","Moving on to our third key initiative, expanding our digital and international presence. On the last two earnings calls, I spoke in detail about our growth opportunity in Asia, specifically in China, as well our expansion in digital commerce. Let me give you an update on both of those areas.","China had a great year in fiscal 2018, posting 25% sales growth on the mainland. Our new small format stores, a key component of our omni-channel growth strategy in the region are performing well.","We ended the year with 111 directly operated stores and concessions in Greater China, representing a net increase of 28 versus prior year. This is complemented by our strong digital expansion in China on Tmall, JD.com and WeChat. We remain on track to reach our goal of $0.5 billion of revenue in five years in Greater China, especially as we continue to raise our brand awareness and perception.","Moving on to digital, which is a critical piece of our global growth strategy. In fiscal 2018, our global digital ecosystem sales were approximately $1 billion at retail value, including both our partners and our directly operated businesses.","In fiscal 2019 and beyond, we expect our digital growth to accelerate as the major pullback in our directly operated North America e-commerce business is largely complete. We\u2019re improving our site\u2019s functionality and increasing marketing to return to revenue growth in this important channel.","In the first quarter, we will be upgrading the technology platform for our directly operated European e-commerce business, similar to what we implemented in North America last fall. We expect this transition will significantly improve the shopping experience on our site with enhanced functionality, including better search, navigation and checkout process.","Our digital wholesale business continues to grow. In fiscal 2018, we drove market share gains in this channel at our key retailers and in our key categories. We are collaborating closely with our key partners on targeted product and marketing initiatives on both department store websites and pure play customers. As an example, our collaboration with ASOS in Europe with the different ways to wear the polo shirt campaign was highly effective, as we tailored the message specifically for the consumer on that platform.","Finally, let me touch on our fourth key initiative, working in new ways to drive productivity and agility. In fiscal 2018, we made significant progress across many areas. Let me start with our major end-to-end initiative, designed to drive productivity across the business, including inventory efficiencies and faster lead times.","Our work in this area has resulted in a 30% reduction in inventory over the past couple of years and we achieved our goal of having 90% of our products on a nine-month lead time at the end of fiscal 2018. This is enabling us to make product decisions much closer to consumer demand.","We plan to drive further improvements in fiscal 2019 towards six-month and three-month lead times for a certain portion of our products. We\u2019ll talk about that and more of our important initiatives in this area at our upcoming Investor Day.","So in closing, over the last fiscal year, we have made strong progress as we continue to execute our key initiatives to position the company to get back to sustainable long-term growth and value creation.","Ralph and I are proud of the work our teams around the world have done this year. We\u2019re encouraged by the way our teams are coming together to focus on the consumer, prioritize what matters most and move with urgency to get us back to winning. I look forward to discussing our more detailed strategic plan with you in a couple of weeks.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jane, and I\u2019ll join her at the end to answer your questions.","Jane Nielsen","Thank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter and full-year results were ahead of our expectations and showed continued progress on resetting the business to a healthier base. Our four key initiatives are delivering higher AURs, lower discounts, expanded gross margins, higher inventory turns and significant growth in free cash flow.","Fourth quarter revenues declined 2% on a reported basis and 7% in constant currency. This was above our guidance, driven largely by a strong Easter holiday in retail. With the holiday momentum, we returned to comp growth in North American stores. During this quarter and throughout this fiscal year, our teams have focused on strengthening the brand and driving strong execution. I\u2019m so proud of the progress we\u2019ve made and the work they continue to do.","In the quarter, we saw higher sell-throughs on spring and improved product profitability, notably in our Polo brand. Adjusted gross margin expanded 440 basis points in the fourth quarter and 350 basis points in constant currency, benefiting from the reduced discount rates and favorable geographic and channel mix.","Lower product costs and product mix also provided a tailwind to gross margin in the fourth quarter. While quality of sales initiatives will continue to drive overall gross margin expansion in fiscal 2019, product cost will become more challenging in the coming year.","Adjusted operating margin in the fourth quarter was 5.6%, down 110 basis points to last year on a reported basis and down 240 basis points in constant currency, at the top-end of our guidance. In the fourth quarter, we stepped up our marketing significantly off a low base last year. Planned investment in marketing was up more than 50% in the fourth quarter and up 10% for the year and contributed to the improvement we saw in our sales trend.","Moving forward, our goal is to progressively increase marketing investment to accelerate our top line growth. However, our objective is to fund the majority of the increases through productivity gains to achieve operating margin expansion.","Moving on to our segment performance. Starting with North America, revenue was down 14% in the fourth quarter and comps were flat in constant currency. Adjusted operating margin was flat to last year as gross margin improvement was offset by increased marketing investment. Importantly, all channels contributed to gross margin improvements in the fourth quarter.","Let me review the North America results across channels, first, our stores; second, our directly operated e-commerce business; and third, our wholesale business. Our stores were a highlight with a 6% positive comp in the quarter, driven by improved AUR and traffic trends ahead of our expectations.","The earlier timing of Easter contributed 3.5 points to North America comp in the fourth quarter and 1.5 points to total company global comp. Our retail improvements demonstrate some of the progress we have made across product, marketing and operational initiatives, such as monthly product newness and timing of floor sets that were better aligned with customers wear now shopping preferences. At a more macro level, we also saw growth in foreign tourist sales in the fourth quarter, following 15 consecutive quarters of declines.","E-commerce comps in North America were down 18% in the fourth quarter in line with our expectations. E-commerce results continue to be pressured by our deliberate quality of sales initiatives, including significant reductions and deep markdowns. This quarter, we continued the work to lower discount rates and promotion frequency. Additionally, new arrivals and most of our iconic items were excluded from promotions.","We expect to return to growth in North America e-commerce in fiscal 2019. This will be driven by three factors. First, the significant pullback in deep markdown sales is substantially complete and fiscal 2019 quality of sales efforts will be more moderated.","Second, we are elevating our assortment and adding conversion-driving functionality to the site, such as customer reviews and live chat, all accompanied by better story-telling and creative.","Third, in fiscal 2018, full price sales, which were not impacted by our promotional pull back, were up 3% with continued strengthening in the fourth quarter. This momentum gives us confidence that we can return to growth as the impact of the pullback diminishes.","Moving on to North America wholesale. The fourth quarter revenue decline of 22% reflects strategic actions, timing shifts and negative, but improving sellout. Two-thirds of the decline is a continuation of our quality of sales initiatives, reductions at Bon-Ton and off-price timing shifts.","Similar to prior quarters, closures of lower productivity points-of-sale in department stores, brand exits and reduced discounts negatively impacted revenue. Reduced shipments to Bon-Ton stores of approximately $10 million versus last year also created pressure.","Finally, a shift in timing of off-price shipments negatively impacted the trend. Off-price revenue was down 29% in the fourth quarter versus an 18% decline in the third quarter. Some Q4 shipments that typically occur late in the quarter shifted into Q1. The remaining one-third was related to our underlying trends. While we are seeing improvements in our apparel categories, some of our progress was offset by weakness in non-apparel categories.","As you know, our wholesale shipments reflect department store orders from almost a year ago. These orders followed a challenging spring 2017 collection sell-out that was down mid-teens. Since that time, sell-out has shown an improved trajectory. The fall holiday season was down low double digits and our current sell-out trend at department stores is down mid single digits. Clearly, we still have work to do, but the improved sell-out trends should be reflected in our orders and then on our P&L over the next several quarters.","Looking out to fiscal 2019, we expect to see an improvement in our North America wholesale trend. While we expect revenue to decline, it should be at a smaller magnitude than in fiscal 2018.","Some of the dynamics we see at play as we enter FY 2019 are, on a positive side, continued sell-out trend improvement, which will increasingly have the benefit of the refresh of our wholesale shop environments and evolved product and marketing; and growth in our digital wholesale business, which now represents a mid to high teens percent of our total wholesale revenue.","While some pressures from FY 2018 remained, we expect them to lessen in magnitude. In off-price, we will continue to reduce shipments, but at a more moderate rate, as we restore balance to the channel as a vehicle for excess sales. The impact from our FY 2018 point-of-sale to closures will lessen as we anniversary those closures in FY 2019.","Finally, the Bon-Ton bankruptcy, which represents about $25 million in fiscal 2018, represents about a 1.5 point of headwind to North America wholesale growth in fiscal 2019. In this channel, our focus remains to build high-quality growth with our partners in the North America wholesale channel.","Moving on to Europe. Revenue increased 13% on a reported basis and declined 1% in constant currency in the fourth quarter. Adjusted operating margins were up 20 basis points, but were down 220 basis points in constant currency as gross margin improvements were offset by increased marketing investments.","Wholesale revenue in Europe increased 1% in constant currency in the fourth quarter in line with the underlying trend of the business. Digital wholesale in Europe continued to post double-digit growth and expand market share. In the retail channel, European comps were down 6% in constant currency, with growth in e-commerce more than offset by declines in our stores.","Comps in Europe continue to be pressured by our ongoing quality of sales initiatives, assortment and inventory challenges in outlet and challenging traffic, notably in some of our outlet stores. We are implementing a number of changes in our product assortments and promotion structures to improve the traffic and conversion trends in our European stores.","We expect these initiatives will start impacting the business in the second-half of fiscal 2019. Also, as Patrice mentioned, we will be upgrading the technology platform for our digitally-operated European e-commerce business at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2019, and we expect this transition will negatively impact second quarter e-commerce comps in Europe.","We will manage these impacts carefully to minimize disruption, similar to what we did in North America when we transitioned last fall. Despite challenging trends in our brick-and-mortar stores, progress in our KPIs continued. In the fourth quarter in Europe, average unit retails were up 3%, discount rates were down and gross margin was up 270 basis points on a reported basis and 40 basis points in constant currency.","Turning to Asia. Revenue was up 17% on a reported basis and 11% in constant currency in the fourth quarter. We saw strong performance across every market in Asia, including 6% growth in Japan, 34% growth in mainland China and 22% growth in Greater China, all in constant currency.","Our product and marketing initiatives are resonating well in the region and we are continuing to increase our digital efforts and engagement with local influencers and celebrities. Comps in Asia increased 4% in constant currency in the fourth quarter, continuing the positive comp trend from the first three quarters of the year.","We expect further comp growth in Asia as we continue to upgrade our distribution network and marketing initiatives to amplify and elevate the brand. We also continued to drive quality of sales in Asia. In the fourth quarter, average unit retails were up 3%, discount rates were down and gross margin was up significantly.","Adjusted operating margin was up 210 basis points to last year in the fourth quarter in Asia and up 80 basis points in constant currency, driven by gross margin improvement. With our quality of sales actions largely completed in Asia, we expect more modest operating margin expansion going forward, as we focus on driving top line growth and leveraging our investments.","Turning to our store fleet. We continue to improve our retail network through the closure of underperforming locations and opening new stores with improved adjacencies. For the full-year, we opened 37 standalone stores and 77 concessions. We closed 31 standalone stores and 65 concessions, ending the year with 472 standalone stores and 632 concessions on a global basis.","Moving on to the balance sheet. In this quarter and throughout this year, we continued to strengthen our balance sheet, reflecting the operational progress we are making. We ended the year with $2.1 billion in cash and investments, up from $1.4 billion at the end of last year.","Total debt at the end of the quarter was $596 million, compared with $588 million last year. Inventory declined 7% in constant currency and 4% on a reported basis to $761 million at the end of the fiscal year. We will continue to focus on inventory productivity and matching inventory flows with demand.","Capital expenditures in fiscal 2018 were $162 million, below our original plan, as we shifted certain capital investments from fiscal 2018 into 2019. We generated $814 million of free cash flow for the year, up from $669 million in the prior year period.","Now I\u2019d like to turn to guidance for the full-year and first quarter of fiscal 2019. We will provide our long-term financial outlook, including our capital allocation strategy at our Investor Day on June 7. As a reminder, this guidance excludes restructuring and related charges.","For the full fiscal year 2019, we expect revenues to be down low single digits in constant currency, representing a sequential improvement in our journey to return to growth. Foreign currency is expected to have minimal impact on revenue growth in fiscal 2019. We expect growth in our international business to be offset by a decline in North America, reflecting the timing of the Easter holidays, which will negatively impact both the first quarter and the fourth quarter, as well as the North America wholesale dynamics I outlined earlier.","We expect operating margin for fiscal 2019 to be up slightly in constant currency. This will be driven by an estimated 50 to 75 basis points of gross margin expansion, as we continue to reduce promotions and shift towards higher-margin channels and regions. Foreign currency is expected to have a minimal impact on operating margin in fiscal 2019. This guidance reflects a balance between continued quality of sales initiatives to elevate the brand and investments in products, marketing and store concepts that demonstrate high potential for growth and returns.","For the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we expect revenue to be flat to down slightly in constant currency. Foreign currency is expected to benefit revenue growth by approximately 150 to 200 basis points in the quarter. We expect global comp store sales in the first quarter to be negatively impacted by approximately 1.5 points, while North America comps to be negatively impacted by roughly 3 points from the timing of Easter, which favorably impacted the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.","We expect gross margin to expand 50 to 75 basis points in the first quarter in line with our expectations for full-year fiscal 2019. Operating margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 is expected to be up slightly in constant currency. Foreign currency is estimated to benefit operating margin by 20 to 40 basis points in the quarter.","We expect capital expenditures of approximately $275 million in fiscal 2019, focused on consumer-facing initiatives that have demonstrated a proof-of-concept and healthy rates of return, including stores, digital and marketing. We expect our effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 to be approximately 22%, below our fiscal 2018 adjusted rate of 24%, primarily due to the lower U.S. federal income tax rate as a result of tax reform. First quarter of fiscal 2019 tax rate is estimated at approximately 18%.","In closing, we continue to make strong progress in building the right foundation to grow our business. Ralph\u2019s enduring vision inspires our teams around the world and they are delivering on operational efficiencies and building our growth initiatives. We are seeing early signs of momentum.","As one team, we are focused on delivering quality, sustainable growth and value creation for the long term.","With that, let\u2019s open up the call for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] One moment please for the first question. Our first question comes from Michael Binetti from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Michael Binetti","Hey, guys, thanks very much for taking our question. Congrats on \u2013 I know you guys have been working hard on this.","Jane Nielsen","Thank you.","Patrice Louvet","Thanks, Michael.","Michael Binetti","Yes, thanks. So can I just ask \u2013 in fiscal 2019, a lot of puts and takes there and, Jane, thanks for all the detail. Do you expect the revenue trend to improve as the year progresses, if we exclude a bunch of calendar shifts you pointed out, some puts and takes like Bon-Ton and the off-price reduction?","And if I can just ask one follow-up in a bigger picture, Jane, you went through a lot of the distribution, you pulled back a really big amount. You hinted that sell-through is starting to improve. But on your last call, I think, you made a hint that your retailers are starting to see the margins on Ralph Lauren product improve on a year-over-year basis. I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s the first increase in years. Are you starting to see green shoots on the order book in any of the meaningful accounts at this point? Are they starting to increase orders, or is it better to characterize retail partners as still digesting a lot of the big changes over the last few years and you need to check a few boxes yet before we start new growth?","Patrice Louvet","All right. Good morning, Michael. So I\u2019ll take the first part of your question and then Jane will cover your \u2013 the second part.","Michael Binetti","Thanks.","Patrice Louvet","Short answer is yes. We expect to see an improvement in our underlying business trend as we move through fiscal year 2019. However, on the face of the reported numbers, you\u2019re not going to really see a smooth sequential quarterly flow. And there are really three reasons that are going to make the quarterly flow a little choppy, if I can use that terminology.","First one is the cadence of our wholesale shipments, right? Our strategic reduction in our off-price shipment this year are going to be more concentrated in the second-half of the fiscal year, so that\u2019s going to obviously pressure revenue in the back-half. And in addition, Q1 is actually benefiting from a shift in European wholesale as we normalize our shipment cadence after adjustments we made last year in that region. So that\u2019s the first one.","The second one is the timing of Easter that we referred to in our remarks, right? The fourth quarter and the first quarter of fiscal 2019 are going to be negatively impacted by this Easter shift.","And then the final one is foreign currency. So based on what we can assume today, we assume that FX will have a bigger benefit to reported revenue in the front-half of the fiscal year. Yes, but if you exclude the impact of the Easter shift, our strategic off-price reductions, you will see a meaningful improvement in our underlying business trends as we go through the year.","Jane Nielsen","Yes, Michael, just on the second part of your question, I have two reasons to believe that our wholesale results are going to improve. One you called out is improved sell-out trends. So if I look a year ago to spring 2017, our sell-out was down mid-teens. As we move through holidays, we saw low double digits. And now in \u2013 our current sell-out is down in the mid-single-digit range, so strong progress there.","Our overall full \u2013 natural margins at wholesalers have progressed to increase quarter-by-quarter, so we made great progress this year. On retailer profitability, as you can see, our profitability, as was reflected in the segment, has also improved, so it\u2019s been a win-win situation. And based on those sell-outs, the order books are going to be stronger as we move into 2019.","So it takes a while, especially in wholesale, because you\u2019ve got to earn your way through. But I think, they\u2019re seeing the sell-out improvements. We\u2019ve gotten good feedback on the showrooms that we\u2019re showing. And importantly, we\u2019re both winning with following \u2013 coming out of our reset.","Evren Kopelman","Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Brian Tunick with Royal Bank of Canada.","Brian Tunick","Great. Thanks, and I will add my congrats as well on the progress.","Jane Nielsen","Thanks, Brian.","Patrice Louvet","Thank you.","Brian Tunick","I guess, my question may be for Jane. The gross margins here, I believe at an all-time high for the company. So maybe can you share with us, Jane or Patrice, your views on maybe where AURs can go from here as it seems like the worst of the inventory rationalization is behind us?","And then maybe, Jane, give us some comfort on where our gross margins may be between different channels or geographies. As those grow faster, how do those differ versus the maybe North America business, so we can think about gross margins expanding even more? Thank you very much.","Jane Nielsen","Sure. Let me try to take your question in pieces. First, on AUR. So where do I see AURs going? AURs are going to go higher and that\u2019s based on a number of dynamics, product elevation that we\u2019ve been working through this year and continue to work on, differentiated assortments by channels that allow for pricing harmonization and for us to provide value in different channels, as well as price harmony.","We are assorting into higher price points, notably in international. The international consumer has a very strong view of the Ralph Lauren brand and we\u2019re going to take that opportunity to assort into higher price points. As we mix into international markets where our AURs are higher, notably in Asia, you will see some benefit also to the AUR as we get that mix. And of course, that\u2019s all balanced on a foundation of less promotions and less discounting as we move through the year.","So that\u2019s the expectation that I see on AURs. As I look \u2013 step back from gross margin \u2013 to gross margins, we do see gross margin\u2019s expansion into the coming year. And that\u2019s driven largely on the back of what I just talked about higher AURs, less discounts and less promotions.","That\u2019s been, as you look across these four quarters, the largest driver of our gross margin progression and that will continue to be the driver as we move forward. There is a benefit, as we \u2013 as I mentioned, as we move into international. That benefit on the gross margin line because of the higher AURs and the higher gross margins in international will be a net benefit as we move into next year.","As you look between wholesale and retail globally, we have \u2013 we are at the highest retail gross margin as a company that we\u2019ve seen. But we believe we have progress to move further, especially as we build out these smaller-format doors that carry a nice \u2013 very nice gross margins across Asia, but across all of our markets, so that\u2019s a net benefit.","And then wholesale, we made a lot of good progress and we\u2019re at our highest total wholesale gross margins that we\u2019ve been at in five years. But with the progress we\u2019re making with assortment and differentiated assortment and the pullback in off-price, we see more room there as well. I think that we are comfortable that gross margin will expand, not at the pace that you\u2019ve seen it in this last year, but as a durable benefit as we move forward.","Evren Kopelman","Okay. Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo.","Ike Boruchow","Hi. Good morning, everyone, and let me add my congrats.","Jane Nielsen","Thank you, Ike.","Patrice Louvet","Good morning, Ike.","Ike Boruchow","I guess \u2013 so I guess, Jane, I wanted to dig into the North America e-comm channel a little bit. It sounds like you expect North America e-comm, if I heard right, to grow next fiscal year. I guess, my question is should that growth begin immediately starting in Q1? Is that more of a 2H inflection?","And then just a quick follow-up to that, now that you\u2019ve kind of rebased that channel, can you just remind us what percent of sales, I think you used to say, we\u2019re on discount, I think it was 78% like two years ago, where that got down to today, now that you feel it\u2019s kind of rebased, just out of curiosity.","Jane Nielsen","Sure. So first of all, on digital, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re tired of hearing me say this, we\u2019re going to make, like all things, nothing happens when you turn the page of a calendar or a fiscal year. But we are going to make sequential progress on our digital business and we\u2019re encouraged by the early signs that we\u2019re seeing on digital. So it\u2019s not a flip, but it will be a sequential progress story as we look into FY 2019.","And where we\u2019re really pleased in our digital business in terms of the amount of products sold on promotion is that, overall, what we\u2019ve done is, we\u2019d really pull down the highest markdowns of 50% off or greater. We\u2019ve seen that penetrate far less in our assortment and we\u2019ve seen full price selling, most importantly, that wasn\u2019t affected by any promotion be up 3% this year and move strongly through the year. So that we ended the fourth quarter with full price selling up over double digits.","Evren Kopelman","Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Rick Patel with Needham & Co.","Rick Patel","Thank you. Good morning, and congrats on the progress. There\u2019s a lot of moving parts here, so good execution.","Jane Nielsen","Thank you.","Rick Patel","You had a nice return to positive comps in North America stores. I\u2019m hoping you can give us a little more detail in terms of products and categories where you had the strongest performance, and your thoughts on the sustainability of that positive momentum in the New Year? And if I tie that into your comment about sequential improvement in e-commerce, should we expect to see retail comps turn positive this year?","Patrice Louvet","Let\u2019s tag team, Jane and I, on this one. First, looking at the progress that drove \u2013 the drivers behind the progress in our comp. It\u2019s really the game plan that we\u2019ve laid out starting to deliver. So the elevation of the brand that we are doing through product, through quality of sales.","And then as you look at the work we\u2019re doing on marketing and on specific product categories, whether that\u2019s denim, you heard earlier examples of outerwear in our prepared remarks, the combination of those high-growth categories and our stronger penetration of those has been key drivers behind the improvement of the comp performance that we\u2019re seeing. And we expect to continue the effort, both in terms of elevating the brand and evolving the product and the marketing.","I also \u2013 although it\u2019s very hard to trace it to every \u2013 to a single activity, I think, the shift that we\u2019re making from a marketing standpoint towards more digital, towards more social and the numbers really continue to bear this out is having an impact on traffic, is having an impact on the brand perception, and this is therefore, driving this improvement that we\u2019re seeing.","Jane Nielsen","Yes. Rick, as I look at the components, really the two drivers of North America comp were strong AUR growth, which you\u2019d expect given our quality of sales initiatives and improved traffic trends across all our channels. Now what we are seeing in contrast to Europe is, we saw a meaningful pickup in foreign tourist traffic. So it was up 7% this quarter and it was down about 7% last quarter. So a meaningful shift in traffic. We try to be clear, this was a holiday quarter.","So, in North America, about 3.5 points with a benefit to North America comp, comp positive despite the holidays, so that\u2019s very encouraging. It will sit on Q1 and the holiday will sit on Q4. But as we move forward, we expect to be sort of flat to down low single digits comp in FY 2019.","Evren Kopelman","Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad","Hey, thanks, It\u2019s great to see the continued progress, congrats on that.","Patrice Louvet","Thanks, Omar.","Omar Saad","Can you talk about \u2013 your inventory levels, quality of sales initiatives obviously have been having an impact on the P&L. Can you talk a little bit more about how you are managing inventory differently as more of your business has moved online across channels? Are you being able to develop kind of internal tech, IT systems that allow you to do more with less on the inventory side? Is that something we should think about as a medium and longer-term driver as well, or was it really just a matter of planning the right amount of inventory, reducing the promotions, and we\u2019ve kind of done most of the work around inventory already? Thanks.","Patrice Louvet","Thanks, Omar. So I guess, a couple of things on this one. One, there is just continued good old basic discipline that we will \u2013 we have in place that we\u2019re going to continue to drive to make sure that we are as efficient as possible.","During Investor Day, which I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll attend, we\u2019ll give you some more perspective on some of the shifts we\u2019re making in terms of managing inventory, particularly across channels, where it was historically been relatively siloed in the way we\u2019ve managed inventory. And I think we\u2019ve got some exciting projects to leverage that more smartly across channels. So you\u2019ll see us continue to make progress on this area.","Jane Nielsen","Yes, and we\u2019ll talk about it more at Investor Day. I would say that the work that our supply chain leader, Halide Alag\u00f6z and Val\u00e9rie Hermann, have done to have a very strong and integrated planning process from sketch to shelf has been a huge benefit to our inventory management. Good old-fashioned SKU cutting that were of unproductive SKUs was also a benefit and now we\u2019re evolving more into differentiated SKUs to support our overall AURs.","And we are using technology like our RFID technology in the factory store, as well as shared inventory across channel to improve our inventory work. I would expect longer-term that our objective is to have the improved turns more moderately than we have with the inventory reset that we did to return to improved turns. But really, you\u2019ll see inventory match our sales outlook.","Evren Kopelman","Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim. Your line is now open.","Robert Drbul","Hi, good morning. I just had a question on the North American wholesale business where you talked about refreshing 80 of the top department stores. Can you talk about the performance of those 80? Are there more that you are doing? And are you recapturing any square footage space in any of those top department stores? Can you give us an update on that? Thank you.","Patrice Louvet","Sure. So let\u2019s break down the different elements here. The first 80, we\u2019re really focusing on improving the environment, right? Some of these doors have not been touched for many, many years, some more than a decade. So it\u2019s about creating a more inviting, more engaging, more modern environment for consumers.","This ranges from the lighting, ranges from fixturing that we have and also allocating the product categories in a way that really is more consistent with the way the consumers approach our business and want to shop us. We have seen strong lifts beyond, I mean, in these 80 doors relative to pretest period or \u2013 and\/or benchmark doors.","So view this as just the beginning for us, right? Ultimately, our goal over the next few years is really to impact the vast majority of our presence. So we will continue to do that and not just in wholesale, but really, our approach is to make sure we\u2019re transforming the shopping experience across every single channel that is relevant for a consumer target. And so that\u2019s true online, that\u2019s true in our own stores, that\u2019s true in our factory stores and that also continues in wholesale, both in North America and globally.","As far as \u2013 second part of the question was?","Jane Nielsen","Can you remind us, Bob, the second part?","Robert Drbul","Just around like the square footage\u2026","Patrice Louvet","There is more space. Square footage","Robert Drbul","Yes.","Patrice Louvet","So that\u2019s \u2013 honestly, that\u2019s not the focus for us at this point. We want to be a lot more efficient with the space that we have. And so this is really about productivity per square foot as opposed to just adding more space. What we\u2019re finding actually, in some areas, we potentially have excess space relative to what we need to present the brand appropriately.","So we\u2019re really focusing on the productivity of the space we have and making that work much harder for us. And we\u2019re actually seeing significant benefits, both in wholesale and in the stores that we\u2019ve renovated behind that approach.","Jane Nielsen","Yes. Bob, I would just add that one of the benefits of that we\u2019re seeing in wholesale channel following the closure of the unproductive point-of-sales, as well as refurbishments that we are seeing our GMROI and our sales per square foot in wholesale increase nicely even in the face of overall shipment declines. So the GMROI of our strategy is working for us and it\u2019s working for our retailers. And in some cases, the resets actually have gone through a period of pullback, it helps you stake your claim to the space that you want and assort it more productively and that\u2019s certainly what we\u2019re doing.","Evren Kopelman","Okay. Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Eric Tracy with Buckingham Research.","Eric Tracy","Hi. Good morning, everyone, and I\u2019ll add my congrats on great execution.","Jane Nielsen","Thanks, Eric.","Patrice Louvet","Good morning, Eric.","Eric Tracy","I\u2019ve got a two-parter here. It\u2019s a little bit distinct. But just first, maybe speak to continued marketing spend and demand creation levels that we should anticipate as we move into \u2013 throughout 2019.","I think, Jane, you set up 10% this year. Maybe just again, sort of both quantify and give a level of assessment where that spend will go?","And then secondly, Jane, you mentioned product costs in terms of gross margin not being as beneficial this year. Clearly, we\u2019ve got some inflationary pressures. Maybe just talk through that dynamic and the potential impact as well?","Patrice Louvet","Sure. Maybe I\u2019ll start with the marketing spend, Eric. So right now, our spend is around 4% of sales, right? The industry norm is closer to 5%. So over time, our goal is to get to minimum, the industry norm, because we believe in branding, we have an amazing brand, we need to invest behind it. We\u2019ve made good progress over the back-half of this past fiscal year, as we want to continue to drive that. And I think you can expect that we will increase similar growth rate in fiscal 2019 relative to the overall increase in fiscal year 2018. With a deliberate focus again on digital and social commerce, that\u2019s where the vast \u2013 and social media, that\u2019s where the vast majority of our marketing increases will go.","Jane Nielsen","So as I look at product cost, Eric, the pressure points are, I\u2019d say, twofold. One is in actual garment, cost of polyester, cotton and even labor wage rates. And then the other factor that we\u2019re looking at is obviously freight cost and trucking capacity. As I aggregate those factors, I think that it\u2019s about 30 to 50 basis points of pressure on gross margin. Now as I contrast that to what happened in FY 2018, it was about 50 basis points of benefit.","So we obviously are looking at cost management \u2013 cost initiative, renegotiating some deals and leveraging scale with our supply partners and managing duty costs. Those are all parts of our ongoing productivity initiatives to manage this cost to that 30 to 50 basis points.","We\u2019ll also \u2013 a part of our AUR journey is to make sure that we cover structural cost increases with pricing increases. So I think we have a handle on it. It is a factor and it\u2019s one of the factors that will make gross margin expansion next year, but at a less significant rate than we saw in FY 2018.","Evren Kopelman","Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Simeon Siegel with Nomura Instinet.","Simeon Siegel","Thanks. Good morning, guys, and congrats on the progress.","Patrice Louvet","Good morning, Simeon.","Simeon Siegel","Jane, sorry if I missed it. The CapEx has been coming down nicely and below plan in the past couple of years. I think, it looks like you\u2019re planning it back up this year. So any thoughts on what that should look like go forward? I don\u2019t know if there was anything timing-wise in there? And then just to your comment about the meaningful decline in off-price shipments in the control there, could you just remind us what the current off-price penetration is and where you\u2019d expect that to go?","Patrice Louvet","Sure, Simeon. Let me give you some context on capital. Obviously, FY 2018, we spent less than we thought we would at $162 million. But I really view this as a test-and-learn year. So we put a lot of test into the marketplace, but we have a stringent guideline for the ROI that we need to see from investments that we put in the marketplace. That caused us to delay some initiatives into 2019, and so you\u2019re seeing that, in our CapEx guidance, it\u2019s closer to about 4.5% of sales as we move forward.","Over the long-term, we think that 4.5% to 5%, 4% to 5% is the right level of CapEx for our business. As I look at CapEx, especially this year, if you contrast it to the last several years, like many others, significant CapEx investments in IT have moved into SG&A as we take advantage of more variable platforms like Demandware or Salesforce eCommerce Cloud, backup services that you don\u2019t have to invest capital in, but you pay as a service and stay technologically upgraded.","So that\u2019s a factor for CapEx as we move forward. But I think, we feel good that we have really inculcated a strong ROI culture. We know where we need to go and we\u2019ll talk about it much more at Investor Day. Then, obviously, on off-price, we don\u2019t disclose the percentage of that business to our total. As you know, we would disclose it if it was more than 10% as a very high watermark. But our objective is to increase this channel\u2019s penetration into our wholesale channel, so it will be decreasing...","Patrice Louvet","Increasing, increasing.","Jane Nielsen","I\u2019m sorry. Oh, gosh.","Patrice Louvet","We are increasing instead of \u2013 don\u2019t let anyone else hear that. We are decreasing its penetration to the wholesale channel. So it is a point of pressure to growth obviously in 2018 and into the future, not as dramatic as you saw in 2018, but at decreasing penetration. It\u2019s a pressure point in growth, because we\u2019ve got to get this channel back to where it should be strategically for us, which is in a point of excess sale for excess that we generate as a retailer.","Evren Kopelman","Okay. We\u2019ll take one last question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from John Kernan with Cowen. Your line is open.","John Kernan","Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. Congrats on the progress and looking forward\u2026.","Patrice Louvet","John, good morning.","John Kernan","Looking forward to the Investor Day. Jane, just wondering if you could touch on what\u2019s implied within the guidance for Europe and Asia this year on a revenue perspective? And then you\u2019ve obviously done a lot to elevate and enhance the brand, not just in North America, but globally. Can you talk about the potential you see in Europe and Asia? I think you talked about $500 million in China. Give us a little more detail now about what \u2013 where you see those businesses going in the future. Thank you.","Jane Nielsen","Yes. And I can tell you, John, we\u2019re going to talk a lot more about this at Investor Day, and you can hear it directly from our leaders, Jeff Kuster and Howard Smith, who will give you perspective. In general, next year, I expect that international will grow and North America will decline less \u2013 in less magnitude than we saw this year, reflecting the work that we\u2019ve done, but that\u2019s our expectation.","As I look across the international business, we know we are underpenetrated in China. Our store presence has a lot of opportunity. The Chinese consumer in the research that we\u2019ve done has an elevated perception of the brand. And we\u2019ve got a lot of room to grow into their perception, both in our assortments and in our stores, building out our stores. Across Europe, again, we have 19 full-price stores in Europe.","We have a great opportunity to grow there. Notably, we\u2019re underpenetrated in Germany and Italy as opportunity areas, where we have a strong consumer perceptions and relatively limited build-out of our store fleet, but those are the opportunity areas.","Patrice Louvet","Yes. I think we\u2019re excited about the growth opportunities we have in international and we will share those in more detail in a couple of weeks. So listen, we\u2019re going to close it here. Thank you for joining the call. We look forward to seeing all of you June 7 on the Investor Day and have a great day. Thank you. Bye-bye.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation.

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]","Now for opening remarks and introductions, I will turn the conference over to Mr. James Hurley. Please go ahead, sir.","James Hurley","Good morning, and thank you for joining us on Ralph Lauren's Second Quarter Fiscal 2013 Conference Call. The agenda for this morning's call includes Roger Farah, our President and Chief Operating Officer, who will give you an overview of the quarter and comment on our broader strategic initiatives; Jacki Nemerov, our Executive Vice President, will provide some merchandising highlights; and Chris Peterson, our Chief Financial Officer, will provide operational and financial details for the second quarter, in addition to reviewing our expectations for fiscal 2013. After that, we'll open the call up to your questions, which we ask that you please limit to one per caller.","During today's call, we'll be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including our financial outlook. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees, and our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements. Our expectations contain many risks and uncertainties. The principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from our current expectations are detailed in our SEC filings.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Roger.","Roger N. Farah","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I hope that those of you who were impacted by Hurricane Sandy over the past few days got through the storm safe and sound. As much as we wanted to report our second quarter and first half results, the safety of our employees was our first priority and that required that we delayed the release until today.","As many of you have had a chance to see the results that we reported this morning, continue to showcase the tremendous resilience of our operating model in the context of the sustained macro headwinds. Revenues of $1.9 billion in the second quarter were modestly below the prior year, primarily due to strategic changes we decided to make in our business, including the store closures associated with our Greater China network repositioning efforts and the discontinuation of American Living. If we exclude the impact of those decisions in addition to the unfavorable foreign exchange effects, revenues increased approximately 3%. It's also important to recognize that the basis of comparison were pretty formidable. We achieved double-digit revenue growth in each of the preceding 2-year periods.","Operating margins expanded 30 basis points to 18.7% in the quarter, reflecting strong improvements at both our wholesale and retail segments. The improved margin structure of our business was primarily a result of a recovery in gross profit margin that was achieved by the combination of lower input costs, thoughtful pricing strategies and operational discipline. While second quarter operating expenses were higher than the prior year, we were able to manage this through our sustained efforts of operational excellence on a global basis.","As you will recall, we originally characterized fiscal '13 as the tale of 2 halves, with operating margin pressure in the first half of the year, followed by operating margin expansion in the second half. And while our year-to-date operating margin performance has been better than we anticipated, expanding modestly, we continue to expect stronger growth in the second half of the year.","Since I know many of you are interested in business trends by region, I'd like to highlight some of our key observations. I would characterize the operating environment as mostly resilient in the Americas, where we are -- we continued to bolster our leadership position in our core men's, women's and children merchandise categories, and where we have successfully partnered with our key customers to secure incremental distribution for emerging categories, particularly handbags, footwear, dresses and Denim & Supply.","In Europe, while our most recent experiences suggest that the trends are stabilizing, it's too soon to become more constructive with our near-term outlook in that region. The southern countries continue to be more challenging than the northern market. We continue to plan our businesses across all channels responsibly, and we will look to chase demand as it materializes. Over the long term, we believe that there is substantial growth of the Ralph Lauren brand throughout Europe, particularly as we focus on our direct consumer development, with new stores and e-commerce growth in the region.","In Asia, the operating environment has been softer than we planned for. Customer traffic to Japanese and South Korean department stores, which is where most of our distribution is currently concentrated, is tracking below the prior year levels. We attribute the drop in traffic to the broader economic malaise that is weighing on consumers and business sentiment throughout the region. Performance at our freestanding stores in Asia is holding up better than our department store location, and we believe those stand-alone stores will become even stronger as we expand the Ralph Lauren store presence throughout the region.","We continue to make excellent progress resetting our Asia presence by upgrading shop locations and merchandising assortments to better align with our global positioning. We opened 7 stores in the region and launched e-commerce in Japan during the second quarter. We plan to open an additional 14 stores there in the back half of the year.","As many of you know, extending our direct-to-customer reach is one of our core strategic growth objectives. I think the real progress we've made with our retail operations over the last 5 years is a testament to the ability to continue to raise the bar and establish new levels of excellence and criteria for success.","We've grown our retail mix to 51% of our consolidated sales in the first half of fiscal '13 from 39% at the end of fiscal '08, and our retail segment operating profitability has expanded to 19% from 11% in the same time period. This progress is a result of the consistent investment along many dimensions, including capital for our new stores, concession shops, enhanced distribution and logistics capability and from launching e-commerce sites and for technology to enhance our in-store experience.","As you saw in this morning's press release, we've made the tough decision to close the Rugby brand. As a result, we'll be closing all 14 stores and rugby.com by the end of fiscal '13. This was not an easy decision to make, considering the hard work of the Rugby team over the few years and the tremendous loyalty of the Rugby core customers. We continue to believe that we can service the millennium Rugby customer with brands such as Denim & Supply and Club Monaco. And we have the opportunity to drive better returns in our vertical retail concepts by focusing our efforts on brands that have a proven global footprint.","Our year-to-date results demonstrate that we are driving improved profitability by focusing our capital and managerial resources on the most compelling long-term opportunities, but the external factors we are contending with and managing day-to-day are real.","The macroeconomic environment is mixed, at best, characterized by slowing trends in Asia, modest growth in the United States and continued uncertainty in Europe. We expect these conditions to persist through the balance of the year.","Notwithstanding the current environment, we are excited about what we believe we can achieve over the next several years. And as Ralph said in this morning's press release, our vision and purpose are clear, and we have the financial strength and the operational excellence to deliver on a global basis.","Before I turn the call over to Jacki, I just want to express how delighted we are to welcome Chris Peterson, our new CFO, to our organization and today's call. As many of you are aware, Chris joined us after a rich 20-year tenure at Procter & Gamble in various financial and operational roles. We believe his wide-ranging, world-class skill set will be an excellent addition to our leadership team, and I know you all will enjoy meeting him soon and working with him in the future.","Jacki?","Jackwyn L. Nemerov","Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. In the fall season, we strengthened our leadership position in our core men's, women's and children's merchandise categories and also continued the strong momentum of our newer dress and accessory businesses.","As you know, the fall season is especially associated with the aesthetic and sensibility of the Ralph Lauren brand. Given the tremendous success of color in the spring and summer season, we incorporated bright into the classic autumn palette, which translated beautifully on the selling floor. Updated silhouettes and strong prints and patterns brought newness and novelty to our apparel and accessory offerings, and the consumer responded favorably. And, of course, fall coincides with the critical back-to-school selling season, where our core programs for boys and girls and our new denim fits and washes for Ralph Lauren Denim & Supply also contributed to our success.","What I think is most impressive about the strong momentum in our core business is that it was achieved on top of already-robust increases over the last 2 years. As you've heard me say before, our leadership and market position start with the quality of our products, beginning with unrivaled design capabilities realized through the highest quality sourcing and manufacturing and showcased for the consumer with the most compelling merchandising initiatives and exceptional in-store and online presentations. This seamless collaboration and execution across all disciplines and departments also contributes to our gross margin performance.","As you saw in this morning's press release, we experienced a very strong increase in our gross profit margin during the second quarter. Most of the increase was achieved as a result of lower cost of goods, primarily a decline in the price of cotton, but strategic and operational elements also contributed to the improvement. More upfront and coordinated efforts between our design and sourcing teams allowed us to achieve more favorable lead times and costing to produce and ship our merchandise.","We also saw improvements in supply chain, where we more effectively leveraged our distribution centers to provide a higher level of customer service to our retail partners, while simultaneously reducing cost. With more direct control of our worldwide distribution, we believe we have the opportunity over the long term to establish larger and more global merchandising initiatives that not only support the incremental gross margin expansion, but also deliver a cohesive and impactful brand message to the consumer.","Additionally, to support the growth of our handbag and footwear businesses, we have strengthened our in-house capabilities in Europe and Asia to more efficiently and effectively develop prototypes and samples. We believe this investment will continue to fuel our innovation in these high-growth categories, and it certainly reflects our commitment to building a powerful accessories business.","Seamless execution has always been a core strength of the Ralph Lauren organization and the excellent work of these teams continue to leverage our world-class best practices and help to support our profit expansion. We expect additional gross profit margin improvement in the second half of fiscal '13 as a result of lower raw material costs, more ready availability of production capacity and ongoing improvements to our global supply chain and logistics processes.","As we begin the holiday season, you all know there is no better gift to give or receive than the gift of Ralph Lauren. The power, equity and aspirational nature of our brand make the holiday selling period historically strong one for us. But we never rest on our laurels. This year, we leveraged the appeal of the brand and the breadth and depth of our product offering across our men's, women's, children's, accessories and home lines to ensure that we stand tall among the many choices before the consumer.","With our strategic partners, we continue the successful approach of a focused holiday merchandising story, built upon distinctive, creative capabilities that our company holds. Our product and marketing messages will be strong and clear across all consumer touch points in-store and online. And this approach, so long associated with the Ralph Lauren brand, has also been extended to the Chaps brand, where we expect it will resonate just as well. Across all families of business, we are well prepared for a powerful selling season.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Chris.","Christopher H. Peterson","Thank you, Jacki, and good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to be speaking with you this morning on my first earnings call as the company's CFO, and I look forward to meeting many of you over the coming months.","As you've seen in this morning's press release, consolidated net revenues were $1.9 billion in the second quarter, 2% below the prior year period and better than the mid-single-digit decrease we anticipated back in August. The decline in net revenues primarily reflects a planned contraction in wholesale shipments that was offset by continued retail segment expansions. Excluding the impact of strategic decisions to discontinue American Living, store closures associated with the company's Greater China repositioning efforts and the net negative impact of foreign currency translation, revenues increased 3% in the second quarter.","Gross profit margin of 58.8% was 220 basis points greater than the prior year, which was slightly better than our expectations. The improvement in gross profit margin is attributable to lower input cost, higher retail segment penetration and operational discipline.","Operating expenses of $747 million were 3% greater than the prior year period, driven by continued investment in our growth initiatives, higher retail channel mix and increased advertising and marketing expenses. Operating expense rate of 40.1% was 190 basis points greater than the prior year but was better than our initial expectations for the quarter, primarily due to the operational discipline of the organization.","Operating income of $348 million was 1% below the prior year period. Operating margin improved 30 basis points to 18.7%, a function of the gross profit and operating expense dynamics I discussed previously. The lower-than-expected operating expense rate accounted for most of the upside to the operating margin outlook we provided in August.","Net income for the second quarter was $214 million, 8% below the prior year period, and net income per diluted share declined 7% to $2.29. The lower net income and net income per diluted share were primarily a result of a higher effective tax rate of 38%. The nearly 500 basis point increase in the second quarter's effective tax rate is attributable to the net negative impact of an approximate $15 million onetime discrete tax item in the quarter.","Regarding our segment highlights for the quarter. Wholesale segment sales of $915 million were 8% below the prior year period as a proactive reduction in shipments to certain European specialty stores and the net negative impact of foreign currency translation more than offset continued growth in core and emerging merchandise categories in the Americas. Comparisons with the prior year were also challenged by the discontinuation of American Living in fiscal 2013 and the global launch of Denim & Supply in the prior year period.","Wholesale operating income of $233 million in the second quarter was 4% below the prior year. Wholesale operating margin increased 120 basis points to 25.5%. The improvement in wholesale operating margin was primarily due to higher gross profit margins as a result of lower input cost and overall operational discipline.","Moving on to the retail segment. Second quarter sales rose 5% to $901 million, supported by a 3% increase in comparable store sales on a reported basis and 5% in constant currency, as well as the contribution from new stores and e-commerce operations. Sales trends were strongest online and at factory stores worldwide, and growth was partially offset by store closures associated with our Greater China network repositioning efforts.","Our 5% constant currency comp growth in the second quarter was achieved on top of challenging multiyear comparisons. Despite lackluster global traffic trends, particularly in the world's gateway cities, comp growth was primarily achieved as a function of stronger conversion, which is a direct reflection of our world-class customer service and clientele-ing [ph] efforts.","Retail segment operating income grew 8% to $157 million in the second quarter, and the retail operating margin increased 60 basis points to 17.4%. The improvement in retail operating income and the expansion in operating margin are primarily due to comparable store sales growth and disciplined operational management that more than offset continued investment in global e-commerce and the impact from our Greater China network repositioning efforts.","Licensing revenue were $47 million in the second quarter, 3% below the prior year, due to the discontinuation of certain American Living and South American licensing arrangements. As a result of lower licensing revenues, operating income for the licensing segment declined 2% to $35 million.","Consolidated inventory was up 7% at the end of the quarter on a reported basis, and we spent approximately $55 million on capital expenditures to support new retail stores, shop installations and infrastructure investments. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion in cash and investments and $832 million in net cash. In the fiscal year-to-date period, we have returned approximately $355 million to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividend payments.","We're pleased with our second quarter results and first quarter -- and first half results, which demonstrate the strong operational discipline of the organization in the context of challenging market conditions. As Roger mentioned earlier, while we exceeded our sales and profit expectations for the first half of the year, we continue to expect fiscal 2013 to play out as a tale of 2 halves, with the second half characterized by stronger year-over-year results.","While it's too early to determine the full impact from Hurricane Sandy, we have tried to make reasonable assumptions based on what we know today. We know that when the storm first hit on Monday, 81 stores, representing about 20% of our directly operated store network, were closed. We also saw some disruption to the e-commerce business as many customers were without electricity. Reopenings have been staggered throughout the week, depending on safety conditions and the availability of electricity. Approximately, a dozen stores remain closed as of this morning.","I do want to knowledge the tremendous achievements of our various corporate and retail store organizations, whose heroic efforts in the face of such adversity has enabled us to chart a course to recovery relatively quickly. At this point, we know we've lost a modest amount of revenues for the third quarter, but there is still some uncertainty with respect to the lingering impact the hurricane might have on future sales trends.","With that as backdrop, I'd like to review the financial outlook we provided in this morning's press release. For the third quarter, we currently expect consolidated net revenues to increase by a low single-digit percentage. Our expectation is based on a mid-single-digit increase in retail segment sales that is partially offset by a low single-digit decline in global wholesale sales.","Included in our consolidated net revenue growth outlook for the quarter is an approximate 400-basis-point net negative impact due to strategic decisions regarding certain operations, including store closures associated with the company's Greater China network repositioning efforts, the discontinuation of American Living and unfavorable foreign currency effects.","Operating margin for the third quarter is expected to be approximately 25 to 75 basis points greater than the prior year period. The anticipated improvement in operating margin is primarily attributable to gross margin improvement that is partially offset by continued investment in the company's long-term strategic initiatives and higher retail channel mix.","We expect the third quarter tax rate to be approximately 29% due to the recent favorable resolution of a discrete tax item.","For the full year fiscal 2013 period, we currently expect revenues to increase by 2% to 3%, which compares to our prior expectation of mid-single-digit growth and includes an approximately 400- to 500-basis-point net negative impact associated with strategic decisions regarding certain operations, including store closures associated with the company's Greater China network repositioning efforts, the discontinuation of American Living and unfavorable foreign currency affects. The moderation in our full year revenue outlook is primarily a result of weaker-than-anticipated store trends throughout Asia, in addition to sustained weakness in tourist travel to major gateway cities in the U.S. and Europe.","The full year operating margin is expected to be approximately 50 basis points greater than last year, which is an improvement relative to our prior expectation of only a modest increase from the prior year's level. We anticipate an improvement in gross profit margin to be partially offset by a higher operating expense margin due to continued investment in the company's long-term strategic initiatives and higher retail channel mix. We continue to estimate the full year tax rate at approximately 33%.","The third quarter and full year fiscal 2013 expectations that I just outlined do not include the estimated $20 million to $30 million in onetime pretax charges associated with the discontinuation of Rugby operations in the back half of the year, when we will close the 14 existing stores and the e-commerce website. We expect to incur approximately 75% of the charges in the third quarter, with the remainder booked in the fiscal fourth quarter.","As Roger alluded to earlier, we remain committed to reinvesting in the business in order to fund the growth initiatives that have supported the company's strong financial results over the last several years. The ability to balance support for long-term growth initiatives with the strong execution of day-to-day core operations has been a critical part of the company's success over the past several years and has also been an important driver of substantial shareholder value creation.","At this point, we'd like to open up the call and take any questions you may have. Operator, can you assist us?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Omar Saad from ISI Group.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Roger, and, Jacki, too, I think, would you guys mind addressing this idea that we're in this -- globally, we might be in this -- consumers might be in this kind of accessories boom as we think about the accessories business versus the apparel business? Obviously, Ralph Lauren is still primarily an apparel-driven company. But especially on the women's side, do you see that happening in your consumer base, this kind of shift away from apparel or to maybe lower-priced apparel in terms of the wallet and spending towards more investment in accessories and footwear and things like that? And is that -- do you think that's having an impact on your business? How do you see that going forward? Do you think it's cyclical or structural? And your efforts around the accessories business as well, how important has that become if that's really what's happening?","Roger N. Farah","Okay, Omar, I'll start and then I'll let Jacki continue. I think it's pretty common knowledge that the concept of accessories, broadly defined, has been an important growth category for the industry now for a while. And whether that's accessories at luxury prices or what's called affordable luxury or even at more moderate prices, I think the accessory category has clearly outperformed apparel and, specifically, women's apparel for a while now. I think in defining accessories, you've got to open it up to a range of products that include handbags, small leather goods, but clearly, footwear has been a strong category for the last couple of years. Watches, eyewear and, even more broadly, I think cosmetics. So with that, I think a female customer can express herself, freshen her wardrobe and accessories has fulfilled that. Interestingly enough, it's not dissimilar to the way Europe evolved over time, where a customer was more willing to buy a handful of high-quality investment pieces in apparel and then used accessories to keep them fresh. I think the other part of accessories that you all understand is that for emerging markets with new wealth, accessories, and particularly signature accessories, are a way of people showing their success, and they're arriving more easily than apparel. So whether that's been the Middle East, whether that's been Russia or whether that's now Asia, specifically China, I think the customer who's finding wealth is expressing themselves through either signature or easily identifiable high-end product. The mix of our business at Ralph Lauren, I think, uniquely includes all product categories. So we're seeing business from that customer in apparel, be it men's or women's, or even the extraordinary success of our kids' business, because I think customers, as they acquire spending capabilities, are spending it on their children, particularly in countries that have limited birthrates. So interestingly enough, you have parents and grandparents all focused on 1 child, that tends to drive up their willingness to spend on apparel as well. I think our accessory businesses are in early stages. We've taken back many of the key licenses over the last 5 or 6 years. We've developed sourcing capabilities. We think the Ralph Lauren aesthetic translates beautifully into accessories and where we have partnerships or licensing relationships with Luxottica or partnerships with Richemont or L'Oreal, I think we're with world-class, best-in-class partners. So I'm very pleased with where we stand and where we're going. One of the interesting realities of our results to date, both the extraordinary margin in wholesale and the extraordinary margin we now operate in retail, is without high penetrations of accessories, which, properly executed, brings with it higher profit margins. So I think we're making good progress. I think we're making quality progress. I don't think we're looking to jam this business artificially in the early stages. And my guess is over the long term, it's going to be a very big part of what we do, and that will be more prevalent in Asia and some of the emerging markets than perhaps some of the more mature markets. But I don't want to back off the apparel business. I think we're very pleased with the way we've got our market share and our positioning in all the key apparel categories. Long answer, but it was a long question, Omar, so.","Operator","We'll go next to Michael Binetti from UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just one modeling question, and then I have a follow-up. Just the -- I think -- I thought you said last quarter that the 3 items that you mentioned as onetime was the China store closures, FX and American Living, would be a little bit higher in this quarter, about a 700- or 800-basis-point drag to revenues. It looks like they're only about 500. I just want to see if any of that was pushed back, I mean, in the back half, or if there was any other change that I might have missed. And then -- but more importantly, Roger, as you think about all the work that you've done with the company to establish Ralph Lauren as a luxury business over the last few years, obviously, the more mainstream brands, like the Polo brand, are a huge input to the profit story for the company globally. Do you think there's an opportunity to, I guess, even boost the focus on that side of the business over the next year and refocus on some of those big profit drivers now that you're more -- I guess, more established as a luxury player?","Christopher H. Peterson","Michael, on the modeling question, I'll address that and then turn it over to Roger. The real difference between the 3 items, the 700 to 800 basis points in the guidance and what we reported was FX, which strengthened a little bit from when we gave guidance last time. So that accounted for the difference. FX was just better than we expected when we gave guidance previously.","Roger N. Farah","Yes. The known effects of the store closures and American Living are very clear, so it's really just the movement of the FX, as Chris said. Michael, I think your question is spot on. And I think we, as a company, feel that the core brands or the brands such as Polo have enormous legs on a global basis. And one of the internal discussions we're having at the very moment is how to make sure we're properly focused to capture the extraordinary appeal of some of those brands. And while we don't want to back off the incremental luxury positioning, either in retail or product developments that Jacki has alluded to, absolutely, brands such as Polo and others are bedrock for us. And we're looking at how to accelerate their position and growth now, whether it's distribution ideas or marketing and branding ideas. So I think you'll hear more to come in the next couple of quarters about strategies we hope to employ to focus on those.","Operator","We'll go next to Liz Dunn from Macquarie Capital.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","My question is for Chris. What are your initial impressions of some of the opportunities there are to sort of evolve the CFO role? And I was wondering if there's any change in the scope of the role or the reporting responsibilities versus what was in place previously.","Christopher H. Peterson","Yes. I guess I'd -- I'll start by just giving you a little bit about why I chose to come to Ralph Lauren and my initial impressions after being here for 6 weeks, which are really the same. First, I was very impressed with the iconic nature of the brand and its equity, including the ability to stretch across both price tiers and merchandise categories. The second thing that I was impressed with was the management team. I think the company has a very strong senior management team and one that I'm excited to be joining. And then, third, I would say is I think the company has significant growth opportunities, both in terms of international penetration, as well as new merchandising categories, such as accessories and footwear. In terms of the specific question on the role, the scope of the role is very similar to the scope previously that Tracey had, and the reporting relationship remains the same. I report to Roger.","Roger N. Farah","Liz, are you implying you want Chris to report to somebody else?","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","No. I was asking about any changes in reporting up to the CFO.","Christopher H. Peterson","I'm sorry. So no, there's no changes with regard to who reports up to the CFO.","Roger N. Farah","Yes, I think I would answer that. Chris has been very impressive in 6 weeks. And I don't want to put pressure on him, but he's really a fast study and has made his presence felt. We're obviously in the early stages of thinking about next year's planning process, and Chris will really lead that. He's also going to be taking a world trip, starting next week. That will take him from Europe through all the key points in Asia and back to the U.S., sometime right before Thanksgiving. So I think Chris is going to be a very active participant with the business units, with the corporate finance people. And his impact, I believe, as a business partner to the IT function, which is critical to the future of the next part of our growth, will be felt very quickly. So no pressure, Chris. But he's off to a good start.","Operator","We'll go next to David Glick from Buckingham Research Group.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Chris, just a quick modeling question and a follow-up with Roger. What's the comp assumption embedded in that mid-single-digit increase in Q3? And then, Roger, can you update us on what's going on in the pace of store openings in China? I believe you said you're going to open 15 stores in the second half of this fiscal year. If you could give us a sense, is that still on track and how you anticipate that rolling out over the next couple of years, and also kind of the size of the stores that you're anticipating, so we can try to put some rough numbers around what these stores can produce.","Christopher H. Peterson","Okay. I guess, on the modeling question, I think we want to stay, from a guidance standpoint, on an all-in basis. So I think we're not going to go to providing the comp guidance at the retail segment. We expect mid-single-digit growth and overall revenues for the retail segment as we reported in the press release.","Roger N. Farah","Yes. I think one of the things to keep in mind is that we'll be winding down against the China repositioning in third and fourth quarter, when the bulk of the stores were closed. And clearly, the wind down of Rugby over the balance of this year will be sales drags. But we're actually seeing the business opportunity in the back half of the year against softer comps as more robust. The pace of opening in Asia is -- our original annual target was 20 stores. We've opened 7 to date, so we have 13 in the back half. That may move around by 1 or 2, depending on a variety of situations. Our strategy there is not dissimilar from Europe or the United States. We are looking for key flagship hubs in the major markets, and then we'll network around them with smaller footprints from 5,000 to 9,000 feet that will primarily be located in malls, because the markets in China are really involving into mall-based shopping experiences. The flagship opportunities are harder to come by. We have a couple in discussion. So the bulk of the 20 stores, at the moment for this year, are primarily in the 5,000- to 10,000-foot range, a combination of men's and women's luxury stores, as well as a few children's stores and a couple men's only and a couple women's only. So we should have a good read on how that first 20 stores is being reacted to by the customer by the middle of the spring, and I think that will be a good time for us to get sufficient customer feedback to make sure we're on the right path.","Operator","We'll go next to Erinn Murphy from Piper Jaffray.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I was just hoping both, Roger and Jacki, maybe you could just elaborate a little bit more on some of the prepared remarks you made on the global merchandising initiatives. Can you just speak more about what the process is, what the benefit maybe? And then how are you thinking about global queue [ph] density in that context? And then just a quick clarification, Roger, for you. You mentioned, at the very beginning of the script, talking about seeing some stabilization in Europe. Could you maybe just parse that a little bit more by region, kind of what you are seeing there? That would be very helpful.","Jackwyn L. Nemerov","So, Erinn, what we're really focused on is transitioning our company from a more U.S.-centric company to a global company. And what we recognize certainly is that all of our critical regional components have very important voices as to how we succeed in the future as a global company. In order to accomplish that, we have reestablished our merchandising divisions to support those global roles with key personnel involved from every regional area. So as we make our decisions, we're making them as worldwide decisions rather than U.S.-centric decisions that have bolted-on European or Asian influences. And what we are finding is that the world is, primarily, 80% the same, but those 20% variations are very important to capture the voice of our international customer. We certainly know that customer is traveling around the world. We want our footprint to look the same, but yet, there are regional nuances that we believe are very important to state in each market. And that's our approach. In doing that, we have also seen some efficiencies that have come out of that structure and regarding SKU efficiencies and being able to have more impressive quantities behind each style decision. So all in all, while we are in this for approximately a year at this point, we still believe we're in early stages, but we're very encouraged with what we see as the outcome.","Roger N. Farah","Yes. Let me try the Europe question. Second quarter for us was a little better than first quarter in Europe, although the general statement I made, which is the northern markets are better than the southern markets, continue. In our definition of Europe, we also include the Middle East and Russia. So those 2 markets have continued to be strong, have continued to perform well, whether in their home markets or whether those customers are traveling to Europe. So that's a particular bright spot. And almost like a heat map from the Scandinavian markets moving down, the strength of the business there has continued. I think what has occurred in some of the southern markets is this -- less panic perhaps over Italy and Spain. And I'm discounting the disruption in Greece because it's a relatively minor part of our business. But I think there's a sense that those markets, while difficult, there is a pathway for recovery. And so while those markets continue to be softer than others, I think we're beginning to see the customer breathing again and being willing to function. They're very different markets. Italy is almost entirely specialty store driven, and Spain is dominated by big department stores. So the specialty store market in Italy is still being run by small mom-and-pops and is more cautious in their forward purchasing. They don't really want to buy new product until they've sold the existing product. And so we've been cautious about what we're willing to sell into that market in an effort to be responsive to their situation, also to be mindful of we want to get paid. So with that, we continue to operate cautiously, but we are seeing a bit of a comfort with the customer as financial decisions are being made that give some backstop to the consequences of the euro. So we'll see. I think the holiday season will be particularly important. We still don't have large penetrations of Chinese tourists as other brands do, and they are reporting much of their either growth or results are underpinned by 25%, 30% or 40% Chinese tourists. Our Chinese tourist penetration in Europe is still less than 2%, and I don't think it will get larger until we're better represented in China. So they know our brand, they understand our brand. And then when they travel, they'll look for our brands in capital cities. So that's still to come in the years ahead.","Operator","We'll go next to John Kernan from Cowen.","John D. Kernan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So I wanted to ask a little bit longer-term, thematic-type question. The theme of you guys taking direct control of your brand and the profitability impact that, that has, the retail operating margin has obviously been on a tremendous upward trajectory, essentially, since 2010. And with all the emerging category expansion, the e-commerce growth and the eventual China expansion, can the profitability of this business reach similar levels to what the wholesale side of the business generates now, looking multiyears out? And then, keeping on that directly-controlled theme of your brand, the Chaps license, what your plans are for potentially directly operating that business, too?","Roger N. Farah","All right, John. I'm going to start with the thematic question, and I'm going to let Chris answer the specific one. We have extraordinary wholesale margins. There aren't any people I know about, who are primarily apparel driven, that run margins in the 25% range. And I think that it's unrealistic to believe that we will get there in retail without a meaningful mix of accessories, which should come with higher margins over time. So the real sign of that possibility will be determined by our ability to create store layouts that are productive with high allocations to accessories while still giving quality representation to our apparel. I think the kind of high-teens margins we're running in retail now, primarily in luxury apparel, is pretty astronomical. So I think it's going to be driven off a mix change and regional development. Because as I said before, I believe long term, the regional opportunities for retail in Asia should be high-profit contributors. And I think the fact that we've taken back these geographic territories or product categories and been able to manage them is embedded in why we've done so well over the last 5 or 10 years in good times or bad. And, Chris, do you want to try the Chaps question?","Christopher H. Peterson","Yes, I'll try the Chaps question. So I think as most of you know, we have a license agreement with Warnaco for the men's sportswear business for Chaps. That license agreement has a change of control provision in it that gives us the option to take back the business in the event of a change of control of Warnaco. Given how recent the news is, we haven't made a decision at this point. But we are in the process of evaluating options with regard to that business, and we'll provide an update in due course once we get through that process.","Operator","We'll go next to Barbara Wyckoff from CLSA.","Barbara Wyckoff - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","My question is on Denim & Supply. What do you see as the successes and challenges when you're in -- can you talk about domestic versus international? And then as part of this, how many doors do you have by region, wholesale plus owned stores?","Jackwyn L. Nemerov","Well, we're very pleased with the initial response over our first year in Denim & Supply. As you know, this is our second fall season. And as you develop a brand, because of the cadence of purchase and sales, you literally can't make any changes and tweak a brand for the first 9 months or so. So following our initial launch with what we thought were positive results and what we thought would be things that we needed to change, one of the biggest standouts to us was how positive the jeans business is as we presented Denim & Supply as a lifestyle brand. So we are working diligently now having identified what those key products are, and now we're putting in a BFR programs in both men's and women's in our core Denim to be able to drive that opportunity to be a minimum of 30% of the business; highly successful and highly predictable. The attitude of the brand, driven by the gritty nature and unusual presentation in our marketing context, both in print and online, has been extremely successful. We partnered with Avicii, and he has created a very interesting draw for the brand. He is a highly successful entertainer, and he has really created tremendous crowd draw to this brand and to its success. We've had a very positive fall season. And while we continue to tweak a little more of this and a little less of that, we're very optimistic. As you know, the brand in the U.S. is exclusively in Macy's. That will be rolling out to additional 100 doors starting next fall, and to Hudson Bay in Canada, where we're also experiencing some very positive results. And at this point, we've confined the brand to those 2 key customers. As I said, we're very optimistic on our position for the millennial customer, which is a high focus area for our department store customers, and one that we believe will be, with this Denim & Supply brand, a strong reach towards that customer and driving additional opportunities into our department stores. We also have launched our Denim & Supply brand internationally, beginning with freestanding stores in both Asia and in Europe, and those also have performed extremely well. In that environment, instead of having men's separate from women's, which is sort of the requirement of the nature of a department store, there, we're able to merchandise the brand together and with a very exciting impact, where the consumer really, it's the place to be. So the customer is shopping with significant other in the store and it has a tremendous pulse and a great result. And as I said, we're very pleased with where the first few stores are at this point, and I think we have plans for many stores to follow.","Operator","We'll take our last question from Robby Ohmes from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Two very quick questions. Roger, I wanted to ask you, actually, on Rugby as a follow-up. You mentioned, I think, in your comments that it was a tough decision. Is there anything you can tell us just -- was there a strategic decision behind that? Or what pushed you over the edge? And is it a commentary on how you see smaller brands out there or brands that are too U.S.-centric, maybe just your thoughts on that? And then just a quick follow-up for Jacki would be could you maybe give us a little more detail on the approach in North America for holiday this year versus last year, in terms of where you see pushing by channel and inventory investment versus last year?","Roger N. Farah","Okay, Robbie. It was a tough decision because we've put a lot of time, energy and money into this brand over a number of years, and I think that comes with a lot of heart and a lot of personal effort by a lot of people in the company. Our decision, at this point, was really based on our desire to focus on opportunities that we have in front of us. And I think Michael talked about this a little earlier in terms of Polo and some of the other brands. I think our conclusion was to take our energies and our resources and apply them against existing brands that have a global footprint as opposed to the ongoing efforts to build something from scratch. I think to build a brand from scratch organically, in a brick-and-mortal retail environment, takes a lot of time and money and energy. And I think the company's decision really just reflects the numerous choices we have to expand some of our other initiatives, one of which Jacki talked about, Denim & Supply, or Polo, or children's, or even at RRL. And I think in the past, many of you have talked to us about focus and are we focusing on the right issues. And I think in our decision making, it was relative weights of opportunities and the expected returns we anticipate getting. So that was all part of our decision. The second part of your question, I think, is directed to Jacki?","Jackwyn L. Nemerov","Yes, on our approach to holiday. So in our retail stores, where sort of our thoughts start, we had a very crisp approach to a very strong and bright statement in our holiday accessory business. It's what do you want to buy for yourself and what do you want to buy as a gift. So that starts off our first question to ourselves. And I think we've put together a very exciting presentation of product that begins to roll out into the stores, this -- between November and, of course, early December, that speaks to that. That is -- that story is really supported by a fabulous holiday mailer, which speaks directly to our VIP clientele for our Ralph Lauren stores. Our holiday approach in department stores is a very crisp and very direct approach to what we want that customer to buy. So we're crystal clear when we determine what we want to set it up -- set up, how many colors do we want to set up, where does it sit on the floor, how do we speak to the customer with that specific item. We try to create a lot of ease of shopping and, at the same time, a lot of excitement as to what we're presenting. We back that up with all of our strategic partners with critical marketing that speaks both in-store and online to those special items and those key purchases for the holiday season. And I think we've put together an extremely appealing assortment as we enter into this critical holiday period. We're armed and dangerous.","Roger N. Farah","Okay. With that, I would just like to, again, reinforce my thanks for the hard work that everybody within our corporation has extended to those affected by this unfortunate hurricane. I'd also like to, again, welcome Chris and know that as he and Jim plan the next couple of months of a listening tour, I think you'll all get to know him and enjoy him as much as we have already.","And with that, I hope you and your families are safe and warm and dry.

Welcome to the Ralph Lauren First Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions on how to ask a question will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mrs. Evren Kopelman. Please go ahead.","Evren Kopelman - Head-Investor Relations","Good morning, and thank you for joining Ralph Lauren's First Quarter Fiscal 2017 Conference Call. With me today are Stefan Larsson, the company's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Madore, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions, which we ask that you limit to one per caller.","During today's call, we will be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including our financial outlook. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees and our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Our expectations contain many risks and uncertainties. Principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from our current expectations are detailed in our SEC filing.","To find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our financial results, you should refer to this morning's earnings release and to our SEC filing that could be found in our Investor Relations website.","And now I will turn the call over to Stefan.","Stefan Larsson - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Evren, and good morning, everyone. We last spoke at our Investor Day in early June where we shared with you the details of our Way Forward Plan. The Way Forward Plan is our multi-year plan to build on the unique brand strength we have, go back to the core of what made us iconic, evolve from that core and build the business back to sustainable profitable growth.","Today, I will share my key takeaways from the first quarter and then provide a brief update on what we have achieved and learned so far in starting to drive the execution of our Way Forward Plan. Then I will turn it over to Bob to review the company's quarterly financial performance in more detail.","Beginning with the quarter, performance was mostly in line with our expectations with some minor puts and takes, as we would expect at this early stage of the execution of our Way Forward Plan. On the revenue side, the domestic business, as expected, continued to be challenged while the international business delivered a strong quarter, posting 10% revenue growth year-over-year.","The main drivers to the decline in North America are what we shared in detail during the Investor Day. A combination of not having evolved our consumer offering enough in product, marketing, shopping experience, and having had an operating model that has generated too much excess inventory. Having these self-induced challenges are hurting us when we, like everyone else, are facing difficult retail traffic trends in a highly promotional environment.","In our international markets, even though we have a much smaller presence there than in North America and we globally have much improvement work to do ahead of us, there were valuable learnings in the quarter that we will use in building back strength in our domestic business. Let me give you a few examples.","In Asia, over the last six months, we have acted aggressively to drive quality of sales up. Our team there proactively closed 43 brand weakening locations, reduced the length of the sale period by an average of 30% and significantly decreased the depth of markdown rates. We have seen some very encouraging results.","Our average unit retail prices and our gross profit dollars were both up significantly. Simultaneously, the team has continued to drive high quality expansion. In Europe, as expected, this quarter benefited from a shift in timing of wholesale shipments. However, the underlying business was also solid and our team has driven several successful quality of sale initiatives. They have been able to reduce buys for this year in a way that has protected full price selling, increased the stock turnover and if the current trend continues, will significantly reduce excess inventory at the end of the season.","As a part of executing the Way Forward Plan, you will see us increasingly focus on proactively driving quality of sales up. These initiatives will include pulling back on inventory receipts, cutting lead times, strengthening our assortment and store closures. These will be some of the most important drivers in getting us back to sustainable profitable growth.","Speaking of profitability, in the first quarter, operating margin was better than our guidance, however, this was driven by one time benefits that Bob will take you through in detail. Excluding this impact, the quarter was in line with our expectations.","Now let me give you an update on our progress on the execution of the Way Forward Plan. As you recall from Investor Day, the Way Forward Plan is built up of a consumer facing part where we are going refocus on and evolve from the core in product, marketing and the shopping experience. And the second part that is about evolving the operating model where we are developing four business engines: a systematic repeatable way of building a stronger assortment, a demand-driven supply chain, a best in class sourcing, and a multi-channel global expansion strategy. Underlying both of these two parts is the foundational strengthening of the leadership team and culture, as well as developing a strong economic model.","Let me start by sharing how we have strengthened the foundation, starting with the leadership team. Jane Nielsen, our new Chief Financial Officer will be starting right after Labor Day. I can't tell you how excited I am to soon have Jane here on the ground working next to me. Jane has the knowledge and experience to support us with driving a very strong execution.","Jeff Kuster, our new Group President for the Americas, has been on the ground for a month. He has already met several of our biggest customers and started the work, together with his team, to build a value-creating plan that will get us back to high performance in North America.","Halide Alag\u00f6z, our new Head of Global Sourcing, who started in early June, has already had a positive effect on the sourcing decisions we are making. She's working very closely with her team to build a best-in-class sourcing capability.","Bill Campbell, our new Head of Global Supply Chain and Inventory Management, will be leaving Amazon shortly and joining us in early October.","Finally, Fredrik Hjalmers, our Head of Global Expansion, started in June and has begun the work with his team to build out a global multi-brand and multi-channel expansion plan.","Moving to the progress we have made in strengthening the organization. We already completed the planned right-sizing of our head count by decreasing it with 8% and reduced layers from an average of nine to six, increasing each leader's span of control. The biggest positive effect of this is that we have become leaner, faster, we'll empower the doers and reclaim the entrepreneurial culture. In addition, it drives an SG&A saving of approximately $115 million on an annualized basis already this year.","Completing the planned right-sizing of the organization has given us a good start in fixing the overall cost structure and developing a disciplined financial model. We are also underway with closing the under-performing stores we identified as part of the Way Forward Plan. In the first quarter, we closed eight of the 50-plus total stores under consideration. We're also on track to getting the other targeted SG&A cost savings out during the remainder of the year.","Let me now move to the consumer facing part of the Way Forward Plan and share some highlights that we are driving there. For the last few months, Valerie Hermann and the other brand presidents have been intensely centered on refocusing our core product offering and evolving from that core. And in doing that, we have not only been able to improve our classic iconic styles, but we have also been able to start cutting the long tail of unproductive styles. So far, we have been able to partially impact what we bought for spring 2017 with a double-digit percentage reduction in the number of SKUs across our biggest brands. The bigger impact in both evolving the product core and cutting more of the long tail will be seen for fall 2017 when we will be able to not just reduce what we buy, but also what we develop.","As we discussed in June, a big value-driver that is connected to evolving our products and assortment is developing best-in-class sourcing. Just a few weeks after Halide started as our head of sourcing, she and I held a very important meeting in Asia with our key strategic suppliers where we solicited their support in driving increased quality, decreased cost and increased flexibility and speed in our sourcing. We received a very strong response from many of our suppliers and together with them, we have already started to make measurable improvements in driving quality up, costs down on comparable products and decreasing our time to market.","We are also full speed ahead with shortening our lead times from 15 to nine months, and even though the full effect will not be seen for a few seasons, we will be 50% there already by the end of this year. Next year, we should be 90% of the way there.","Almost equally important to cutting the overall lead times down is the work we are doing in building an eight-week test and rapid response pipeline. For this year we're just starting and by next fall we will have the capability that will enable testing on most of the new product ideas before introduction. The work of developing a demand driven supply chain has just started.","Even though Bill Campbell is not starting until October, we have already adjusted our inventory levels down to better match demand and decreased excess inventory that drove excess markdowns and cannibalization. Overall inventory levels are projected to go down for the remainder of the year.","In parallel to driving the execution of the Way Forward Plan, there were several important examples recently that demonstrated how we're building strength in the business from a position of unique and iconic brand strength. One of those proud moments was our presence at Wimbledon earlier this summer and another was the Olympic ceremony this last Friday where we could see team U.S.A. walk into the stadium demonstrating the strength of American iconic style. We are so proud to be able to partner up with and support the U.S. Olympic team.","In conclusion, even though it's early days in the execution of our Way Forward Plan, this is a multiyear journey and we are now one quarter in, just in the beginning of the execution phase. I'm very pleased with the progress we are making. We have guided this year as a reset and stabilize year and that is what we're delivering on. We will continue to balance meeting our near term commitments with staying on track to execute our long-term Way Forward Plan.","As I noted, we have made progress in a number of areas from strengthening the leadership team to starting to improve the product and assortment building, starting to cut the lead times and improving our sourcing, to the execution in the regions and the cost initiatives. I'm excited to see our teams taking on the challenges head on and we believe the company is again moving in the right direction.","And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob.","Robert L. Madore - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Senior Vice President","Thank you, Stefan, and good morning, everyone. First quarter net revenues of $1.6 billion were down 4% compared to the prior-year period on both the reported and constant currency basis. This is in line with the guidance we provided this past June of a mid-single-digit revenue decline. Foreign currency translation did not have a material impact on revenue growth in the first quarter.","On adjusted basis, gross profit margin was 61.1% in the first quarter excluding noncash inventory related charges of $54 million associated with our restructuring activities. This was 130 basis points above the prior-year period primarily reflecting favorable sales mix shift, lower product costs, and an improvement in Asia driven by initiatives to improve quality sale metrics.","Operating expenses on an adjusted basis were $821 million excluding $105 million in restructuring and other related charges. These expenses were down only 1% to last year as our head count reduction in other expense initiatives under the Way Forward Plan had limited benefit in the first quarter due to the timing of these activities.","Adjusted operating margin in the first quarter was 8.2% excluding $159 million in restructuring and other related charges. This was 60 basis points below last year due to fixed expense deleverage on lower net revenues, and partially offset by higher gross margin.","The adjusted operating margin performance was better than the outlook we provided in June of a 110 basis point to 160 basis point decline, driven by more favorable impact of our inventory management initiatives, specifically lower inventory reserves due to restructuring related inventory charges as well as product mix. The product mix shift was significant in Europe, and was driven by a higher level of summer product within the wholesale shipments and a higher level of made for factory product in factory stores due to less excess inventory.","Adjusted net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 was $90 million or $1.06 per diluted share excluding restructuring and other related charges. On a reported basis, net loss in the first quarter was $22 million or a loss of $0.27 per diluted share. The effective tax rate was 29% in the first quarter, on an adjusted basis, compared to an effective tax rate of 30% in the prior-year period.","Moving on to segment performance, wholesale revenues decreased 5% on both reported and constant currency in the first quarter to $607 million. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in North America, as the U.S. department store channel continued to experience challenging traffic trends. This was partially offset by wholesale revenue growth in Europe, primarily driven by a benefit from timing of shipments relative to last year in addition to proactive measures taken to clear inventory. Adjusted wholesale operating margin in the first quarter was 23.7% excluding restructuring and other related charges. This was 190 basis points above the prior-year period driven by a higher gross margin.","Retail segment sales decreased 3% in both reported and constant currency in the first quarter to $907 million. The sales decline was driven by a comparable store sales decline that was partially offset by non-comparable store sales growth. Consolidated comparable store sales decreased 7% in constant currency and 6% as reported during the first quarter, primarily driven by lower traffic trends during the quarter in a challenging macro environment in most regions.","Global e-commerce revenues declined 6% during the quarter on a reported basis, primarily due to the company's pricing harmonization and other quality of sale initiatives. At the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2017 we had 485 directly operated standalone stores and 598 concessions globally. Compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2016, the company had 18 net new directly operated stores and 40 net new concessions shops at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2017. In addition, our international licensing partners operated 96 Ralph Lauren stores and 17 dedicated shops, as well as 60 Club Monaco stores and 74 Club Monaco concession shops at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2017.","Retail operating margin in the first quarter excluding restructuring and other related charges was 13.8%, which was 120 basis points above the prior-year period due to a higher gross margin. Licensing revenues decreased 8% in both reported and constant currency, impacted by timing of shipments during the quarter. Licensing segment operating income down 7% in the first quarter compared with the prior-year period.","Now I'd like to provide some color on our performance by geography in the first quarter. In the Americas net revenue declined 11% as we continued to see pressure in the U.S. department store channel. Same-store sales were down high-single digits in North America in the first quarter driven by traffic challenges. In Europe net revenues increased 14% on a reported basis and grew 15% in constant currency. This growth was mostly driven by a benefit from timing of shipments relative to last year. Excluding this shift, the underlying trend was solid in the quarter. Going forward we note that the potential impact of Brexit on consumer spending and geopolitical volatility in the region are increasing uncertainty in this market.","In Asia net revenues increased 3% on a reported basis and were flat with the prior-year period in constant currency. We experienced continued growth in Japan and Australia. Same-store sales growth was negatively impacted by our ongoing strategy to improve our quality of sale metrics in the region. We continue to experience gross margin improvement and average unit retails were up significantly while markdown rates were down significantly.","Now let me provide you with an update on our restructuring activities related to the Way Forward Plan. The company continues to expect restructuring activities to result in approximately $180 million to $220 million of annualized expense savings related to its initiatives to streamline the organizational structure and right size its cost structure and real estate portfolio.","We continue to expect restructuring charges of up to $400 million as a result of the fiscal 2017 restructuring activities and up to $150 million inventory charge associated with the company's Way Forward Plan. These charges are expected to be substantially realized by the end of fiscal 2017. In the first quarter of fiscal 2017 the company recorded $104 million in restructuring and related impairment charges and $50 million in inventory charges.","Now moving on to the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory was $1.2 billion at the end of the first quarter, down 2% year over year. The company expects inventory quality to continue to improve on the balance sheet, as inventory clearance activities continue.","Moving to capital expenditures, we spent $78 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to $68 million in the prior-year period mostly to support our retail store network, concession shops and infrastructure projects.","During the first quarter the company paid approximately $100 million related to repurchase of its Class A common stock. At the end of the quarter approximately $200 million remained available for future share repurchases. We ended the year with approximately $1.2 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet and $692 million of total debt.","Now I'd like to turn to guidance for fiscal 2017. As a reminder, this guidance excludes restructuring, impairment and inventory related charges in connection with the company's Way Forward Plan. For fiscal 2017 the company continues to expect consolidated net revenues to decrease at a low double-digit rate due to a proactive pullback in inventory receipts, store closures, pricing harmonization and other quality of sales initiatives combined the weak retail traffic and a highly promotional environment in the U.S.","Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency will have minimal impact on revenue growth in fiscal 2017. The company continues to expect operating margin for fiscal 2017 to be approximately 10%, as cost savings are expected to be offset by growth in new store expenses, unfavorable foreign currency impacts, infrastructure investments and fixed expense deleverage. The fiscal 2017 tax rate is estimated to be approximately 29%.","For the second quarter of fiscal 2017 the company expects consolidated net revenues to be down mid to high-single digits on a reported basis. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency will have minimal impact on revenue growth in the second quarter.","Operating margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 is expected to be 200 basis points to 250 basis points below the comparable prior-year period. Initiatives under the Way Forward Plan are expected to have a greater impact in the second half of the fiscal year than the second quarter. Second quarter tax rate is estimated at 29%.","With that, we'll open up the call for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The first question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Good morning. Thanks for the update. I guess my question I want to ask \u2013 maybe for a little bit more information and insight on what you learned in Asia as you kind of improved the quality of sales there. It is a different market in terms of it is a lot more owned retail or concession model, you don't have that kind of big wholesale piece. Trying to understand \u2013 I also think the brand maybe is a little bit \u2013 the architecture is a little bit simpler in Asia. Maybe help us understand what is the difference between the Asian market, what you are learning there, and maybe what we can expect in North America, which is \u2013 because of the omni-channel wholesale brand architecture might be a different path towards elevating the quality of sales. Thanks.","Robert L. Madore - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Senior Vice President","Yeah, thank you, Omar. The biggest changes that we've made to support and strengthen the quality of sale that we're seeing in Asia is to really significantly cut back on our promotional stance two different ways. One, significantly shortening the length of promotion. And two, just the depth of the discounting and the markdown. And what we've seen is overall from a quality of sale perspective, whether it's looking at discount rate, which has decreased significantly. We've seen a very significant increase in average unit retail. And although we've seen a more moderate decrease in UPTs, overall it's driving a stronger average transaction value for us. That's been the biggest change and the biggest benefit that we've seen from that.","Stefan Larsson - President and Chief Executive Officer","When it comes to Jeff Kuster, who just started, as I mentioned in my opening remark, he is starting with an assessment of the challenge in North America and diagnosing that in detail so we get a facts based view on what we are up against. And then we are pivoting to building a plan to increase quality of sales in North America.","So differences there, Omar, coming back to your question, there are definitely differences in Asia and North America based on channel differences as being one big difference. But it comes back to how we plan the inventory, how we buy the inventory to demand, how our promotional strategy, our promotional execution and how that plays across channels. That's why the fact based diagnosis is so important.","Jeff just started three, four weeks ago and he is underway with the team and will work with the different channels and that's where we're going to add the most value in this analysis, and coming back, that's what gives me the most confidence when it comes to a plan to increase quality of sales. But we are doing this for the first time cross-channel and we're going to do it together with our biggest customers as well. So we are looking forward to come back and provide our insights when we get them.","Robert L. Madore - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Senior Vice President","I mean, one other thing, Omar, related to the Asia quality of sale improvement. We've also done an in-depth analysis of points of distribution and we reduced approximately 48 points of distribution in Asia this quarter that we felt really didn't properly represent the brand but at the same time we also identified a number of additional points of distribution. So, for an example, in our wholesale channel, which is a relatively small business in Asia, but we saw in the quarter a 48% increase in the number of shops in our wholesale channel, too. So it's both cutting back on promotions, whether it's depth, length, but then also making sure that we're in the correct points of distribution for the brands.","Evren Kopelman - Head-Investor Relations","Next question, please.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Kate McShane with Citi Research.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Thanks for the update on the supply chain efforts. I just wondered if you could maybe walk through some of the mechanics of how you are reducing the supply-chain lead time, especially in light of your commentary today about the 50% reduction in lead time this year and 90% by next year.","Stefan Larsson - President and Chief Executive Officer","Let's see. Yes. It's not a 50% and 90% reduction of lead time. We're moving \u2013 it's a 50% \u2013 we're going be 50% on a nine-month lead time by the end of this year and we're going be 90% on a nine-month lead time by next year.","As I mentioned on the Investor Day, the biggest change here is a cultural change and it's a change of how we work as a team. So instead of working in a sequential way where you hand over function by function and by that you build in slack in the lead times and you extend the lead times, we are working together cross functionally. So, one thing that has really excited me over the first couple of months digging into the Way Forward execution with the team is to break down the silos, to have design, merchandising, sourcing, sales distribution channel at the table from the first design idea all the way in to selling the actual product. And just by that, we cut a lot of time from the lead times.","And then it's about going and mapping through and Halide Alag\u00f6z is leading that work. She's mapping every single component of the current lead times and looking at how is every component and every day and hour spent adding value to driving brand strength and profitable sales growth and driving a stronger assortment. And I can say that I'm very encouraged by the facts that we are digging up, that we will be 90% on a nine-month lead time by the end of next year.","Parallel to that is going be the eight-week test of rapid response pipeline because that's going be a big enabler as well that in a very short period of time we're going to be able to test any and every new big product idea before we go big. And rapid response part of that is to say when we sell something and we see a bigger demand than expected, we will be able to much faster chase back into those products.","Evren Kopelman - Head-Investor Relations","Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Nice quarter. Just one near-term I guess modeling question to help us think about the year, then maybe just a longer-term question. On the model could you help us think about the planned cost-saving split between SG&A and cost of goods sold as we look at both the second quarter and the second half?","I guess I thought \u2013 I guess we had a little bit upside down in our model. I thought some of the cost reductions you had already taken would have meant more SG&A leverage this quarter, maybe not as much cost of goods. And then longer-term, as you guys laid out the plan for the next four years at the Analyst Day you referred to as 2018 as revenue stabilizing. And as we look at it with the guidance you gave today we were able to do a little bit of math around the year. And we can see that the back half of the year looks like revenues will be down by mid to high teens it looks like.","We know in the fourth quarter you will have to lap an Easter shift and an extra week and that you will be closing stores so it will naturally be lower. But certainly some of the drivers on why the growth rate leaving the year will be so low will extend into the first half of next year. I am trying to think if \u2013 a little bit of time has gone by now \u2013 if you could help us think about how to maybe start quantifying what your reference to stabilizing revenues will look like in fiscal 2018 given what you know about the business today as you start walking into the plan.","Robert L. Madore - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Senior Vice President","Yeah. So thank you, Michael. Relative to your first question on the SG&A cost savings. The majority of our restructuring activities are more heavily weighted to the second half of the year. So for instance, our organizational changes were just made in June. So, you'll start to see the benefit of those in Q2, but they'll be much more heavily weighted to the second half. Of the overall savings that we discussed and quantified at the Investors Day relative to the Way Forward Plan of $445 million, that's a gross number. It doesn't represent net savings that'll drop to the bottom line, and all of those savings essentially represent SG&A savings, not cost of goods savings.","So more heavily weighted to the second half related to your question on SG&A expenses, particularly as it relates to completion of our anticipated store closures. So, we communicated 50-plus closures. We're actually looking a little deeper at that number, and relative to that 50-plus, we closed eight in Q1. So again, our store closures are more heavily weighted towards the second half of the year, and that's purposeful because we had committed to inventory buys for a lot of those stores and we want to be able to liquidate them through those doors.","Relative to the revenue guidance for the remainder of the year, and then I'll turn the question over to Stefan to talk about the guidance for the longer-term period, the high, the mid\/high teens are really being driven by, again, timing of store closures, timing related to a number of quality of sale initiatives, whether it's pulling back significantly on inventory receipts which will reduce sales, whether it's the impact of pricing harmonization within regions and channels, et cetera, and we also don't expect as much benefit from sales mix shifts as we've seen in Q1 in particular.","Stefan Larsson - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Bob. And to build on what Bob just said, Michael, when it comes to the phasing of the Way Forward Plan and the financial outlook we gave on a four-year basis, if you look at \u2013 let's start with the phasing. We guided top line, from a phase perspective, to reset and stabilize 2017, moving into 2018, and then pivot to growth. And so why Q3 and Q4, why we should expect an increase in the sales \u2013 a decrease of sales in Q3 and Q4 versus the current trend, it comes back to the work Jeff and his team is doing in North America. Given how our \u2013 how big North America is of our overall business, the assessment that Jeff and his teams come back with will include several additional quality of sales initiatives. So that's why we have guided the way we have guided.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Evren Kopelman - Head-Investor Relations","Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just as a quick follow up on what Jeff's team is doing. When would you think after they come back with that analysis that those implementations would be in the market? So are we talking about spring of 2017 where we might see a difference in quality of sale? Is friends and family and couponing on the table?","And then just on the supply chain, the speed dynamics, you've talked about building a speed pipeline, as you mentioned, on test and react in department stores, which is pretty new. As Halide has done her work, I know she is early on, but I am just curious how that dynamic will work when you're not a vertically integrated retailer, you are relying on your third-party retail partners to get data to test and react to. So maybe just building a little bit on how that might work. Thanks.","Stefan Larsson - President and Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thank you, Lindsay. So let's try to cover all your questions. So starting with Jeff and his team's work in North America, how soon you will see that come through. What I can say there is it's top priority. It's by far our top priority to assess the North American challenge. And as soon as we have clarity within the next few months, we will start to implement additional quality of sales initiatives. So we keep you posted on a more detailed schedule. But the ambition is full speed forward to assess, get the fact based and then lay out the plan and start executing it right away. So, we should see an impact at the end of this year.","When it comes to friends and family and other couponing initiatives are on the table, everything is on the table. Then it's \u2013 everything is on the table, and then we look at, how do we drive brand strength and sustainable profitable sales growth in a responsible way from where we are to where we are heading.","Eight-week speed pipeline. So I mentioned a few times before that coming into this role, the wholesale relationship partnership was new to me, and I was blown away by our biggest customers and their willingness to take on the challenge together with us.","So, they are waiting for us to come back and say, relating to the eight week speed pipeline and a number of other areas to say how can we partner up and create joint value out of this. Because when we get into a more balanced inventory and cut most of the excess out and be able to react on eight weeks, then we will be able to create value not only for us but for them. And they are very clear on that.","So we have an ongoing dialogue with them, and they are waiting for us to be ready to start to execute on it. What excites me is to see by the speed Halide and her team has come into not only assessing the state but also reaching out to the suppliers. As I mentioned, we went to Asia, Halide and I, and met with our key suppliers.","The suppliers that were there represent 70% approximately of our total volume. And we invited them into co-create this journey, to co-create the sourcing part of the Way Forward Plan, which also it didn't surprise me because I'm more experienced from working closely with sourcing partners that they were more than ready to dive in. So, I've seen several concrete examples of how working differently we'll be able to increase quality, decrease the cost and increase the flexibility and the speed.","Evren Kopelman - Head-Investor Relations","Thanks. Next question.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Matt Boss with JPMorgan.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Thanks. So, on your wholesale reset, can you just talk a little bit about the process, how you select the doors to consolidate? Is it location volume, is it retail or partner specific? And then just more multi-year, what does your plan consider in terms of a potential larger scale department store closing? Any strategies in place just to offset the potential impact if that were to transpire?"," Okay. Thanks, Matt. I'll take that question, which is \u2013 it comes back to Jeff's assessment that we need to do the fact-based assessment first. I'm a firm believer in getting the facts crystal clear on the table, put everything on the table and then look at where we're set out to go. Which is one common goal for the whole team which is in the US, for wholesale, for all channels, strengthen the brand and drive profitable sales growth and then map out the path to that. So I'll have to come back to you on the details.","Evren Kopelman - Head-Investor Relations","Thanks. Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo.","Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone. Just to go back to the low-double-digit sales decline outlook for the fiscal year. I was wondering if you could give us some more color on the moving pieces that kind of get you there, maybe meaning how much is negative comps from your quality of sale initiatives impacting the retail side of the business versus wholesale decline as you reduce sell-in on inventory. And then maybe just specifically more detail on the North America geography within the wholesale channel for the year, would be really helpful.","Robert L. Madore - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Senior Vice President","Yeah. So it's really driven by a combination of things, some of which I've already mentioned. Store closures plays a big role in that as it relates to the retail business. We are planning retail comps at the mid to high single digit level for the remainder of the year.","In addition to that, as we said there's a number of quality of sale initiatives that are being undertaken, whether it's pulling back inventory receipts, whether it's significantly reducing promotional cadence, both timeframe and depth of those. All of that is going to drive a pullback on the revenue side of things but it will help strengthen the brand and improve our profitability going forward. Those are the main drivers.","One other item worth noting, which is very significant, is pricing harmonization across all the regions. And we found as we did our deep assessment of the business and the challenges that that was a huge issue for us particularly in North America across all our channels and that's a very important initiative.","Evren Kopelman - Head-Investor Relations","Okay. Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.","Robert L. Madore - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Senior Vice President","Hi, Dana.","Evren Kopelman - Head-Investor Relations","Let's take the next one, Raya. We'll come back to Dana.","Operator","Okay. The next question comes from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Great. Thanks. Good morning. A couple of questions, just first a follow-up on Europe. Could you just quantify the impact of the timing of the wholesale shift in the region during the quarter? And then I think you mentioned that North American comps were down high-single. How did comps look in Europe? And if there was any variance by region, that would be helpful.","Robert L. Madore - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Senior Vice President","Yeah, so the impact of the timing of the wholesale shipments in the first quarter were roughly about $20 million. And then relative to the comp performance, Europe had a low single digit negative comp in the first quarter.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Okay.","Robert L. Madore - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Senior Vice President","And we don't really...","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","And was there any...","Robert L. Madore - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Senior Vice President","We don't break that out by region or country.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","And then if I could just follow up on the e-commerce, I think you mentioned it was down 6% in the quarter. And I realize you have got kind of the impact of the pricing harmonization. But how should we just think about that channel going forward and what is implied in your guidance in Q2 throughout the balance of the year? Thank you so much.","Robert L. Madore - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Senior Vice President","Yeah, you should think of that guidance as mid- to high-single-digit decrease. Really again, driven particularly in North America by the pricing harmonization and the other quality of sale initiatives. We are clearly looking to be much less promotional within that channel.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Okay. So e-commerce and brick and mortar will be down to the similar level?","Robert L. Madore - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Senior Vice President","Yes.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you very much.","Evren Kopelman - Head-Investor Relations","Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Good morning, everyone. As you think about the Way Forward Plan, Stefan, how are you seeing the product evolution evolve? What should we see as we go through the next few quarters or to the next year how you want to see the product resonate with the three brands that you are focusing on? And do price points change? Thank you.","Stefan Larsson - President and Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thank you, Dana. So when it comes to the product part of the Way Forward Plan, it's all going to be about going back to the core of what made us iconic, and the core of what drives the business, and the core of what the consumer already loves. So the core for us is what we have been known for which is classic, iconic style, and how you will see that refocus and evolving the core, the work that we're doing, how you will see that is that you will gradually see it in spring 2017 and then gradually season by season you will see the core being focused on in terms of, we will make sure that we have an updated classic, iconic style that has an effortless twist that makes it current today. So it's about \u2013 you will see that the core from everything from placement to presentation to marketing, it will cut through and it will be one message and it will be a core that is updated and relevant for today.","Evren Kopelman - Head-Investor Relations","Okay. Next question, please.","Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from David Glick with Buckingham Research Group.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning. Stefan, I just had a question on this lead time reduction. I just wondered what are the tradeoffs that you have to make as you go down that path? Obviously having shorter lead times, there is the potential of having to have higher product costs, perhaps not. But I am interested if that is part of the tradeoff. Obviously you are trying to save markdowns by being six months smarter about what you are committing to. But I was just wondering if you could kind of walk us through that. Thank you.","Stefan Larsson - President and Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thank you, David. So when it comes to tradeoffs, what's been very encouraging to see is that coming back to the work behind and the drivers behind moving from 15 to nine months to start with and adding the eight-week test pipeline, it comes very much back to the disciplined approach of working cross functionally from design idea all the way into the store, and reading the sales and responding to that.","So working with Halide and her team and putting sourcing at the table upfront together with design and merchandising has led to that we have been able to move towards the nine-month lead time, have an eight-week speed, increase the quality at the same time as we see costs on comparable products go down.","So Halide has, like everyone else working on the Way Forward Plan, she has started \u2013 she and her team have started focusing on the core. And that is what will make the biggest difference from a consumer perspective and from a business perspective. And very encouraging to see that we're able to cut the lead times, increase the quality, decrease the price at the same time \u2013 decrease the cost price.","Evren Kopelman - Head-Investor Relations","Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Jay Sole with Morgan Stanley.","Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. My question is about the store closures. Can you talk to us about what types of stores you're closing? Where they are? What criteria you are using to determine which stores will close? And Bob mentioned, taking a deeper look at store closures, does that mean that you're considering closing possibly more than 50 stores? Thank you.","Robert L. Madore - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Senior Vice President","Yes. Thank you, Jay. So the criteria with which we selected stores for closure was really two fold. One was is the store strategic in strengthening the brand? And then secondly, the overall level of profitability were the major drivers, and the major criteria that we looked at. Yes. We are looking at possibly closing more than 50 stores. There were some stores that went through our initial evaluation using those criteria that we may have felt were strategic, and that we could turn the productivity around in the stores. And we're going back and just validating that and questioning that.","Evren Kopelman - Head-Investor Relations","Great. Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from John Kernan with Cowen and Company.","John Kernan - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. It seems like the Way Forward Plan is definitely gaining some momentum. Your gross margin ex restructuring charges was up pretty significantly in the first quarter. Bob, you talked about lower inventory reserves on the balance sheet, but can you help us understand what we should expect for gross margin that's embedded in your guidance for the remainder of the year? Thank you.","Robert L. Madore - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Senior Vice President","Yeah, so, the first quarter was benefited from a few things that we consider to be kind of one time in nature, right? So one was the significant favorable sales mix shifts that we experienced from products, geography in a channel perspective. We don't see that magnitude of favorability on the go-forward.","With respect to the impact on inventory reserves, and that's really a commentary relative to the guidance that we gave, that as we were working through and executing on our inventory initiatives, whether they're restructuring or other initiatives, what we found is that we did not have to record the level of inventory reserves that we had initiatively estimated when we gave our guidance. So it was just a function of refinement of our restructuring and inventory management activities that were going to be one time in nature relative to the visibility we had when we gave guidance versus how we're seeing things play out as we look at the plans materializing relative to the forecast going forward.","Evren Kopelman - Head-Investor Relations","Okay. And we'll take one final question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert F. Ohmes - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Oh, Hey. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick one, I was hoping you could remind us or maybe tell us how e-commerce performed for you guys in the quarter? And maybe, Stefan, remind us where dot-com business fits into the Way Forward Plan globally and sort of what the initiatives are underway there right now? Thanks.","Robert L. Madore - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Senior Vice President","Yep. So e-commerce comps were down mid single digits. We had better performance in Europe than we experienced in North America. In North America, our top line revenue was impacted by two things primarily. One again was the pricing harmonization that we talked about. And then also, cutting back on our promotions. We cut back significantly on the length of the promotions, the number of promotions and the discount rate depth relative to how we've historically operated. That's really what drove the North American performance.","Stefan Larsson - President and Chief Executive Officer","And longer term, John, in terms of the e-commerce role in the Way Forward, it's going to have a really important part. We have mentioned a number of times before that we're going to follow the consumer, where the consumer is going. The consumer is clearly going to e-commerce and mobile first. We are developing an e-commerce platform. Since a while back, we are on target to deliver that. That's going to enable us to not only build a flagship online that's highly aspirational and stands for everything that's Ralph original edition about a life in style and be very focused on the core product strategy, the icon strategy, and it's going be very shoppable at the same time. So when it comes to its role short-term here and now over the next six months, it's going to be a part of Jeff's strategy that he is developing for North America because that's multi-channel and e-commerce is going to play an important role.","Stefan Larsson - President and Chief Executive Officer","Okay. That was the final question. I look at Evren here, and she smiles and nods. So, before we close, I just want to say, on behalf of Ralph, myself and the Board, I would like to thank Bob for all his contributions to the company over the last 12 years. It's going to be your final quarterly call. Thank you.","From all of us, and to all of you, thanks for joining on the call today. Look forward to speaking again next quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation.

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Now for opening remarks and introductions, I will turn the conference over to Mr. James Hurley. Please go ahead, sir.","James Hurley","Good morning, and thank you for joining us on Ralph Lauren's fourth quarter and full year fiscal '12 conference call.","The agenda for today's call includes Roger Farah, our President and Chief Operating Officer, who will give you an overview of the year and comment on our broader strategic initiatives; Jacki Nemerov, our Executive Vice President, will provide some product commentary; and Tracey Travis, our Chief Financial Officer, will provide operational and financial highlights from the fourth quarter in addition to reviewing our initial expectations for fiscal '13. After that, we will open the call up for your questions, which we ask that you limit to one per caller.","During today's call, we will be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including our financial outlook. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees, and our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Our expectations contain many risks and uncertainties. The principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from our current expectations are detailed in our SEC filings.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to Roger.","Roger N. Farah","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to be reporting exceptional fourth quarter and full fiscal '12 results this morning. For the full year, our sales increased 21% to nearly $9 billion, reflecting -- $7 billion, excuse me, I'm already excited, reflecting excellent growth across our major channels of distribution and geographic regions.","We achieved record level operating earnings of over $1 billion, a function of our strong sales growth and our ability to leverage expenses even as we continue to make substantial investments to support our long-term growth objectives.","Diluted EPS rose 24% for the year, which is an acceleration from the low-teens compounded growth we delivered in the prior 3 years.","We ended fiscal '12 with $1.3 billion in cash and investments. In recognition of our strong performance, liquidity metrics and comfort with our long-term plans and projections, our Board of Directors recently authorized the doubling of our cash dividend to $1.60 a share annually. This is the third 100% increase in the quarterly cash dividend in as many years and is a clear demonstration of our company's commitment to enhance shareholder returns.","As strong as our operating performance was for fiscal 2012, let's not forget that we started the year facing some formidable headwinds. Every year has its own unique set of challenges at the onset. Some of that is purposeful and strategic and some of that are a function of external realities. At the beginning of fiscal '12, we were contending with considerable political and social uncertainty in Europe and the Middle East; the aftermath of the devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan; and most significantly of all, we faced an unprecedented spike in our cost of goods.","We managed through these external factors thoughtfully while staying focused on our long-term growth objectives of expanding our international presence, extending our direct-to-customer reach including significant investments in global e-commerce, innovating and developing new product categories such as the launch of Denim & Supply and assuming the control of our home textile operations, investing in our global systems and infrastructure and attracting and developing world-class talents.","Our results confirm the extraordinary operational and managerial disciplines of our global teams, and they are reflective in the incredible appeal of the Ralph Lauren brand worldwide.","Our international sales rose 33% in 2012 and represented 36% of our revenue, which is 300 basis points above the prior year level and compares to just 20% 5 years ago.","Our European revenue was up 26%, an acceleration from the low-teens compounded growth rate we achieved over the prior 5 years. This is considerable progress for a period characterized by substantial macroeconomic challenges. And despite near-term caution, it's also a validation of growth opportunities we continue to see in Europe over the long term.","We made major progress transforming our operations and brand presence throughout Asia during the year. Our talented locally based teams are leveraging our more comprehensive and direct control over the regions and are implementing plans that, we believe, significantly benefit our company over the long term.","","We have a unique opportunity to get this right. So we're being thoughtful and deliberate in the pacing and sequencing of our investments in people, systems, infrastructure, distribution and marketing. In some cases, this involves taking a step back in order to find a clearer, more profitable path to the future. This same approach has worked very well for us in the past in Europe and Japan and with the transition of many of our product licenses.","As most of you know, we embarked on a major brand repositioning effort in Greater China, closing 95 points of distribution, representing 60% of our network, during the year. We effectively reset our presence in the market, leaving us with what we believe is a more brand appropriate and a stronger foundation for growth.","Over the next 3 years, we expect to open approximately 60 new stores in Greater China, all in premier locations and adjacent to the world's leading luxury brands. 15 of those stores are in place for the back half of fiscal 2013 across many of the major cities including Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong.","The integration of our formally licensed South Korean operations was executed seamlessly during the year. And in a relatively short period of time, the local team has embraced our culture and operating procedures. Over the last year, we successfully closed and repositioned 30 concession shops, which is approximately 17% of our total Korean shop presence, and we are beginning to implement many of the strategic merchandise initiatives that have worked well for us in other parts of the world.","Today, more than half of our Asian revenues are generated in Japan. We started fiscal '12 with a cautious outlook for Japan in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake and tsunami. And while sales were challenging in the few weeks following disasters, they recovered quickly and gained momentum throughout the year. I believe the current strength of our Japanese operations is a function of resetting our presence there. This is a process that began in earnest 4 years ago and include the closing and relocating of shops and implementing strategic merchandise initiatives. Over the next several years, we intend to build on our strong foundation in Japan by relocating and adding concession shops in addition to growing our freestanding store network, which is very modest today.","It will take time and patience for us to substantially scale up our presence throughout Asia especially since we will not compromise on the real estate or brand positioning. Securing appropriate incremental distribution is a multiyear process especially with our standards of excellence. However, growing a more elevated local market presence should help sales to Asians and especially Chinese tourists visiting other parts of the world, particularly Europe and the United States.","In addition to opening new stores and concession shops, we made a significant investment in e-commerce last year. We launched international e-commerce for Ralph Lauren in France, Germany and several other French- and German-speaking countries, and we launched e-commerce for Club Monaco in the United States followed by Canada. We will continue to invest in this high-growth global channel with more dedicated marketing, more sophisticated technology and more focus on delivering a best-in-class customer experience.","For fiscal 2013, we intend to launch e-commerce in Japan in the second half of the year. We will also be doubling the capacity at RalphLauren.com, dedicated U.S. customer service and distribution center in order to support an expected doubling of the business from current levels.","Since an increasing portion of our anticipated long-term growth is expected to come from our retail segment and customers are shopping across channels more than ever, during fiscal 2013, we intend to make substantial investments in global customer relation management and customer intelligence platforms. We're in the early stages of development and investment, but we believe that over time, knowing and our servicing our customers better should support stronger sales and profits growth into the future.","We are already driving excellent productivity in our brick-and-mortar stores. The substantial strength of our retail comps, which rose 14% in 2012 on top of a double-digit gain in 2011 is the best evidence of this. In fact, the last 3 years, productivity per square foot at our directly operated retail concepts in the United States and Europe has accelerated. These productivity gains are important drivers of consistent improvement in our retail segment profitability even in the context of fairly turbulent market conditions.","We have made some meaningful changes in our management team and organizational structure in 2012. These changes provide more direct alignment with our key long-term growth objectives and should enable more powerful leverage with certain strategically important areas of our business. Jacki assumed the oversight of our global supply chain and logistics organization. Since she already managed our global merchandising and product development, Jacki now manages the full product life cycle from end-to-end, which was a real asset as we navigated through the raw materials inflation last year.","We also welcomed Daniel Lalonde to our organization in February as President of International with oversight of our operations outside of North America and in support of our ongoing focus on growing our international presence.","We also elevated Eric Korman to President of our Global Digital & E-Commerce operations, including leadership and oversight for our customer intelligence initiatives.","Fiscal '12 was a strong and productive year by any measure. With a fair amount of uncertainty at the onset, the team planned prudently but were positioned to seize market share opportunities as they emerged. And ultimately, our performance was better than we anticipated. Our results are an affirmation of the powerful diversity of our operating model across channel, regions and merchandise categories. They confirm that the strategies, as we execute them, continue to position us for compelling growth even as we contend with unforeseen external realities and make substantial reinvestments back into the business.","And while we enter fiscal '13 excited about our long-term global growth prospectus, we are faced with another set of unique challenges. Once again, some are purposeful and strategic and some are a function of the external factors. We are absolutely committed to our repositioning efforts in Asia, to our investment in global e-commerce and customer intelligence and to the continued upgrading of our systems and infrastructure. These commitments will likely weigh on our expenses especially in the first half of the year, but we believe they are critical to achieving our long-term objectives.","As we consider the current environment, we are concerned about near-term global economic trends, especially the uncertainty in Europe. Geopolitical issues are likely to dominate consumer psyche for some time whether it's adjusting to the new political realities emerging in Europe or the upcoming presidential elections here in the U.S.","We believe we are proactively positioning ourselves to navigate through these dynamics, planning prudently while remaining agile enough to capitalize on opportunities as they emerge. This approach has served us well in the past. Regardless of the near-term dynamics, we have a clear and compelling growth trajectory ahead of us. We are allocating talent and capital to our most compelling high-growth, high-return opportunities. And we intend to continue operating the business according to the clearly defined strategies and disciplined execution that are the hallmarks of our organization. The consistency of our approach has created significant shareholder value in the past, and we believe it can support additional value creation over the long term.","And with that, I turn the call over to Jacki.","Jackwyn L. Nemerov","Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. Fiscal 2012 was a tremendous year for us. The allure of our brand and the impact of our merchandising initiatives drove strong global sales growth, including mid-teens expansion in our largest market, North America. This exceptional performance was supported by momentum in even our most core product categories where we have long dominated. We also saw excellent traction in the emerging accessories and denim categories.","The strength of our sales performance is supported by disciplined merchandising, planning and allocation strategies that, combined with our brand leadership, generated strong profitability for the company and our wholesale partners.","Our market share gains in men's and children's worldwide is a testament to our commitment to innovation. The constant evolution of our assortments to include a broader range of products and lifestyle sensitivity gives existing customers something fresh and attracts new customers to the world of Ralph Lauren.","In women's, the spring\/summer Live in Color merchandising and marketing program for the Lauren Lifestyle brand is a beautiful and highly coordinated expression of a brand-right and trend-right statement. As a result, we are experiencing very strong performance across sportswear, dresses, accessories and footwear.","In fiscal 2012, we made a major commitment to growing our presence in the denim arena across multiple customer segments. For our most premium customers, we introduced Black Label denim for men in our own stores and select specialty stores worldwide. This not only added a compelling new dimension for the current Black Label customer, but it's also attracted a new customer to the brand. We look forward to building on our early success with additional points of global distribution in the near future.","In addition, we introduced Denim & Supply last fall. In the last 6 months of the year, we opened or converted hundreds of department store shop-in-shops and 4 freestanding stores worldwide. The scale of the launch demonstrates our commitment to both denim category and the younger, more trend-conscious consumer.","As we transition out of Polo Jeans, which is primarily in international markets, we continue to focus on building customer awareness for Denim & Supply around the world, leveraging the familiarity of the Ralph Lauren name while expressing the youthful and independent spirit of this new brand.","Handbags and small leather goods are another meaningful growth strategy for us. In the Ralph Lauren luxury segment, we are experiencing strong performance of our seasonal fashion styles, and at the same time, steadily building a stable of signature styles that we expect to be the backbone of this global opportunity.","The majority of our distribution is still limited to select Ralph Lauren stores worldwide, but given the reaction to the line, we have slowly expanded the distribution to include a handful of our existing shops at our most prestigious partners including Bergdorf Goodman, Saks Fifth Avenue and Harrods.","With our Lauren Lifestyle brand, we are in our second spring season with handbags and small leather goods, and the brand has achieved more than double the distribution it had at this time last year.","For those of you who are familiar with the category, I'm sure you've seen the evolution of the Lauren handbag and small leather goods assortment in a relatively short period of time. We believe that the quality and value proposition of the line is unmatched in the category. Customers have responded, and comp gains at existing locations have been strong.","With more focused attention on product development and procurement and with expanded distribution and dedicated advertising and marketing, we believe handbags and small leather goods will become a very meaningful contributor to our consolidated sales growth over the next few years and they are, of course, a key component of our growth plans in Asia.","As our businesses become more complex across brands, merchandise categories, distribution channels and geographies, we have put a great deal of emphasis on streamlining our global processes. A critical aspect of my expanded role is to bring continuity from design to merchandising, to manufacturing into supply chain and sales. Our optimized organizational structure provides a vantage point for me to leverage our unique strength in each of these disciplines in a more integrated and impactful way. It should also allow me to identify and develop new competencies that will enable us to be an even more agile organization.","A good example of how this optimized structure can add real value is how we navigated an unprecedented spike in raw materials last year. It was imperative for us to maintain the design aesthetic for which we are known and the quality of make and continuity of execution for which we are respected throughout the industry. In order to do so while maintaining the value proposition to the customer and protecting our profitability, we mobilized an extraordinary collaboration across our merchandising, buying, sourcing, production and logistics teams. We also leveraged our strong relationship with outside partners and customer organizations.","Our sales results and market share gains attest to the fact that customers appreciate the decisions we made, and we ended the year with only a modest decline in our gross profit margin, which we will experience in the second half a recovery in product margins.","If you have a feeling in the coming months of the Ralph Lauren brand is even more visible than usual, you will not be wrong. Beginning with Father's Day, we will be celebrating what we call the Sports of Summer as a proud sponsor of this summer's great global sporting events from the U.S. Open and British Open golf championships and the U.S. Open and Wimbledon tennis championships to Black Watch Polo and most notably, the London Olympic Games. Event-specific merchandise will highlight the heritage of each sport and the unique connection between the sensibility of the Ralph Lauren brand and these iconic athletic lifestyles.","We'll be supporting each program with advertising and marketing that reflects our multi-channel distribution. The Sports of Summer will reinforce our position as the preeminent sports lifestyle brand and create global visibility and a powerful halo for all Ralph Lauren merchandise around the world.","We are very proud of our progress in fiscal 2012 and are especially excited to be in the earliest stage of the development in some of the highest growth categories, which means that with as much as we've achieved, there's still so much more to come.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tracey.","Tracey Thomas Travis","Thank you, Jacki, and good morning, everyone. As Roger highlighted earlier, we reported excellent fourth quarter and full year operating results. We achieved this performance while managing extraordinary cost inflation and meaningful investment in our long-term growth initiatives, including the integration of formally licensed South Korea and home textile operations; the global fall launch of Denim & Supply; the continued expansion of our international e-commerce capabilities; and commencing a major repositioning of our distribution network in Greater China through exiting the balance of what amounts to 95 total shop and store locations. We ended the year with record sales and profits, and we achieved progress on all of our strategic initiatives.","With respect to the fourth quarter, consolidated net revenues were $1.6 billion, 14% greater than the prior year period and in line with our expectations. We achieved double-digit growth in all of our major geographies and across both our wholesale and retail segments in the quarter.","The gross profit margin of 57.1% was 30 basis points higher than the prior year period and better than we expected. The improvement to the prior year was primarily a function of favorable channel and product mix that more than offset the net impact of cost of goods inflation in the quarter.","Operating expenses rose 14% to $790 million in the quarter, and the operating expense margin of 48.7% was modestly above the prior year period. The increase in operating expenses was primarily a function of our sales growth and the mix of overall business growth, specifically higher retail segment growth, which maintains a higher expense structure than our other business segments.","We also had incremental costs associated with the assumption of our home textile operations and shifting in timing of some corporate expenses that we discussed with you on our third quarter conference call.","Restructuring charges of $10 million in the fourth quarter were also in line with the outlook we provided on the third quarter conference call. Excluding the restructuring charges, we would have achieved 50 basis points of operating expense leverage.","Our fourth quarter operating income of $136 million was 16% greater than the prior year period, and our operating margin rose 20 basis points to 8.4%, the net result of the higher gross profit margin and offset by the impact of the restructuring charges I mentioned.","Net income for the fourth quarter increased 29% to $94 million, and net income per diluted share rose 34% to $0.99. The growth in net income and diluted EPS was primarily a function of our higher operating income in addition to a lower effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 due to the favorable effect of discrete tax items.","Regarding our segment performance in the fourth quarter. Wholesale revenues rose 10% to $828 million, a result of continued momentum in North America and in Europe where the fourth quarter also benefited from the earlier shipment of certain spring\/summer product. Our core apparel offering, particularly our men's and children's wear merchandise supported most of this growth worldwide. Incremental distribution for handbags in North America and footwear in Europe also contributed to the growth.","In North America, wholesale revenue growth also benefited from continued sales of new categories such as Denim & Supply and home textiles.","Additional points of distribution for Lauren in accessories were growth drivers in Europe in the quarter.","Wholesale operating income grew 12% to $153 million in the fourth quarter, and the wholesale operating margin rose 30 basis points to 18.5%.","The improvement in operating income and margin rate was primarily a result of stronger product margins that were partially offset by incremental expenses associated with new and emerging merchandise categories, particularly home textiles, Denim & Supply and the expansion of certain products in Europe.","Retail segment sales grew 19% to $752 million from the fourth quarter. We experienced broad-based momentum with particular strength at our factory stores globally, at concession shops in Japan and Korea and online.","Overall comp store sales increased 12% in the fourth quarter including 30% growth at RalphLauren.com, 5% expansion at Ralph Lauren stores, a 10% increase at our factory stores and 14% growth at Club Monaco stores. Comp growth across retail formats was primarily a function of higher transactions and higher average dollars per transaction. Trends at our Ralph Lauren stores in the U.S. and Europe remain the most challenging during the quarter as local customers continue to be somewhat restrained with their discretionary  luxury apparel shopping. We did, however, experience strong growth in the Asia-Pacific region led by Japan and despite completing the closing of an additional 53 points of distribution as part of our China brand elevation and network repositioning efforts.","Performance at RalphLauren.com and our factory stores worldwide and the Club Monaco remained robust, a continuation of trends that have persisted for all of those concepts throughout the year and on top of strong comp growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011.","Retail segment operating income of $44 million was an impressive 72% greater than the prior year period, and the retail operating margin improved 180 basis points to 5.9%.","The growth in retail operating income and the expansion in margin rate are primarily a result of strong comp store sales growth and improved profitability in each of our major geographic regions.","Licensing royalties of $43 million in the fourth quarter were 2% below the prior year period, reflecting a decline in home product licensing royalties due to assuming direct control over our home textile operations. The decline in licensing royalties contributed to a contraction in licensing operating income in the fourth quarter.","We ended the year with inventories up 20% from the prior year period. Approximately 7% of the increase is for merchandise to support revenue growth on comparable products, geographies and distribution. The remaining 13% of this increase is related to non-comp items included in inventory this year, primarily home textile, new stores and international e-commerce in addition to cost of goods inflation.  There was no material foreign currency impact in the quarter.","We spent approximately $272 million in capital expenditures during the full fiscal year to support our retail store and wholesale shop development worldwide in addition to continued investment in our global systems and infrastructure. Approximately half of our capital spending for the year was to support our international growth efforts, and we continue to expect that an increasing portion of our capital spending will be allocated to international retail and development, particularly in Asia over the next several years.","Consistent with our commitment to return capital to shareholders, we purchased an aggregate 3.2 million shares of our Class A common stock for approximately $395 million during fiscal 2012. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had approximately $577 million remaining under our authorized share repurchase program. We also returned $74 million to shareholders in the form of dividends in fiscal 2012.","After funding all of our capital needs and working capital requirements and returning capital to shareholders, we ended the year with $1.3 billion in cash and investments, an increase from the $1.1 billion we ended fiscal 2011 with.","Fiscal 2012 was clearly a year of substantial growth and strategic progress for the company. We are very proud of our accomplishments, and as Ralph mentioned in this morning's press release, we are also very excited about what's on the horizon for us.","As we look to the future, we remain committed to reinvesting in the business in order to fund the growth initiatives that have consistently supported our strong financial results.","As you are already aware, a critical part of our success formula over the past several years has been our ability to balance our support of initiatives that represent critical growth areas for the future along with the exceptional daily execution of our core business operations. Our European operation, our footwear line, our Lauren apparel brand and RalphLauren.com are all examples of investments we made within the last decade and they represent meaningful contributors to our profit growth today.","In fiscal 2013, there are a few areas of incremental investment that are expected to become important contributors to our growth for the next decade. These include continued global e-commerce development with a more concerted focus on building capabilities in Asia in order to continue to support our customers' desire for channel shopping options. As Roger spoke about earlier, we are also building internal capabilities to institutionalize and maximize customer relationship management and intelligence on a global basis across all channels of our business.","We intend to invest incrementally in the Ralph Lauren brand via advertising and marketing, particularly as we support our newer merchandise categories and regions of the world and as we leverage our sponsorship of the world's premier sports events, most notably this summer's Olympics.","We will also continue to invest thoughtfully in operating systems and infrastructure that support our global growth aspirations.","While we enter fiscal 2013 on the heels of impressive multi-year momentum, in the last few months, we've experienced the effects of some remarkable sociopolitical upheaval and the onset of another recession throughout much of Europe as many consumer-based companies have already noted in their earlier press releases. Economic growth also appears to be slowing in other regions within Asia that have been important engines of global expansion for some time.","In the U.S., which remains our largest market, economic recovery remains uneven across many segments. A derivative effect of these macro dynamics is reflected in volatile foreign currency exchange rates, which have evolved into a material headwind for us this year. The impact of this uncertainty, combined with actions we have taken to proactively position ourselves to take advantage of future growth opportunities, does mean that we expect fiscal 2013's growth will be less robust than our stellar fiscal 2012.","With that as a backdrop, I'd like to review the financial outlook that we provided in this morning's press release. For the full year fiscal 2013 period, we currently expect revenues to increase at a mid-single-digit rate, with a low single-digit decline in wholesale revenues offset by a low double-digit increase in retail segment sales. Areas of our business that were the primary drivers of our strong revenue growth in fiscal 2012, including most of our retail formats worldwide and our core North American wholesale operations, are expected to provide continued momentum throughout fiscal 2013, but at a more modest rate given the economic climate.","And while Europe was an important contributor to our growth last year, we expect low single-digit expansion in the region this year as momentum in our retail segment in Europe is largely offset by a decline in wholesale volume due to the severity of the economic slowdown I discussed earlier.","We continue to transition certain Japanese wholesale license to directly controlled concessions, which is also expected to impact wholesale revenue growth throughout the year. And strategic changes we decided to make in our business such as the impact of closing 60% of our Greater China distribution network and the winding down of American Living, combined with unfavorable foreign currency effects that are expected to persist throughout the year, are estimated to suppress our consolidated sales growth for fiscal 2013 by approximately 4%.","Our full year operating margin is expected to be modestly above fiscal 2012's level as the recovery in gross profit margin is largely offset by an increase in operating expense rate to support strategic investment in our growth initiatives and also reflects the impact of our higher retail mix.","Our fiscal 2013 tax rate is planned at approximately 33%.","As I just mentioned, while we do expect to realize gross profit margin expansion this year, we don't expect meaningful improvement to begin until the fall season, which is our fiscal third quarter. This, coupled with the anticipated sequencing of our investment in our strategic initiatives, means that fiscal 2013 will evolve as a story of 2 halves for us. We expect to experience operating margin pressure in the first half of the year followed by operating margin expansion in the second half of the year.","For the first quarter, we expect consolidated net revenues to grow at a low single-digit rate as flat to slightly lower wholesale revenues are offset by high single-digit growth at our retail segment.","Our outlook includes continued broad-based strength in North America and at most of our retail formats worldwide that is moderated by a decline in European wholesale volume, some of which is a function of a shift in the timing of certain spring\/summer  shipments that benefited the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012.","Revenue growth will also be impacted by reduced distribution in Greater China. Foreign currency effects are estimated to negatively impact consolidated sales growth by approximately 2% to 3% in the first quarter, primarily due to weakness of the euro.","Operating margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 is expected to be down approximately 250 to 300 basis points from the prior year period. The decline in operating margin is primarily attributable to an anticipated de-leveraging of operating expenses due to relatively flat wholesale revenues and lower concession sales in Greater China where we are still absorbing the cost of our infrastructure despite the network contraction.","We are also incurring investments in the strategic initiatives I outlined earlier. Our first quarter gross profit margin is expected to be pressured at many of our retail concepts as they are still cycling through the cost of goods inflation that impacted our wholesale segment in the latter part of fiscal 2012.","We intend to spend approximately $360 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2013 to support our retail and wholesale growth initiatives and the consistent upgrading of our global systems and infrastructures. Approximately 1\/3 of our capital spend is allocated to our distribution network development in Asia, mostly concentrated on Greater China.","While we are once again entering our new fiscal year amidst a lot of uncertainty, we are taking proactive measures to navigate through these challenges in a manner that is both Ralph Lauren appropriate and that supports our future growth objectives. Whatever the near-term headwinds might be, they in no way alter our enthusiasm for or our focus on our long-term goals. We are very confident in the relevance of our strategy and the strong growing appeal and glowing appeal of the Ralph Lauren brand across many merchandise categories worldwide, which should enable us to continue to deliver meaningful profit growth over the long term.","And with that, we will take your questions. Operator, would you assist us with that now?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Omar Saad with ISI Group.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I was hoping, Roger and team, you guys could give a little bit more detail on kind of what you're seeing in Europe and how you're thinking about it, near term and long term, especially in the context of several other high-profile companies reporting a significant slowdown there and your guidance for flat to down wholesale growth, how you're thinking about the consumer spending environment, the macro, your opportunity kind of to offset that through retail -- own retail growth, additional distribution on the wholesale side either doors and\/or categories and then how you're thinking about the tourism piece as well. Is there a benefit there as the brand continues to grow globally?","Roger N. Farah","Omar, I know we ran a little long with our \"end of the year presentation\", but that's a pretty long question. Let me see if I can talk about Europe broadly and then hit on some of the specifics you touched on. If I miss some of them, I apologize. We reported extraordinary results last year, 26%, and we really saw that across all strategies: retail, wholesale, across almost all of the countries. We had double-digit growth in France, Germany, Spain, the U.K., Scandinavia and others. I think what you've heard from us today and what you've heard from other people is that the ongoing overhang of economic uncertainties in Europe, which have been now prominent in the press, pretty hot and heavy since the middle of last fall straight through the spring are weighing on the customer's mind. And I think that's true of the local customers by country and to some degree, that's been masked by the tourist business in many of the key capitals. Depending on the brands that you're talking about, if you have a high penetration of Chinese tourists visiting the major capitals of Paris or London or Switzerland or Milan, that has inflated, I think, the European results. We don't happen to have, based on our small penetration in China, we don't happen to have that kind of Chinese tourists running through our European operations. While we do get a high degree of tourism, our major tourists are coming from the Middle East or Russia where we have strong presences, and then they find us in other European cities. So we think over time as we build our Chinese presence and we talked today about the 60 stores we plan on opening over the next 3 years, 15 in the back half of this year, we think our growing presence there at a luxury level will, in fact, begin to develop the tourist business in Europe and the United States that others are enjoying. So our results to date have been primarily based on the local markets and\/or tourism from other countries. We're  planning, based on our relationships with our key wholesale distribution, cautiously. They want to be tight with their inventory. They want to try to improve their turns. There's a great deal of uncertainty in the southern tier of Europe, particularly Spain. Italy has particular problems with their specialty distribution. The specialty channel there has gone through several turbulent years. And then the northern parts of Europe whether it's Germany, France, Scandinavia or the U.K. held up better last year and we believe will hold up better into the new year. But I think the constant overhang of economic concern and then what the corrections will be to manage that set of issues I think is what's dragging that market into a slower growth environment. So while we're planning growth, I think Tracey said it very clearly, we're just planning it more conservatively than we've done in the past. Against that, we continue to invest in e-commerce growth in that market. We launched in the U.K., France, Germany and we'll continue to look for that channel to grow. Quite frankly, the factory channel continues to perform well in Europe. But in our Ralph Lauren stores, we're seeing a softness that I think is a reflection of the local customer being cautious with their shopping in the near term. None of this dissuades us from our long-term ambitions in Europe. In '08 and '09, we took market share during a very difficult time. My hope is that we'll do that again, but we're very committed to the long-term distribution of Ralph Lauren in Europe and we'll continue for the right real estate. Maybe this economic environment creates opportunities either to get better access to property or maybe at a better price, or perhaps  some cases, to buy. So I think being nimble and being light on our feet in Europe will give us our long-term objective. The question is what happens over the near term. Clearly, the euro has suffered. So for us, that's an impact to us as it continues to kind of gyrate in the high 1.20s, low 1.30s. And we'll just see how that plays out as the year goes on.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Adrianne Shapira with Goldman Sachs.","Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Roger, you've proven that you do better when you're in control. We saw that in the '08, '09 downturn. And so with this clear ongoing shift to retail, my question is really twofold: one, as it relates to sales, help us think about how you're planning with wholesale down low singles versus retail up low doubles, how much of that is self-imposed as you shift to more retail; and then the second part of the question, how it relates to profitability. As you mentioned, productivity per square foot is accelerating. So how do we think about this mix shift impacting overall profitability?","Roger N. Farah","Yes, Adrianne, I mean we've operated under the belief consistent with what you just said that whether it's controlling a license or controlling a region that our commitment to doing it right over the long term has paid off. The shift in distribution channel from wholesale to retail or concession shops, primarily in Asia to owned, I think has served us well in terms of communicating to the customer in its purest way. And so I think you saw comp stores last year that were extraordinary at 14%, on top of the year before that of 10% and years and years of compounding have given us very high sales productivity. That, in turn, has given us  very strong profitability in retail. Those of you who have followed our story for a long time know that we started from a very low point and we've made a pretty amazing progress. Our point of view is that in Asia particularly, where there's not an appropriate or robust distribution channel, our future depends on our ability to run our shop-in-shops or run direct retail. Now the margins in retail, even at the high levels we're at today where our hopes of getting them higher are not quite as high as our wholesale margins, which are extraordinary. The inventories will turn slower. There'll be capital involved, but we believe over the long haul, our ability to take our message directly to the customer in brick-and-mortar or e-commerce really is the foundation of our future growth. The other issue, which I'll just mention, and I think you all know this, but as cost of goods begin to improve and inbound receipts begin to return to a more normalized level, we're very pleased with our decision a year ago not to change the quality and not to change our sourcing strategy, and I think the customer reacted to that quality. But those inbound receipts come in and turn faster in our wholesale segment where the margins will begin to recover sooner. In retail where the inventory turns slower, it's a combination of the on hand and the new receipts. And as they turn through the year, the margin will begin to rise. So the rate of margin improvement cycles through different at wholesale and retail because it's not the inbound receipt that's driving margin. It's the margin on what you sell. So if the wholesale goods are turning 5 or 6 or 7x a year and retail's turning 2 or 3 or 4 depending on the format, the wholesale margins will recover faster followed by the retail margin. So that's an important nuance to the way the year lays out.","Operator","We'll go next to Liz Dunn with Macquarie.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","I guess I'm wondering about your sort of awareness with the Chinese customer, the consumer. Is the reason that you don't have as much of that business in Europe just that the business hasn't been positioned well there? And what -- other than just distribution in China and getting the right locations, what other steps are you taking to increase your awareness with the Chinese consumer?","Roger N. Farah","Okay, Liz. The reality is that we had a licensee that was based in Hong Kong for many, many years. And with that, his focus was on Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia and had very little distribution in Ralph Lauren products in China proper. What he did have was positioned as a casual sportswear brand primarily for men in B- and C-type locations. So our brand awareness over the last 10 or 15 years and the quality impression of our brand is very different than the way we see it here in the United States and Europe. So as those customers travel, they're looking for the brands that they have learned over the last 10 or 15 years signify quality and heritage, and their knowledge of our brand is much lower and incomplete. So we believe that not only will that grow business in China as we have the right kind of stores, but as we expose the customer through the store experiences, through marketing or through future Internet activities, they will then look for the brand when they travel around the world. Today, many of the luxury brands are reporting European sales of 25%, 30% or 40% to Chinese. Our Chinese tourist business in Europe is less than 2%. So we believe that we'll get the multiplier effect as we push out in China over the next 3 to 5 years.","Operator","We'll go next to Christian Buss with Credit Suisse.","Christian Buss - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the cadence of incremental investments over the balance of the year? Can you help us understand how you're planning to roll out some of the investments that you're talking about now?","Roger N. Farah","Okay, well, let me break the investments into a couple buckets. The primary international investments are being made in Asia and I think I said earlier that the bulk of the 15 stores that are being opened in China will be in the back end. That doesn't mean we're not spending money in the front half. So the opening date is really the culmination of the spending. So in that case, back-side openings will be front-side spending. The ongoing investments in the Internet are really 12 months of the year whether that's distribution and logistics here in the United States or the ramp-up in building as we go to a full launch in Japan. So that's spending in advance of the revenue will be for the first 9 months. Separately, the ongoing investments in technology, infrastructure and systems is really a 12-month cycle and should be evenly spread through the year. So I guess the sum of all that is more investment spending in the early part of the year culminating with openings or launching in the fall, and we get the revenue in the back half of the year.","Operator","We'll go next to Jeff Klinefelter with Piper Jaffray.","Jeffrey P. Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Just curious, a little bit more color on the domestic business, the wholesale business, given the strong spring we had in the industry, the apparent interest in color, which seems to play very well into your brand -- your brands. Wondering,  puts and takes kind of, Roger, by category. You have some new categories that are gaining distribution. What about kind of the organic or heritage categories? Any movement in the number of doors that you're in or floor space would be helpful.","Roger N. Farah","Okay, Jeff. I would say that you're correct. We've had a very strong domestic performance with our wholesale partners at their retail. And putting aside the way Easter falls within our fiscal reporting because, as you know, the March, April time period for us is split between fourth quarter and first quarter. For most other people, not. We've enjoyed our strongest businesses this spring in our heritage and core businesses like men's. That's had a very strong spring. The children's business has had a strong spring. Lauren has begun to perform better in sportswear, but we've had a very strong business in dresses. Jacki talked about accessory and footwear. So we're really seeing broad-based strength in the performance of our products at retail. The domestic retailer continues to operate with a mindset towards conservatism in terms of inventory and turn, but nevertheless, we've had a strong spring. As you mentioned, color plays well for us as a brand. And I really do believe, based on our last couple of experiences with Olympic products, it will be a very exciting lead up through the August Olympics. So we think domestically, we are well positioned in the core product categories. Denim & Supply, it's the first spring we're in the market. We have added to the distribution of our handbag and accessory businesses, so those are beginning to roll out. I think Jacki quoted a doubling of the doors in our handbag and accessories from this time last year. We're also beginning to see traction in our ownership of the home business. I think our partnerships with the department stores and their confidence in the way we've taken licenses and repositioned them, I think people are beginning to get excited about the opportunities at home here in the domestic market. So lots of good things in the core, and the new businesses are beginning to get traction and door count.","Operator","We'll go next to Faye Landes with Consumer Edge Research.","Faye I. Landes - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","Two quick questions, one more technical. But the first as follows: first of all, Roger, you've spoken before of volatility in -- relative volatility quarter-to-quarter -- week-to-week, rather, in your U.S. retail especially in gateway cities and in flagship stores. You've talked about that in the last several calls. I was hoping you could address that. And then the more technical question is it appears that you've bought back few, if any, shares in this quarter and I was hoping you could address that given your general enthusiasm for the share buyback.","Roger N. Farah","Okay, Faye. I'll start with the week-to-week. The predictability of the trend lines really post the recession has been different than probably prerecession. The consumer mentality, I think, in the last 2 years while in aggregate has been spectacular, I think they're more careful about their spending. I think they're more selective. I think they're looking for great product, but maybe the great piece or the great item or the great accessory. I do believe they're buying close to the need. So some of the weather patterns has affected the business. It was spectacularly warm earlier in the year and then it got cold, and I think the customer has exhibited a sensitivity to that, that we probably didn't see before. The other part of your question is the gateway cities where the United States has seen important tourist activities, where Florida was particularly hurt during the recession. It has come back and some of that has been fueled by the tremendous tourist business from the Brazilians. When we track by country where our international tourist business is here in the United States, the Brazilians rank very, very high, not only in Florida but in New York. So we see tourism not only affecting the travel patterns and the shopping in Europe. We see it here in the United States. The more technical part of your question, which is our strategy to return excess capital to the shareholder. As we've talked about in the past, Tracey and I have said our first priority is investing back into our business if we think we can get a return, and I think we've done that well over the years and we expect to do that into the new year and beyond. Our second alternative, assuming we've done that properly, is to take excess cash and return it to shareholders either through dividends or share buyback. And I think you've seen, as our cash flows have grown over the last couple  years, we've done that pretty aggressively. I think today's announcement to double the dividend again, third year in a row we've doubled the dividend, I think, reinforces our commitment to return money to shareholders in the most efficient way we think is appropriate. And I think you'll see in fiscal '13 a combination of this more aggressive dividend and share repurchase going back to the shareholder if we don't have a proper use for it. We're clearly holding a lot of cash in our balance sheet. We have very little debt. We did that proactively through the recession. At this point, with early reads on interest rates staying low for a long time, my guess is we'll look to return excess capital to the shareholders both ways throughout the year.","Operator","We'll take our final question from Barbara Wyckoff with CLSA.","Barbara Wyckoff - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Can you talk about the accessory penetration, where can it go over time? And also opportunities in categories outside of handbags and small leather goods.","Roger N. Farah","Okay, Barbara. We don't quote percentages, but I would say that whether we're talking about the Ralph Lauren level of accessories or whether we're talking about a Lauren or Polo level of accessories, the company is putting a lot of time, energy and money to distort those categories. We've clearly developed multiple tiers and multiple channels for our apparel, but we're very focused on the right distribution in product and accessories. Then the question always becomes how do you to define accessories? Does that include eyewear, and does that include watches and jewelry and handbags, small leather goods, belts, scarves? Interestingly, because I know, Barbara, you go in the store up the street on 72nd, we devoted the entire main floor to our accessory area, which for us is a future direction but does not read the same way in many of our former stores. Some of the real strong categories there have been the belts, scarves and footwear, things that in the past don't seem to get the same kind of attention that perhaps handbags and small leather goods go to. So we're finding the customer has a real appetite for Ralph's design sensibility across all product categories. And, of course, we're in the early stages of developing watches, which, if you travel the world, has been one of the strongest growth categories for luxury companies everywhere. And while that's a long process to do that, we have some spectacular watches that are beginning to get traction with the largest single store in the world for us in watches being Macau. And I think that gives you a sense of the upside to some of these product categories as we reinforce that with our commitment to the Asian market.","So with that, operator, I apologize. We've run a little late. It was the end of year, and I thought it deserved a little extra attention in the prepared remarks. Just a spectacular year on every level. We started the year with some concerns as we do again this year, but it was a spectacular year. I think the team really maximized the opportunity in the Ralph Lauren brand in the Ralph Lauren way, and we're excited about the new year. So we thank you for your interest and your attention. We look forward to updating you in August. Thank you.","Operator","And that concludes today's conference.

Welcome to the Ralph Lauren Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. James Hurley. Please go ahead.","James Hurley","Good morning, and thank you for joining us on Ralph Lauren's Second Quarter Fiscal 2015 Conference Call. The agenda for this morning's call includes Jacki Nemerov, our President and Chief Operating Officer, who will provide an overview of the quarter and comment on our broader strategic initiative. Chris Peterson, our Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer, will provide operational and financial perspective on the second quarter, in addition to reviewing our outlook for the balance of the year. After the company's prepared remarks, we will open the call up to your questions, which we ask that you please limit to one per caller.","During today's call, we will be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including our financial outlook. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees and our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Our expectations contain many risks and uncertainties. The principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from our current expectations are detailed in our SEC filings.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jacki.","Jackwyn L. Nemerov","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. The better-than-expected second quarter results we are reporting today demonstrate the progress we continue to make on each of our core strategic growth objectives. Revenue growth of 4% included sustained double-digit expansion for our international and our worldwide e-commerce businesses, as well as the successful launch of our newest brand, Polo for women. Diluted EPS of $2.25 was better than we anticipated, largely due to the disciplined operational management of our teams around the world.","We are especially proud of these results in light of the challenging global operating environment during the quarter. The U.S. dollar strengthened against several major currencies, and geopolitical tensions escalated in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and parts of Asia. Collectively, these events had a negative impact on global tourism, and in certain instances, have also weighed on local customer demand.","The highlight of our second quarter was, of course, the global introduction of Polo for women. This natural complement to our iconic Polo men's lines allows us to present the brand to consumers at retail in an even more powerful way. The launch of Polo for women coincided with the opening of our first Polo flagship store on Fifth Avenue in New York City, but the voice and the impact of the brand was felt around the world, and the product message amplified by nearly 400 new Polo women's shops.","We kicked off fashion week in New York with a groundbreaking 4D fashion show in Central Park, featuring the Spring 2015 Women's Polo collection. Staged over 3 consecutive nights, the show was a holographic, cinematic runway experience projected onto a 60-foot wall of water that was unlike anything the industry or the consumer has seen before. Thanks to the impact of the event itself and the global reach of RalphLauren.com, the show has achieved nearly 120 million social media impressions and over 2 billion media impressions to date.","The high awareness, recognition and appeal of Polo has translated seamlessly to the women's offering, and the response has been terrific. The product is outstanding, the assortment is distinctive, and we believe that Polo for women fills a whitespace in the market around the world. We've spoken in the past about the creation of a global merchandising organization and the consistency of assortment and presentation around the world speaks to this relatively new team's remarkable results. I'd like to recognize the hard work of our design, merchandising, supply chain, retail, visual presentation, advertising, marketing and public relations teams for their extraordinary contributions to this important launch.","For those of you who may not have yet had a chance to see the new Fifth Avenue Polo flagship, I encourage you to do so. Our team has done a spectacular job and the store is the perfect stage on which the depth and impact of the Polo brand story comes to life. The store brings brand heritage, lifestyle sensibility and product innovation together in a way that both clearly defines the Polo women's offering and perfectly complements the men's offering. The fits, fabrications and fashion elements of the women's and men's line are resonating strongly with the younger customer our associates see in the store. Speaking to the global appeal of the Polo brand, 40% of the store sales to date have been to foreign customers.","In addition to the Fifth Avenue flagship, we have opened 20 stores in the first half of the year, and are on track to achieve our accelerated store development plans across our portfolio. We opened a Polo store in Shaw Centre in Singapore, and this is just the starting point, as we will be expanding Polo thoughtfully over the next few years, with a store in Las Vegas that opened this week, another in Houston set to open for the holiday season and a flagship on Regent Street in London in the first half of 2016.","We have also opened a spectacular Ralph Lauren luxury flagship in Hong Kong's Causeway Bay Lee Gardens shopping district. This 20,000 square-foot store showcases our full range of women's and men's apparel, an exceptional presentation of accessories and footwear, a watch and fine jewelry salon, a beautiful collection of decorative accessories and gifts from our home collection, and a special vintage offering. Our expanding retail presence in Asia not only has a positive impact on our business, but also on our brand positioning with this consumer, both in the region and in other markets where they encounter our brand when they travel.","Our Club Monaco business continues to grow in major markets as well. During the quarter, we opened 2 Club Monaco stores in London, as well as a recently renovated and expanded location in Boston's Prudential Center, with additional stores opening in Miami and Montr\u00e9al later this year. The company plans to open an additional 20 to 25 stores in total across the portfolio over the next several months. And based on this accelerated store development activity, we expect to achieve a higher level of retail sales growth in the second half of the year.","We are also on track with the increased investments in advertising and marketing that were planned for the year, including more digital, print and social media around the world for both Polo and the Ralph Lauren brands. We expect these investments to support accelerated revenue growth in the back half of the year as well.","Speaking for a moment to the season that's upon us, I'm pleased to share that our fall merchandise assortments have been well received across product categories and distribution channels around the world. This is evidenced by strong sales boosts at wholesale accounts and improved conversion in our own stores. We have seen momentum with our luxury collections in men's Purple Label, Women's Collection and RRL, as well as strong performance for our Polo, Lauren and Denim & Supply brands.","Now I'd speak briefly about our next exciting endeavor, the global launch of Polo Sport. Polo Sport will be the next evolution of authentic modern activewear. As in everything we do, this line will unite the highest standards of quality and construction with our iconic approach to design, resulting in assortments that will take the consumer from field to street with workout essentials and sports apparel that ideally suit today's active lifestyle.","The Polo brand has always reflected an active spirit and sensibility, and our company is proud to be associated with some of the world's most admired sporting events and championships in the worlds of tennis, golf, polo and of course, the Olympics. The strong consumer response to these partnerships and products affirms our belief that our brand's credibility and potential in the active space is unique and powerful. The brand's introduction will focus on men's apparel, with our first delivery for fall '15 season. As you know, the active segment of the apparel market is growing at a tremendous rate, and we believe there is a significant long-term market share opportunity for Polo.","Our better-than-expected results for the first 6 months of fiscal 2015 demonstrates the strength of our brand and the resilience of our diversified operating model, both of which allow us to make substantial investments in our longer-term growth objectives. As Ralph said in this morning's press release, our sustained focus on growing our international presence, extending our global retail reach and innovating with new products, has always served us well. I do want to mention some of the macroeconomic pressures facing our industry.","As you know, growth has slowed for many of the world's largest economies, and we are closely monitoring both the global operating environment and the consumer reaction. We have set the bar high with respect to our sales plans for the year and believe in the strength of our rigorous planning process and our proven ability to carefully navigate through these kinds of challenges.","We have confidence in our product and marketing strategies, and the sophistication of our global supply chain and merchandising organization enables us to read and react to changes in market dynamics better than ever before. Our unwavering commitment to the quality of our product, the integrity of our brand and the unique value proposition they provide will be our competitive advantage for the upcoming holiday season.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Chris.","Christopher H. Peterson","Thank you, Jacki, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start with a brief recap of the quarter. Consolidated net revenues rose 4% to $2 billion in the second quarter. Growth was led by the retail segment, driven by our direct-to-consumer strategy. Every geographic region grew in the quarter, with the international business up double digits.","Adjusting for the incremental headwind from foreign exchange since early August, revenue growth was closer to 5%. Gross profit margin of 56.8% was 20 basis points above the prior year period due to favorable channel and geographic mix. Operating margin of 14.4% was 100 basis points below the prior year, and was significantly better than the outlook we provided in August due to strong and proactive operational management throughout the organization and a shift in the timing of certain expenses into the back half of the year. The operating margin decline was entirely attributable to incremental investments in new store openings, marketing and infrastructure projects.","Net income of $201 million was modestly below the prior year. Net income per diluted share rose 1% to $2.25 due to a reduction in diluted share count as the company continues to return capital to shareholders through its share repurchase program.","Moving on to segment performance. Wholesale revenues of $943 million were 2% above the prior year, reflecting growth in all geographic regions. Wholesale operating margin of 26.2% was in line with the prior year, as improved profitability for underlying operations was offset by incremental investments in advertising and marketing.","Retail sales rose 7% to $1 billion. Growth was driven by the incremental contribution from new stores and included double-digit growth for both the international retail business and global e-commerce operations. Comparable store sales increased 1% during the quarter, supported by strong e-commerce performance and improved conversion at brick-and-mortar stores, which continued to experience challenging traffic trends.","Retail operating margin was 13.6%, 80 basis points below the prior year period, reflecting costs associated with the company's global store and e-commerce development efforts, in addition to increased investments in advertising and marketing. Excluding those incremental investments, retail profitability improved from the prior year's level on strong international performance.","Licensing revenues and operating income each rose 2% in the second quarter, due to higher royalties from increased sales of Ralph Lauren, Polo and Lauren products. Consolidated inventory was $1.3 billion at the end of the quarter, reflecting investments to support anticipated sales growth for existing operations and new store openings. We spent approximately $91 million on capital expenditures in the second quarter, mostly to support new retail stores and infrastructure projects.","The company repurchased about 413,000 shares of its common stock, utilizing $70 million of its authorization and bringing year-to-date repurchase activity to $250 million. At the end of the quarter, $330 million remained available for future buybacks and we had $1.2 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet.","As we mentioned in August, we recently established the company's first commercial paper program and had $210 million of notes outstanding at the end of the quarter. We believe this is an attractive financing vehicle, since the cost to borrow is currently about 20 to 30 basis points.","We are pleased with our second quarter and year-to-date results, both in terms of financial performance and progress on all of our key growth initiatives. We achieved our sales objectives and delivered better-than-expected profitability, despite a challenging operating environment. The team's skill balancing near-term market realities and our commitment to our long-range goals is a defining characteristic of our organization.","Now let me turn to the fiscal year. Our fiscal 2015 plan calls for incremental investment in 3 key areas. The first is expanding our global store network, including important flagship projects. The second is strengthening our infrastructure, including implementing SAP and upgrading our e-commerce platform. And the third is increased advertising and marketing to support exciting new initiatives, such as the launch of Women's Polo, the opening of the Ralph Lauren Hong Kong flagship store and other high-profile store openings. Jacki talked about the progress on new stores and marketing initiatives. I would like to spend some time on our infrastructure projects.","We've made very good progress and are on track with our plans for the year. Our global design, merchandising and sourcing operations have now fully transitioned to SAP, as has most of the North America wholesale business. We expect to complete the North America wholesale transition over the next several months. Based on the successful results to date, we recently kicked off the project for Europe, which we plan to complete over the next 18 months. We expect the SAP project to lead to both revenue growth and margin improvement opportunities over time as the project is fully implemented.","We are also making excellent progress on a multiyear project to upgrade our global e-commerce platform. Today, we work with a single partner who manages the front end of our e-commerce sites. That front end includes our core commerce, content management and order management functionality. We handle the back end, essentially fulfillment, distribution and customer care, ourselves. Over the next 2 to 3 years, we're working toward assuming more direct control of that front end. This will allow us to significantly improve the consumer shopping experience, enable omnichannel capabilities and reduce cost versus our current structure.","To do this, we recently completed a vendor evaluation process and have now selected the software providers we'll use for our core commerce, content management and order management functions, as well as a systems integration consultant.","We're investing in new talent and capabilities so we can manage application development and systems integration in-house going forward. This will enable us to be far more nimble in responses -- and responsive to changes in technology and consumer behavior, allowing us to deliver a best-in-class customer experience that is uniquely Ralph Lauren.","It's an exciting evolution and a critical investment, considering the growing importance of e-commerce worldwide. We expect a strong return on investment for this project and will provide more quantitative perspective once we have completed the fiscal 2016 budget process.","Now I'd like to turn to the outlook for fiscal '15. On a constant dollar basis, we are maintaining our outlook for the year. That being said, foreign exchange rates have become a substantial headwind over the last 3 months. As a result, we now expect reported revenue growth of 5% to 7% for fiscal 2015, which reflects about 100 basis point negative impact from FX that is concentrated in the second half of the year. The full year fiscal 2015 operating margin is still estimated to be approximately 75 to 125 basis points below fiscal 2014's level, attributable to accelerated investment in our strategic growth initiatives.","Based on current foreign exchange rates, we expect operating margin to be at the mid to low end of that range since our unallocated corporate costs are incurred in U.S. dollars. The full year tax rate is estimated at 30%. For the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we expect consolidated net revenues to increase by 3% to 5%, led by retail segment growth and including a 200 basis point headwind from foreign exchange rates. Operating margin for the third quarter is expected to be approximately 100 to 150 basis points below the prior year period, due to higher cost of goods and incremental investments in the company's strategic growth initiatives.","The third quarter tax rate is estimated at 30%. Our priorities are clear, and we have both the talent and the financial strength to attain them. The company has a long-standing track record of success in executing its strategies. We are excited about what we expect to achieve over the next several years as we continue to focus our capital and managerial resources on the most compelling long-term opportunities. As Ralph said in this morning's press release, we believe the investments we are making today will create significant value for our shareholders over the long term.","At this point, we'd like to open the call up for your questions. Operator, can you assist us with that, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Omar Saad with ISI Group.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask a broader question around the broader retail strategy and what's going on in that piece of the business. And if you look back over the last several quarters, it's kind of been trending around a low single digit flattish comp sometimes. But I know you've got a lot of new retail rollout plans, the new Polo store on Fifth Avenue, and you had some pretty significant openings recently. Maybe you can give -- put this in context of how you expect the retail business to unfold over time and perhaps even an update on how some of the new stores in China and on Fifth Avenue and Singapore are doing to date would be helpful.","Christopher H. Peterson","Sure. Thanks, Omar. Let me start with the Fifth Avenue store. So I think the response to the Fifth Avenue Polo store, which has been open about 1.5 months, has really been excellent, with broad-based acceptance of icons and fashion pieces. Interestingly, the Women's Polo business is representing about half of the sales of that store, which we are very encouraged by, because we think that the Women's Polo launch gives us another leg to the stool for the Polo retail strategy, and we're seeing strong response to that product. We're also seeing, as Jacki mentioned, about 40% of the sales go to foreign tourists in that store. And so we're seeing a strong resonance of Polo product with the foreign tourist. And the other interesting point I would say on that is that the #1 tourist shopper now in the United States is the Chinese, which we also think is encouraging, given the size of the Chinese consumer in the global market. We are very underpenetrated in China. And as you know, a lot of our retail strategy focuses on getting a broader penetration in international markets where we're -- that are more whitespace for us. And so we're excited to see the strong product acceptance among the Chinese consumer. More broadly, on the Polo store strategies, I think it's still a little bit early days. We've just launched the Polo Women's line. What we're seeing on the Polo Women's line is that the AUR, or the average unit retail price, on Women's Polo is about 40% lower than Blue Label, which we discontinued. But what we're seeing initially is that the unit velocity is dramatically higher. And so we expect the sales volume for Polo for women to far outpace that of the women's Blue Label line as we go forward. And we're seeing early good signs of that as we go along. We've only got about 5 directly operated Polo stores opened at this point, but we have a significant -- significantly greater number planned over the next 6 to 12 months, and we'll continue to learn as we open those.","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Strycula with UBS.","Steven Strycula - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got a question for Chris regarding SAP. Wanted to see, given your experience in prior SAP implementations, just how you think about this in greater detail over the long term? You spoke to it a little bit in the early part of your call, but could you address maybe how this impacts your gross margins and SG&A efficiency longer term?","Christopher H. Peterson","Sure. So I think we're through the point where we've implemented SAP, and I think we've done a very good job of not dropping the ball from the implementation of SAP. So the transactional systems, the data conversion rates, the ability of the system to operate at scale, we feel highly confident in at this point. I think the next phase of the journey is beginning to realize some of the financial benefits. One of the things that we're very excited about is the -- what SAP is going to enable in terms of allowing us to operate on a more global basis. So for the first time, now, recently, in the last month or 2, we now have visibility to the number of SKUs that we're creating around the world and the SKU overlap because we now have common style numbers. And we believe we have a significant opportunity through our global merchandising organization to drive greater brand consistency around the world by improving the SKU -- by rationalizing our SKU base as we go forward. If you think about that rationalization of the SKU base, that has significant margin and revenue improvement opportunities for us, because what it will allow us to do is focus our design and merchandising efforts on the SKUs that we believe are the highest potential sellers. It allows us to manufacture at a higher scale per SKU. It allows us to reduce inventory going forward. It should allow us to have lower markdown rates, and it should allow us to market more -- in a more common way around the world. And so we're very excited about the prospects that the SAP system will enable. Now, it will take time to fully flush through our system. The first season that we're working on for SKU reduction is fall of 2015 because we tend to design 9 months out. So we're expecting to see initial benefits toward the back half of next fiscal year, and we expect the benefits to grow from that point.","Operator","The next question comes from Kate McShane with Citi Research.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I wondered if you could clarify, Chris, your commentary in the outlook of higher cost of goods in Q3. Is that sequentially going to be higher from what we saw in Q2? And how should we think about that going into Q4? And just as a longer-term part of the question, can you update us on any refinements in the supply chain that you are working on that can ease some of the rising costs we're seeing over the longer term?","Christopher H. Peterson","Sure. So I think on the higher cost of goods, I think this is a reflection of some of the investments that we're making in the season to move some of the production into Italy for some of our more luxury-oriented lines, invest more in the product quality, as well as -- which we believe is important to elevate the product. And that's really what we're talking about in terms of higher cost of goods that we expect in the third quarter. There also is a piece in the third quarter of product mix that we expect to impact the gross margin a little bit in the third quarter. But I don't view this as a sustainable trend. I view this as sort of a -- more of a one-off, so to speak. But we thought, given that we saw that trend, that we should mention it to The Street on the call so that it wasn't a surprise after the fact.","Jackwyn L. Nemerov","And regarding the supply chain, what we have recently done is taken our manufacturing, sourcing and supply chain distribution organizations and consolidated that under a single leadership. And what we're seeing is that there is now a seamless view from start of manufacturing through delivery of our customers. And what we are working on and seeing quickly is that there are some important benefits by that close-tied relationship from start to finish, from factory to delivery to our stores and our customers. And we're just beginning to identify and recognize those opportunities.","Operator","The next question comes from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to follow-up on your full year guidance, your 3Q guidance and what that implies for 4Q as it relates to revenue. The pace of revenue growth in the fourth quarter, how much of that is a function of your store openings? And any visibility you have as far as what your forward order book might look like for the spring season, particularly in light of all the pressure we're seeing retailers feel right now.","Christopher H. Peterson","Yes. So I think we've got very good visibility to our bookings through the balance of the year. And I think it's that visibility that we have in our bookings through the balance of the year, coupled with the accelerated pace of new store openings, that's factored into our guidance of accelerating revenue growth in the back half of the year, and in particular in the fourth quarter. Of course, the retail segment is a little bit more volatile depending on consumer traffic patterns, macroeconomic trends and consumer spending patterns. And so we're staying very close to that and monitoring it in a read-and-react fashion. But I think you've hit it right, which is the visibility we have in the wholesale bookings, which is pretty good at this point, coupled with the accelerated pace of retail store openings, is what's factored into our guidance for the balance of the year.","Operator","The next question comes from Christian Buss with Credit Suisse.","Christian Buss - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So I was wondering if you could provide some perspective on how you're thinking about the development of your supply chain when it comes to lead times. One of the things we've been thinking about is faster lead times becoming a responsibility for every vendor. Could you talk about what you're doing in that regard?","Christopher H. Peterson","Sure. So I think one of the things we're looking at is our cycle time. And I think it's what Jacki meant -- talked about when she was talking about the combination of our global manufacturing and sourcing group with our supply chain group. By putting those 2 groups together, we're taking an end-to-end look at the time from design to the products being on the floor in the store. And in some cases, our current cycle time makes sense because it's optimized for cost and responsiveness to the consumer demand. In other cases, we believe that there could be an opportunity to accelerate cycle time so that we're more responsive to consumer demand and we can read and react on a faster basis. And I think one of the benefits that SAP is going to give us is even better visibility into those types of decisions going forward. So it's early days, because we've just combined these organizations and we're just in the middle of the SAP implementation. But it's certainly something that we are looking at actively. And we're not looking at it on a one-size-fits-all basis. We're looking at it very much on a product category basis.","Jackwyn L. Nemerov","Christian, also let me add that the SKU count initiative and the dramatic reduction that we're looking at there also, we believe, combines to give us tremendous agility. And in terms of what we're managing and how our teams are managing it broadly from design through delivery, and that would be also an important outcome of that initiative.","Operator","The next question comes from Evren Kopelman with Wells Fargo.","Evren Dogan Kopelman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Could you give a little bit more color on the geographical basis on your retail comp, international versus U.S.? And then in the U.S., maybe a little bit more color on how outlets did relative to full price.","Christopher H. Peterson","Sure. So we saw, on a comp basis in our retail business that internationally, we -- our comps were up low to mid single-digits. In the international business, we had double-digit comp growth in the e-commerce business in the quarter. In the U.S. business, the comps were relatively flat. And the channel that continued to experience the most challenge was the U.S. factory outlet business, where traffic to the outlet channel in the U.S. continued to be down. We did see an improvement in conversion, in our case, in that channel, which muted some of that traffic decline in the outlet business. Interestingly, in the international outlet business, traffic was up, and our comp store sales growth was up in that channel outside the U.S.","Operator","The next question comes from Dave Weiner with Deutsche Bank.","David Weiner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So I was wondering, Chris, you had talked earlier about -- you gave some color on the different expense buckets, and that was helpful. I guess, if we think about those in their totality, can you give a little color on maybe what the cadence of that might look like going forward? And then, kind of related to that, you talked about the launch of Polo Sport. Could you maybe just dig a little into that in terms of what we should expect there from the expense side as well?","Christopher H. Peterson","So, on the expense side, I think that, as we mentioned a little bit earlier, I think the peak expense pressure from the SG&A cost of the new store investments, the marketing investments and the infrastructure investments was really in the second quarter that we're reporting today. That being said, the dollar impact, that's from a margin standpoint, the dollar impact is going to be a little bit higher in the third quarter and the fourth quarter, but we expect that not to have as great a margin pressure because of the accelerated pace of revenue growth in the third and fourth quarter. And so that's sort of how we're looking at it playing out during the fiscal year. So we expect the SG&A pressure to moderate in the third and fourth quarter versus what we saw in the second quarter from the incremental investments. On Polo Sport, I think Jacki sort of touched on it. We were very excited about this initiative because we think it gets us into a very large, fast-growing part of the apparel business. Our first launch is going to be for fall of next year, so this is a fall of next year launch. And we're really focused at the launch on the Men's business and we're focused on launching in our stores, in e-commerce and in select department and specialty stores around the world. So more to come in terms of quantification of that opportunity as we get closer to the launch date.","Operator","The next question comes from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I guess I have a question for Jacki. I know millennials have been a group that you guys have been focused on, and it seems like the Polo Women's launch is definitely helping to tap into that. Did that change how you're thinking about Denim & Supply longer term? Would just love an update on how that brand has been trending at wholesale.","Jackwyn L. Nemerov","Interesting, it's -- we're finding that the Polo Women's product definitely has an appeal to the millennial customer. And it is evidenced, clearly, if you stand in Fifth Avenue and you watch the audience who is buying that product, which was an important target for us as a company. So we really believe and see that we are realizing that result sort of as we are observing the results. The Denim & Supply product is doing extraordinarily well, although it has a more narrow distribution in a few stores that we've opened to date. And then more broadly, in wholesale internationally and of course, in the U.S. with Macy's. So the results have been fantastic on the brand, and the -- the audience is similar, however, the expression of the products are very different. The Polo Women's product really speaks to the, sort of the young preppiness, but with a twist and a very relevant to today's trend for that customer. And Denim & Supply has a much more -- a bohemian style about it, much more of a freestyle. And so they're quite differentiated when you look at the product. Both doing well and both really hitting their target audience.","Operator","The next question comes from Joan Payson with Barclays.","Joan Payson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","With some concerns out there around Europe recently, I was wondering if you could maybe speak more in detail to that business, either how it's been trending recently or if there have been any recent changes by region?","Christopher H. Peterson","Sure. So, I think we were very pleased with the performance we had in Europe in the quarter. Our revenue was up high single digits in Europe in the quarter. We had our retail business grew double digits, and our wholesale business was up low single digits. If you look within Europe, I think we continue to see strength in the U.K. and Northern Europe. But importantly, we've seen a stabilization in Southern Europe that's contributed to a return to fairly strong growth in that region.","Operator","The next question comes from Barbara Wyckoff with CLSA.","Barbara Wyckoff - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Can you talk about what strategies you're planning to offset declining outlet traffic? And why do you think that the traffic continues to be tough? And then the follow-on to that, what posture you're taking in Macy's and other department stores with the continued price promotion focus.","Christopher H. Peterson","Sure. I'll handle the outlet question. So from an outlet question, I think that what we're doing is a couple of things. Number one, we're focused on increasing and making our marketing investments more relevant and more targeted to that outlet shopper to try to have call-to-action advertising that drives traffic into the center and our stores in the center. And I think that is helping mitigate a little bit the traffic trend in the U.S. outlet channel, which I would differentiate from the international outlet channel. That being said, I think longer term, what we believe is that with the expansion of the e-commerce business, we believe some of those e-commerce shoppers are choosing to shop online rather than drive to the outlet. And so we do believe there is a cannibalization impact that's impacting the outlet channel. And we think that it's important for us to play in both channels, and it's important for us to focus on both driving traffic in both channels and improving conversion in both channels.","Jackwyn L. Nemerov","We also believe that with the gas price reduction and the fact that it often takes an hour to drive to an outlet mall, that, that also will provide some relief to the channel and could be an important differentiator as we move forward. In terms of price promotion at the department stores, I guess I've been doing this so long that it doesn't feel like it's any different to me. We have navigated through this season after season, through -- with every customer. We work hard to stay out of the fray and to guide our results based on our performance and product. As I said, I think we're happy with where we are for the fall season and we feel very comfortable as we guide ourselves into holiday and spring that we are well set up for the right appeal of product to our customers. So as I said, I don't feel it's any different than it's ever been before. And I think that, as I said, we are confident in how we move into the holiday season.","Operator","The next question comes from Rick Patel with Stephens.","Rick B. Patel - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Just a question on China e-commerce. I think you're still in investment mode right now. Can you give us an update on where you are? I'm curious on how you're positioned to take advantage of the growing demand in that side of the world as consumers embrace your concepts.","Christopher H. Peterson","Yes. So, we are early days on that. We just turned on in June of this year our Hong Kong e-commerce website that has ship to capability to a number of markets in Southeast Asia. We have not yet penetrated the Mainland China e-commerce business. We also, I would point out, just recently turned on social media in China as part of our increase in marketing and advertising spending this year, which we're very excited about. We are, of course, investigating how to approach and tackle the e-commerce business in Mainland China, given the size and growth of that business. But we have -- we're working through what we believe is the right business model, and we'll update you as we make decisions on that.","Operator","The final question comes from Rick Snyder with Maxim Group.","Rick L. Snyder - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","You indicated in the first quarter that there was a revenue shift in wholesale to Q2 in the U.S. And I'm looking at the wholesale growth, and it's only up 1.6%. I think it's a net loss for the quarter. Can you just talk about that shift? And did it play out as you expected?","Christopher H. Peterson","Yes. So, I think one of the challenges is that our financial quarters don't line up nicely to the seasons. And so what we tend to look at is the spring\/summer season, and then we look at the fall\/holiday season. And what our focus is on the wholesale channel is growing market share. And so as we looked at how we closed out the spring\/summer season, which included Q4 of last year, Q1 of this year and Q2 of this year, our wholesale business globally grew faster than the wholesale channel, and we grew market share in the channel over that period. We believe that we have a very strong plan for fall\/holiday, that we have confidence we'll continue to grow our market share in the channel. There can be quarterly shifts in timing of shipments related to that, that follow wholesale customer receipt plans, but we tend to be more focused on the season basis than on the quarter basis is how we look at it.","James Hurley","Great. Thank you very much for calling in today and participating.","Jackwyn L. Nemerov","Thank you.","Christopher H.

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Now for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. James Hurley. Please go ahead, sir.","James Hurley","Good morning, and thank you for joining us on Ralph Lauren's Third Quarter Fiscal 2013 Conference Call. The agenda for this morning's call includes Roger Farah, our President and Chief Operating Officer, who will give you an overview of the quarter and comment on some of our broader strategic initiatives; Jacki Nemerov, our Executive Vice President, will provide some merchandising highlights; and Chris Peterson, our Chief Financial Officer, will provide operational and financial details for the third quarter, in addition to reviewing our expectations for fiscal 2013. After that, we will open up the call for your questions, which we please ask that you limit to one per caller.","During today's call, we will be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including our financial outlook. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees, and our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Our expectations contain many risks and uncertainties. The principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from our current expectations are detailed in our SEC filings.","And now I'll turn the call over to Roger.","Roger N. Farah","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to be reporting better-than-expected third quarter and year-to-date profits this morning. Operating income rose 17% and diluted earnings per share was up 35%, excluding the Rugby-related charges, on sales growth of 2% in the third quarter. The strong profit flow-through really showcases the operational excellence of our global teams. Proactive and prudent planning, including thoughtful pricing and merchandise strategies, and disciplined expense management enabled us to improve our profitability despite sustained macroeconomic issues and several disruptive events in the 3-month period.","During the quarter, revenue momentum was strongest at RalphLauren.com, Club Monaco, factory stores worldwide and our core North America wholesale operations. These top line trends were enhanced by excellent margin dynamics, a clear indication that we are gaining profitable market share in areas we are already very strong.","We also experienced better trends out of Europe, where third quarter revenues increased 8% in constant currency led by growth at our retail operations. Momentum in the Americas and in Europe more than made up for the weakness in Japan and South Korea concession shops during the quarter. Club Monaco had a strong worldwide performance, a function of strong comp growth and expanded distribution, which is now included in the wholesale channel in Europe and e-commerce in North America. Both new and loyal customers are gravitating towards Club Monaco's compelling and unique merchandise assortments and the in-store experience.","Our year-to-date results demonstrate that fiscal '13 is actualizing as the tale of 2 halves we described to you at the beginning of the year. Higher input costs and certain strategic decisions that weighed on sales and profit growth in the first half have transitioned to an improving profit growth story in the second half, supported by lower input costs, continued market share gains in North America and the incremental contribution of new stores and e-commerce platforms. This is happening even as we continue to make important investments in our long-term strategic growth initiatives.","We've made good progress on our core initiatives, which are focused on the revenue side on extending our direct-to-customer reach, expanding our international presence and innovating with new merchandise categories in the year-to-date period while investing in our world-class infrastructure, supported by a fortress balance sheet.","Our focus on these strategies lead us to expect more of our future growth to come from our retail operations as we are allocating a growing portion of our capital investment to retail development. We are funneling resources to our highest potential opportunities, particularly in e-commerce and in Asia. We've had to make some hard choices in resource allocation and in the process, such as closing Rugby, we believe these thoughtful decisions position us better for future growth.","During the third quarter, we expanded our global e-commerce capabilities, leveraging our existing European sites to service Italy, Greece, Spain and Portugal. Today, we are servicing customers online in 11 countries throughout Europe. Two recent launches, Ralph Lauren in Japan and Club Monaco in North America, have gotten off to strong starts and confirm the growing importance of e-commerce. We continue to invest in this expanding online reach, particularly in Asia. Korea will be launched later this year, followed by China.","As this year's holiday industry sales figures attest to, the continued shift in the customers' preference to shop online is undeniable. Industry-wide, online sales expanded at double-digit rates as brick-and-mortar stores struggled with sluggish customer traffic trends. Sales on smartphones and tablets are growing at an even faster rate.","Traffic to RalphLauren.com from mobile devices was up 35% in the third quarter and gained 500 basis points of sales penetration compared to the prior year. The tremendous growth of our brand sales online is not limited to our own sites. We have experienced excellent growth with our most important wholesale customers, and we continue to invest in deepening those partnerships as e-commerce becomes more important to them.","The incredible dynamism of e-commerce requires that we continually reinvest in upgrading the customer experience and improving customer service levels in all aspects of the business, particularly in people, technology, infrastructure and marketing. With the continued strong growth of our North American e-commerce operations, we have made the determination to intensify our support of the business by purchasing our distribution center in North Carolina, and beginning a project to double the size and capacity of the facility to over 800,000 square feet.","We are contemplating our e-commerce efforts with the continued expansion of our brick-and-mortar store network. Our more recent store development efforts have primarily focused on marquee locations that appropriately showcase our most elevated Purple Label and Black Label assortments worldwide.","Based on the tremendous demand of our Polo, women's Blue Label and children's merchandise, we believe there is a compelling global opportunity to open Polo Ralph Lauren stores that maximize the extraordinary appeal of these brands. Our past experiences suggest that when we are able to present our products in customized retail environments that really communicate Ralph's lifestyle vision, the customer rediscovers the World of Ralph Lauren in impactful new ways.","So beyond the obvious benefits to our global retail development efforts, we believe a more compelling showcase of creativity and innovation supporting Polo, women's Blue Label and Childrenswear would be positively received by our global customers.","The investments we've made to create the world's most fantastic shopping environments and enhanced customer service experiences, both online and off-line, has supported steady retail segment profit margin expansion over the last several years. The third quarter was no exception, with retail segment margins improving 60 basis points, excluding the Rugby charges. Improved profitability was achieved despite lackluster customer trends during the quarter. The 4% increase in global retail same-store sales is a testament to the success of our customer service and clienteling efforts, which ultimately delivered improved conversion and higher average dollar transaction size across most of our retail formats.","I believe our third quarter performance, particularly the strong profit flow-through, confirms the vitality of our brand, the relevance of our strategy and the world-class capabilities of our management team. Our robust profit growth demonstrates the strength of our operating model in the face of a unique set of challenges, particularly in the United States, where consumers were distracted by a highly contentious presidential election and tremendous anxiety regarding the fiscal cliff, and where we experienced considerable disruption from Superstorm Sandy.","I'd like to acknowledge the extraordinary effort of our organization in dealing with Sandy because I think the tremendous level of engagement and responsiveness really speaks to the heart and the character of our company. Ralph and I are proud of how our teams rallied to get the business back to normal in short order, especially during a time of significant personal disruption for many of them. And the team's energy wasn't just focused on the business, it was also channeled into helping out our colleagues in need and the communities in which we operate.","Hundreds of employee volunteers committed thousands of hours to assist the recovery and relief efforts. The company donated tens of thousands of essential garments and warm-weather items and the Lauren family, the Polo Ralph Lauren Foundation and our employees collectively donated over $2 million to a variety of charities dedicated to improving the lives of those affected by the storm. The resilience, passion and optimism that was evidenced in how our team managed through Sandy is an inspiring reminder of the remarkable fabric of our organization.","Chris will walk you through the outlook for the balance of the year and provide some perspective on how we are planning fiscal '14. But I want to underscore our commitment to investing in our key growth initiatives and our focus on monetizing those investments into strong returns for our shareholders.","As Ralph said in this morning's press release, we have a successful track record of investing for growth. And with $1.4 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet, we certainly have the liquidity profile to stay the course with our key initiatives.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to Jacki.","Jackwyn L. Nemerov","Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. As our third quarter results attest, we had a superb holiday season. The power of Ralph's vision and the strength of our product gave us the confidence to plan for robust growth across all distribution channels and in key regions, particularly in our core merchandise categories.","Despite the weak operating environment that Roger spoke about earlier, the loyalty our brand enjoys is unique. And based on our third quarter performance, I think it is fair to say that our confidence paid off.","As I mentioned in November, we were executing a two-pronged merchandising strategy to capture both self-purchase and giftgiving occasions. We offered exceptional merchandise across all product categories from the most luxurious items at our Ralph Lauren stores to robust assortments in department stores worldwide, thereby effectively leveraging the powerful equity and universal desirability of our brand.","Our holiday bright story was extremely successful and beautifully combined strong fashion pieces, key items for a cohesive offering that struck just the right chord with the consumer. This approach was highly effective, particularly for our core men's, women's and children's offerings. Across all brand tiers, the strength of the product, the clarity of our key item strategies and the compelling value  proposition clearly resonated with the customer.","As we've become a more globally-oriented company, our merchandising teams are achieving an increasingly stronger and more consistent product message while still responding to important regional considerations for fabrics, weight, color and fit. Based on our success this holiday season, I believe that greater global coordination of our merchandising teams is something we will continue to leverage.","How our product is presented to the customer is another important focus for us since this is where Ralph's vision truly comes to life. Our strong collaboration with both retail and wholesale partners ensure that our product and merchandising strategies were supported by best-in-class in-store and online presentations, as well as spectacular advertising and marketing that we believe contributed to excellent sell-throughs.","Beyond the Ralph Lauren brand, our Chaps brand also had a very successful holiday season. Customers were drawn to its updated classic American appeal that was expressed through a fully-coordinated merchandising strategy across multiple product categories. Our regional merchandising tactics were particularly effective in driving great success in warm weather markets.","Women's was especially strong, driven by trend-right fashions and colors and wear-now fabrications. I believe the momentum of Chaps is a clear demonstration of how perhaps even more in times of uncertainty, customers value trusted brands that deliver consistently high-quality merchandise at an excellent value.","Important emerging merchandise categories, such as Ralph Lauren Denim & Supply and accessories, also achieved excellent growth in the quarter, and we continue to nurture these newer opportunities on an increasingly global scale. The excitement around Denim & Supply has grown as a result of the strong advertising and marketing that resonates with this brand's particular target audience. We have fantastic products with a fresh and youthful spirit that has tremendous appeal to the millennial customer worldwide.","In a relatively short period of time, we've already established credibility as a go-to denim resource in what you all know is a highly competitive space. The strong acceptance of our washes and fits at this stage is especially encouraging because we know those factors drive tremendous customer loyalty. As we look to the future, we will build on this momentum by expanding distribution for Denim & Supply, adding additional wholesale doors, increasing the brand's online presence and opening more freestanding stores in high-profile markets around the world.","Our accessories product continued to gain traction in the marketplace with increasing momentum from season to season and benefiting from expanded global distribution. Growth for our women's footwear, handbags and small leather goods has been especially strong, albeit on a relatively modest base. We've had great success integrating both Polo and Ralph Lauren's men's accessories into our existing points of distribution, where our apparel business is, of course, so strong. These highly-curated accessories offerings fit perfectly within our lifestyle merchandising approach and are seen as a natural extension of the brand proposition. Initial customer response has been better than we anticipated, and we look forward to seeing this category develop for us.","Since accessories are a critical component of our company-wide strategic growth objectives to innovate with new products, extend our direct-to-consumer reach and expand our international presence, we continue to reinforce our commitment to the category. We're building a stronger platform for growth by investing in incremental design and merchandising talent, and supporting them with more sophisticated and efficient means of developing samples and prototypes. This will allow us to more readily effect change and leverage our innovation to drive either -- even stronger growth.","Our ability to execute critical product development and merchandising strategies is made possible by the tremendous capabilities and support of our sourcing, supply chain and logistics teams. Their partnership ensures that we are flowing the right product at the right time, which is easier said than done for a business as complex as ours is across so many brands, merchandise categories, channels and regions. The extreme discipline of these teams enabled us to navigate through considerable disruption in the quarter.","In addition to Superstorm Sandy, we were also contending with 2 dock strikes, but the teams didn't miss a beat. Their partnership means that we were able to flow through the margin benefit of the lower input costs. I don't think there's any better proof of the operational excellence of our organization than the 35% profit growth flow-through we achieved in the quarter.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Chris.","Christopher H. Peterson","Thank you, Jacki, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen in this morning's press release, we're reporting strong third quarter results today. Consolidated net revenues were $1.8 billion, 2% above the prior year period and in line with what we anticipated back in November, despite the disruptive operating environment Roger spoke to earlier.","The growth in net revenues primarily reflects continued retail segment expansion that was partially offset by a planned contraction in wholesale shipments. Excluding the impact of strategic decisions to discontinue American Living and store closures associated with the company's Greater China repositioning efforts, in addition to the net negative impact of foreign currency translation, revenues increased 5% in the third quarter.","Gross profit margin of 59.3% is a new peak level for the third quarter and was 220 basis points greater than the prior year, which was better than our expectations. The improvement in gross profit margin is primarily attributable to lower input costs, favorable product mix and operational discipline.","Operating expenses of $790 million were 4% greater than the prior year, driven by overall business expansion including higher retail segment mix, continued investment in our growth initiatives and approximately $13 million of impairment and restructuring charges related to the discontinuation of Rugby.","Operating expense rate of 42.8% was 60 basis points greater than the prior year, but was better than our initial expectations for the quarter, primarily due to disciplined expense management across the organization. Operating expense rate also benefited from a shift in the timing of certain marketing and IT infrastructure spending out of the third quarter and into the fourth quarter. Excluding Rugby-related charges, the third quarter's operating expense rate was approximately 10 basis points below the prior year.","Operating income of $304 million was 13% greater than the prior year period and operating margin improved 150 basis points to 16.5%. Excluding Rugby-related charges, operating income increased 17% and operating margin expanded 220 basis points to 17.2%. The lower-than-expected operating expense rate accounted for most of the upside to the operating margin outlook we provided in November.","Net income for the third quarter was $216 million, 28% greater than the prior year period, and net income per diluted share increased 30% to $2.31 a share. Excluding Rugby-related charges, net income rose 33% and net income per diluted share grew 35%. The substantial increases in net income and net income per diluted share were the result of higher operating income and a lower effective tax rate of 27%. The nearly 900 basis point decline in the third quarter's effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the net favorable impact of an approximate $15 million discrete tax item in the quarter. Tax rate was better than outlook we provided in November due to the geographic mix of business during the quarter.","Regarding our segment highlights for the quarter, wholesale sales of $734 million were 2% below the prior year period as the discontinuation of American Living in fiscal '13, a proactive reduction in shipments to certain European wholesale customers and the net negative impact of foreign currency translation more than offset continued growth in core and emerging merchandise categories in the Americas.","Wholesale operating income of $145 million in the third quarter was 29% greater than the prior year, and wholesale operating margin increased 470 basis points to 19.7%. The significant improvement in wholesale operating margin was primarily due to higher gross profit margins as a result of lower input costs, favorable product mix and overall operational discipline.","Moving on to the retail segment. Third quarter sales rose 6% to $1.1 billion, supported by a 4% increase in comparable store sales and the contribution from new stores and e-commerce operations. Sales trends continued to be strongest online and at factory stores worldwide. Growth was partially offset by weakness at concession shops in Japan and South Korea, and by store closures associated with the Greater China network repositioning effort. We estimate that Hurricane Sandy had a 1% to 2% negative impact on our comparable store sales growth in the quarter as a substantial portion of our store network was incapacitated for several days and people in the affected areas were primarily focused on recovery and relief efforts.","Despite the challenges of the overall retail environment, 4% comp growth in the third quarter was achieved on top of difficult multi-year comparisons. Comp growth was primarily a function of stronger conversion and higher average dollar transaction sizes.","Excluding Rugby-related charges, retail segment operating income grew 9% to $211 million in the third quarter, and the retail operating margin increased 60 basis points to 19.8%. The improvement in retail operating income and the expansion in operating margin are primarily due to improved profitability in the Americas and Europe.","Licensing revenues were $50 million in the third quarter, 1% greater than the prior year as higher domestic product licensing revenues were partially offset by the transition of certain South American licensing arrangements to directly controlled operations. Operating income for the licensing segment rose 3% to $37 million as a result of higher licensing revenues and lower net costs.","Consolidated inventory was up 10% at the end of the quarter, and we spent approximately $78 million on capital expenditures to support new retail stores, shop installations and infrastructure investments.","The company repurchased just under 1 million shares of its common stock during the quarter at an average cost of $154.50 a share, utilizing $150 million of our authorized share repurchase program. In the first 9 months of the fiscal year, we repurchased $450 million of stock and returned approximately $578 million to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividend payments. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.4 billion in cash and investments.","So a great quarter by any standard and even more so considering the unique environmental challenges we faced. At this point, I'd like to review our outlook for the balance of the year.","For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue growth to accelerate and increase by a mid single-digit percentage. Our expectation is based on an 8% to 11% increase in retail segment sales and wholesale sales that are about flat to the prior year period. Included in our consolidated net revenue growth outlook for the quarter is an approximate 300 basis point net negative impact due to strategic decisions regarding certain operations, including store closures associated with the Greater China network repositioning efforts, the discontinuation of American Living and unfavorable foreign exchange effects.","Operating margin for the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately 125 to 150 basis points greater than the prior year period due to lower input costs and continued expense management. The fourth quarter tax rate is expected to be approximately 29%.","For the full year fiscal 2013 period, we expect revenues to increase by 2%, which includes an approximate 400 to 500 basis point net negative impact associated with strategic decisions regarding certain operations, including store closures associated with the company's Greater China network repositioning efforts, the discontinuation of American Living and unfavorable foreign currency exchange effects.","In light of our better-than-expected third quarter results, we're raising our profit outlook for the year. The full year fiscal 2013 operating margin is now expected to be approximately 75 to 100 basis points greater than last year, which compares to our previous expectation of an approximate 50 basis point increase from the prior year's level. We continue to anticipate that an improvement in gross margin will be partially offset by a higher operating expense rate due to the investments we've made in the company's long-term strategic initiatives and to higher retail channel mix. We estimate the full year tax rate at approximately 32%.","The fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2013 expectations that I just outlined do not include onetime charges associated with the discontinuation of our Rugby operations. We estimate Rugby-related impairment restructuring charges to be $20 million to $25 million on a pretax basis, which is at the lower end of our original expectation of $20 million to $30 million from last quarter. $13 million of these charges were incurred in the third quarter, and we expect the balance to be recognized in the fourth quarter. We expect all operations to cease before the current fiscal year end for Rugby.","We remain committed to reinvesting in the business in order to fund the growth initiatives that have supported the company's strong financial results over the last several years. While we are still in process of refining our fiscal 2014 budget, I did want to provide some qualitative insight into how we're approaching next fiscal year.","We expect revenue growth to accelerate from fiscal 2013's level based on the contribution from a number of the growth initiatives we've invested in this year and a more comparable base of business as we will lap the discontinuation of American Living and the store closures associated with our Greater China network repositioning efforts at the end of this fiscal year.","Revenue growth is expected to be retail-led in fiscal '14 with international markets and e-commerce leading the growth.","We intend to invest in a number of key initiatives as part of the fiscal 2014 plan. These include an acceleration in retail network expansion in China, continued global e-commerce expansion and a significant investment in IT infrastructure. With respect to retail network expansion in China, we expect to incur higher expenses associated with preopening, rent and other costs compared to fiscal 2013.","For global e-commerce, we plan to increase our investment to broaden our reach into new countries, upgrade our sites and customer experience in existing markets, and expand warehousing and distribution capacity.","Regarding IT infrastructure, we are executing a phased implementation of SAP over the next few years that will require a significant investment in operating expenses and capital. In fiscal 2014, we expect to convert global product procurement and the order of the cash process for our North American wholesale operations from legacy systems to SAP. Over time, we believe SAP implementation will yield productivity improvements and procurement savings in addition to providing the company with a stronger platform for future growth. It's an exciting endeavor for the company, and it's a process I've had a lot of experience with in my past.","While we expect the investments we're planning to make in fiscal 2014 to result in higher operating expenses in the near term, they are all expected to generate returns that greatly exceed our cost of capital. We will be completing the fiscal 2014 planning process over the next 2 months, and we'll provide a more detailed outlook for next year when we report our fourth quarter earnings in May.","Finally, I wanted to touch on the status of the Chaps men's sportswear license with Warnaco since I know many of you have an interest in learning about our plans for those operations. As I mentioned on the last call, we have the right to terminate the existing license agreement upon a change of control, which would be triggered upon the closing of the transaction between Warnaco and PVH. After reviewing our alternatives, we now expect that if a change of control is triggered, we will terminate the license and look to take direct control of the Chaps men's sportswear operations.","Now we'd like to open the call up to questions. Operator, can you assist us with this?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Omar Saad with ISI Group.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Roger, could you talk about Europe? It was interesting to hear you mention -- it sounded like you're seeing a reacceleration there. But it's interesting that it's happening more on the retail side than perhaps the wholesale side. Can you talk about some of your strategies for the European market? What you're seeing across the different channels? Obviously, it's a very complex market with many different countries and regions. And then with some of the areas you feel like you can really improve the business there and still drive growth. That'd be very helpful.","Roger N. Farah","Okay, Omar, we talked on the last call, I think, about beginning to see some signs of strengthening business trends in Europe, and I reported the constant currency revenue increase of 8%, which is quite exciting given the market turbulence. Retail has led that charge, and we're excited to see that continue. The wholesale business is actually split by region because what we're seeing is ongoing softness in Italy, Spain and the southern part of Europe. It's partly why we planned for reduced shipments into that specialty distribution in Italy, both in an effort to cut back and also to make sure we could collect on shipments made. And also because the Spanish business, which is very large wholesale customer, with ECI, we planned for lower shipments. That was offset by stronger wholesale business in the northern countries, including Germany and the U.K. and the Scandinavian markets. So even within that headline statement, it's really a by-country conversation, and we actually saw strong sell-throughs in the wholesale shipments for this holiday season. So while I think Europe will continue to be plagued by some uncertainty, we are adjusting our plans, our strategies for a realistic point of view. I think the euro has strengthened, surprisingly, in the recent past. And I think that's a positive. And I think Europe continues to be experiencing tremendous tourism. Albeit slightly off the run rate of earlier in the year, it's still getting large numbers of tourists. And in our case, we continue to look for growing penetration of the Chinese. But until that comes, the Russians, the customers in the Middle East who know us, and interestingly enough, the third-largest tourist customer base in Europe is the Brazilians. So we continue to work both the domestic customer in Europe and the tourist customer. And I think that speaks to our online strategies. It's why we opened additional countries. Our online site is resonating with the customers, as well as the brick-and-mortar strategies that go with it. So all in all, Europe is probably better than we expected as we started this year.","Operator","Next question will come from Kate McShane with Citi.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","With regard to the expense spending in fiscal year '14, I wondered if that was incorporating the flagship investment that you're planning to make in China, and if you can update us on the timing of those 3 flagships you've mentioned in the past.","Christopher H. Peterson","Yes. I think that's clearly part of our thinking. I think that with regard to flagships in China, we're focused on trying to make sure we have the right real estate. I don't know that we'll wind up opening all 3 at the same time. I think this is more of a vision of over the next couple of years of what we'll do. But certainly, it's contemplated in our fiscal '14 plan that we will be opening stores throughout China, including a flagship location.","Roger N. Farah","I think, Kate, you know that to find these unique locations takes time. We're very optimistic in the 3 cities we've articulated. We do have a flagship men's store opening up May-June of this year. We think it's going to be the World of Ralph Lauren as the Chinese have never seen it. But when you find the flagships, it's probably a year of dead rent and construction before you open the doors to take your first customers. So it's critical over time we get those. We're stalking them, they're stalking us. But at the end of the day, probably only one will open in fiscal '14.","Operator","Next question comes from Liz Dunn with Macquarie Capital.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","So I'm interested in the 2014 outlook. It sounds as though you're saying sales growth will accelerate and SG&A investment will accelerate. But we saw some really nice earnings growth in this quarter. Any viewpoint on sort of whether or not that sort of that magnitude of earnings growth could continue through 2014?","Christopher H. Peterson","Yes, I think at this point we're still in the planning stage, so we haven't completed the budget cycle for '14. So I think you're -- the overall comments we made about revenue growth accelerating, but also SG&A expenses being higher because of the investments we want to make in the long-term health of the business is what we're seeing in terms of how the budget's going to play out. But we're not at a point yet where we can provide detailed guidance in terms of what the net impact of that's going to be. And we certainly will plan to do that on the next call, in May, once we've completed the budget process.","Roger N. Farah","I think, Liz, we have demonstrated over the years and over the quarters that we do a pretty good job of flowing through profit on incremental sales. And so as we communicate the May results, I would probably not expect ongoing 35% EPS growth every quarter. We're very proud of that. We aspire to that. But that might be a tad bullish.","Operator","Next question comes from Christian Buss with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Christian Buss - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, I was wondering if I could get some update on the more mature markets in Asia and how they're performing, and whether the initial response in China is as expected or ahead of plan.","Roger N. Farah","Okay, Chris. I will try to respond to that. As you know, China is still in its infancy. We went through a very big decision to pull down most of the network that had been put in place by a 20-year plus relationship with a licensee, and that has played out over the last 18 months. And thankfully, we're lapping that as we head into the beginning of the new fiscal year. We're on track to open 11 stores this year, plus or minus a few 20 next year. And I think we're beginning to lay the foundation for what, over time, will be a very successful market. The bulk of our Asia Pac sales at the moment are generated in Japan and South Korea, and those are built on a network of shop and shops in the department stores. So we're really more dependent in those 2 key countries on footsteps generated by the department stores and then our ability to get market share within that footstep traffic. This third quarter for us, both of those department store models suffered traffic erosions. So while we think we picked up share, it was a more difficult trading environment. And the new stores in Hong Kong or China are still small in relation to the overall scale of the Korean and the Japanese markets. So the teams over there have worked very hard to refine assortments. We've learned every season more and more about that customer and what they want, and we're now beginning to supplement around it freestanding retail-owned stores in Japan, remerchandising Korea. And then, obviously, the Chinese business serviced in Macau or Taiwan or the Philippines or Malaysia is all oriented towards freestanding retail. I think the big change that maybe you all understand is that the early doors are primarily pure luxury. They are Collection, Black Label, Purple Label, and we feel very good about establishing that business. But we're also now feeling very bullish about the ability to open Polo stores, children's stores and Denim & Supply. So that the overall strategy of distribution in the market is balanced, allows us to attract customers within our pyramid of brands and we're getting good feedback every day on each one of those strategies.","Operator","We'll now hear from David Glick with Buckingham Research.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Roger, just wanted to get a little more color on the accessory business. Obviously, you're getting some nice growth there. I was wondering if you could perhaps dimensionalize the business for us in terms of the penetration, where you are and where you're headed, and in particular, how you might approach that business differently as you essentially kind of started a new business in China where obviously demand for accessories is very strong.","Roger N. Farah","Yes, David, we are very committed to the growth of accessories and, of course, it always depends on what your definition of accessories are. I'm going to use the term broadly to be small leather goods, handbags, footwear, eyewear, jewelry, watches, et cetera. And as you know, it represents a smaller part of our luxury business than most other people considered in the luxury sector. As we are expanding our own retail footprint, we are respacing our stores. A lot of the Asian real estate will be positioned with expanded assortments available in accessories. Clearly the Madison Avenue stores reflect expanded assortments, and Europe will do the same. So we're really in the early stages of giving it main floor expanded space, and we're beginning to see good traction from the customer. At this point, it's not really a strategy loaded with a lot of wholesale expectations, although there'll be some. It's really our ability to deliver a message and a level of expertise in our own brick-and-mortar and e-commerce space. So that is playing out as the new real estate is coming on, and we're encouraged by not only the Ricky Bag, but some of the key merchandise categories that are going to be important to us going forward. As you know, we're pushing very hard on that at a luxury tier. That business is the backbone of most of our luxury competitors at high margins, high productivity. And I think we've said before, and we'll say it again, it's very important. We aspire to penetrations, particularly in Asia where the customer is very oriented towards accessories, to penetrations that are 5 or 6 times what we get today in our normal stores.","Operator","We'll hear from Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Roger, on Europe, I was encouraged by your comments that Europe sounds like it's showing some green shoots there. On the wholesale business, could you just maybe give us some thoughts on what inning you think you're in as far as the proactive reduction in shipments there, when do we anniversary those initial cutbacks, and how you see it going -- how do you think about restarting that business and the growth outlook as you kind of start to anniversary those cuts? And then finally, on the comments you made about the Polo brand and maybe opening some stores specifically for that brand and shining a light on that, I think it's safe to assume that that's where the real scale benefits you enjoy as a business come from. And I assume that comes with some gross margin tailwinds for the company if that comes with a bigger mix over the next few years. Maybe you could address that.","Roger N. Farah","Sure. I'll start with the Polo brands. As you know, we represent the most important menswear brands in the industry, in every market we're in, and the backbone of that has been Polo. And I think with all the excitement over the years about Purple Label and Black Label and RLX and all the other initiatives, we're very cognizant that Polo is in high demand around the world. And as we elevated assortments on a Madison Avenue or New Bond Street, we were shrinking the assortments of Polo represented in those stores to highlight the other luxury brands. And what we realized is that there was a tremendous appetite by our customers for what we call the Blue Label products, men's and women's and kids, that we weren't satisfying in the direct-to-customer. We certainly were excelling at the wholesale distribution where there is credible wholesale distribution available. But in parts of Asia and in other parts of the world, where you have to depend on direct-to-customer through your own stores, Brazil would be another example, we really got very excited, and Ralph has really led the charge on envisioning a more complete Polo story that we can take directly to the customer. That could be flagship locations or that could be smaller-sized footprints in appropriate sized markets. The margins on those business are higher than the total. So any incremental penetration of Polo is a positive for the overall company margins. In reference to your first question about -- I like the green shoots in Europe, we think that heading into fiscal '14, most of the recalibration of forward shipments has been done. If you go back about 5 years, the largest 2 wholesale countries for us in Europe were Italy and Spain. And today they're not. And so we've already seen over the course of several seasons and years a shift and a development in Germany, in France, in England and really the Scandinavian markets. But today I think we head into spring shipping for our calendar '14 and for fall bookings, and I think we're beginning to feel like that's leveled out.","Operator","We'll move to a question from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Roger, I just wanted to kind of circle back on one of the prior questions related to Europe, but really focusing more on the margin side. I guess, it's encouraging to see some of the improved margins, in the retail side in particular. Could you just maybe address some of the changes you've made throughout the year in terms of merchandise flows, mark-down rate management or just maybe changes that have happened in the in-store selling environment that have really driven some of this improvement? And then, as we think about that segment from a profitability perspective, how should we think about the longer-term potential both in Europe retail profitability as well as the global basis?","Roger N. Farah","Okay, Erinn. Let me see if I can condense my thoughts because there's not a single syllable or a single sentence that talks to what has been a multi-year initiative to raise the profitability of retail. Some of you who followed the story over the years knew that, that was one of our core initiatives. And we've come a long way and we continue to exhibit margin upside even in what would be called a tough quarter from macro issues. I think we've just learned to be professional retailers. Our history as a company was really in the licensing and wholesale side of the distribution network, and I think we do that superbly. I think it's interesting, the wholesale team teaches the retail team, and we cross-pollinate best practices in terms of assortments, presentation, sales support, customer service. And then when you overlay the e-commerce business, both in wholesale and retail, I think we're really trying to approach and service a customer in any of the channels they want to shop in on a global basis more consistently. So we're definitely getting more professional about staffing alignments with traffic patterns. We're definitely getting more thoughtful about conversion rates, average dollar transaction, multiple sales, fulfilling orders for customers that may come through the Internet out of the brick-and-mortar if we don't have the inventory or vice versa. And I think we have achieved the level of profitability on the back of extraordinary sales per square foot, and we have driven and continue to drive the sales per square foot as an operating metric. The other thing that we try to focus on, I think to our advantage, is gross margin dollars returned per square foot. So it's not always margin rates or sales per square foot, but it's the ability to develop the dollars per square foot and how you allocate space and how you focus your attention that ultimately has dollars flowing to the bottom line. So there are a lot of things going on that probably would be longer than I could answer here. But I think we've got some real professionals worldwide, and I think we're trying to apply lessons learned in one channel or one product category or one region to the overall corporate initiatives.","Operator","And we will take our last question from Barbara Wyckoff with Credit Agricole.","Barbara Wyckoff - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Going back to China, looking out 3 to 5 years in China, how would you see the balance of business kind of playing out, umbrella of Collection, Black Label, high-end luxury, the Blue Label type doors, crossing men's, women's, children's, and then the role of the outlets?","Roger N. Farah","Okay, Barbara, I'm going to try. And I'm not sure whether 3 to 5 years or whatever we would define as medium and long term. I think the subject in China is really our pyramid of brands and our hierarchy of distribution will primarily occur in retail. So in other markets where we have a balance of retail and wholesale, the wholesale channels tend to carry a lot of Blue Label, a lot of the businesses that are more broad in their appeal and then our retail tends to focus on the more elevated luxury. I think given that China will be dominated by direct-to-consumer, whether brick-and-mortar or e-commerce, we will attempt over time to replicate the pyramid of products from the most elevated, most fashionable, most expensive straight through the hierarchy with a similar profile of real estate. That will partly be determined by square footage and location. It will probably be determined by productivity. And so as we continue to get better brand awareness in a country where our brands are not well known, we have to raise brand awareness about who we are and what we do. We also think beyond China, that will wash out into Europe and the United States and other markets. We just showed some statistics to our board yesterday that showed the Chinese today have now become the #1 luxury customer in the world, and they're 30% of the luxury buying in Europe and they're 15% of the luxury buying in the United States. And so our initiatives in China, while substantial and real, we think will have an extraordinary halo over the rest of the company in multiple locations. And today, it's not a very big part of our total. So our results and our achievements are absent meaningful contribution by the Chinese customer on a worldwide basis.","So with that, I'd like to thank you all for listening and participating. We are all very excited about the results. We're very excited about the company's initiative around Sandy. We think we've got a beat on operating metrics for the balance of the year and into next year. So we look forward to updating you in May.","Operator","Thank you, sir.

We are pleased with our second quarter fiscal 2019 results that reflect continued progress on our Next Great Chapter strategic growth plan.","We delivered both top and bottom-line growth as we continue to focus on returning the company to quality growth and value creation. Our results were driven by double-digit top-line growth in Asia and sequential progress in North America and Europe.","Importantly, we remain on track to achieve our plans for the full year. Our long-term plan is based on our three guiding principles: put the consumer at the center of everything we do; elevate and energize our brands; and balance growth and productivity.","Let me take you through the progress we've made in the second quarter across our five key strategic initiatives, which include: first, win over a new generation of consumers; second, energize core products and accelerate under-developed categories; third, drive targeted expansion in our regions and channels; fourth, lead with digital across all activities; and fifth, operate with discipline to fuel growth.","Starting with the first one, win over a new generation of consumers; in the second quarter, our key marketing initiatives centered around our 50th Anniversary Fashion Show and key sporting events. The show, which took place in New York City's Central Park in early September, captured Ralph's 50 years of bringing authentic and timeless style to the world.","We showcased the breadth of our portfolio with a highly diverse cast of models spanning generations, ethnicities, and gender. We successfully leveraged the show, driving record levels of engagement around the world across digital and social media. We had more than 3 billion social media impressions and over 100 million global views of the show online. Importantly, search volume for the brand increased high single digits versus the same period last year, based on Goggle Analytics. According to ListenFirst, a leading social analytics firm, Ralph Lauren generated more than twice as many social engagements as other brands showing at New York Fashion Week.","Engaging influencers and celebrities, particularly those who resonate with different segments of our consumer base and reflect different dimensions of the brand, was a critical part of our 50th celebration strategy. Influencers across media, business, philanthropy and music from all over the globe joined us. These included: young Hollywood actors, such as Blake Lively, Anne Hathaway, and Ansel Elgort; musical superstars like Nick Jonas with his fianc\u00e9e Priyanka Chopra, Chance the Rapper, and Bruce Springsteen; to fashion stars like Taylor Hill; and our Asian influencers, such as Akira and Li Bingbing.","In addition to the show, we continued to leverage the power of cultural events. The second quarter included our sponsorship of the U.S. Open Tennis tournament, one of the most widely attended sporting events in the world. We also outfitted the U.S. team at the Ryder Cup, one of the premier golf tournaments globally. Overall, we increased marketing by over 30% to last year in the second quarter and continue to shift our spend to channels that matter most to consumers today, namely digital and social.","Moving on to our second key initiative, energize core products and accelerate under-developed categories. In the second quarter, Ralph and our design team continued to drive excitement in core product categories through limited edition releases, expanded customization options and refreshed fabrications and details.","As part of our 50th anniversary celebration, we partnered with MR PORTER, a leading men's online retailer, on a limited edition capsule. The collection was inspired by some of our iconic men's designs with a mix of pieces from Polo, Purple Label and RRL. The capsule launched on October 15 on the MR PORTER website and at our flagship stores.","In October, we also announced our exciting new collaboration with London-based streetwear brand, Palace, which I'm sure many of you have seen. The Palace founders describe the collaboration as \"Palace Ralph Lauren is a timeless collection that represents a love letter from a young London skateboard company to their favorite brand in the universe\".","Launching on November 9, the capsule collection consists of menswear pieces inspired by iconic Polo styles that the Palace creators have worn throughout their lives. It will be available: on our own Polo mobile app in the U.S., so this is a great opportunity to download it now, if you haven't already; on our new digital flagship in Europe; and across Palace's retail network. We plan to continue attracting new consumers and driving excitement around product through our limited edition releases and other exciting partnerships going forward.","We also expanded our customization offerings this quarter, both online and in our stores, including a new custom shop at our recently renovated Prince Street store in New York City and at the U.S. Open.","Customization plays well with gifting, and we are excited about its potential as we approach holiday. We plan to further expand our offering and choices for consumers ahead of the season. We will open our second customization shop in Asia in our Omotesando store in Japan in time for the holiday season.","Moving to our under-developed categories that have significant growth potential across our brands; these include denim, outerwear, wear-to-work, footwear and accessories. We launched our first wear-to-work offering in women's Polo this fall, with an initial focus on a select number of directly operated stores and our flagship RalphLauren.com. Early results show a strong consumer response, especially to our blazers and dresses.","In fragrance, we launched our newest fragrance for men with L'Or\u00e9al, Polo Red Rush, in the U.S., helping to accelerate growth in our fragrance portfolio. Focused on reaching a new generation of consumers, we had an energetic campaign featuring actor Ansel Elgort.","Moving on to our third key initiative, drive targeted expansion in our regions and channels; we are focused on building a compelling and competitive ecosystem centered around key cities globally. This includes digital distribution as well as new and renovated stores to drive growth.","During the second quarter, we opened 36 new stores and concessions globally and closed 28 locations. This included 25 openings in Asia, with 10 in China, our fastest-growing market. Our China openings were in our key city clusters of Beijing, Taipei, Shanghai and Hong Kong.","Our momentum in China continued in the second quarter. Greater China revenue was up over 20% to last year in constant currency, including over 40% growth in Mainland China, driven by comp growth and new stores. We're pleased with the performance of our new doors, as they are delivering above-average productivity and profitability. Our digital business in China is growing rapidly through Tmall, Tmall's Luxury Pavilion, JD.com, and WeChat.","In the second quarter, we launched Polo on JD's luxury platform TOPLIFE. We also opened our own directly operated digital commerce site in China, RalphLauren.cn. This is the exclusive online destination for our luxury labels, men's Purple Label, and women's collection. The premium shopping experience on this site includes features such as free online and in-store returns, same-day delivery in Shanghai, live chat customer service, and integration with WeChat.","We also opened two new full-price stores in Europe in the second quarter. We opened one store in London and one in Manchester, as we start to build out our ecosystem strategy in Europe as well. We are underpenetrated at brick-and-mortar retail, with only 21 full-price stores across Europe. Our expansion plans include five more openings in the second half of this fiscal year and more than 100 stores in the next five years.","Moving on to our fourth key initiative, lead with digital, our global digital business, including our directly operated sites, department store dot-com, pure players and social commerce, was up 10% to last year in the second quarter, with strong performance across the board.","Importantly, our directly operated North America digital flagship returned to growth as planned and delivered 9% comp increase versus last year. We attribute the improvement to our continued work to reposition RalphLauren.com as our most important flagship. This was driven by a combination of strong brand building, an enhanced consumer experience, and higher quality of sales, all enabled by our new platform that we put in place a year ago and recently rolled out to Europe. New capabilities we added in the second quarter included: new robust brand landing pages; waitlist functionality; and faster standard shipping.","Our improved digital flagship experience was part of the reason for our move up to the number four spot in the L2 Global Fashion Index for digital, up from number 11 last year. L2 specifically highlighted our digital flagship relaunch in North America as well as our digital marketing and social media activity at out 50th celebration. We're pleased to see this external recognition of our digital initiatives and progress, and we continue to work towards best-in-class capabilities and functionality.","In the second quarter, our directly operated European digital commerce sites also moved onto our new platform, as we continue to elevate and improve our digital presence globally. Our team managed the transition well, and our business returned to growth on our European sites by the end of the second quarter. We expect an acceleration of this growth rate in the second half of the year as a result of the significantly improved brand building, consumer experience, and functionality.","In North America, we released our first-ever mobile Polo app during the quarter. The app is designed to engage the most enthusiastic members of our community of consumers by providing insider access to exclusive content and curated products. The limited edition Yankees collection that we launched in September to celebrate Ralph throwing the ceremonial first pitch at Yankee Stadium was available exclusively through the Polo app, and we sold out of the Yankees jacket within minutes of the launch.","And lastly, we officially launched our mid-tier brand, Chaps, on Amazon during the second quarter. And we are encouraged by the early results and learnings.","Finally, let me touch on our fifth key initiative, operate with discipline to fuel growth. In the second quarter, we continued to challenge every cost and improve our efficiencies, especially given headwinds on input costs and tariffs. This enabled us to fund a significant increase in our marketing investment while expanding operating margin and increasing operating profit. Adjusted operating expenses, excluding marketing, were roughly flat in the quarter.","We continue to increase the flexibility and efficiency of our global supply chain as we keep a close eye on tariffs and other trade developments. The tariffs enacted to date have a limited impact on our business, but we are continuing to diversify our supply chain to mitigate the long-term impact of potential tariff scenarios.","In closing, as we execute our Next Great Chapter plan, we are encouraged by our early progress. Our teams around the world are embracing our strategy and are focused on executing with excellence. We've done a lot of work to ensure that every individual at the company clearly understands how his or her work supports our strategy.","Speaking of our teams, I am especially proud to note that Ralph Lauren recently achieved global recognition in the Korn Ferry Employee Engagement Awards. We rank in the top three most engaged places to work across nine different countries, including Japan, China, and Korea. In addition, for the first time, we achieved certified status as a great place to work in the U.S. and were recognized on the Forbes Best Employers for New Grads list, as we focus on attracting the next generation of talent and consumers.","Each member of our diverse and motivated global motivated team is contributing to deliver on our plan. And Ralph and I continue to be inspired by their passion and commitment every day and know that it will take all 24,000 of us around the world to deliver it.","With that, I'll turn it over to Jane, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions.","Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Thank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone.","Our second quarter results demonstrated continued execution on our strategy while navigating a more challenging global trade and cost environment. We delivered on key metrics, including mid-single-digit AUR growth, double-digit growth in digital commerce, and gross and operating margin expansion, all while delivering both revenue and profit growth.","Second quarter revenues increased 2% on both a reported and a constant currency basis. This was driven by strong 13% growth in Asia and 10% growth across digital commerce. Adjusted gross margin expanded 100 basis points in the second quarter and 60 basis points in constant currency, benefiting from reduced promotional activity and favorable product, geographic, and channel mix.","Adjusted operating margin in the second quarter was 13.9%, up 50 basis points to last year on a reported basis and up 20 basis points in constant currency. In this quarter, we chose to make incremental investments in consumer-facing 50th anniversary marketing and social media amplification. We continue to make progress on our long-term objective of increasing marketing to approximately 5% of sales while also focusing on productivity to achieve our operating margin expansion goal.","Moving on to our segment performance, starting with North America, revenue was up 1% in the second quarter and adjusted operating margin was 23.7%, representing a 60 basis point increase to last year. In the retail channels in North America, we posted 1% comp growth in constant currency, as our directly operated digital commerce business inflected back to growth. The 9% increase in our digital comp came as a result of incremental traffic gains. We continue to reposition RalphLauren.com as our most important flagship door with ongoing improvements in product and functionality.","Our brick-and-mortar comps in North America were down 1% in the second quarter, driven by traffic declines, while AUR grew 3% year-over-year. We are focused on reversing the traffic declines through increased marketing, refreshed store environments and improved products, including expansion in under-developed categories. At a more macro level, foreign tourist sales were down about 2% to last year in the second quarter, largely reflecting currency movements.","Moving on to North America wholesale, second quarter revenue was roughly flat, which was partially driven by an increase in off-price sales related to timing of shipments. For the full year, we still plan to reduce our off-price penetration within our broader wholesale channel.","Our goal is to continue to improve quality of distribution and strategically reposition off-price toward an excess inventory clearance vehicle. Our full-price wholesale sales continue to be pressured by our deliberate actions to improve quality of sales and exits from lower quality distribution. While we expect volatility on a quarter-by-quarter basis, our underlying trend is improving. And for full year FY 2019, we expect underlying revenue to be down low to mid-single digits versus the mid to high single-digit declines last year.","Our digital wholesale business continued to grow, delivering 9% growth year-over-year in the second quarter, with continued share gains in core categories. As a reminder, our revenue trend in North America wholesale will look more challenging in the second half of the year, notably in the fourth quarter. This is due to the timing of off-price shipments that I just mentioned, with significant declines planned in the second half. Our focus remains on building high quality growth with our partners in the North America wholesale channel.","Moving on to Europe, revenue was down 1% on a reported basis and flat in constant currency in the second quarter. Adjusted operating margins were up 50 basis points, but were down 110 basis points in constant currency, driven by comp pressure, increased marketing and new store expansion.","In the retail channel in Europe, comps were down 4% in constant currency, representing a sequential improvement from the 8% decline we reported in Q1. Our digital comp on our directly operated European website was flat, impacted by our digital platform upgrade at the end of last quarter. We saw strong quality of sales improvements, including double-digit growth in AUR and a reduction in discount rates and are encouraged by the response to our newly upgraded platform.","As we got back into inventory positions and adjusted product assortments in Europe, notably in outlet, we saw an improvement in our trend with Q2 brick-and-mortar comps down 4%, representing a 5 point increase from Q1. We expect continued improvement in trends in the second half of the year.","Our ongoing efforts to improve quality of sales continued, with AURs up 8% in the second quarter in Europe retail. Wholesale revenue in Europe was flat in constant currency in the second quarter. A shipment timing benefited Q1 and negatively impacted Q2, as planned. Our underlying trend in the channel remains healthy, up low to mid-single digits, including double-digit growth in wholesale digital.","We expect continued volatility in Q3 and Q4 growth based on shipment timing, with growth patterns similar to those of the first half of the year. However, overall second half performance should align with our underlying growth trend.","Turning to Asia, revenue was up 13% on a reported basis and 14% in constant currency in the second quarter. We saw strong performance across every market in Asia, including Japan, Korea, China and Australia. Our product and marketing initiatives are resonating well in this region. And we continue to increase our digital efforts and engagement with local influencers and celebrities.","Our 50th Anniversary Fashion Show in Central Park included many of our key Chinese and Japanese social influencers, who shared our brand with millions of followers. Comps in Asia increased 6% in constant currency in the second quarter. We expect continued comp growth in Asia as we upgrade our distribution network and increase our marketing initiatives to amplify and elevate the brand.","Adjusted operating margin was up 220 basis points to last year in the second quarter in Asia and up 270 basis points in constant currency, as leverage from strong top-line performance more than offset increased marketing investment in the quarter.","Moving on to the balance sheet, our balance sheet is strong and we returned capital to shareholders, reflecting our continued operating progress. We ended the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and investments and $684 million in total debt. We used a new issue of $400 million of senior unsecured notes to retire $300 million of debt that matured in September 2018. Consistent with our commitment to return cash to shareholders, we repurchased $92 million in shares in the second quarter.","Moving to inventory, at the end of the second quarter, inventory was up 15% to last year. About 60% of the inventory increase is related to higher in-transit inventory and earlier receipt of goods versus last year. We are utilizing less airfreight this year in order to reduce shipment costs and this resulted in a higher level of goods in transit.","We also realigned our wholesale receipt calendar to better match customer demand and maximize full price selling. This also impacted quarter-end inventory level.","The remaining 40% of the increase is related to higher inventory buys to support anticipated growth, including new stores, digital and comp growth. As we mentioned last quarter, we had strategic increases in our European factory stores as we cut too deeply and were out of stock last year. In addition, the second half includes the largest number of our new store openings this year, therefore, the inventory for those new stores was on hand at the end of the second quarter.","As a result, our inventory levels at the end of this quarter and next quarter will be higher than we typically have during this season. We plan to moderate inventory levels by the end of this fiscal year to be better aligned with our sales outlook.","Now, I'd like to turn to guidance for the full year and third quarter of fiscal 2019. As a reminder, this guidance excludes restructuring and related charges. We are on track to deliver our goals for the year. We now expect revenues to be flat to up slightly in constant currency for the full year fiscal 2019. This is based primarily on our strong first half top-line result. We continue to expect a decline in North America and growth in our international businesses.","Foreign currency is now expected to have about 75 basis points of negative impact on revenue growth in fiscal 2019. We continue to expect operating margin for fiscal 2019 to be up 40 to 60 basis points in constant currency, with minimal impact from foreign currency. This guidance reflects our solid performance in the first half and our view of the underlying trends as we execute the Next Great Chapter plan.","It also incorporates the emerging dynamic of tariffs and our plans to better align inventory levels to our sales growth outlook. For the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we expect revenues to be up low single digits in constant currency. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by approximately 100 basis points in the quarter. Operating margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 is expected to be up about 20 basis points to last year in constant currency.","Foreign currency is expected to be a slight benefit to operating margin in the quarter. We continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $275 million in fiscal 2019, focused on consumer-facing initiatives that have demonstrated a proof of concept and healthy rates of return. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 is unchanged at 21%. Third quarter of fiscal 2019 tax rate is estimated at approximately 22% to 23%.","In closing, we are moving forward in executing our Next Great Chapter plan and we continue to make operational progress in our business while navigating a more challenging global trade and inflationary environment. Our teams around the world celebrated 50 years of Ralph's creative vision and we are passionate about our future. Importantly, our teams are delivering and this quarter demonstrates that we are on the right path toward long-term sustainable growth and value creation.","But before I open up the call for your questions, many of you already know that Evren Kopelman, our Head of Investor Relations, will be transitioning to a new role within the organization as CFO of Club Monaco. On behalf of the entire Ralph Lauren team, we'd like to express our gratitude for everything she has contributed to this role. Evren has led the Investor Relations team with integrity, transparency and passion. And we are confident that she will do the same for our Club Monaco business.","The great news is that our IR function also has an excellent new leader, Corinna Van Der Ghinst, who will be assuming the Head of IR role. Cori spent over a decade as a sell-side analyst at Citi and as a fashion entrepreneur. She joined the RL team seven months ago and is off to a great start. Please join me in congratulating both of them and please reach out to Cori and the team on any communications going forward.","With that, let's open up the call for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. Thank you for taking our question and congrats on the revenue momentum.","Patrice Jean Louis Louvet - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Morning.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","What factors drove the return to growth in North America digital and are they sustainable over time? And overall, what inning do you believe you're in with digital?","Patrice Jean Louis Louvet - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Good morning, Paul. Hey, welcome. Welcome to the group. So we're actually pleased with our progress on digital commerce this quarter, both in North America and actually also internationally, but let me touch on the key drivers for the North America progress. It's really three factors for us: one, better brand building; two, an enhanced consumer experience; and then, three, continued work on quality of sales.","So maybe just to give you some flavor, some of the things we drove across each of these factors. On the brand building front, we leveraged the 50th Anniversary Fashion Show with what we called an immersive website experience. We streamed the show live. We told richer and deeper stories, and we're going to continue to do that on product. We integrated our social feeds, and we launched what we've called a dynamic 50th storytelling section on the site, so much more elevated storytelling, much more elevated photography, much more interesting content.","On the consumer experience front, we drove a number of changes, and we know we have significant progress to make here. So just to give you few examples of increased functionality in this past quarter; faster site loading time on mobile. Our loading time improved by 25% to 30% over the past quarter, and we know every second is millions of dollars.","Product suggestions, so we introduced a May We Suggest section. Actually, we reintroduced a May We Suggest section that we had many years back and that we brought back. We've provided enhanced product detail pages. We launched favorites, and we also launched the waitlist functionality.","We are now delivering more elevated packaging on our luxury items, and then we accelerated our standard shipping timings. So those are just a few of the changes we've driven. And obviously, making sure our consumers have an awesome experience on the site is critical for us. Then the third element is we continued to work on quality of sales, driving AURs and reducing our discounting over time.","In terms of innings and Jane is our baseball expert on this team, listen, in terms of innings, I think, Paul, at this stage, we're really in the very early stages of the game. We actually see many more opportunities moving forward. We're planning continued growth now in North America digital commerce in the back half of the year. So we're pleased with the plus 9% we delivered this quarter and expect to continue to grow moving forward.","Then longer term, our biggest opportunities are really in building the omnichannel functionality of our digital commerce operations, so better connecting our retail experiences to where the consumer wants us to show up, better connecting it to our social commerce, and so on.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you for the color. Just to quickly walk down the P&L, you had another solid quarter of gross margin expansion, but guidance does suggest that those gains may moderate somewhat in the second half. So if you could, just help us maybe better understand the puts and takes of this quarter and what we should keep in mind as the year progresses, including just how much you believe you can narrow the inventory to sales spread by year end.","Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Sure, so welcome, Paul. I'd be happy to take you through the gross margin. What you saw in the second quarter, we were pleased with our gross margin performance expanding 100 basis points in the quarter. The most important driver is what's been really durable over the last two years, and that is that we reduced promotion and we got our AURs up. That's going to maintain over the second half of this year and is the chief driver in expanding our gross margin 75 basis points for the full year. We also had benefits from geographic mix and channel mix. Those are also going to be durable through the second half of the year.","Where we're seeing a switch is really the product cost, which was a slight headwind in the quarter, actually becomes a headwind through Q3 and Q4, and is about 30 to 40 basis points of pressure by the time we exit the year in the fourth quarter. You'll recall last year, that was a tailwind of about 80 basis points. So that's where the dynamic is shifting, and we've been calling that out for a while. And indeed, we are seeing that.","Now importantly, as we think about that pressure, it incorporates the tariff pressures that we're seeing from the existing legislation and incorporates some of the freight and input cost inflation that we're seeing.","And then FX, which has been a nice tailwind to us in the first quarter of about 10 basis points and in the second quarter of about 40 basis points, moves into a headwind in the second half of the year. So those are really the drivers. We're really pleased that we continue to expect gross margin expansion, and we're holding to our guidance on gross margin expansion. But we do see, as we've called out for a while, some of those pressures coming.","As we look at inventory, we expect inventory to more closely align with our sales outlook by the fourth quarter.","Evren Dogan Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. You may ask your question.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks and congrats on a nice quarter.","Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Thanks, Matt.","Patrice Jean Louis Louvet - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Thanks, Matt.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","On the expense front, Jane, I guess help us to think about the SG&A efficiencies remaining from here. And maybe just elaborate a little on the timeline for SG&A line item leverage if comps were to turn positive going forward.","Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.","So as we think about big initiatives in terms of what we're seeing in SG&A, we have a number of focus areas across our costs. We're seeing some of the benefits from the procurement initiatives that we instituted. We're starting to see some nice distribution savings that will mostly manifest themselves in FY 2020 from the work that we're doing, and a disciplined approach to overall costs. And overall in the quarter, we've seen our payroll costs reducing. And of course, as I called out, we invested in marketing this quarter.","As I look to the back half of the year, we'll continue to invest in marketing, notably in the third quarter. Now recall, last year in the first half of the year, marketing was down. It was up in the second half. We are going to invest and expect to have increased marketing in the third quarter, but some leverage in the fourth quarter overall. And so I think you'll see the expense flow be a little higher in the third quarter and advantaged in the fourth quarter as we move through the year. But as you saw in our guidance for the full year, we expect operating margin expansion and our revenue to be flattish to slightly up. And so I think you'll see some nice profit accretion top to bottom line.","Evren Dogan Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Next question, please.","Operator","The next question comes from Simeon Siegel with Nomura. You may ask your question.","Simeon Avram Siegel - Nomura\/Instinet","Great, thanks. Good morning, guys. And congrats on the progress.","Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Thanks, Simeon.","Patrice Jean Louis Louvet - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Thanks, Simeon.","Simeon Avram Siegel - Nomura\/Instinet","Jane, any view on how much more room you have to grow AUR? You've obviously been doing a fantastic job there. And then any way to quantify the savings you expect from reducing the airfreight. And then, Patrice, any learnings you can share on maybe favorite question on Amazon, anything that you've seen there with our relationship? Thanks.","Patrice Jean Louis Louvet - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Sure.","Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Sure. So I would say on AUR growth, AUR growth is a key part of our strategic plan that we outlined. So we expect AUR growth as we move through into the second half so that will continue. And then as we look out over the next five years, because we're elevating our brand, we're moving to a more direct-to-consumer distribution, you will see AUR growth through the remainder of the plan. So, we see it as durable. We see it as an important part of the plan. It's a combination of reduction in promotion, selective and surgical price increases, as needed, notably on new products. And overall, assorting into higher AURs, notably in our international markets, where consumers have been very receptive to that.","The shift out of airfreight is a part of our ongoing saving strategy to move to more efficient forms of freight transport. Freight, in total, is about 3% to 5% of our COGS, so it's important. It's a nice shift, but I wouldn't say it's a material driver of overall COGS.","Patrice Jean Louis Louvet - Ralph Lauren Corp.","And I guess on your Amazon question, so maybe just starting with a bigger picture on pure players for us. Pure players is a key building block of our digital commerce strategy. And, actually, this quarter, pure players was the fastest growing part of our digital commerce business.","As far as the U.S. is concerned, we're now live with our Chaps pilot on Amazon. We've been on there for several weeks. We're actually encouraged by the early results, the higher AURs, frankly, than we expected, so we'll see whether that continues. And then the learnings that we're generating together with Amazon, so feeling good about that. But, obviously, very early days and we'll report over time in terms of how we're performing.","And then on the broader Amazon conversation, we are continuing our dialogue with Amazon. We are very clear on the four key principles for us to participate in pure play business. They haven't changed, right: brand building presentation; pricing integrity; making sure that no non-authorized third-party sellers or counterfeit products are available on the site; and working with the partner on access to consumer data. So those four principles are still in place.","We are now there on the balance of the portfolio with Amazon in the U.S. We're actually making progress across many different pure players around the world, including here in the U.S. We just joined Stitch Fix, Olivella in the U.S. and also new customers around the world. So continuing to drive it and continuing to drive the dialogue with Amazon and looking carefully at our experience in our pilot with Chaps.","Evren Dogan Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Great. Next question, please.","Operator","The next question comes from Brian Tunick with Royal Bank of Canada. You may ask your question.","Brian Jay Tunick - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning. Congrats to the team, and especially Evren on the promotion, very well done.","Evren Dogan Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Thanks, Brian.","Brian Jay Tunick - RBC Capital Markets LLC","I think you guys talked about share gains in North America in the department store on the digital side, so curious how do you feel about share dynamics overall in North America wholesale? It's been a while, I think, since you guys talked about share gains?","And then the second question would be, would you expect the off-price sell-ins to be down next year as well or is this really the big cleanup year? Thank you very much.","Patrice Jean Louis Louvet - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Well, why don't we tag-team on that one with Jane, Brian. So as far as share is concerned, we believe greatly in share, right. Because ultimately, it's the measure of consumer voting, so it is something that we watch.","As far as the U.S. performance is concerned, so our men's wholesale share is basically stabilized. So it's now been stable for a couple quarters after 13 quarters of decline, so we're encouraged by the stabilization. Obviously, success is not stabilization. Success is growth. We are growing share online on wholesale dot-com so we're actually excited about the progress we're making there.","And we're now all focused on making sure we deliver share in the brick-and-mortar part of wholesale. We're doing that through the marketing investments and engaging marketing activities. We're doing that through, obviously, all the product work that's going on, both on the core and on the newness. And we're doing that through renovating our doors. And that continues to be a program on which we are making solid progress to make sure the brand is presented in a way that's consistent with how we view it and how we want it to show up to consumers in 2018. So I think that's the share picture. Jane, you want to talk about off-price?","Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.","So, on the off-price reduction, it's going to be down meaningfully this year. As we move out into the out years of our strategic plan, we do plan to reduce our penetration of off-price to our wholesale channel. So we expect it to be compressive, if you will, to our overall growth. We contemplated that with our algorithm as we looked at our five-year strategic plan. Will it be negative or not? I think it's too soon to call. It'll be based on our overall wholesale outlook. And we're managing that channel prudently, but we've acknowledged it is a pressure point to our overall growth algorithm and we've contemplated that.","Evren Dogan Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Next question, please.","Operator","The next question comes from Kate McShane with Citi. You may ask your question.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions and Evren and Cori, congratulations again. My question centered around the capsule launches you highlighted in your prepared comments. I just wondered how you were thinking about managing the cadence and availability of these collections going forward and what ROI are you seeing from these specific capsule launches so far.","Patrice Jean Louis Louvet - Ralph Lauren Corp.","So overall, we're excited about the role these capsules play within our overall brand building program. We are very clear that we have to do this at the right pace, because if you do it too frequently, it loses its sense of excitement and interest. We think we have the right drumbeat, so we expect to continue to do these at the pace that I think we've established so far. And, listen, every time we drop one, we're getting immense excitement and great interest.","The latest one is Downhill Skier, so available on our app for those of you who want to access it. And initial results are quite positive behind that. But it is part of our broader brand building program and product program moving forward, right?","If you think about it from a product standpoint, one, we obviously want to drive the core. We're seeing positive results on the core. Then we want to use limited editions in capsules and personalization to bring excitement to the brand. And then, obviously, a third plank is the under-developed categories that we've been talking about.","Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.","From an ROI perspective, Kate, we look at these as really they have a great marketing value. They tend to sell out and sell out at full price. Our teams have gotten very adept at developing them, so the incremental costs are minimal. So we see them as a good product ROI and, more importantly, a great marketing ROI.","Evren Dogan Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Next question, please.","Operator","The next question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. You may ask your question.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask a follow-up on the digital inflection. Sorry if I didn't pick up on this, but I'm trying to understand how much of that inflection to positive trends in the digital comps is a matter of kind of cycling the closing down of all the promotions that were driving traffic and sales and just kind of winding that down and not having to comp against that so much versus kind of more offensive measures that are really driving consumer demand and excitement in that channel, maybe if you could help us understand what are the key driver in inflection.","And also on the Polo app, while we're on digital, maybe you could talk about the possibility for a membership program or some sort of loyalty program. We're seeing more brands kind of combine membership and loyalty with their own apps to engage with the consumer more directly. Thanks.","Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Sure, Omar. I'll take the first part and then I'll let Patrice talk about what we're doing moving forward. What we've seen in terms of our inflection back to growth, there's no denying that we are overlapping a significant reset of our digital business to drive price harmonization, to become less promotional. I think we've accomplished that. And encouragingly in the quarter, what we see is that our full price business on our website is growing nicely, so that's an important part of what you're seeing in terms of the growth.","But what I can't do is break out exactly what's the benefit of the improvements that we've made to the site and how much that's impacting. We did see the key driver is improved traffic and so that we know that that's helping the top line and that traffic is getting a better experience. But I think that the reset that we've done as we look at full price selling, which has been up nicely in this quarter, is an important part of the driver. So I think they really go hand-in-hand.","Patrice Jean Louis Louvet - Ralph Lauren Corp.","And then on the app, I mean, we're actually really excited. We're finally able to make an app available to our fan community around the world. Loyalty point is spot on, Omar, which is ultimately, we will want to have a loyalty program for our best customers. We'll need to make sure that we offer relevant value for them. But certainly, that's consistent with our thinking on this platform.","Evren Dogan Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Next question, please.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question.","Michael Binetti - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks. And I'll add my thanks to Evren and Corinna. Can we dig in on North America wholesale for a second? Flat in the quarter; I think that in the first quarter, that was down mid-single digits and excluding some one-time shifts and then flat this quarter. Jane, do you feel like that's a pretty comparable number to the underlying negative mid-single digits in 1Q or were there any puts and takes in the second quarter to think about?","Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.","We saw North America, overall in the first quarter, wholesale business was down low single digits. And we see it flattish in the second quarter, up slightly in the second quarter. I think it's relatively comparable.","What I'm seeing in the underlying trend, the underlying full price trend is that from first half to second half, we're making sequential progress. So we're very encouraged by that. We saw in the first half, sort of, some high single-digit to mid-single-digit declines.","As we go into the second half, we expect to see that improve to be more towards the overall trend, of sort of low to mid-single-digit declines in our full price business, which is a meaningful improvement from what we saw last year. So overall, we're encouraged. Most of the noise is coming from the shipment timing of off-price, but we see sequential progress in our full price North America wholesale business as we move into the second half of the year.","Michael Binetti - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","If I roll that forward, just thinking about the math, it looks like revenues are poised to decline mid to high single digits in fourth quarter on the North America wholesale side or on the...","Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.","That's right.","Michael Binetti - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","I'm sorry, on the total company, mid to high singles. Looks like currency will be about a 3 point drag. And then I think you had an Easter shift that maybe is a point there. So underlying, we're low single digits, as the rest of that inflection from third quarter back to negative in fourth quarter? Is that fully explained by the off-price shift that you're speaking about?","Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Okay. So we've got a lot of dynamics. Let me just sort of pull them apart. In the fourth quarter, you're exactly right, Michael. We've been calling out for a while. What you're going to see if you step back, first half to second half, you're going to see overall trend improvement.","In the first three quarters, consistent with our guidance of this year, are very positive. Fourth quarter, as we said, has a number of factors that we've called out. One is, the Easter shift, which is 3 points to North America comp and a full point to the total company. This is total company revenues.","We've called out reductions in off-price. And then shipment timing in Europe for their wholesale business is going to be favorable in the third quarter, but it will decline in the fourth quarter, very similar to what we saw in the first half of the year. Those are the three drivers that get you to the guidance squeeze on the fourth quarter, which is our most challenging top line quarter.","Evren Dogan Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Next question, please.","Operator","The next question comes from Alexandra Walvis with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.","Alexandra Walvis - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning and thanks for taking the questions, a couple of questions for me on the brick-and-mortar presentation for the brand. So firstly, on the wholesale side, Patrice, you made a comment earlier that the refreshes that you've been making with some of the department store partners have been progressing well. Can you remind us how many of these that you've done, how many of these there are still to go? What proportion of the fleet does that represent and whether there's further momentum that we can expect there?","Second question on brick-and-mortar relates to your own brick-and-mortar business. You've seen this material inflection in your e-commerce, RalphLauren.com business. What needs to happen for the brick-and-mortar comps to inflect materially positively? Is it a case of more store remodels? And you've mentioned previously that we should expect some more omnichannel initiatives, so perhaps that's part of the story, but I'd be interested in your thoughts there.","Patrice Jean Louis Louvet - Ralph Lauren Corp.","So starting with the wholesale renovation, so far over the past 12 months, we've done about 175. Obviously, we're focusing first and foremost on those bigger doors, so not every door is treated equally. Some of these include the doors that our biggest partner is renovating at the same time, their top 50. That represents about 10% of sales. So we're early days in this exercise. Where we have done it, we've seen an acceleration of top line growth and we see a good financial return on it. So we're actually quite encouraged by the early results we're getting behind this.","What we'd like to do, I think we talked it during Investor Day, is over the next three years, we want to get to at least 60% of our business, which will represent the majority of the core doors for the business; so continuing to drive that both here in the U.S. and also doing that around the world. We just redid our Selfridges doors. So those of you who are traveling in the UK, you'll get a chance to see that. That was redone about three or four days ago, and the early indications are positive.","As far as the second part of your question, which is when do things turn from a brick-and-mortar standpoint and what's going to be different relative to e-commerce, I think it's really the key elements of the strategy that we've called out, which is making sure that our marketing is connecting with a new generation of consumers and getting those consumers excited about what we have to offer. It's really around product and getting the right balance between core and fashion and leveraging the capsules and the special partnerships and personalization, as we talked earlier, to drive that.","And then indeed to your point, the omnichannel dimension is critical, so we look at it as a whole, because we need to make sure we're connecting as much as possible wholesale dot-com and wholesale brick-and-mortar because we are encouraged by the progress we're seeing on dot-com, and so it's leverage the momentum that we're building there.","But it's the fundamentals of product, communication, and store. And I am actually really pleased with the way the teams are actually treating against all those three elements. So we should continue to see incremental sequential progress as we put one foot in front of the other in driving the acceleration of the business.","Evren Dogan Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Next question, please.","Operator","The next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. You may ask your question.","Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, everyone. Congrats on the quarter. Congrats, Evren and Cori, on the moves. I guess, Jane, I want to focus on Europe, or Patrice, just first thoughts on the overall market. There's clearly been some very unseasonable weather and a lot of partners and brands have struggled there, just what you're seeing from a macro perspective maybe the UK versus the EU.","And then, Jane, I just wanted to ask about the comp forecast for the back half. I think you talked about continued improvement on the comp line at Europe. Is that a return to growth improvement or, is that just less bad, less negative comp trajectory through the year?","Patrice Jean Louis Louvet - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Let me start and then you take on, Jane.","Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Yes.","Patrice Jean Louis Louvet - Ralph Lauren Corp.","So listen, as far as overall Europe is concerned, Ike, we're actually performing in line with our expectations for Q2. So it's the same thing, delivering sequential progress, I think we talked earlier about the progress we're making on direct comps. We're also seeing good performance on wholesale. So we're not seeing macro dynamics really shift significantly for our business. We've also assumed relatively tame progress from a macro standpoint in Europe moving forward. I think we're assuming basically flat overall growth for the region.","And we have outlawed weather as an explanation for business performance at Ralph Lauren. So listen, weather was not clearly a tailwind, but we have to control our destiny and we've I think leveraged other dimensions of our portfolio and business model to drive the business forward, so all in all, seeing good performance on wholesale.","There are timing dynamics, but low to mid-single-digit performance in European wholesale, better transition than expected on our platform on dot-com, great work by the team there, so feeling good about that. And then, as you saw, sequential progress on retail comps, minus 4% Q2, minus 8% the quarter before that, and we expect that progress to continue.","Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Yes. Ike, as we said, one thing that we might call out is that we do see some weakness in foreign tourists, largely probably based on what we're seeing in the euro. But overall in Europe from a comp perspective, we were very pleased with the 5-point improvement we saw going from Q1 to Q2 in our bricks-and-mortar comps.","And, as you know, we made a significant investment in inventory in that market to get back into more seasonal product, a little more innovation in our product, notably in our outlet stores, and we're seeing that working. And so we expect our bricks-and-mortar comp as a reflection of that investment in inventory, and in conjunction with marketing investments that we've made, that you'll see an improvement in the second half. We don't guide comps by region, but we expect to see some nice improvement as we move through the second half.","Evren Dogan Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.","We'll take one last question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The last question comes from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities. You may ask your question.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi. Evren, thank you very much and congratulations to you guys.","Evren Dogan Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Thanks.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","So I guess if we could spend just a little bit of time on China, I'd love to hear how you guys feel about how the Ralph Lauren brand relationship with the Chinese consumer is and marketing plans there. And specifically, there's a lot of talk around tourism, but trends in Hong Kong, Macau, more tourist-driven markets there. I just wonder if you could just give us some insight into what you're seeing there. Thanks very much.","Patrice Jean Louis Louvet - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Sure. Good morning, Bob. So, listen, we're excited about our progress in China, right. You saw the numbers. They continued to be strong in Q2: Greater China, up 20%; Mainland China, up 40%, consistent with what we delivered in the first quarter. So we have nice momentum, nice momentum there. If you kind of peel the different elements apart, our digital business is growing double digits there. We just launched our digital flagship RalphLauren.cn, so we're excited about that. We just joined TOPLIFE within the JD platform. We're also excited about that, so, in general, good progress on the digital commerce front.","And then, we're continuing to drive our brick-and-mortar presence in the context of the ecosystem we want to build around these big cities, the Shanghais, the Shenzhens, the Beijings and Hong Kongs of this world. We ended the quarter with 68 stores in China. We are on track to open 50 in total for the fiscal year.","And what's exciting and gets to your specific consumer question is what we're seeing in terms of consumer engagement is we're bringing in a good balance between men and women, right. So, you know, globally, our business trends to be more skewed towards men. But in China, actually we've got a good 50%-50% balance between men and women. We're bringing younger consumers, right, so consumers in their 20s and 30s which we feel good about.","And then we're also seeing consumers who are prepared to buy at the high-end of our range from a product standpoint, so one illustration, cashmere, which is one of our higher-priced items, consistently is in the top 10 selling items in China. And as a whole, we're actually seeing the consumer ready to migrate to the higher parts of our portfolio.","From an awareness standpoint, we continue to build awareness. It's always a little tricky to get reliable awareness data in China, but from the latest indications we had is the marketing that we're doing there with influencers weaving the brand into the cultural fabric of China is clearly resonating. And the fact that we had a number of our influencers at the show obviously helped. And we've got Singles' Day coming up, so we'll do a lot of good marketing around that. We're not going to leverage it as a promotional tool. We really focus on it as a brand building tool.","But I would say the response that we're getting from consumers, men and women, across Mainland China and Greater China is actually quite encouraging. And we're building good momentum. And you know what our goal is for the business. We want to hit $0.5 billion in the next five years. And if we continue at this pace, then we'll get to that number and probably a little bit more.","On tourism, actually tourism is a relatively small part of our business, right, so the whole Daegu conversation and so on really doesn't apply much to us. Obviously, it's an area of development for us, but at this point certainly not a vulnerability.","Patrice Jean Louis Louvet - Ralph Lauren Corp.","All right, that closes the morning. Listen, thank you to all of you for joining us today. This is clearly an important year for us as we celebrate our 50th anniversary and not many companies get to do that in this industry. And I do want to take this opportunity to congratulate Ralph and the entire team on what we've accomplished so far and the ongoing work that we're all doing to deliver for the future as we write our Next Great Chapter.","We're pleased with our early progress and results as we continue to strengthen our connection with the consumers around the world. We again want to thank Evren for everything that she's done on this part of the business. And I really look forward to you helping us drive Club Monaco to glory. And then, Cori, officially welcome in your new role. This is great succession planning, I think. And we look forward to talking to all of you over the course of the next quarter or at the call the next quarter. So thank you and have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation.

The agenda for this morning's call includes opening remarks from Stefan Larsson, the company's new Chief Executive Officer; an overview of the quarter, and an update on key strategic initiatives from Christ Peterson, President of Global Brands; followed by financial perspective on the second quarter as well as expectations for fiscal 2016 from Bob Madore, Chief Financial Officer.

Good morning, everyone. It's a true pleasure to be on the call this morning. I want to start by thanking Ralph and the board for the trust that they have put in me to become the CEO and work by Ralph's side to grow this great company into the future. I also want to take the opportunity and thank Chris and the whole Ralph Lauren team for the great work they have done in creating a very strong foundation to build on. This is a really, really great company. Ralph's dreams and vision about a better life, about style, about great quality, about specialness, story-telling, have built the brand into one of the most beloved brands in the world. It started with the idea about a different tie and it grew to become one of the most iconic brands in the world.","This is my first week at the company. I have a lot to learn. The first week started with a board meeting and then an analyst call. I'm excited by that. I will spend my next few months in the role getting to know our teams, our customers, and our investors. For those of you who don't know me, I set the bar for performance really high. For 15 years, I was a part of the team that grew H&M from $3 billion to $17 billion. Most recently, I led Old Navy, where we drove three consecutive years of high performance and we added $1 billion in sales.","Ralph and I share the same focus on striving for greatness. We never settle, and we love winning, and my job is to make sure we deliver on Ralph's creative vision and drive performance on the highest of levels, from both a brand, customer, and shareholder perspective. I joined because I believe in Ralph. I believe in his vision. I believe it's more relevant than any time before. I believe in the brands. I believe in the teams. And together with Ralph and the team, I look forward to continue to grow this unique company over many years to come.","So with that, over to you Chris.","Christopher H. Peterson - President-Global Brands","Thanks, Stefan and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to be reporting better-than-expected second quarter results this morning. On a constant currency basis, revenues were up 4%, and diluted earnings per share was up 13% versus a year ago, excluding one-time charges. Profits were significantly better than our expectations entering the quarter driven by stronger-than-expected operating margins. This was driven by both gross margin and SG&A improvement.","On gross margins, we are beginning to benefit from the initial phases of the SKU and style rationalization, lower negotiated source income cost, increased full-price sell-throughs and mix benefits. SG&A was also significantly better than forecast due to earlier-than-expected cost savings from the global brand reorganization and disciplined expense management. We are pleased to see margin benefits from these initiatives already and expect to see topline benefits as well as the new global line planning process is implemented.","Now let me provide an overview of the quarter. We continued to see the impact of currency movements on foreign tourist traffic around the world. The stronger U.S. dollar reduced foreign tourist traffic in the U.S., while the weaker euro and Japanese yen had the opposite effect in those markets. In Europe, our revenue was up double-digits in constant currency similar to the first quarter. Growth was driven by increased sales to both local customers and tourists. Wholesale demand was particularly strong, with robust sell-throughs that drove strong reorders. All brands across the portfolio performed well and by region, Northern and Central Europe performed the best.","In Asia, second quarter revenue was up 7% in constant currency, with double-digit growth in Japan, China, Southeast Asia, and Australia. We are successfully elevating our brand in these markets through targeted merchandising strategies and marketing initiatives. Full-price selling is up year-over-year, driving better sales and margins. We are achieving market share gains through success with local customers as well as increased tourist traffic. Korea, Hong Kong and Macau all were negatively impacted by reduced tourist traffic. In Korea, trends started to improve as the lingering effect of the MERS outbreak diminished.","In the Americas, net revenue was up 2% in constant currency. Sales trends were impacted by the continued decline of traffic to both our retail stores and department stores, driven by lower foreign tourist traffic and an unseasonably warm start to the fall season.","Within our retail store network, we were able to partially offset the traffic declines by driving increased conversion through successful merchandising strategies and marketing initiatives. Our global e-commerce sales were up 10% in the second quarter, driven by our international business. In North America e-commerce, we saw improved trends compared to the first quarter. We made several enhancements in our omnichannel capabilities including the launch of Buy Online Ship from Store and Hold Online pickup in Store and a new feature where customers can be added to a waitlist if we are sold out of a size or color.","We also added product videos that are driving a higher average order value. Within the global factory outlet channel, results were mixed. Europe saw increased traffic and conversion rates leading to strong comp store sales growth. The U.S. continued to see traffic declines due to fewer foreign tourists. Importantly, in the U.S. in locations where domestic customers represent more of the traffic, we achieved positive comps driven by improved conversion rates that were the result of successful marketing and in-store initiatives.","As we plan the second half of fiscal 2016, we are taking a prudent approach given the slow start to fall in the U.S. fueled by unseasonably warm weather and continued declines in foreign tourist traffic. We believe inventory in the North America department store channel is elevated and as a result, despite our Q2 beat, we are maintaining our guidance for the full year. Bob will share more details on our second half guidance.","Now let me provide an update on our key strategic initiatives starting with the transition to our new global brand management structure. We made excellent progress in the quarter with all six brand presidents and their leadership teams now in place, our new global line planning process well underway, and the clarification of decision rights across brands, regions and channels. The global line planning process is one of the most important elements of the new operating model as it impacts the way we design, merchandise and plan our assortments.","The Men's Polo brand successfully piloted this new process as the team planned for the fall of 2016 season. The team began with input from the regions and channels and the view of the successes and opportunities of the prior season. This led into category and classification strategies to start the design process. When the new line was completed several weeks ago, the positive impact of the process was evident, yielding significant product innovation, greater global brand consistency, and style and SKU reductions.","For example, for fall 2016, Polo will feature lighter weight fabrics and a more wear-now sensibility for warm weather stores and early deliveries in northern climate stores. There will also be more elevated product, including more sport coats and dress furnishings as these elements have seen strong sales in our retail stores. We expect a double-digit reduction in SKUs compared to the same season last year and this is on top of the reduction we achieved in fall 2015. So, we are very encouraged by this progress. We will be rolling out the global line planning process to other brands over the coming weeks as we kick off the design and development process for the spring 2017 season, and we believe there will be tremendous benefit across our portfolio.","The success of the Men's Polo pilot has led to enthusiasm and confidence among the brand teams as to the benefits this new way of working will have on the strength of our assortments and the efficiency of our operation. We continue to expect a significant reduction in SKUs and sample and design cost which will lead to better inventory turns, higher gross margins, and meaningful SG&A cost savings across the brand portfolio over the next 18 months to 24 months. We've also initiated a new global brand strategic planning process that will be completed over the next few months. This will be the first time we will have a holistic strategic view by brand across all geographies and channels of distribution.","We are raising our estimate for annual expense savings associated with the restructure to $110 million from $100 million, given the progress we have made in the global brand restructuring effort, as well as incremental store closures we have identified. As a result, we expect a higher restructuring charge of $120 million to $150 million versus our previous estimate of $70 million to $100 million. This increase also includes the impact of recent management changes and one-time charges primarily related to litigation settlements.","Turning to our direct-to-consumer growth strategy, we are expanding our reach through new store openings and elevating our presentation through renovation activity in our existing fleet. In the second quarter, we renovated our Ralph Lauren store in South Coast Plaza, which will reopen shortly, and we will be starting renovations at our Beverly Hills flagship store. These activities will reinforce our luxury presence and elevate our positioning in the Los Angeles market. For Polo, we opened five new directly operated stores in the quarter, including two in the U.S. and three in Asia. We also made progress with re-positioning select stores to either Ralph Lauren Luxury or the Polo Concept in North America. We expect this effort to drive better alignment and clarity by brand as well as improved store productivity and efficiency.","Across all brands and concepts, we opened 14 directly operated stores in the second quarter, as well as several licensed locations and concessions. This brings us to a total of 20 new directly operated stores for the first half of the year. And we are on track to open 40 to 50 new stores for fiscal 2016, which will provide mid-single digit square footage growth taking into account planned store closings.","Let me turn to some product highlights for the quarter. We previously announced the clarification of our luxury product offering through the merging of Women's and Men's Black Label into Ralph Lauren Collection and Purple Label. The first season of the merged line is delivering now, and the reception is very positive. We are already seeing the efficiencies of this strategy through a reduction in product development and sample costs, and we expect a strong selling season. In our accessories business, we continue to gain momentum with our iconic Ricky Collection in both existing and new silhouettes and styles. We also saw double-digit comp growth in scarves, jewelry and belts, and are continuing to focus on these categories for disproportionate growth.","Now let me turn to Polo Sport which launched in our retail stores and select department stores worldwide in August and was followed in October by a launch in 75 top DICK'S Sporting Goods stores and on dickssportinggoods.com. We kicked off the launch with the introduction of the PoloTech Shirt at the U.S. Open tennis tournament. The shirt which features industry-leading advancements in wearable technology has already generated more than 3.1 billion media impressions and continues to receive strong editorial attention. This was followed by powerful video content leveraged across all distribution channels. The early read on Polo Sport is positive, and we have already incorporated initial learning from this first season into go-forward development. We believe Polo Sport will be a significant business for us as consumers' growing desire for performance and athleisure product fits perfectly with the DNA of the Polo brand.","Overall, we are pleased with the progress we have made this year and we are confident in the company's potential for future growth. We believe that the new global brand management operating model will allow us to more fully leverage the power of our brands, and we continue to make thoughtful strategic decisions to minimize the impact of near-term market realities and maximize shareholder returns over time.","Before I turn the call over to Bob, let me say that we are all excited to have Stefan joining as our new CEO. And on behalf of Ralph, myself and the entire senior management team, we would like to recognize and thank Jackwyn Nemerov for all of her contributions over the past 11 years.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob.","Robert L. Madore - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin with a brief recap of the quarter. Second quarter net revenues were up 4% to the prior year on a constant currency basis driven by double-digit revenue growth internationally as well as the contribution of new stores and strong global e-commerce growth. This is in line with the guidance we provided of 3% to 5% constant currency growth in August. The negative FX impact to revenue growth was approximately 500 basis points, largely in line with the expectations. On a reported basis, net revenues declined 1% to $2 billion in the second quarter.","Gross profit margin was 56.5% in the second quarter. This was 30 basis points below the prior year period. The decline in gross profit margin was due to unfavorable foreign currency effects. On a constant currency basis, gross margin was up 90 basis points compared to the prior year due to lower negotiated sourcing costs, benefit from the initial phases of SKU and style rationalization, increased full-price selling and mix benefits.","Operating margin in the second quarter was 13.5% excluding one-time charges, 90 basis points below the prior year. This is significantly better than the outlook we provided of 275-basis-point to 325-basis-point decline in August. The operating margin was favorable to our guidance due to better than expected gross margin, cost savings from the global brand organization plan and disciplined expense management. The lower operating margin to the prior year was attributable to negative foreign currency effects and incremental investments in infrastructure.","Net income for the second quarter was $184 million or $2.13 per diluted share, excluding one-time charges. Earnings per share grew 13% to the prior year period, excluding foreign currency impacts and one-time charges. On a reported basis, net income was $160 million or $1.86 per diluted share in the second quarter. The effective tax rate of 29% in the second quarter on an adjusted basis was slightly below our guidance of 30% due to discrete tax items and compared to an effective tax rate of 28% in the prior-year period.","Moping on to segment performance, wholesale revenues increased 3% in constant currency in the second quarter. Wholesale revenue was supported by double-digit constant currency growth in Europe with the strength across all brands. On a reported basis, wholesale revenues of $927 million were 2% below the prior-year period. Wholesale operating margin in the second quarter was 26.8% excluding one-time charges. This was 60 basis points above the prior-year period, driven by gross margin improvement and disciplined expense management.","Retail sales increased 5% in constant currency, to $996 million in the second quarter. Growth was driven by incremental contribution from new stores and strong global e-commerce growth. Comparable store sales declined 1% in constant currency and declined 6% on a reported basis. International same store sales were positive with particular strength in Europe, Japan, China, and Australia but comps declined in North America as traffic was pressured by the strong U.S. dollar and the overall retail environment.","Our e-commerce trend improved somewhat from last quarter but was offset by our brick-and-mortar comp, which was down 2% to 3%, similar to last quarter. Within e-commerce, our international business continued to post strong double-digit gains. Excluding one-time charges, retail operating margin in the second quarter was 12.8%, which was 80 basis points below the prior-year period, reflecting fixed expense deleverage and negative foreign currency effects. Licensing revenues increased 7% in constant currency in the second quarter, and licensing operating income was in-line with the prior year period.","Moving on to the balance sheet, consolidated inventory was $1.4 billion at the end of the second quarter, up 7% year-over-year. This growth reflects investments to support new store openings and increased shipments of Polo Sport and Polo Women's. At the end of the second quarter, we had 32 more directly operated stores and 82 more concessions in the chain than a year ago, which is contributing to the growth. We feel comfortable with our inventory levels and the quality of our inventory.","Moving on to capital expenditures, we spent $134 million in the second quarter compared to $91 million in the prior-year period. The company also repurchased 1.1 million shares of its common stock during the second quarter at a cost of $130 million. This brought year-to-date repurchases to $280 million. At the end of the second quarter, approximately $300 million remained available for future share repurchases. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet and $727 million of total debt. This reflects the new $300 million senior note offering we completed in August.","Now I'd like to turn to guidance for fiscal 2016. As Chris mentioned, we are taking a prudent approach to planning the balance of the fiscal year. As a result, despite our Q2 beat, we are maintaining our guidance for the full year. We continue to expect reported revenues to be approximately flat for the year, driven by a 3% to 5% constant currency revenue growth and 400 basis points of negative impact from foreign currency based on current exchange rates.","The constant currency growth will be supported by significant contributions from the strategic initiatives which we have invested in over the last several years, as well as the actions we are taking to mitigate negative currency impacts including raising pricing for the spring 2016 season in Europe, Japan, Canada, and Australia. Retail segment revenues are expected to grow faster than wholesale. As a reminder, we have a 53rd week in fiscal 2016.","Moving on to operating income, on a reported basis, we continue to expect our full year, fiscal 2016 operating margin to be approximately 100 basis points to 230 basis points below fiscal year 2015's levels due to unfavorable currency impacts. This guidance excludes one-time charges that are primarily related to restructuring activities associated with our global brand reorganization. We expect these one-time charges to approximate $120 million to $150 million for fiscal 2016, of which $38 million was recognized in the second quarter and $83 million in the first half of fiscal 2016. This is higher than the estimate we shared previously of $70 million to $100 million due to inclusion of additional charges associated with the recently announced management changes and additional restructuring activities.","Our fiscal 2016 tax rate is expected to be 30%. We are planning approximately $400 million to $500 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 to support our global direct-to-consumer and infrastructure investments. For the third quarter fiscal 2016, we expect net revenues to grow zero to 2% on a reported basis. We estimate the negative currency impact on sales growth in the third quarter to be 250 basis points. Our operating margin for the third quarter is expected to be 200 basis points to 250 basis points below the prior-year period due to negative foreign currency effects and infrastructure investments. The third quarter tax rate is estimated at 31%.","Overall, we are pleased with the better than expected second quarter results. Disciplined planning and rigorous attention to the day-to-day execution enabled us to offset meaningful FX and environmental headwinds in addition to driving our strategic initiatives forward.","With that, we'll open the call up for your questions. Operator, can you assist us with that?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The first question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Thank you. Good morning. Nice quarter, guys. Stefan, I know it's your first week, so I'm not going to ask you any detailed questions on the company, but I would love to get your view kind of on the global apparel fashion landscape, how you see it evolving, especially given your experiences at H&M and Old Navy which are two very different brands than Ralph Lauren. And then kind of accordingly, how does that shape your view of what the biggest opportunities are at Ralph Lauren? Thanks.","Stefan Larsson - Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Omar. And I'll start with \u2013 I hear it as two questions, one being my view on the global landscape. So, I believe that independent of where you're in the market today, in fashion apparel, you have to be special, you have to be unique, you have to be exciting, you have to stand for something, you have to be consistent, you have to focus on quality, you have to focus on the experience, and you have to deliver something great. So that's very much what attracted me when I had that first dinner with Ralph. I realized that this is his vision. This is how he has built this great company and that's why I said in my opening remarks that I believe that vision is more relevant than ever before, given what I see happening out there.","And coming to the biggest opportunity \u2013 that connects to me to the biggest opportunities, I believe that Ralph's vision that started with ties and a drawer at the Empire State building and has built into where we stand right now is just a beginning. I believe that there are really good days ahead of us.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. Congrats on a great quarter in a tough environment. I guess just two questions. I apologize if they are a little wordy. So, I was a little surprised by the magnitude of the gross margin improvement from the SKU improvement you guys made this early, considering you told us the roll out of the global SKU program will really be only in place for one brand, Polo, I think, by fall of 2016. It sounds like you went through a smaller manual process today and it translated to a lot of improvement. Can you give us any quantitative metrics to help us think about how much you lowered SKUs by this quarter and how that may \u2013 what the magnitude of that is relative to what we're going to see next year in the fall as you roll it out?","And then as a follow-up, you've had us focused on some investment buckets for the past few years. You've commented on e-commerce and SAP spend peaking this year. I think you'll have less intensity in flagship openings next year, so maybe the retail investment isn't quite as intense, but maybe if we start adding up those buckets up again, can you give us your early thoughts based on the components as you see them today for your ability to leverage margins in fiscal 2017? Thank you.","Robert L. Madore - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. So, let me take the first part of that first. So, I think the results obviously came in significantly better than we expected this quarter when we gave guidance on the quarter and really about \u2013 we beat the operating margin expectation that we had by about 200 basis points. And if you look at that beat, about half of it was due to gross margin and half of it was due to SG&A and it was really a function of a number of items. On the gross margin side, we did see benefits from the SKU and style rationalization and you're right, that we tackled that when we started the global merchandising group about a year or two ago in a manual way. We're just scratching the surface of that, I would say at this point, because the systemic approach to the style and SKU rationalization is really what's coming in the global line planning process which was going to kick in 12 months to 18 months from now.","So I would say if you looked at Men's Polo for fall of 2015, we might have been down a low double-digit percentage of styles and SKUs. And then when you look at fall of 2016, we're expecting again, even versus that lower base, another improvement of equal magnitude, and I think on many of the other brands, we've had an initial little bit of a progress, but I think there's more progress ahead of us going forward as we move into the line planning process.","We also, on the gross margin side though, benefited from the lower negotiated sourcing costs. If you recall when we took the big foreign exchange hurt back earlier this calendar year, we commissioned our manufacturing and sourcing group to go back to our sourcing and supply chain base, and that sourcing discussion and cost discussion has resulted in average unit cost reductions that came a little bit bigger than we expected and faster. And then we also benefited from improved full-price sell throughs during the quarter. So, all of that kind of went in the positive direction which led to the gross margin improvement.","Relative to next fiscal year, I think we are just about to kick off the budgeting process, so it's premature to give guidance on next fiscal year. We'll provide qualitative perspective at our next call but your comment is accurate in that certainly from an infrastructure standpoint, we expect the e-commerce replatforming spend to be higher next year as we ramp up the work on moving to the new e-commerce platform, but we do expect the SAP spending to moderate though. I expect infrastructure in total to not be a significant year-over-year driver.","The retail investment also, I don't expect to be a year-over-year driver because we're at about the rate of new store openings that we anticipate going forward. I do think that we're going to see foreign exchange impact next year continuing, primarily on the transactional side, because the hedging program that we had in place this year will roll off over the next 9 months to 12 months, so we'll see a transactional hit although the translational impact should be small to non-existent at current rates. But then we're going to start to see some of the benefits from all of the restructuring work that we've done, both from the global brand restructuring, from the line planning and from the pricing actions that we put in place that should start to roll in over the next 12 months.","So, we'll provide more specifics on how all of that nets against each other on the next call but that's where we stand at the moment.","Operator","Thank you.","Robert L. Madore - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Next call.","Operator","The next question is from Bob Drbul with Nomura Securities.","Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. You mentioned that the inventory levels at retail and in department stores were elevated a bit. I guess, when you look at the forecast that you laid out for the rest of this fiscal year, can you just walk us through some of the markdown assumptions that you will see necessary and sort of how you're thinking about the markdown support to department stores versus your own retail operations?","Christopher H. Peterson - President-Global Brands","Yeah. So, I think we feel very good about the currency of our inventory. So when we look at our inventory, the currency of our inventory is very well-positioned from a current season and future season basis versus a prior season inventory. The inventory growth that we've had in our inventory versus year ago is really to support new store activity and new product introductions like Polo Sport around the world. When we look at the U.S. department store channel, I think that's the place where we see a little bit of elevated inventory across the channel that is not just in our business, but broadly defined in many of the competitors. And I think it's a function of the foreign tourist traffic being down in the U.S. as well as the unseasonably warm start to the fall season.","And so as we approach the holiday selling period, which is obviously the biggest selling period of the year for our industry, we felt like it was the right thing to take a prudent approach to that given where we're headed. We've got a long history of navigating through this in a very strong way, and we've got real expertise within the company to help us do this. And what we're trying to do is keep our inventory fresh and current, exit the season in a positive way as we transition to the next season, but do that in a way that protects the brand equity in the consumers' eyes. And so that's what we're going to be doing as we've done for many years.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Kate McShane with Citigroup.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Thank you. Good morning.","Christopher H. Peterson - President-Global Brands","Good morning.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Just on the outlook for the back half of the year, why don't you think some of your, excuse me, expense management and lower sourcing costs impacting the back half more? Are there any expenses that shifted out of this quarter into the next quarter, and is the caution on the back half of the year more from the cancelations or the potential for cancelations or more from anticipated markdowns at your wholesale partners?","Christopher H. Peterson - President-Global Brands","Yeah. So, I think that \u2013 we haven't seen expense shifts that have gone from the second quarter to the third quarter. So, I think we're being prudent given the environment that we see as we head through the back half of the year. So, the guidance for the back half of the year is really more a function of that. We have not seen cancelation in orders. And in fact, if you look broadly across the business, it's really a mixed environment. In Europe, our reorder rate is stronger than it's ever been. And so we're seeing real strength in the wholesale channel in Europe, and we're chasing to catch up with the reorder rate there. In the U.S., I think we're being cautious given the environment that we're facing. We're wanting to manage the markdown allowances in a prudent manner that, as I mentioned on the previous question, positions us well as we exit the fall season and transition into the spring season.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from David Glick with Buckingham Research Group.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Yes. Good morning. Thank you. Just a question on your Polo retail strategy, obviously it's one of your key growth pillars. The Men's business is obviously a very well-established business in wholesale and retail. Women's in Polo is a newer business, I presume, to attract a younger consumer. Can you share with us your learning so far and what, if any, repositioning you have to do from an assortment perspective, maybe from casual to dressier or how are you feeling about the Polo Women's business and is this still just an important growth initiative as it was positioned certainly over the last year? Thank you.","Christopher H. Peterson - President-Global Brands","Yeah. No, you're exactly right. So, we feel very good about the Polo Men's business which is historically one of the strongest businesses in the company. The Polo Women's business, we launched I guess about a year ago and we've seen what I would say as good results to date. The business has been stronger internationally than it has in the U.S. as we've started off.","In the international markets in Europe and in Asia, we largely replaced a Blue Label business that was discontinued and we took many of the locations that were Blue Label locations and converted them to Women's Polo locations. And that business, the Women's Polo business, has now not only surpassed the size of the Blue Label business, but at price points that are below where Blue Label was. So, the unit velocity of the Polo Women's business internationally is more than double the unit velocity rate of the Blue Label business. And we see significant expansion opportunities for distribution of Women's Polo around the world.","In the U.S., where we didn't have a very well-developed Blue Label business, we launched Women's Polo in incremental spaces into the marketplace. I think we're off to a good start in that business. We see it as a critical element of the company's future growth strategy, and we're working to take learnings from the initial seasons and develop them into the line as part of the line planning process that we're kicking off for Women's Polo as we go forward. So, I think we're encouraged by the start that we've had, but there's more to do, and certainly a lot more opportunity ahead of us, because, as you know, the Women's fashion and apparel business is bigger than Men's. And with the strength of the Polo brand and the strength of Polo Men's, we continue to see a big opportunity in Polo Women's.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Christian Buss with Credit Suisse.","Christian Roland Buss - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yes, hello. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the line planning process and what kind of changes you're making there. If you could talk about sort of how far into the 2016 design season you are now, and where the real opportunities are for improvement of the design process and the cleaning up of the design process?","Christopher H. Peterson - President-Global Brands","Sure. So as I mentioned a little bit in the prepared remarks, we started with a pilot of the line planning process on the Men's Polo line, which is our biggest line for fall of 2016, and we've now largely completed that pilot process. And it's interesting because the way that we did the pilot process is we started with a hindsighting approach of looking at prior seasons. We also then engaged all of the region and channel leaders around the world to bring in consumer input and feedback into develop \u2013 which we used to develop category and classification strategies and develop specific targets for price points, margins, SKUs by category and classification which then led to an architecture that we handed off to the design community. And I have to say the design community did an outstanding job of using that feedback and designing a line that is very compelling.","So that line that was designed has now been shared back with the regions and the channel teams and the response from the region and channel teams has been terrific to the design community's progress in terms of product innovation. I'm not going to talk about all of the product innovation at this point because I don't want to give away too much of our secrets. But I referenced a couple of the items that you're going see as we move into the fall 2016 Men's Polo line. You are going to see us having lighter weight fabrics, a more wear-now sensibility. About half of the Polo distribution is in warm weather climate locations. And we felt like we had a big opportunity to design into that so that both for the early part of the fall season in the Northern climate stores, and the majority of the fall season in the warm climate stores we had product that was more compelling, more innovative and more attractive for those target locations. And I think we've delivered on that. And there's a series of themes like that that you're going to see as we go through that.","So that's where we are really for the fall process on the line planning process. We're really kicking off the line planning process for the spring 2017 season for the majority of the balance of the brands and categories. And so, I expect that we'll see similar results for the spring 2017 season as we get through the process on the other brands.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Rick Patel with Stephens.","Rick Patel - Stephens, Inc.","Good morning. Nice quarter, and Stefan great to have you on the call. I have a question on e-commerce. So it seems like you did quite well globally, but if I recall correctly, there were some significant competitor promotions in the last quarter. I'm curious if they continued and perhaps limited the upside for this channel. And then secondly, just a question on e-commerce margins. Because it's managed by partners right now, but as you go live with your own websites in the coming years, what kind of margin uptick should we expect from bringing it in-house? Thank you.","Christopher H. Peterson - President-Global Brands","Sure. So the global e-commerce revenue was up 10% in the second quarter, and this compared to the 2% increase we had in the first quarter. So we were encouraged by the acceleration of revenue growth in the e-commerce channel. I think that we continue to stay true to our promotional cadence, where as I mentioned on the last call, we decided to pull back a little bit in terms of the amount of business that we were doing on sale. But what we had this quarter were some omni-channel initiatives like buy online ship from store, hold online pick up in store, the new wait list functionality and product videos that drove higher average order value and the combination of those new omni-channel initiatives I think is what drove the return to stronger growth. And that was true both out internationally, but also true in the North America e-commerce business.","Relative to the profitability, today we pay eBay Enterprise or the formerly GSI a percent of revenue for the service that they're providing on \u2013 that's a percent of e-commerce revenue. In addition to that, we're incurring charges associated with insourcing the platform. Once we convert off of the GSI platform to our insourced platform, that GSI fee will go to zero and so we're effectively double paying if you will today for both in-house and outsourced capability. We expect to convert off of the eBay, GSI platform over the next 12 months to 18 months. So I think you'll see us double paying for a 12-month to 18-month period and then you'll see us start to generate the benefit after that.","The other point I would make is we expect the insourced capability and cost to be lower than the GSI fee that we're paying. So it's not just that we're getting more capability but we're getting more capability at a lower going cost structure.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay Beth Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask two quick ones. First, you've talked about price increases that you took \u2013 high single digit price increases that you took on products sold overseas, and I know that that product doesn't really hit the shelves until the spring season, but I was curious if you had any read. I know your customers have generally accepted the price increases. If there's any read that gives you more or less confidence that consumers will also accept them?","And then, second, Chris, if you could just touch on, now that you're actually seeing some of the benefits from the work you've been doing over the last several quarters in improving efficiencies, line planning, SKU reduction and all that sort of stuff, whether you have sort of fresh perspective on what the margin recovery opportunity is for the business over the longer term as all of these things that you sound so encouraged by and all the long-term opportunity to improve efficiency really comes through? Thanks.","Christopher H. Peterson - President-Global Brands","Sure. Let me start with the price increase question. So, I think, it's a little bit early to talk about the consumer reaction to the price increase, but I'll give you a little bit of what we're seeing, and it's encouraging, because we did see, and as you know, we took sort of mid- to high-single digit price increases in the \u2013 to respond to the currency devaluation in Europe, in Canada, in Japan and in Australia, which were the markets that were the most affected by devaluation.","In Europe, which is the largest market that we've taken price increases in, we still haven't got the product on the floor in front of consumers, but we have gone through a wholesale market with the higher prices, and what we've seen from that market from wholesale orders is that the wholesale orders have been actually in line with our previous growth rate in terms of unit volume.","And so the pricing has come on top of the unit volume, and so we're encouraged by that from a sell-in perspective where we're seeing that the pricing isn't a barrier to strong sell-in in the wholesale channel. We're also hearing that many of the competitors are taking pricing in the market as well. But we don't yet have the consumer read of what is the consumer reaction when that product shows up on the retail and wholesale floors. I expect that we'll get some early indication of that over the next three months or so.","And then on the question on longer term margin, certainly we're very encouraged by the line planning work that we've done, the SKU reduction opportunity, the global brand reorganization from a cost savings, and from a efficiency of operation. I think, it's a little bit too soon to say what that means for longer term margins, but certainly we believe all of these things can contribute to a margin improvement story over the next three years to five years. And so we're very much shooting for an operating margin improvement story over that time period as many of these initiatives begin to take hold.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Congrats on a nice quarter. So as we think about the go forward constant currency revenues, aside from the mid-single digit square footage growth which should continue, what's the best way to think about steady state, North America and Europe wholesale growth versus retail comps, again, in more of a steady state environment if we ever see one?","Christopher H. Peterson - President-Global Brands","Yeah. So, you know, I think that we would like to return to a steady state environment, but we're not counting on returning to a steady state environment. So, I think, we're trying to manage the business in a volatile period where we are seeing significant moves in tourist traffic around the world. I do think if you look at Europe and the U.S. combined from a wholesale perspective, I think our view is that that channel is going to grow at sort of a low single-digit rate.","We continue to believe that we can grow market share in that channel by entering new product categories and innovating on our product lines, so we think we might be able to grow a couple of points faster than the channel as we gain market share which we've pretty consistently done over the last 5 years to 10 years. And then I think our direct-to-consumer strategy of e-commerce and retail expansion is likely to remain a disproportionate growth driver for us going forward.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Jay Sole with Morgan Stanley.","Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. Stefan, I want to ask you just a little bit more about your answer you gave to the first question. At Old Navy, you talked a lot about how aspirational is becoming mass-pirational, in that the democratization of fashion was a big reason that Old Navy was becoming more successful. Can you talk about how the Ralph Lauren and Polo brands can navigate through that environment and how, you know, what your vision is to keep the brand special and continue to perform well?","Stefan Larsson - Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thanks, Jay. I'll start with saying that I have a lot to learn. And what I already know though is that there are things happening out there, bigger changes in the environment, than ever before over the last 50 years in fashion apparel. And one change that I see is that the customer wants something special, and it has to be unique and there has to be a story. And you hear a lot of brands speaking about story telling. And then you can look back at what Ralph and the team has done. It's been years before anybody else in telling real stories, inviting customers into movie, sharing a dream of a better life.","So I believe that there is a real strength in that going forward as well. And then I have to come back to you when it comes to after I've learned more about the brands, the consumer, the market, and started to work with the team here on crafting and \u2013 out, refining the growth strategy that we already have.","Operator","Thank you. The final question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Good morning, everyone. Can you hear me okay?","Christopher H. Peterson - President-Global Brands","Yeah.","Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Great. I just wanted to \u2013 speed is a competitive advantage that certainly both of you have addressed. And Chris, just want to know how far along do you feel the business is currently in your speed initiative? And Stefan, what competencies of speed in your former jobs do you think could be brought over to Ralph Lauren over time? And, Chris, how do you see this as a margin enhancer also? Thank you.","Christopher H. Peterson - President-Global Brands","Yeah. So I'll start and then I'll let Stefan finish. I think that part of what we're doing by moving to the global brand structure is about speed of decision making and speed of execution in the market. Because when you have a centralized point of view by brand that, with all of the functional groups represented as part of the brand team, it allows us to move in a faster way. I will say that we're not yet there from a moving as fast as I think we could in some areas, and a lot of that's because we're just at the beginning of the global brand structure.","The global brand teams have been in place now for only a couple of months, and so I think they're both getting up to speed on the business, implementing line plans for the first time, developing brand strategies, we're starting to get brand financial reporting up to enable those teams to really manage the business on a more real-time basis, and so I think we're making progress, but there's more work to do.","Stefan Larsson - Chief Executive Officer","Yes, and to build on what Chris said, and hi, Dana. I believe speed is important, I've received questions throughout my career on speed. I believe it has to be grounded in an original idea. So when I look at what Ralph and the team have done to build the company to where it stands right now is based on an authentic idea. And so it's about being authentic and it's being \u2013 it's about being current at the same time. And that's part of the changes I see in the market, and that's part of why I'm very excited to be here, because Ralph has created something original, and \u2013 and being very authentic to that, and working with the team to being more and more and more authentic. But at the same time making sure that we are current. So it's finding those two components and that will deliver something that the consumer will be excited about, and that will drive growth over time.","Christopher H. Peterson - President-Global Brands","Okay. Thank you very much for joining this morning, and we will look forward to following up with you for additional questions, as always, as appropriate.

After the company\u2019s prepared remarks, we will open the call up to your questions, which we ask that you limit to one per caller.","During today\u2019s call, we will be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including our financial outlook. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees and our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Our expectations contain many risks and uncertainties. The principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from our current expectations are detailed in our SEC filings.","Now, I turn the call over to Jacki.","Jacki Nemerov","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. The third quarter results we are reporting today demonstrate the disciplined operational management of our teams through a competitive holiday season and against the backdrop of an unusually volatile macro environment. The 3% constant currency revenue we achieved in the quarter was below our expectation, largely due to external forces. As the U.S. dollar continue to strengthen against several major currencies and geopolitical tensions remained elevated. There was a sustained negative impact on global tourism, and in certain instances, local customer demand.","The U.S. market size was more competitive with greater promotional activity across all distribution channels. We gain share early in the holiday shopping period, which positioned us well as the environment became more competitive in the three weeks before Christmas. I\u2019m proud to report that we navigated these challenges in a brand appropriate way, controlling the controllable and delivering operating profitability at the high end of our outlook.","We aggressively managed expenses even as we continue to invest in our long-term strategic growth initiatives. As both a company and the brand Ralph Lauren is always taken a long view and this quarter was no exception. Now let me turn to product highlights of the fall holiday season, and begin with our luxury brands. Both men\u2019s Purple Label and Women\u2019s Collection performed well in the quarter by challenging traffic trends in our retail stores. Not only to these lines represent the purest expression of Ralph\u2019s design vision, but they exemplify the quality craftsmanship and attention to detail that the true luxury customer appreciates.","Sportswear and outerwear were particularly strong categories where our distinctive aesthetic proved especially compelling. As you know, we recently launched Polo for women, the high awareness and broad appeal of the Polo brand has translated well to the women\u2019s offering and customers around the world are embracing it. Momentum is growing with each new delivery as the distinct fashion sensibility of the brand continues to resonate with the younger customer across retail and wholesale channels. The distinctive lifestyle positioning and retail presentation of our Denim & Supply brand has created real differentiation in the marketplace.","Its appeal among millennial\u2019s had led to a strong performance of both the foundational Denim component of the line as well as the more directional fashion elements. From a category perspective, dresses continued to be a standout performer across all of our distribution channels and we\u2019ve expanded the assortment to fully represent day cocktail and formal occasion needs. Handbags and footwear also experienced strong growth in the quarter with terrific consumer response to both iconic silhouettes and new styles.","Finally, the distinctive point of view and emphasis on fashion drove strong growth for our Club Monaco brand across women\u2019s apparel, men\u2019s apparel and footwear. I\u2019d like to provide some perspective on sales trends by region since there were some very interesting differences during the quarter. Importantly, we achieved constant currency revenue growth in each of the three major operating regions of the Americas, Europe and Asia. This is despite lower sales to important tourist customers especially those from Russia and the Middle East, who have been most impacted by the volatility in currency and commodity market.","International performance was especially strong, growing double-digits in current currency with greater China and Europe registering the strongest gains. This is encouraging not only in the contest to difficult geopolitical and macroeconomic condition. But also because growing our international revenue is one of our most important strategic objective and in the year-to-date period, international revenues represented one-third of our total revenues. Our European revenues rose double-digits in constant currency during the third quarter, led by strong spring wholesale shipments and reflecting broad-based momentum throughout the region.","Generally speaking, we continued to see the best trends in Northern Europe recovery in the southern part of the continent and more steady expansion in central Europe. We achieved high single-digit constant currency growth in Asia, led by our free standing store network, with trends varying by country. Sales in Japan were quite good and continued the momentum we had last quarter. Korean sales remained challenging for the apparel sector, especially in the department stores, which represent the majority of our distribution. Double-digit constant currency revenue growth in greater China largely reflects the investment we have made a new distribution.","While Hong Kong was disrupted by prolonged political protests, we are encouraged by the performance of our recently opened Lee Gardens flagship. This is an important market for luxury brands and we believe the store appropriately positions the Ralph Lauren brand to this customer. We achieved modest growth in the Americas were lower customer traffic to brick-and-mortar stores was a formidable headwind. A planned shift in seasonal customer receipt plans for certain merchandise categories impacted our wholesale shipments during the quarter. Our North American e-commerce business grew at a double-digit rate in the third quarter and both our retail and wholesale channels.","To expand on e-commerce, since that\u2019s another important area of strategic focus, our global e-commerce revenues grew 17% in the third quarter, supported by double-digit expansion in each region. Traffic to our e-commerce sites increased significantly, with over 40% growth in mobile traffic alone. We experienced equally strong momentum for our wholesale e-commerce business. We were well prepared for this year\u2019s kickoff to the holiday season during the Thanksgiving, Black Friday week, which now stands through the increasingly important cyber Monday. The strength of our retail e-commerce was due in part to a number of site enhancements we\u2019ve made over the last several months.","These include more impactful visuals, redesigned product detail pages, enhanced quick-shop capabilities and a more streamline checkout process. We added preorder to capabilities for our women\u2019s collection line, which is an important feature for the luxury customer who wants to shop the runway. We\u2019ve also develop more robust omni-channel capabilities, leveraging technology to share inventory across our retail format. This enables us to enhance our customer service and maximize sales, while improving the productivity of our inventory.","The investments we are making in e-commerce and omni-channel capabilities beautifully showcase the Ralph Lauren lifestyle, while offering the product focus and clear call to action that this customer expects. These efforts will be enhanced even further in the next two to three years with our new e-commerce platform. This investment will ensure that ralphlauren.com is the most robust and expansive expression of the Ralph Lauren brand, and will support what we believe can be a billion dollars in sales.","I\u2019d also like to highlight the efforts of our global supply chain organization during the quarter. Over the years, our sourcing and logistics teams have navigated through not only the growing scope of our global operations across regions, channels and product categories, but also dynamic changes in input cost and all the while meeting the company\u2019s extremely high standards of quality and innovation.","The benefits of our decision to design a global supply chain organization were especially apparent during the third quarter as we contended with the West Coast port situation. The end-to-end visibility from product sourcing to customer delivery enabled our team to develop and execute robust contingency plans, minimizing risk, controlling costs, and maintaining business continuity. I\u2019m delighted to report that our service levels to customers have been maintained despite the 3 to 10 day extended transit times that the disruption has created for the industry and I want to extend my thanks to this remarkable team for their extraordinary work.","The global supply chain teams also made excellent progress on a number of critical strategic initiative design to continuously improve our productivity. Some of the most compelling areas of opportunity have come from improved supply and demand visibility. This is allowed us to better leverage our volume growth and to be more disciplined with respect to managing product minimum, reducing product lead times and consolidating shipments.","We believe that they are still more opportunity and this will continue to remain an area of focus. The unexpected challenges we faced in the third quarter followed better than expected sales and profit trends in the first half of the year. We are proud of our progress against the company\u2019s long-term growth objectives and with our ability to consistently invest in these areas while still executing day-to-day operations to our exacting standards. We are able to do this as a result of the strategic diversity of our operating model, the power of our brand portfolio, the desirability of our products, and the high level of operational control we have over business.","In November, I mentioned the next exciting endeavor for our Polo brand, the global launch of Polo Sport, beginning with the introduction of men\u2019s and boy\u2019s for the fall \u201815 season. Across the globe, the feedback on this product has been strong and seen as a natural fit with the spirit and sensibility of Polo. As you know, the active segment of the apparel market is growing at a rapid rate and we believe there is a significant long-term market share opportunity for Polo.","I also want to mention the most delicious extension of our Polo brand, our new restaurant in New York. The Polo bar officially opened on January 9th and the response has been sensational. From the food to the service to the decor, Ralph has brought something special and unique to the Manhattan dining scene and we are overwhelmed by the enthusiasm people have to experience the brand in this way.","Based on the continued uncertainty of the global macroeconomic environment, we are planning the fourth quarter next year cautiously and responsibly. This included a comprehensive look at our operating model. Chris will take you through some of our plans to move to a global brand management structure with new systems and processes to support the stronger sales and profit growth we expect over the next five years.","As challenging of the macro environment is, I believe we are operating from a position of strength and that our company is mobilized to manage through it. We have a long-term plan; a clear strategic roadmap to help us realized that plan, the managerial talent to navigate that roadmap and $1.4 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet to support our efforts. The board shares our confidence in both our future growth plans and our financial condition as evidenced by increase in the quarterly dividend payment that was announced today.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Chris.","Chris Peterson","Thank you, Jacki, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019d like to start with a brief recap of the quarter. Consolidated net revenues rose 1% to $2 billion in the third quarter. Adjusting for FX headwinds, revenues increased 3%, which was achieved on top of a 9% gain on the prior year period, led by the retail segment and driven by our strategic focus on e-commerce and new store development. Every geographic region grew on constant currency during the quarter with the international business up double-digits.","Reported revenue actualized below our outlook of 3% to 5% growth, due to negative foreign exchange and weaker than expected trends at our retail stores, which were impacted by a decline in traffic, especially among important tourist customers and a more promotional holiday period in the U.S. Gross profit margin of 57% was a 120 basis points below the prior year period. We anticipated decline in gross profit margin was due to mix impacts, the more promotional U.S. marketplace and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts.","Operating margin of 15.5% was 110 basis points below the prior year, entirely attributable to the lower gross profit margin. This was at the high end of the outlook with provided in November, due to strong and proactive expense management throughout the organization and despite incremental investments and new store openings, marketing and infrastructure projects. Net income of $215 million was 9% below the prior year, and net income per diluted share decline 6% to $2.41 million.","Moving on to segment performance, wholesale revenues increased 2% in constant currency, which was achieved on top of 14% gain in the prior year period. On a reported basis, wholesale revenues of $837 million or in line with the prior year. Growth in European whole shipments was offset by lower shipments in the Americas due to the cadence of seasonal receipt plans and unfavorable foreign exchange. Wholesale operating margin of 24.7% was 120 basis points below the prior year due to product mix impacts. Retail sales rose 5% in constant currency and were up 2% to $1.1 billion on a reported basis.","Growth was driven by the incremental contribution from new stores and included double-digit growth for global e-commerce. Comparable store sales were in line with the prior year in constant currency and declined 2% on a reported basis, due to foreign exchange. Constant dollar comp trends reflect strong e-commerce performance and positive growth internationally that was offset by a decline in comps in the Americas, which continue to experience challenging traffic trends at brick-and mortar stores. Retail operating margin was 16.9%, 260 basis points below the prior year period, reflecting the more promotional U.S. marketplace and cost associated with the company\u2019s global store and e-commerce development efforts.","Licensing revenues increased 6% and operating margin rose 7% in the third quarter, due to higher royalties from increase sales of Ralph Lauren, Polo and Lauren products around the world. Consolidated inventory was $1.2 billion at the end of the quarter, reflecting investments to support anticipated sales growth for existing operations and new store openings. We spent approximately $124 million on capital expenditures in the third quarter, mostly to support new retail stores and infrastructure projects. Company also repurchased about 550,000 shares of its common stock, utilizing $100 million of its authorization and bringing year-to-date repurchased activity to $350 million.","At the end of the quarter $230 million remained available for future buybacks, and we have $1.4 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet. At this point, I\u2019d like to review our outlook for the balance of the year and provide some preliminary perspective on fiscal \u201816. For the fourth quarter, we expect consolidated revenues to increase at a mid-single digit rate in constant currency, which is an acceleration from the third quarter and year-to-date results. Based on current foreign exchange rates, FX is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by approximately 550 basis points.","Operating margin for the fourth quarter\u2019s expected to be 250 to 300 basis points below the prior year with relatively equal pressure on gross margin and operating expenses. The decline in operating margin reflects unfavorable foreign exchange impacts, investments and the company\u2019s strategic growth objectives and a cautious view of the global environment, which we believe this prudent of this time. Fourth quarter tax rate is expected to be approximately 31% to 32%. For the full year fiscal \u201815 period revenues are expected to increase about 4% in constant currency and we now anticipate of 200 basis point negative impact from foreign exchange.","This compares to our prior outlook of 5% to 7%. The full year fiscal \u201915 operating margin is now estimated to be 170 to 190 basis points below the prior year\u2019s level compares to a prior expectation of a 100 to 125 basis points decline. The change in operating margin guidance is driven by the lower sales outlook and foreign exchange.","As a remainder, the primary drivers of the year-over-year contraction in operating margin are the incremental investments for making to expand our global store network strengthen the company\u2019s infrastructure and increased advertising and marketing. The fiscal 2015 tax rate continues to be estimated at 30%. If we look to the future, we remained committed to investing in the growth initiatives that we believe we\u2019ll provide us with a more robust platform for future sales and profit growth.","While we have not yet completed our fiscal 2016 budget, I want to provide some qualitative insight into how we are approaching next fiscal year. The context in which we are operating has changed. In addition to political and economic challenges around the world, we are experiencing significant headwinds from foreign exchange rates. Based on current exchange rates, FX will have about a 550 basis point negative impact on fiscal \u201916 revenue growth.","The combination of translational and transactional currency effects is estimated to reduce our full year operating income by approximately $185 million. This is the most significant currency impact the company has experienced in the fiscal year. To deal with these external realities, we are taking decisive actions to mitigate their impact. First, we intend to raise prices in certain markets that have been impacted by currency devaluation including Japan, Canada and Europe.","Second, our supply chain organization is negotiating lower prices across our manufacturing base as a result of lower raw material cost and oil prices as well as the strength of the U.S. dollar. Finally, we intend to reduce operating cost by restructuring the organization something I\u2019ll come back to you later. With that as a backdrop, we are currently planning mid-single digit constant currency revenue growth in fiscal \u201816 supported by significant contributions from the strategic initiatives in which we\u2019ve invested over the last several years.","These include new product development, new store development and global e-commerce. Retail segment revenues are expected to grow faster than wholesale due to expanded square footage in continued momentum in e-commerce. On a constant dollar basis, we expect operating margin from continuing operations to improve from fiscal 2015 level due to gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage. We intend to reinvest that improvement in two main areas, the build out of the new global e-commerce platform and global store development including the renovation of several existing stores.","Over the next two years, we expect to re-merchandize several existing locations to our Ralph Lauren or Polo concepts in order to refine brand positioning, streamline assortments and better service the customer. On a reported basis, we expect operating margin to be down due to the foreign exchange impact I mentioned earlier. We will provide more specifics on our fiscal \u201916 operating margin expectations in May after we completed the budget process.","Let me now turn to the operating model change that Jacki referred to few minutes ago. For a number of reasons, we decided that the time was right to transform the way in which our organization is structured, how we design and manage our processes and how we make decisions. This is a significant change to position the company for stronger future performance. About 15 years ago, the company embarked on a long range plan to assume direct control over strategically important regions and merchandise categories.","This began with the acquisition of the European business in 2000. Over the next decade, the company acquired more than a dozen previously licensed businesses. These actions allowed us to maximize the sales and profit potential of each of these businesses while elevating the presentation of the brands. The result however was a complex operating model. To address this, we first turned to infrastructure upgrading systems in order to integrate what was a highly fragmented channel and regional structure.","Next, we began to globalize several critical corporate functions, such as finance, IT, supply chain and merchandizing. Today, we are taking the next step to simplify our operating model. Over the next several months, we will commence plans to move from a decentralized channel and regional structure to a fully integrated global brand-based organization structure. We have always believed that our brands are greatest assets and a significant competitive advantage. Our strength as a company stems from the vitality and desirability of our brands.","In this new structure, we will create global brand groups that will not only define the strategy from the design and merchandising to retail concepts and marketing, but will also have accountability for financial performance around the world. Importantly, we will continue to have regional channel and functional teams, but not only provide critical expertise and insight to the global brand groups, but also operate the business on the day-to-day basis.","We believe this will strengthen the connectivity from the design vision to the consumer impression and ensure greater clarity and consistency of brand expression. While each of our brands enjoys high awareness and regard today, we believe this new organization design will further enhance brand equity. We see this next step is a critical milestone to realizing our vision of operating as a truly global business, maximizing our growth potential and realizing significant operating efficiencies. Let me give just one example. Now that we have completed the SAP rollout across design in global manufacturing, we have visibility for the first time into our SKU development, adoption and performance.","We now know that last year, we designed 130,000 SKUs across the company with the commonality rate by brand in like locations around the world that is very low. The new structure and processes will enable a significant reduction in SKUs, which will lead to lower inventory levels, better gross margins and SG&A cost savings. Our goal once the new structure is fully implemented is to achieve over $100,000 in annual expense savings. Only a modest amount will be realized in fiscal \u201816 with more significant savings in fiscal \u201817 and beyond.","We expect to incur restructuring charge as a result of this reorganization and we are currently working through the details of the plan. We will provide more insight in May. We are very excited about the company\u2019s growth prospects. We are investing in the business and making the right strategic decisions in order to minimize the impact of near-term market realities and maximize shareholder returns overtime.","With that, we\u2019ll open up the call for your questions. Operator, can you assist us.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad","Thanks, good morning. Chris and Jacki, hoping you could elaborate little more on some of the organizational changes that you discussed this morning. The impetus behind them, maybe some more anecdotal ideas around where you can see benefits accrue over time, as you shift the organizational structure and then where you stand on the HR perspective, I believe in teams and people in place for a kind of brand centric global organization. More color on those would be really helpful. Thanks.","Chris Peterson","Yeah, let me start, I think that a lot of the work that we\u2019ve done in the company over the last couple of years to globalize the company in terms of our systems, in terms of some of the functions that we move to a global basis, as really enabled us to take the next step. And so we think now is the right time because of a lot of this ground work that we\u2019ve laid over the past couple of years to really set the stage for the new organization model and we think that this creates a platform for future sales and revenue growth acceleration, because what it\u2019s going to enable us to do is be more focused on a by brand basis and really integrate the work of design, merchandizing, marketing, retail store concepts around the world.","And so if you think about the way we\u2019re operating today, because of the way we\u2019ve acquired licenses, we\u2019re really operating with many different groups around the world that are performing similar activities. And we believe that this new construct will allow us to enhance the brand clarity and consistency around the world, while driving operating efficiencies at the same time. In terms of where we are from an HR standpoint, I think as we alluded to prepared remarks, this is going to require a detailed design work which we\u2019re in the middle of and we expect to have much more specifics when we come back and talk on the May call on that basis.","James Hurley","Next question? Lora we\u2019re ready for the next question.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti","Thanks, good morning guys. Chris, I was wondering if you could help us with a little more color on your comments on the operating margin outlook for fiscal \u201916 when you exclude FX.","Chris Peterson","Yeah. So I guess I would say a couple of things. First, let me just describe the FX impact a little bit and then I\u2019ll come back to the underlying. So, I think as we mentioned we expect FX at current rates to have about a negative 550 basis point impact on the top-line. A lot of our cost structure is in U.S. dollars, Swiss francs and Hong Kong dollars, because that\u2019s where we have our big standards of operation from an SG&A standpoint from overhead and of course a lot of our manufacturing base is in currencies that have not depreciated as much as the Euro, the Japanese yen, the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar. So when we look at the FX impact on the top-line of 5.5%, the flow through of that to the bottom-line is a little bit over 40% in terms of the impact that it has which is what leads to the $185 million headwind because our cost structure is not denominated in local currency.","On the underlying basis, back to your question, I think that we expect our operating margin on the underlying basis to be up versus this year and that\u2019s because some of the investments that we\u2019ve been making in terms of our infrastructure, in terms of the retail store development and in terms of the increased marketing and advertising were seeing positive trends from those that are driving growth in operating margin on an underlying basis. The two headwinds that we have next year which we expect to offset the underlying increase in operating margin are the e-commerce platform, which will be a bigger investment next year than this year, but we believe strategically the right thing for us to do as we\u2019ve talked about in the past and the continuation of our retail store development effort particularly where we\u2019re looking to re-merchandize many of our stores from the world of Ralph Lauren concept into distinctive Ralph Lauren luxury stores or Polo stores, which we think are clearer to the consumer.","James Hurley","Next question?","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from David Glick with Buckingham Research Group.","David Glick","Yes, thank you. Just a follow-up question on your America\u2019s business, I was just wondering if you can give us obviously the international business in constant currency was very strong, little bit of noise in North American wholesale. How do you think about in the sort of context of the new world as you describe and how do you think about the underlying growth potential on a near and intermediate long-term basis of your wholesale and retail businesses in U.S. in comparison to what continues to be strong performances in Europe and Asia.","Chris Peterson","I think if you \u2013 if we look at the wholesale business, we believe the wholesale business which is largely focused in U.S. and Western Europe as a channel is likely to grow at a sort of a 0% to 2% rate. We believe we have opportunity to grow market share and we\u2019ve pretty consistently been growing market share in that channel if we look over the last 10 years and so we think we can grow a couple of points faster, which would position us at sort of a low to mid-single digit growth rate in the wholesale business going forward.","The retail business we believe we can grow faster both driven by the e-commerce business where we had high teens growth in the current quarter and we think that the e-commerce business is going to continue to grow at an accelerated rate, which is why we are investing behind the e-commerce business and then when you go to the brick and mortar retail business, I think that \u2013 we think that the brick and mortar retail business, we had strong performance internationally and a little bit of a slowdown and performance in U.S. that was below our expectations primarily driven by traffic trends. We saw traffic trends in the quarter at the factory outlet channel that were down mid-single digits and that\u2019s what really affected us relative to the expectations we had going into the quarter.","Jacki Nemerov","I think also that in the U.S., the third quarters interesting because what we saw was that we continued to take market share in the quarter even across all of our categories on that we blend and represent, that was \u2013 I think unique as certainly the backdrop of the quarter was more challenging around.","James Hurley","Next question?","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Kate McShane with Citigroup.","Kate McShane","Thank you, good morning. Chris, I just wondered if you could walk us through the revenue guidance that you have for the remainder of fiscal year 15, which you\u2019re guiding to be up mid-single-digits in constant currency, which is up against your toughest comp and would be the stronger sales growth of the year. What are the drivers of that and what are you basing your confidence on that this can be achieved in Q4?","Chris Peterson","Yeah, so I think as we look at Q4, we think that we\u2019re planning the business prudently with a mid-single-digit constant dollar comp growth. We have good visibility in our wholesale business from a booking standpoint and we certainly expect the wholesale business in the fourth quarter to grow at a faster rate than what we saw in the third quarter and in the year-to-date period. From a retail standpoint, we are anticipating a bigger impact on retail primarily due to new store openings. So baked into our constant dollar comp guidance is not a big expectation for a constant dollar comp increase. It\u2019s more around the acceleration where we see in the wholesale business as well as the full impact of our retail store development activity and of course we\u2019re continuing to view the e-commerce is operating very successfully, which we have been doing.","James Hurley","Next question?","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","Thanks, good morning, Chris. For the fiscal \u201816 outlook, I just had a question on that, I think it was a $185 million operating profit drag. Number one, is that on a fully unhedged basis and have you hedged any of your inventory that would delay that flow through? Number two, is any of that $185 million occurring in the fourth quarter? Or is that just a fiscal \u201816 number? And then lastly, how much visibility do you have to lower costs from cotton and energy and other items, offsetting some of that operating profit drag? Thanks.","Chris Peterson","Yeah, okay. So we do hedge our inventory purchases, a portion of our inventory purchases and we typically hedge sort of six to nine months out. So we\u2019re not hedged for the full fiscal year next year and we\u2019re not hedged to the 100% rate. We typically hedge at sort of a 70% of our exposure rate. So there is a significant impact from currency in that guidance for next year that\u2019s inventory related, but there are also will be an additional flow through in the following year from the portion of inventory next year, where we do have a hedge on, if you think forward to fiscal \u201917. With regard to the fourth quarter, there certainly is a foreign exchange impact on the bottom-line and on the operating margin in the fourth quarter and in fact it\u2019s fairly significant.","And the reason for that is that when you think about the flow through that I talked about earlier, if the FX drag on the top-line is flowing through next year to a little bit over 40% rate. We\u2019re also seeing a similar type of impact in the fourth quarter and with the 550 basis point drag from foreign exchange on the top-line in the fourth quarter, that\u2019s creating an operating margin pressure in the fourth quarter, which is a big part of the reason for our guidance change on operating margin, not just for the fourth quarter, but also for the fiscal year \u2013 the current fiscal year.","And then on comp on raw material and oil cost, we have some visibility to that and so when we saw the drop in commodities and we saw the strength of the dollar and we saw the drop in oil prices. We immediately began working with the global manufacturing and supply chain teams, who have at this point gone over and met with the number of our manufactures in Asia and began the work on getting cost reduction. We don\u2019t have full visibility to the cost reduction that we\u2019re going to get, but we are certainly confident that we\u2019re going to get some cost reduction as part of this and that\u2019s part of the detailed work that we have and finalizing the budget ahead of us over the next couple of months. There is a timing lag in terms of when that flows through because typically the seasons that we\u2019re negotiating are six months out or so from the time that we began that negotiation process.","James Hurley","Next question?","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Christian Buss with Credit Suisse.","Christian Buss","I was wondering if you could talk a bit about retail performance and what your expectations are going forward for outlets versus full price stores.","Chris Peterson","Yeah, I think on the outlet business, we saw retail comps up in the international outlet business and so we\u2019re seeing sort of a tale of two different environments. In the international business, the outlet business continue to \u2013 we are able to continue to drive comp store sales gains and we\u2019re not seeing the traffic declines in the international outlet centers that we are in the U.S. and the U.S. I think the traffic declines that we\u2019re seeing to the center are putting more pressure on that business. It\u2019s still a large business and still a very profitable business for us, but we believe that with the growth of the e-commerce business which is become particularly large in the U.S. that\u2019s starting to cannibalize a little bit into that channel, also as some of the brick and mortar stores that are closer in to the urban areas have gotten more competitive on pricing it\u2019s reduced the consumer desire to drive to get to the outlet center.","And so we\u2019re factoring that into our plans as we go forward because we expect that trend, although you can never predict but we certainly think the consumers going to continue to shop more and more on online and as that happens we think that\u2019s going to continue to put pressure on brick and mortar.","James Hurley","Next question?","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Evren Kopelman with Wells Fargo.","Evren Kopelman","Thank you. Good morning. Can you give a little bit more color around your comments about the promotional environment in the U.S. maybe more by channel what you saw at department stores versus the outlet channel, where you saw the biggest pressure and what do you expect going forward?","Chris Peterson","Yeah, so I think what we saw was that as we enter \u2013 I think Jacki sort of talked about this in the prepared remarks. But as we enter the holiday season, we got off to a pretty strong start over the Thanksgiving period, the week before Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, and then we saw a little bit of a drop in sort of the consumer purchase behavior and that period between the Thanksgiving \u2013 the end of the Thanksgiving shopping period and the first couple of weeks of December. And as a result of that what we saw was that a lot of the competitors ratcheted up the promotional intensity in terms of trying to deal with the inventory that they had on the floor and so reacted to that not to ensure that we stayed competitive during the period and I think that\u2019s what we were alluding to in our commentary. And again, that was really a U.S. phenomenon, not so much international.","James Hurley","Next question?","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Joan Payson with Barclays.","Joan Payson","Hi, good morning. Could you talk a little bit about the Polo women\u2019s business, how that\u2019s performing in retail stores compared to a point of sale at wholesale and also how it\u2019s doing internationally compared to domestically.","Jacki Nemerov","Yes, the Polo women\u2019s business is off to a nice start. As you know, we started that business just this past fall. And we\u2019re seeing a strong response from that younger customer and on an overall basis we are seeing a nice reaction in the department stores. We\u2019re seeing a nice reaction in our retail stores and from an international basis, also a very strong reaction in the international markets in Europe and in Asia. I think that as any new brand is launched, there are opportunities to continue to build and perfect and as we are now receiving next season\u2019s merchandise and so forth, we\u2019re continuing to see those changes and an improvement consistently in the momentum of the brand. We really believe that it\u2019s unique and addresses a new audience and so I would say that we are pleased so far with the results, but more to do and more to build and develop.","James Hurley","Next question?","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Barbara Wyckoff with CLSA.","Barbara Wyckoff","Hi everyone, following on Joan\u2019s question, talk about, please, the performance of Lauren in U.S. department stores this year versus last year and how do you see it going forward?","Jacki Nemerov","Our overall performance in the Lauren brand all of its categories which are obviously \u2013 we have a sportswear business and important dress business, footwear business and accessory business, multiple licensed businesses and the brand has been growing steadily over as you know many years. I think that we see opportunity in certain aspects of the business, certain businesses are on huge acceleration and other businesses have slowed slightly and we continue to work on a daily basis to be able to address that. The dress business is on fire. Lauren represents the number one dress brand in almost every department store. We\u2019ve had a phenomenal footwear season with accelerated growth in footwear. Our bag business is also building nicely and we had an excellent season in bags. Our sleepwear business, a lot of \u2013 our coat business also was spectacular for the season. So I think that it moves on a category by category basis, but overall strong growth in the brand.","James Hurley","Next question?","Operator","Thank you. The final question comes from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray.","Erinn Murphy","Great, thank you, good morning. Just on the gross margin side, could you just help us aggregate that 120 basis point decline during the quarter? What was tied to the promotional environment versus FX versus mix shift and then, did you guys have to air freight more to work around the port issue. And then just in context with the gross margins, as we think about your guidance for 2016, you talked about constant currency gross margin being up. Just speak to the drivers there. Thank you.","Chris Peterson","Yeah, so on the quarter on gross margin, really there were three things that impacted the 120 balance sheet. Certainly, currency had a significant impact as we mentioned the promotional U.S. marketplace and then we had a mix impact as well, and part of that was due to the cadence of our wholesale shipments. The cadence of our wholesale shipments in the quarter, we round up shipping more women\u2019s product in the third quarter than we did men\u2019s product in the third quarter from a growth rate standpoint and the men\u2019s business operates at a significantly higher gross margin for us than the women\u2019s business. And so we saw a mixed impact that was due to the men\u2019s versus women\u2019s growth mix.","If you look at those three aspects, I would say that the three aspects were relatively equal in nature. There was not one that was overwhelming relative to the other aspects on gross margin during the quarter. We did have to air freight more product during the quarter. We also round up routing a lot of product via all-water routing. So we shipped it around the U.S. and received it in the East Coast ports. And what that did is Jacki eluded to was that allowed us to avoid some of the issues in the West Coast port situation, but it takes more time to ship it to the East Coast. So we then had to accelerate once the product was unloaded in the East Coast, receipt into our Greensboro distribution center and staffing our Greensboro distribution center to turn that inventory around faster. So we did see an impact from the West Coast port strike. But I would say that impact was relatively minor because of the strong management of our supply chain teams.","And with regard to next year, on an underlying basis, we do believe gross margins going to be up as we gone through the initial stages of the budget process and I think there is a couple of reasons for that. One, as we expect the retail segment to grow faster than wholesale and of course our retail segment has higher gross margins than wholesale. Two, we expect the accessories business to grow at a faster rate than the balance of the business and that also tends to be a gross margin sweetener. And then third, at least in constant currency, the international business is projected to grow at a faster rate and of course we have higher gross margins in the international business than we do in the U.S. and so when you look at those three elements, I think all of that is driving us to underlying gross margin that\u2019s improving in next year\u2019s forecast versus this year.","James Hurley","Thank you very much for attending and as always, we\u2019ll be available for follow-up calls.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.

Please go ahead.","Evren Kopelman","Good morning and thank you for joining Ralph Lauren\u2019s fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2017 conference call. With me today is Jane Nielsen, Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions, which we ask that you limit to one per caller. ","During today\u2019s call, we will be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including our financial outlook. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees, and our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.

I\u2019m looking forward to reviewing our progress for the year in detail, but let me start with one of the most important developments, which I\u2019m sure you all saw yesterday. We have appointed a new President and Chief Executive Officer, Patrice Louvet. ","Patrice is a highly seasoned and successful business leader. He most recently served as the Group President of Global Beauty at Procter & Gamble and has a strong track record of leading global businesses during this 25 year-plus career at P&G. He has a deep understanding of consumers and brands, a collaborative leadership style, and a passion to win in the marketplace. The team is ready to welcome him when he joins in July, and I am looking forward to partnering with him.","Now let me turn to a review of our performance and future outlook. 2017 was an important year as we strengthened the foundation of the company. We created operational efficiencies by improving our cost structure, increased the productivity of our assortment, and improved quality of sales. Let me take you through some of the key achievements for the year, starting with product.","We improved the productivity and profitability level of our assortment by cutting the unproductive styles. For both spring and fall 2017, we reduced the number of SKUs by 20% and focused our investments on our core iconic products. Second, we reduced our lead times. Fifty percent of our business is now on a nine-month lead time, and we are on track to get to 90% by the end of fiscal 2018. Importantly, we are driving improvements beyond the nine-month mark. For spring 2018, approximately 35% of our business will be at lead times of six months or less. Third, we have aligned inventory to demand. Inventory is 30% below prior year with improved turn. This has been achieved through both restructuring actions and a more effective buying process. In addition, since the start of our aggressive inventory management initiatives in Q2 \u201917, we reduced our warehouse space by 13% with continued reductions planned for the first half of FY18. Fourth, our distribution is healthier. We closed 50 underperforming doors in our retail fleet and we are well on track to close 20 to 25% of our U.S. wholesale points of distribution by the second half of FY18. Fifth, our expense structure is more efficient. We reduced SG&A by $240 million in fiscal 2017. Our organization has reduced management layers from nine to six, with a 20% reduction in the executive population over the last two years. Additionally, we consolidated regional operations under a single international group to streamline costs and processes. This group will be led by Howard Smith, who recently served as President of the Asia-Pacific region. Howard has a track record of elevating the brand, driving sales growth, and improving operations during his 15-year career at Ralph Lauren. Lastly, we have recently added two key senior hires - Jonathan Bottomley, Chief Marketing Officer, who joins us from Vice Media, and Tom Mendenhall, Brand President for Menswear, who joins us from Tom Ford International. Jonathan will report to Patrice, our new CEO, and Tom reports to Val\u00e9rie Hermann, our President of Global Brands.","Now I\u2019ll turn to a quick review of our fourth quarter financials. This quarter, we continued to deliver against our strategy and commitment. As you saw in our press release, revenues declined 16%, in line with guidance. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and on a 13-week to 13-week basis, revenues were down 12% to last year. Adjusted operating margin was 6.5%, 10 basis points above last year and in line with our guidance of 6% to 6.5%. Adjusted operating margin was up 150 basis points excluding the impact of the 53rd week and foreign currency. Adjusted gross margin increased 90 basis points driven by improved quality of sales, reduced promotional activity, lower product cost, and favorable geographic and channel mix. This was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency effects of approximately 90 basis points. ","This quarter operating expenses, excluding restructuring and other charges, were down 12% to last year on a like-for-like basis. Expense initiatives drove the decrease. These included streamlining the organization to reduce headcount, changing product development processes to reduce costs, and closing unprofitable stores to improve the profitability of our fleet. ","The tax rate for the fourth quarter was 27% on an adjusted basis, lower than our guidance for 30%. This was due to a geographic shift in expense mix driven by changes in our ecommerce platform development.","Moving onto a review by geography, as we highlighted in our earnings release this morning, we are changing our reportable segments from wholesale, retail and licensing to North America, Europe and Asia, driven by significant organizational and operational changes we\u2019ve implemented over the past 12 months. We will provide segment information under the new reportable segments for the past eight quarters in an 8-K that will be filed later today. We will also continue to give visibility to wholesale and retail sales trends going forward. All our comments today will be consistent with the change in our reportable segments.","In North America, revenue was down 21% in the fourth quarter as we executed important quality sales initiatives as a part of our work to come back to high performance. Operating margin was down 200 basis points. In North America wholesale, we continued to strengthen our foundation by strategically reducing shipments to better align with underlying demand and to reduce inventory levels at our wholesale partners, all targeted to improve full price selling. We continued to reduce our sales in the off-price channel as we look to scale back this channel across our geographies. ","These deliberate actions - pulling back on excess inventories, lowering sales to the off-price channel, executing door closures and exiting brands, coupled with challenging trends, resulted in wholesale revenue down 23% in the quarter. In our directly operated ecommerce business in North America, we took further actions to harmonize pricing and reduce promotions. Comps were down 20% in the fourth quarter, reflecting lower inventory units, reduced SKU count, and fewer promotional periods. While these initiatives created significant pressure on ecommerce revenue, they drove healthy gross margin expansion and importantly created greater price coherence in the region. ","These are important first steps; however, more work remains through fiscal 2018 as we aggressively address our high level of promotion in this channel. This is an important component of a multifaceted program to both ensure promotional consistency across our channels and to enhance the overall brand and shopping experience in our most important door.","Moving on to Europe, revenue was down 3% in constant currency in the fourth quarter primarily due to the 53rd week impact and calendar shifts that negatively impacted retail comps. Operating margin in Europe improved approximately 500 basis points in constant currency, excluding restructuring charges.","In Asia, revenue was down 11% in constant currency in the fourth quarter primarily due to the 53rd week impact and store closures. Operating margin in Asia improved approximately 800 basis points versus prior year in constant currency, excluding restructuring charges. This was driven by an improved gross margin through lower discount rates and expense reduction initiatives.","Across our international groups, we have focused throughout the year on improving quality of distribution and quality of sales. The majority of this work is behind us and we have a solid foundation in our international markets. We are also laying important groundwork for growth, including building on our relationships with digital pure play partners like Zozotown in Japan, and Zalando, Asos and mytheresa in Europe. In the fourth quarter, we successfully launched an exclusive collection with Zalando with a dedicated marketing campaign and we\u2019ve seen strong sell-through so far. In Asia, we launched with Shinsegae and Hyundai Online in the fourth quarter. ","Moving on to comparable store sales, in constant currency and on a like-for-like basis, comps were down 11%. Excluding calendar shifts related to both Christmas and Easter holidays, the underlying comp trend was down 8% in the fourth quarter, similar to the underlying trend of down 7% in the third quarter. Global ecommerce comps declined 16% in constant currency in the fourth quarter, impacted by the previously mentioned initiatives in North America. As these actions continue through fiscal \u201918, we are forecasting mid-teens decline in global ecommerce comps with lower discount rates and higher gross margins. ","As you saw in our announcement last month, we are moving to a more flexible platform for our directly operated ecommerce business through a new collaboration with Salesforce Commerce Cloud. This new solution will deliver a more brand enhancing and consistent experience for our consumers with a lower total operating cost than the platform we were internally developing. ","In concert with our actions in our directly operated ecommerce business, we continue to evolve our digital strategy to move with the consumer and drive growth through our online partners. Last year, global sales of our product across both our pure play and department store customers\u2019 websites were approximately $500 million at retail, comparable to the sales volume of our directly operated ecommerce business. We expect continued growth with our digital partners in FY18.","Turning to our store fleet, we achieved our goal and closed 54 underperforming doors in fiscal 2017, ending the year with 466 standalone stores and 619 concessions on a global basis. For fiscal 2018, we plan to open approximately five net new stores and 35 net new concessions driven by growth in Asia. ","Moving onto the balance sheet, our progress with our plan is reflected in our inventory position. At the end of the fourth quarter, inventory declined 30% to $792 million versus last year. This inventory reduction is driven by both restructuring actions and an improvement in our operating processes, including a proactive pull-back in receipts and moving toward a demand-driven supply chain. We ended the fourth quarter with approximately $1.4 billion in cash and short-term investments, up from $1.1 billion at the end of last year. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $588 million, down from $713 million last year. ","Capital expenditures for fiscal \u201917 were $284 million compared with $418 million in the prior year period. This was lower than guidance of $325 million primarily due to a shift in several retail projects into FY18 and an increased focus on return on investment. The year-over-year reduction is driven by lower IT and infrastructure investment.","Regarding share repurchases in the fourth quarter, we repurchased $100 million of our stock, bringing full year \u201917 repurchases to $200 million, consistent with our communication in June. ","Now let me review our restructuring activities. We are on track with our total savings targets from the initiatives we announced last June related to the Way Forward plan. In addition, we recently announced a new restructuring plan with estimated charges of $370 million throughout fiscal \u201918 and associated savings of approximately $140 million. We\u2019ve made good progress on these actions and are on track to deliver those savings by the end of fiscal \u201919. In the fourth quarter, we recognized $216 million of charges from this new plan. Total charges for the quarter were $370 million, of which about $120 million was cash.","Now I\u2019d like to turn to guidance for fiscal \u201918. As a reminder, this guidance excludes restructuring and other charges. Our work to strengthen the foundation of the business will continue in fiscal 2018 as we set the stage to bring demand back to the business. We expect revenue to decline 8% to 9% for the year excluding the impact of foreign currency. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is expected to have approximately 150 basis points of negative impact on revenue growth in fiscal 2018.","Brand and distribution exits in both wholesale and retail account for approximately half the decline, with quality of sales initiatives and challenging traffic trends representing the remainder. We expect the sales trend to improve as we move through the year.","We expect operating margin for fiscal 2018 to be 9% to 10.5%, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is expected to pressure operating margin for fiscal 2018 by 50 to 75 basis points. ","Clearly there are many variables in play as we enter FY18. This guidance is grounded in that reality and reflects our decision to accelerate quality of sales initiatives while providing some flexibility to roll out products, marketing, and store concepts that demonstrate high potential for growth and returns. We believe this is the right decision for the long term as we balance near-term margin pressure with setting up the company to return to growth.","For the first quarter, we expect revenues to be down low double digits, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Based on currency exchange rates, foreign currency is expected to pressure revenue growth by about 225 basis points in the first quarter. Operating margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 is expected to be about 9.5% to 10%, excluding currency impacts. Foreign currency is expected to pressure operating margin by about 75 basis points.","Regarding tax rates, as noted in our press release this morning, we are adopting the new accounting standard ASU 2016-09 for the accounting of employee share-based payments. This will affect our effective tax rate and increase its variability, with one of the key variables being the price of our stock. Based on a stock price of $75 per share, the adoption of this standard is expected to raise the fiscal 2018 tax rate to approximately 28% and the first quarter rate to 33%. Without this impact, the effective tax rate would be approximately 25% for the year. This impact is most significant in the first and second quarters due to the timing of vesting and exercise of certain stock compensation. ","Let me now review our priorities for cash and capital structure. We are committed to maintaining our strong balance sheet and investment-grade credit rating to provide strategic flexibility, liquidity and access to capital markets. Within that context, our first priority for cash is to invest in our business and to lay the foundation for future profitable growth. Our second priority is to return capital to shareholders with a commitment to maintaining our dividend. Excess cash flow beyond current and future investment and dividend needs will be considered for future potential share repurchases. Currently we are planning no share repurchases in fiscal 2018 as we evaluate the cash needs of our business, sector dynamics, and the uncertain environment around U.S. tax reform. ","We expect capital expenditures for fiscal \u201918 to be $300 million to $320 million, driven by new store openings, renovation of our retail environments, and infrastructure investments. ","In closing, we are moving in the right direction. We are creating a strong foundation to evolve this iconic brand and our business in a challenging environment. We remain intensely focused on our execution as we build a pathway to sustainable growth. Ralph, the board and I are thrilled to welcome Patrice to the company, where he joins a passionate, committed team of over 23,000 Ralph Lauren employees around the globe.","With that, let\u2019s open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","The first question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. ","Omar Saad","Morning, thanks for taking my question. ","Jane Nielsen","Sure, good morning, Omar.","Omar Saad","Hi Jane. Wanted to see if you guys could talk a little bit more about Patrice\u2019s hiring and the thought process behind it, and maybe dive into a little bit more detail around why he\u2019s the right person for the job. Thanks.","Jane Nielsen","Sure. Well you know, as you saw in the announcement yesterday, Patrice has a proven track record of leading major global consumer brands, and he\u2019s really an operator who has had a career that\u2019s focused on efficiency and effectiveness in the organization\u2019s he\u2019s run. He has transformed and grown brands like Olay and Pantene with a real focus on leveraging consumer insights. He\u2019s a global citizen and has diverse experience across distribution channels, from ecommerce to wholesalers to retail, so he really has had a breadth of experience.","Probably most importantly, he really has a collaborative leadership style, who can work in partnership with Ralph and the senior team to ensure that we can move forward on the front-facing part of our plan to get demand back to our business, so we\u2019re all excited to welcome him. ","I think Patrice knows well and appreciates the steps that we\u2019ve taken over the last year as a part of the plan to improve our business, and he\u2019s fully supportive in continuing that work to create an effective business, to continue to focus on our value creating engines and to pivot to the consumer-facing side of our business in partnership with Ralph.","Evren Kopelman","Great. Next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Kate McShane with Citi Research.","Corinna Van Der Ghinst","Hi, good morning. It\u2019s actually Corinna Van Der Ghinst on for Kate. Hi Jane. I was just hoping you could talk a little bit more about the quality of sales initiatives that you guys have talked about in the past. I know you\u2019ve discussed moving away from a more promotional model. I was just wondering how you see kind of the gross margin expectations for the year and also qualitatively where have some of your bigger challenges been in getting back to that kind of fuller price selling model.","Jane Nielsen","Sure. So as I step back and look at FY17, I think one of the things that we are very proud of is the work that we\u2019ve done on quality of sales. It\u2019s shown up in our gross margin every quarter and it\u2019s shown up in our results in FY17. Just looking at this quarter, about half of our sales--I\u2019m sorry, about half of our gross margin improvement was a result of reduced promotions and better sell through on higher margin product. The other half was balanced between favorable geographic and channel mix and better product costs.","As we look at our efforts in quality of sales, we\u2019ve been very effective particularly in the second half of the year of really pulling back thoughtfully in partnership with our wholesale partners on receipts to ensure that our plan and our receipt flow was designed to flow in and reflect higher margin sell through. So we purposely planned, pulled back, looked at the percentage of our business that was selling at a discount that we viewed as too heavy, pulled back on those receipts so that we could move in in wholesale into higher margin sell through. That\u2019s starting to happen. It had to be done planfully because of the long lead times on inventory, but you\u2019re starting to see that.","Equally, ecommerce, the fourth quarter I think shows our lean into quality of sales in ecommerce. We worked through the inventory that we had ordered almost a year ago, but we really pulled back on promotion frequency and promotion depth on some key icon styles, notably in our women\u2019s and children\u2019s business. You\u2019re going to see that continue as we move forward. We\u2019ve planned our receipts to move into higher margin sell through and to move forward on a reduced promotional cadence.","So what we\u2019re starting to see is real harmony across the market, notably in North America, and a real planful pull-back that continues quality of sale.","Evren Kopelman","Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs.","Rosalie Frazier","Hi, this is Rosalie Frazier on behalf of Lindsay Drucker Mann. We had a question on FX impact to margins. As a follow-up on that, are you taking any pricing to offset FX headwinds?","Jane Nielsen","So as we look at FX headwinds, most of our--we think about pricing specifically in-market. Most of our customers internationally are local customers, so we move into currency headwinds by taking pricing largely on innovation and new styles, so we will address some of those headwinds, largely on innovation, and moving into pricing on innovation and on new styles. So it\u2019s not--we don\u2019t move pricing with FX, we do step back in the marketplace in which we operate, we look at the value of our product, we look at the competition in the marketplace, and then we look at some of the macro factors and price accordingly.","Evren Kopelman","Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray.","Erinn Murphy","Great, thanks. Good morning. ","Jane Nielsen","Morning Erinn.","Erinn Murphy","Good morning. You talked about sales guidance throughout the year showing some steady improvement. Can you just speak a little bit more about what you see are the drives of that improvement in the back half of your fiscal year, and then just clarifying, Jane, I think you also said in the guide half of the sales declines are from brand and distribution exits. Can you just refresh the thoughts on what percentage was denim and supply off-price pull-back versus wholesale pull-back? Thanks.","Jane Nielsen","Sure. Let me just--let me step back from the components of your question. As we move through the year, I expect sequential improvement in both our wholesale business as we start to overlap some of the quality of sales initiatives that we started and move into full price selling, so I expect that to improve pretty much sequentially through the year. I do expect the fourth quarter in our businesses, and largely in North America, to be better as we\u2019ll benefit from Easter in the fourth quarter of FY18, and equally expect our retail comps and overall sales to move to be sequentially better as we move through the year.","As I mentioned, most of our work in international, we\u2019ve gone through the majority of our work, and I expect international overall to move to--to be moving into positive sales growth territory as we move through to the back of the year. Ecommerce, where we really did the bulk of our work in the fourth quarter and we have a significant amount of quality of sales work left to do in FY18, will be a pressure point as we move through the year.","Then just in terms of the comment on denim and supply, we are exiting denim and supply through all four quarters of the year, as we announced. Denim and supply, we did execute spring shipments in FY17, so that pressure will be through the four quarters of the year, and it is about 200 basis points of pressure overall for FY18.","Evren Kopelman","Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Laurent Vasilescu with Macquarie. ","Laurent Vasilescu","Good morning, and thank you very much for taking my question. I wanted to follow up on the wholesale channel. Jane, last quarter you provided some very helpful metrics to quantify the decline in wholesale revenues, particularly around the Way Forward plan and the reductions in the value channel. Can you provide those metrics for the fourth quarter 15% decline, and then secondly with the new reporting structure, how should we think about the changes year-over-year for North America, Europe and Asia revenues in FY18?","Jane Nielsen","Laurent, could you repeat the second part of your question about Europe and Asia?","Laurent Vasilescu","Sure, yes. With the new reporting structure, how should we think about those changes year-over-year in revenues for North America, Europe and Asia in FY18?","Jane Nielsen","Sure, got it. Thank you. So in terms of our overall wholesale business, what we saw as we moved into the fourth quarter is we continued with about a 20% pull-back in the sales of our off-price channel, and as I mentioned, that is work that we\u2019ll continue to do and will continue throughout FY18. Our objective is to reduce the percentage of sales that off-price wholesale represents to our total wholesale business. ","Then as I think about the new--as we think about the new reporting segments, Europe and Asia as we move through FY18, Asia in particular should have--will be moving through store closures in the first half, but moving into growth in the second half, and about a similar shape for Europe with more pressure in the first half but moving into growth year-over-year in sales in the second half.","Evren Kopelman","Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Mr. Brian Tunick with RBC. ","Brian Tunick","Thanks very much, good morning. ","Jane Nielsen","Morning Brian.","Brian Tunick","Morning Jane. Curious on how we should be measuring inventory as we move through the year, particularly in the wholesale channel. Maybe just give us some idea of the metrics we should expect. Obviously inventory is down sharply right now, but how should we be thinking about that the next couple of quarters, and then any update on the number of remodels of shop-in-shops planned for this year inside your wholesale partners? Thanks very much.","Jane Nielsen","Certainly. So as you think about inventory as we move through the year, we are continuing our work on overall inventory and you will see inventory in the first half declining about--you know, in the 20% range. As we pivot into inventory orders that are more oriented to FY19 demand, you\u2019ll see inventory down in the low double digits in Q3 and then starting to align with overall sales in Q4. So again, inventory first half in the 20% range, second half should average out to down in the high single digit range. ","Then in terms of overall shop-in-shop remodels, we\u2019re still working through the plan on remodels. You will see us targeting some high profile, high traffic doors in wholesale for overall remodels, and then in Asia you will see us doing some--and Europe, you will see us doing some of the corner refreshes in our wholesale business.","Evren Kopelman","Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti","Hey guys, good morning and thanks for taking my questions; and Jane, thanks for all the detail this morning, very helpful. Just two quick ones, and I apologize if I might have missed it, but the guidance for first quarter, I\u2019m just trying to--it seems like you gave a pretty clear picture on the revenues, but it seems like the implied guidance is for the gross margins to be up pretty significantly, and I know there\u2019s some noise from adjustments in the prior year. If you wouldn\u2019t mind helping us just fine tune approximately where you think the gross margin versus the SG&A lands in your guidance; and apologize again if I did miss that.","Then secondly, you\u2019ve spoken a little bit about the off-price channel and continuing to pull back on it, but as you kind of just step back and, say, there aren\u2019t many clear channels of transaction growth in the U.S. right now, one of them is obviously the Amazons of the world and maybe the e-tailers, but also off-price is going to continue to be building stores here. I mean, you\u2019ve given us a lot of detail about how you\u2019re pulling back on it because you were over what would be an equilibrium point, but how are you thinking, I guess strategically, about what the right amount of product is to have in that channel going forward versus having too little exposure there to growth that a lot of consumers consider to be a primary channel of retail? I guess that would be my questions, thanks.","Jane Nielsen","Yes, let me answer the last part of your question first, and then I\u2019ll give you some clarity on Q1. We do view value wholesale as a channel that is--that serves a segment of consumers, that they\u2019re excited about the treasure hunt aspect of that channel, and we recognize that. We haven\u2019t said we\u2019re exiting that channel but we are rebalancing it, and we\u2019re rebalancing it both in terms of the amount of product that we sell through that channel and the types of product that we sell through that channel, so you will see it decline as a percentage of our total wholesale business throughout FY18. Then moving forward, you\u2019ll see a slightly different mix of product but you\u2019ll still see us serving that consumer base, but on a less penetrated basis. ","Then your question in terms of overall gross profit, we do expect margin expansion, gross margin expansion in FY18 in the first quarter. We haven\u2019t given specific guidance, but I would expect that the overall margin expansion should be about similar to what you saw as we exited the fourth quarter, similar to slightly better.","Evren Kopelman","Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Matthew Boss from JP Morgan.","Matthew Boss","Great. So you\u2019re 9% to 10.5% EBIT margin guidance implies contraction at the midpoint, versus I think in the past you talked about constant currency expansion in the forecast. I guess any changes you\u2019re seeing in the apparel backdrop larger picture, and could you just lay out the variables that drive that 150 basis point range just between the top and the bottom of that EBIT margin guide for this year?","Jane Nielsen","Absolutely. So as we look--you know, as we look into FY18, there are a lot of factors in play next year. Clearly we\u2019ve got a rapidly changing consumer environment and we have some significant change internally, so we\u2019ve chosen, number one, to continue to work on building the foundation and right-sizing our business to a healthier base, notably in ecommerce. We need to have a coherent price strategy across the region. We can\u2019t be leading pricing down, and so we are leaning into that price coherency in our ecommerce business, notably in North America.","With that said, we still have a consumer-facing strategy. This is still evolving, and we\u2019ve left ourselves some flexibility to roll out product, marketing and store concepts notably in the second half, which would imply a wider range of guidance on overall SG&A growth, notably in the second half. Also in the second half, we begin to lap some of the aggressive SG&A cuts that we took in FY17, and that\u2019s part of that variability as you look through the year.","So I\u2019d say we\u2019ve got-overall we are leaning in to some of the pull-back in ecommerce. That\u2019s causing some sales volatility relative to our previous guidance, and we are leaving ourselves the flexibility on the SG&A line to plant important investment seeds for growth. Those are the two areas that give us a guidance range for FY18.","Evren Kopelman","Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo.","Ike Boruchow","Hi, good morning. Jane, thanks for the detail. ","Jane Nielsen","Morning Ike.","Ike Boruchow","Just real quick, so the $370 million in charges, just curious how much of that is cash, and then embedded in your fiscal year top line guide, can you just give us a little bit more color in terms of what\u2019s embedded on comp - I\u2019m sorry if I missed it, and then within that, your digital expectation as well as the store comp expectation. Thank you.","Jane Nielsen","Sure, okay. So why don\u2019t I start with our expectations in terms of guidance. We expect mid to high single digit global retail sales and comp decline. We expect wholesale to decline in the mid teens globally, and we expect ecomm comps to decline in the mid teens globally.","Evren Kopelman","Cash?","Jane Nielsen","Oh sorry, yes. In restructuring, of the $370 million of Q4 restructuring charges, approximately $120 million was cash.","Evren Kopelman","Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Jay Sole with Morgan Stanley.","Jay Sole","Great, thank you. Jane, you talked about why Patrice is the right person for the job. Can you just talk about how the decision making process will take place as a company going forward between Mr. Lauren, Patrice and yourself?","Jane Nielsen","Sure. So first of all, I\u2019d step back and say that we have a very capable and seasoned senior team, so it\u2019s not just Ralph, Patrice and I, it\u2019s an operating committee of seasoned executives that we all play a role from the regions to the functions, and we have operating committee meetings weekly where we address the performance of the business and develop strategy. We also work in--Patrice will work closely, as will the operating team, in concert with Ralph as we put in place the strategy for the consumer-facing part of our transformation, and that would be specific to marketing, to products, and to store design.","Evren Kopelman","Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from John Kernan with Cowen and Company.","John Kernan","Good morning Jane, Evren. Thanks for taking my questions. Jane, you talked a lot about efforts with some of the pure plays internationally - Zalando, Asos. Just wondering what your strategy is with Amazon? The brand\u2019s distributed fairly heavily through third party distributors right now on Amazon, just wondering if there\u2019s an opportunity to take it more direct. Then my follow-up question is there\u2019s obviously a lot of pressure on all the global apparel brands from a margin perspective. I\u2019m just wondering if you\u2019re still comfortable with the long term mid teens operating margin target for the company. Thank you.","Jane Nielsen","Yes, let me start with the last part of your question. Clearly improving operating margin and getting to a mid teens operating margin is still our goal, and we are working tirelessly on that Given the change that we have in the environment and the changes that are occurring internally, the big question for us is timing. I think it\u2019s the question for everyone. But certainly getting back to higher operating margin and doing that as quickly as possible is Patrice\u2019s goal, it\u2019s my goal, and it\u2019s the goal of the company, so we\u2019ll give you more visibility and timing as we move through and as we look through these initiatives and see their performance.","Then the first part of your question in terms of Amazon and other pure players, this is a dynamic marketplace. The consumer is changing, the digital ecosystem is changing, and as you\u2019ve seen with our efforts that have been very successful on sites like Zalando, we\u2019re looking at all opportunities and that will be a big part of what Patrice will do when he comes in, in concert with the senior team. So we\u2019re open, we\u2019re looking, but these are big strategic issues and we\u2019ll want to do them in partnership with our new chief executive officer.","So with that, I want to thank you for joining our call today. I look forward to speaking with many of you later on today and throughout this quarter, and I especially look forward to talking with you next quarter when Patrice will join me on this call. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"17557":["Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL) Q1 2014 Earnings Call August  7, 2013  9:00 AM ET","Executives","James Hurley - Director of Investor Relations","Roger N.

Welcome to the Ralph Lauren First Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. James Hurley. Please go ahead.","James Hurley","Good morning, and thank you for joining us on Ralph Lauren's First Quarter Fiscal 2014 Conference Call. The agenda for this morning's call includes Roger Farah, our President and Chief Operating Officer, who will provide an overview of the quarter; Chris Peterson, our Chief Financial Officer will provide operational and financial perspective on the first quarter, in addition to reviewing our outlook for the balance of fiscal 2014; and Jacki Nemerov, our Executive Vice President, will provide merchandising highlights and comment on some broader strategic initiatives. After the company's prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions, which we ask that you limit to one per caller.","During today's call, we will be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including our financial outlook. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees, and our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Our expectations contain many risks and uncertainties. The principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from our current expectations are detailed in our SEC filings.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Roger.","Roger N. Farah","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. The first quarter results that we are reporting today continue to demonstrate the resilience of our diversified operating model. Despite an uneven global operating environment, we planned the business prudently and continued to make significant investments in our long-term growth objectives and in the infrastructure to support them. Ralph and I are proud of our team's accomplishments, especially since we made important progress on several of our key initiatives during the quarter. We expect our recent investments in new stores, e-commerce operations and international expansion to continue to accelerate sales and profit momentum in the second half of the year. And we are confident that the investments we are making today can support profitable, sustained growth for us over the long-term.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Chris, who will provide some operational and financial perspectives on the first quarter.","Christopher H. Peterson","Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. The first quarter sales and profits we're reporting today are slightly better than we expected, and I'd like to start with a recap of the financial results.","Consolidated sales grew 4% in the first quarter. Excluding the impacts of discontinued businesses and unfavorable foreign currency translations, revenues were 6% higher than the prior-year period. This was slightly better than the low single-digit growth we anticipated due to better-than-expected wholesale revenues in North America and Europe. The cold and late start to spring resulted in sales trends that were somewhat choppy throughout the period, with business strengthening when weather conditions were more seasonally appropriate. While traffic to brick-and-mortar stores was challenging, growth in e-commerce continued to be very strong for both our Retail and Wholesale segments.","Gross profit for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 increased 1% to $1 billion. Gross profit margin of 60.7% was 160 basis points below the prior-year period due to the integration of the Chaps men's sportswear operations and unfavorable foreign currency dynamics.","Operating expenses of $728 million in the first quarter were 4% greater than the prior-year period. The higher operating expenses primarily reflect overall business expansion, costs associated with newly transitioned operations and continued investment in the company's strategic growth initiatives and infrastructure, all of which was partially offset by disciplined operational management.","We also had a $16 million gain on the acquisition of the Chaps men's sportswear license. This onetime gain was included in the first quarter and full year outlook we provided in May and will mostly be amortized in subsequent quarters. Operating expense rate of 44% was 10 basis points above the first quarter of fiscal 2013.","Operating income of $276 million was 5% below the prior year due to higher operating expenses related to the timing of investments in the company's strategic growth objectives, the Chaps integration and negative FX impacts. Operating margin was 16.7%, 160 basis points below the first quarter of fiscal 2013. The operating margin results were better than the 200 to 250 basis point contraction we anticipated back in May due to stronger-than-expected productivity gains in certain areas of the organization.","Net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 was $181 million, 7% below the $193 million achieved in the comparable period of fiscal 2013. And net income per diluted share declined 4% to $1.94. EPS of $1.94 was better than we anticipated due to higher revenue and stronger profit flow-through, a testament to the operational excellence of our teams who are still contending with a relatively challenging global retail landscape during the quarter.","Moving on to segment level details. Wholesale sales grew 6% to $735 million in the first quarter, primarily a result of the contribution from the newly transitioned Chaps men's sportswear operations and continued growth in core North American merchandise categories, which continue to gain market share. Product-wise, Women's wear and accessories were the most important contributors to Wholesale revenue growth in the quarter. A planned reduction in shipments to certain European customers and the transition of certain Japanese wholesale distribution to directly operated concession shops partially mitigated wholesale revenue growth during the quarter. Wholesale operating income of $154 million was in line with the prior-year period, as improved profitability in North America was more than offset by lower international profits and Chaps transition costs.","Retail segment sales rose 3% to $879 million in the first quarter, reflecting the incremental contribution from new stores and strong growth for e-commerce operations. Excluding the impacts of discontinued businesses and foreign currency, Retail sales increased 6% from the prior year.","Consolidated comparable store sales declined 1% on a reported basis and were up 1% in constant currency during the first quarter, on top of relatively challenging multi-year comparisons. We estimate that the earlier timing of Easter this year negatively impacted our comp growth by approximately 2%.","With the exception of e-commerce, customer traffic trends were soft across most Retail formats during the quarter. However, strategic marketing efforts, along with the investments we've made in in-store technology and customer service, enabled us to mitigate lower traffic levels with improved conversion and UPTs at most of our retail formats worldwide. Comp store sales were stronger at directly owned Ralph Lauren factory and e-commerce operations and weaker at concession shops in Asia.","Retail operating income of $160 million was 11% below the prior-year period, as costs associated with the company's global store and e-commerce development efforts and foreign currency effects were only partially offset by disciplined operational management.","Licensing revenues of $39 million were 8% below the prior-year period as lower Chaps-related licensing revenues offset higher apparel and fragrance royalties for Ralph Lauren products. Licensing operating income of $29 million was in line with the prior-year period. Consolidated inventory was up 9% at the end of the quarter, largely due to the newly acquired Chaps business and new store openings. We spent approximately $66 million on capital expenditures to support new retail stores, shop installations and infrastructure investments. Free cash flow of $229 million in the first quarter was 11% greater than the prior-year period.","The company repurchased about 850,000 shares of its common stock during the first quarter for an average cost of approximately $176, utilizing $150 million of authorized share repurchase programs. At the end of the quarter, the company had $427 million available under previously authorized share repurchase programs for future buybacks, and we ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in cash and investments.","We made important progress on several initiatives during the first quarter. We completed the pilot conversion wave of SAP. This included global product procurement and North American Wholesale operations for a group of pilot brands and involves transferring millions of pieces of data, including inventory, purchase orders, sales orders and accounts receivable from legacy systems to SAP. The pilot implementation went very well with data conversion rates between 99% and 100%, and we are now fully on to SAP for the pilot brands. Based on the pilot's success, we are proceeding with the next wave of implementation later this quarter, which transitions a more meaningful portion of the company's brands and merchandise categories.","As we articulated last quarter, we are taking a staggered approach to systems conversion in order to proactively manage the risk profile of the project. Over time, we believe SAP will yield productivity improvements and procurement savings in addition to providing the company with a stronger platform for future growth.","The integration of the formally licensed Chaps men's sportswear operations has also gone smoothly. We worked on an accelerated basis over the last few months to take this business in-house since it is an important component of the overall Chaps brand. In a short period of time, we've successfully on-boarded about 50 new employees and established dedicated warehousing and distribution capabilities to support the business. We're now at a point where we are migrating from a costly transition services agreement to a wholly integrated and directly managed model.","At the beginning of July, we assumed direct control of Ralph Lauren operations in Australia and New Zealand from our former licensee. As a result of the license take-back, we've integrated approximately 300 new employees, 13 stores and 20 shop-in-shops across the 2 countries. Although we have already incurred some upfront costs associated with the transition, the full financial impact of managing Australia and New Zealand will be reflected in our results beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2014.","It's clearly been a productive start to the year. Before I review our outlook for the balance of 2014, I'd like to turn the call over to Jacki.","Jackwyn L. Nemerov","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results demonstrate that despite the formidable challenge of a cold and late start to spring around the world, we had a good spring-summer season and we're able to exceed our sales and profit plans for the quarter. The balance and diversity of our merchandise assortments, as well as the lifestyle positioning of our brand, which tends to emphasize a total sensibility over a single item, allowed us to offset softness in certain seasonal classifications such as knits and sandals, with strong performance in other categories such as dresses and denim. In addition to strong performance for the Ralph Lauren brand, the Chaps brand also had a fantastic quarter across a wide range of merchandise categories.","As Chris mentioned, the integration of the Chaps men's sportswear business into our organization went smoothly and is, in fact, one of the fastest transitions we've ever executed. Chaps is $1 billion brand at retail with representation in over 40 merchandise categories, and we're excited about the growth it represents for the future. With direct control of the largest and most strategically important merchandise categories, we believe that we can further enhance the clarity and consistency of the brand to drive even stronger productivity gains and achieve merchandising and marketing synergies with our customers.","The success of Chaps in North America over the last several years is a clear demonstration of the enduring value of trusted brands that deliver consistent quality and great value. In order to more fully leverage the power of this brand, we are building a plan to expand the distribution of Chaps around the world. I'm pleased to share with you that we have an agreement with a distribution partner in Mexico to launch Chaps in that market in both retail and wholesale locations next spring. This is the first step in an exciting new journey for Chaps, and we've received tremendous interest from other potential partners around the world, so there will be more to come on future calls.","Now I'd like to spend some time on exciting developments on 2 of our strategic initiatives. The first being the evolution of our omni-channel approach to servicing the customer, and the second being an update on some of our non-apparel merchandise categories. With regard to the omni-channel, you already know that developing our worldwide direct-to-consumer presence is one of the most important long-term strategic growth objectives. We've invested substantial amounts of capital and operating expense to build both retail stores and online shopping experiences that are unique to our brands and distinctive to the consumer.","During the quarter, we opened 2 high-profile Ralph Lauren retail locations in China, a spectacular 10,000 square-foot Men's flagship store in central Hong Kong, with an impactful 6-story facade and a 5,800 square-foot Men's and Women's store at L'Avenue in Shanghai, which is a new first-class retail and office complex. Both stores will showcase our luxury apparel and accessories in a powerful way.","China is one of the company's largest and most compelling long-term growth opportunities. And the foundation of our strategy is a retail expansion that will require significant investment in both stores and e-commerce capabilities in order for us to be properly positioned in the market.","As you know from our approach in the U.S. and Europe, our stores, both physical and virtual, are critical expressions of our brand, so the decisions we make in China are extremely important to the future of our luxury business.","Last quarter, we spoke briefly about retail strategy for our Polo brand that would allow us to more fully represent that aesthetic across men's, women's and children's merchandise. We believe that a dedicated retail expression for the full breadth of the Polo brand will allow us to better serve a diverse customer base. Our existing luxury retail stores offer a smaller assortment of Polo and only for men, and those locations attract a customer who's really drawn to our Black Label and Purple Label products.","The creation of dedicated Polo stores will provide the right environment in which to represent the sensibility of this powerful brand, with a full product line across not only men's, but also women's and children's. Given the broad appeal of the Polo brand, we believe that there's potential for these stores in many locations around the world.","We opened the first dedicated Polo store in East Hampton during the first quarter and it's off to a great start. As we embark on the first phase of a multi-year plan to leverage the tremendous global demand for our Polo brand, several more retail projects are planned around the world, including a 35,000 square foot flagship on Fifth Avenue in New York.","We are also excited about the continued global development of our Denim & Supply brand. We opened 2 Denim & Supply stores in the United States during the quarter, one on University Place in New York City and the other on Newbury Street in Boston. They joined a fleet of 15 other Denim & Supply retail stores, 8 in Europe and 7 Asia, and complement our worldwide wholesale distribution. Denim & Supply is a relatively new brand that resonates with the 20-something millennial audience. The product is fresh and distinctive, but grounded in the quality and the authenticity of Ralph Lauren. As far as the brand has come in its first 2 years, we believe there is considerable room for additional stores.","In another aspect of our plan to fortify our omni-channel approach, we're on track to launch e-commerce in South Korea later this fall, which will represent the 14th country in which we are e-commerce-enabled. We have invested in e-commerce-capable distribution centers in Italy, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Seoul to support additional ship-to markets throughout Europe and Asia. We will also be opening our greatly expanded distribution center supporting our North American e-commerce operations this fall. Over the last year, we've invested about $75 million in capital to build a facility that can support the doubling of that business.","Because we view our retail stores and e-commerce sites as not only important commercial ventures but also valuable branding vehicles for us, we believe it is imperative that both merchandising and marketing messages be aligned. To ensure this, we've invested in the technology and the distribution logistics capabilities that allow us to integrate and leverage the unique power of our product distribution, our inventory and our brand messages.","Today, a customer in one of our stores works with a well-trained sales associate who uses an iPad to easily and quickly offer additional options that he or she knows are available online but that the customer is not seeing right there in that particular store. That additional option could be as simple as a size or a color or it could be a style or a label not sold in that location. The combination of sales associates who are knowledgeable across the entire portfolio of our products and technology that enables easy access to a single pool of shared inventory is a winning formula. The customer's experience is richer and more dynamic, and our productivity and profit margins are stronger.","And of course, as technology and distribution capabilities have evolved, so, too, has the customer -- the consumer behavior, and we know that the customer explores, browses and shops our brand across these channels and that their expectation is one of alignment and seamlessness. We are very focused on servicing and delighting our customers wherever they choose to shop for Ralph Lauren.","To that end, the investment we're making in our customer intelligent platform is focused on realizing a holistic view of our customers, so we can service them in a brand-centric, channel-agnostic manner in real time. Our omni-channel thought process extends beyond our directly operated retail business. Over the past several years, we've architected and executed a highly successful application of this omni-channel view with our wholesale partners. And it's been an important driver of our growth and success together. As you're well aware, our largest wholesale partners are focused on integrating their physical stores with their e-commerce operations. We have partnered with them to support those endeavors with fully integrated merchandising and marketing strategies that reinforce our brand's leadership position, both within their stores and on their sites.","Now turning to our merchandise categories beyond apparel: handbags, footwear, watches, jewelry, eyewear and fragrance. I want to update you on our continued development and investment. You've heard us talk about handbags, small leather goods and footwear because they have been among our fastest-growing categories and represented approximately 8% of our consolidated sales in fiscal 2013. We are pleased with the credibility the Ralph Lauren brand has established in a relatively short period of time in the highest tier of the luxury leather goods market, and are also focused on building a strong platform for sustainable long-term success.","This fall, you will see a lot of activity around our most iconic handbags, the Ricky. Launching in the next few weeks is a complete world of Ricky story built around a greatly expanded range of handbags and small leather goods products inspired by this signature bag. A high-impact, multichannel global advertising, marketing and public relations program featuring the recently introduced Soft Ricky style will be impossible to miss. The introduction of the Soft Ricky has already been a great success worldwide, and we are building upon its appeal with this introduction of a broader range of sizes, colors and related items for the fall and holiday seasons.","Beyond luxury handbags, there's also momentum for other accessory categories. Building upon the worlds of Ricky platform in leather goods, we are leveraging some of our most iconic brand themes to develop new watches, eyewear and fragrances. This spring, we had a great success with 2 of our new watches, the Safari Chronometer and the Steel Link Stirrup. The high level of consumer interest in these new styles has increased exposure for our entire watch collection and had a beneficial impact on the business.","The Safari aesthetic was also the inspiration for our latest eyewear collection, where both optical and sun styles were introduced into the line and were well received by the consumer.","Ralph's passion for the design of fine automobiles was the inspiration for our newest men's fragrance, Polo Red. The fragrance and its messaging has been huge hits with consumers, and the early success of Polo Red will be supported this fall with substantial television and magazine advertising.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Chris.","Christopher H. Peterson","Thanks, Jacki. We are pleased to be starting fiscal 2014 with strong progress on several long-term objectives and sales and profits that are trending slightly better than planned. As you will recall, fiscal 2014 was planned with increased investments in the business to support long-term shareholder value creation. Key areas of investment this year include accelerated retail store and e-commerce development worldwide, the transition of formally licensed products and regions to directly controlled operations and upgrades to our management information systems to support our long-term growth objectives.","Based on the timing of our specific projects, we continue to expect fiscal 2014 to evolve as a tale of 2 halves, with the first part of the year characterized by lower sales growth and outsized investment spending related to the integrations of Chaps and Australia\/New Zealand and by preopening costs for new stores. We expect accelerated revenue and profit growth in the second half of the year, with the benefit of revenues from new store openings, the launch of our South Korean website, expanding the number of countries we can ship to from our European e-commerce operations and the transition of Australia\/New Zealand as a directly operated region.","As we articulated in May, the combined year-over-year impact of the incremental investments we are making in new stores and e-commerce platforms and in systems upgrades on our operating profits is approximately $75 million for the full year period. While this step-up in spending will weigh on our near-term operating profits, we continue to expect each of these investments to deliver a rate of return that is well in excess of our cost of capital.","For the full year fiscal 2014 period, we continue to expect consolidated revenues to increase by 4% to 7%, which includes 150 basis point negative impact from foreign currency effects and a roughly 100 basis point additional headwind from discontinued operations. Our full year fiscal 2014 operating margin is still expected to be 25 to 75 basis points below fiscal 2013's record level. The year-over-year contraction in the operating margin outlook is primarily due to the integration of newly assumed operations, accelerated investment in our various strategic growth initiatives and FX impacts.","Excluding the impacts of the incremental investment in the company's growth initiatives and foreign exchange, underlying operating income growth would be up low-double digits for the year. We continue to expect the fiscal 2014 tax rate to be 31%.","For the second quarter of fiscal 2014, we expect consolidated revenues to increase at a low single-digit rate, with Retail segment sales growing at a mid single-digit rate and relatively flat Wholesale revenues due to a shift in the timing of certain wholesale shipments out of the second quarter and into the third quarter due to the SAP implementation.","Foreign currency is estimated to negatively affect revenue growth by approximately 100 basis points in the second quarter and will continue to have more of an impact on our Retail segment given its geographic business mix. Discontinued businesses are estimated to mitigate second quarter sales growth by an additional 100 basis points. Operating margin for the second quarter is expected to be approximately 300 to 350 basis points below the prior-year period due to higher operating expenses related to the timing of investments to support the company's long-term strategic objectives, the integration of formerly licensed regions and product categories and the foreign exchange impact. The second quarter tax rate is estimated at 31.5%.","We've established aggressive goals for the year, laying critical groundwork for the future. Our global teams continue to demonstrate strong operational discipline as they not only manage the day-to-day, but also support the important progress we're making on key long-term initiatives, particularly our global omni-channel efforts and infrastructure upgrades.","With that, we'd like to open the call for your questions. Operator, can you assist us with that?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Omar Saad with ISI Group.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I'm hoping you guys can comment on looking at the top line overall for the company, it's been a little bit soft for the last couple of quarters and you obviously got all this great kind of global long-term growth opportunities. It seems like there was also a little bit of discrepancy, Wholesale top line versus Retail. What gives you confidence in the kind of this re-acceleration you're going to see in the back half? Are there certain elements either within the segmentation of different brands, regions, channels? Just kind of give us an update on your overall kind of view on this top line re-acceleration that's coming.","Roger N. Farah","Okay. So, Omar, I'll try that, and then Jacki and Chris can chime in if they want to add. I think you're right, in the last couple of quarters, for various discrete reasons, we've had the results as you commented. While we delivered the plan for the first quarter, I would say that spring\/summer was a bit choppy in terms of overall trends in the apparel market. On a regional basis, it was interesting because it was pretty good in the U.S., actually better than expected in Europe, with Asia being down. And that was really a combination of strong results in the early days of China and Southeast Asia, but weaker results in Japan and Korea. Some of that being FX, some of that really being the shop-in-shop businesses that dominate both Korea and Japan. And I think those 2 markets and the department store distribution network in them experienced contractions. And so really, it was a series of different results around the globe. As we head into fall and holiday, we feel good about the product early reads, and I know it's early for fall, have been good. We're seeing the strengthening of key markets in Europe. We've had some good wholesale pre-books in Europe beginning to flatten out and then grow the forward bookings after several seasons of contractions there. We've got some strong product initiatives as Jacki articulated. And so we're feeling like, in the go-forward business, we'll have less of the one-offs that we've experienced, plus the addition of Chaps for Men's, plus the addition of Australia, plus the launching of some of these e-commerce sites where we've been carrying the expenses and haven't gotten the revenues. And lastly, and this is true for most people with businesses here in the U.S., we're going against the effects of Sandy, which did impact part of the fall season last year. So for lots of reasons, the underlying trends of the last quarter with the Easter shift, which is sort of unique to us because of the way it splits between March and April, and some of the FX, we delivered the plan perhaps not as much as we had hoped but I think we're encouraged about fall and beyond.","Christopher H. Peterson","The only thing I would add is that this next wave of SAP, which we're implementing toward the end of the quarter, is causing us to shift a little bit of our revenue, particularly in the Wholesale business, out of the second quarter and into the third quarter. So we're going to shift some shipments out of the last week of September and into the first week of October. And that's having a little bit of a split impact between the second and the third quarter revenue guidance.","Operator","The next question comes from Kate McShane with Citigroup.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Roger, this is somewhat answered in the first question but I wondered if there could be more, a little bit more detail. I know last year, around the time of the second quarter, you had decided to pull back some products from Europe because of the state of the world there at the time. Are those sales returning in that region?","Roger N. Farah","Okay, Kate, well, you know I love detail so I'm glad you asked. I would start by just giving you a sense of the trends in Europe. We have talked in the past about sort of a general strength in the North and a little bit softer in the South. And while that continues sort of as a headline, we actually have seen this season, France get a little softer than it's been in the past, but strength in Germany and the U.K. and the Scandinavian markets and other markets have actually encouraged us. We proactively pulled back really on 2 levels. One, countries that are dominated by specialty store distribution like Italy where the specialty stores were struggling, and we were very cautious about putting product into them that, quite frankly, we might not have gotten paid for. So we really worked to proactively reduce that. We worked with our better specialty store customers, but that was a decision to balance inflow of product and the risk of not getting paid. And, quite frankly, we've managed that beautifully. In the department store channels, countries that are dominated mostly by department store distribution, which is Spain and Germany, parts of France and the U.K., as their business has been soft, excluding Chinese tourists, we worked hard to get the inventory turns and the supply and demand in alignment. And as I briefly said in the beginning of my comments, we're beginning to see that turn. And the go-forward bookings in Europe are encouraging in the places we're choosing to sell. So after several quarters or a year of contraction, that was strategically applied to the wholesale channel. We're beginning to see that reverse in the go-forward product categories, countries and regions. So I think that's good news.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Two questions. First, Chris, the 100 basis points you called out of headwind from discontinued operations, the headwind to revenues, it sounds like it's incremental just because I didn't see it when I looked back at the fourth quarter, is that new? Maybe you could tell us a little bit what that was? Was that in the original 4% to 7% guidance you gave last quarter? And then secondly, on the transitioning of Chaps, I'm wondering if there were any adjustments that you made to inventories that perhaps you weren't expecting -- that was the gross margin impact maybe a little bit more than you thought in the quarter related to some inventories you had to clean up. If you could just help me with that.","Christopher H. Peterson","Sure. Yes, I think on the first question, the discontinued businesses are really primarily Rugby, which we had called out previously. I think we felt like we wanted to provide a little bit more specificity in the guidance on how much that discontinuation of Rugby was impacting the guidance. So it's not new news, it's just a -- additional sort of perspective on -- that we wanted to share with the Street. So that's the primary piece of that. On the gross margin impact and Chaps impact, it kind of came out as we expected. So you saw in the release that we had $16 million gain. Part of the way the accounting worked is because we terminated the agreement early because of the PVH and Warnaco merger, we had to take a step-up in the inventory along with a number of other items that resulted in a gain. The inventory that we shipped out in the April, May, June period, we then recorded higher cost of goods. So part of that gain wasn't really incremental, it was a shift out of the cost of goods into the gain number, but that $16 million gain wasn't all incremental. And we knew about that because we had negotiated the contract with PVH prior to our May release, and so that was included in our guidance but there is an underlying gross margin impact that's about what we expected because of that step-up in inventory and then you ship out and incur higher cost of goods than what the going cost of goods level would be.","Operator","Our next question comes from Liz Dunn with Macquarie.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","Just questions around Retail. It looks like a lot of the Rugby stores were sort of re-purposed for some of your other growth initiatives. Is that, first, is that correct? How many were there? And what do you think about unit growth for this year, what should we be looking for? And then it also looks like there are quite a number of licensed stores opening under Club Monaco and some under Ralph Lauren. But to the extent that you have licensed stores opening, how do we sort of avoid some of the missteps that licensed partners have made in the past in terms of opening appropriate locations or not being appropriately positioned? Kind of how are you working with these guys to make sure that they get it?","Roger N. Farah","Okay, Liz, let me try that. We re-purposed probably half of the Rugby stores. And those stores, some of which became Polo, for instance, East Hampton and Short Hills later this fall. Some of which became Denim & Supply, like Newbury Street or University Place downtown. And about half, we closed. The bigger news there is that while it's certainly early days, and Jacki touched on this in her opening remarks, we're feeling very bullish about the opportunity for Polo as standalone Retail. We've had Polo for Men's in our own Ralph Lauren stores, albeit smaller as we've expanded our luxury presentations. But standalone Men's and complemented with Women's Polo, which will be part of our fall strategy, is a very exciting concept for the customer. That will be displayed at its pinnacle on Fifth Avenue next fall. So we have 25 stores in the pipeline for this year to open worldwide. But the probes into Polo stores and Denim & Supply give us a very good feeling about the commercial viability of a high store count growth in the future, which is different than looking for luxury locations. Within our current performance this spring and heading in, the United States and really Europe had pretty strong Retail results. It was really offset by the shop-in-shop concession numbers in Japan and Korea, which we include in our Retail comps, that really dragged the business down in total. So when you put aside some of the moving parts with FX and Easter, the low single-digit positive comps were really stronger in the U.S., stronger in Europe and a little bit down in total in Asia, obviously supported by a very strong e-commerce growth. So there are levels of detail underneath the headline numbers that I think give us some confidence we're on the right path.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christian Buss with Credit Suisse.","Christian Buss - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Could you provide some color on the marketing plans for the China business, and some color on how the stores have performed in their initial ramp phase?","Roger N. Farah","Yes, we have opened a number of stores over the last year, 1.5 years. Obviously, a lot more to come. China is running about 18% ahead. So Southeast Asia is also running mid double-digit, mid-teen double-digit increases, so we're encouraged by the early reaction there. That includes stores in Vietnam and Malaysia and some other markets. While it is still early days, we did open what we call a flagship in Hong Kong, in the Prince's Building, which is a dramatic statement about our Menswear. We had a soft opening in June. We'll have a bigger push in the fall, and that's had tremendous early reaction from the customers. And surprising to us, strong sales in building and furnishings. I think most of you know that the China customer today, and the male customer is the dominant customer, is more casual in dress, but we've had very good early success in clothing. So we expect to begin to ramp up the marketing plans, print, as well as store activities starting in the fall but really coming out more strongly in calendar '14. That's when we're planning a series of large store openings in the fall of '14 in Shanghai and in Hong Kong, and it really will represent a more complete coming-out party for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Glick with Buckingham Research.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Just a couple of quick questions, just a follow-up, Chris. If you can quantify the net impact on the gross margin from Chaps, I know you mentioned 2 moving parts there? And then secondly, Roger, you called out Women's as one of the stronger businesses, Women's and accessories. Accessories not a surprise, Women's, it sounds like it's getting stronger. I just wonder if you can comment on what you're seeing in the Women's business. And was Men's not called out because it was weaker or it just wasn't as strong as Women's?","Christopher H. Peterson","So I'll take the Chaps. The total impact to the gross margin on Chaps was about 120 basis points in the quarter.","Roger N. Farah","I'm going to ask Jacki to maybe touch on some of the product initiatives that you asked about David, and then we'll go from there.","Jackwyn L. Nemerov","David, we have seen a strengthening across our entire Women's business, starting with our collection in Black Label business where they are starting off with quite a good fall at this point year-over-year. Our Lauren business had a very, very strong season, up high-single digits off of a very substantial base. As you know, we are the #1 brand in the department stores and continue to grow in that position and in that floorspace. Our accessory business, I commented on in the script, as our luxury accessory business with the centerpiece of the Ricky, which has done extremely well for spring, and we pretty much had sellouts. We're re-delivering now all of our fall colors. And I don't know if you noticed in the Sunday Times, but we had a fabulous Soft Ricky ad this Sunday. And that is now just the beginning of what we expect to see around that product for the fall right through the holiday season. We're putting a heavy emphasis on our accessory opportunity. Our Lauren accessory business had a very, very strong spring season, and it looks like a good lead into fall. And because of that, we are seeing additional store rollouts and, as I said, real nice double-digit increases in our Lauren brand as well. For anyone who wants a real treat, take a trip down to Macy's Herald Square to see our new Men's Polo shop, which was just opened on Friday. And it has -- it is a 10,000 square foot shop opened off of the new Seventh Avenue Men's door coming up into the shop on the second floor escalator right into the Men's shop. Dramatic presentation of all of the lifestyles that we see in our Polo customer, and from the most casual to clothing and dress furnishings and new accessory area that we installed in this Polo shop. And I think that speaks to how we feel about the opportunity, the continued opportunity in our Men's business. We had a very nice season off of our obviously very large based business, and in most stores ran a mid to high single-digit comp over prior year.","Operator","The next question comes from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up from an investment perspective as it relates to SAP and recognizing the staged approach you're taking, are there more front-end loading of the investments particularly in Q2 than maybe were previously implied? And then just from the remaining investment as we think about it for the balance of the year, how should we think of that kind of progressing as we get through the next 2 quarters in the back half? And then just a second question kind of on some of the longer-term growth opportunities, particularly in Denim & Supply, as this brand has gone more into Retail and as that continues to grow, can you speak a little bit more about what you're learning about that consumer in particular?","Christopher H. Peterson","Sure. I'll take the SAP question. So the year-over-year spending on SAP is a significantly higher spending that's in fiscal '14 versus what we did in fiscal '13. I think we've said the combination of the investment in SAP, the new stores and the e-commerce platform is $75 million increase versus last year from those things combined, and SAP is a significant portion of that $75 million. If you look at the SAP spending, the SAP spending is a little bit more front half-loaded in the fiscal year than back half-loaded because of the timing of the waves that were going through implementation. This wave that we're going to do at the end of September is really the largest wave that we've got sort of remaining for this scope of the project that we're looking at. And so there will be -- it will be spread out through the quarters but it will be a little bit more front half-loaded.","Jackwyn L. Nemerov","On the Denim & Supply consumer, Erinn, what we are really seeing is that the department store customer, our customers are focused on really driving this millennial customer into their stores. What we are seeing is a very strong and early reaction. For instance, in Macy's in Denim & Supply, we are in the Impulse department, which is focused on that millennial customer. In Men's, we're in the Young Men's area, sitting next to Levi. Both of those businesses have been tracking very, very strongly, Men's and Women's, in the department stores. We opened 2 locations in this quarter, one in Boston and one in New York for Denim & Supply, and off to a very good start. And we believe that there will be many stores following that. We have stores that have opened in Europe and in Asia, also performing very well. So what we're seeing is that certainly, within the Ralph Lauren brand in the Denim & Supply aesthetic, we've really been able to engage with this customer. And as I said, the sell-throughs, the product mix, the nature of and the exciting look of that product is clearly engaging that customer. We have a very interesting marketing campaign with the DJ Avicii, who is a very hot DJ in that market. And what's happening is we'd actually just launched this amazing video that has gotten millions and millions of consumer reactions to it. And it's extremely well done, and Avicii will be part of our fall campaign, with special appearances and special concert. So we're putting a tremendous amount of focus on the opportunity that we see with this millennial customer.","Operator","The next question comes from Faye Landes with Cowen and Company.","Faye I. Landes - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","A couple of things. Can you, first of all, you mentioned the impact of FX on gross margin. I'm just trying to figure out what the exact number is. And also, more -- perhaps more crucially, can you define or sort of outline when you expect to return to higher core top line growth rates post the anniversary-ing of China, America leaving [ph], et cetera, and what it's going to take to get there?","Christopher H. Peterson","Sure. So let me start with gross margin. So gross -- foreign exchange had about a 50 basis point approximate impact on gross margin. So if you looked at the gross margin, we talked about the Chaps impact and the FX impact, if you looked at the gross margin excluding those 2 impacts, we would have been flat to slightly up on gross margin on the core business in the quarter.","Roger N. Farah","And I think, Faye, in terms of the top line growth, you know all the macroeconomic factors going on in the world today. So I'm not going to rattle those off. Our focus is on a very underdeveloped Asia business for us. We've talked consistently for years about seeing Asia as potentially 1\/3 of our business in the future, with Europe being 1\/3 and the United States being 1\/3. So at 63% U.S, we've got a long way to go in the international markets, whether that's emerging markets like Brazil or other parts of Europe or really the more scalable opportunities in China. So we will continue to look at the distribution strategies, the brand strategies, the marketing strategies that will drive an acceleration in the international growth rates. Within product categories, which is the other focus for us, Jacki touched on several of them. They are the luxury businesses, they are the accessory businesses, and we feel very bullish about the size and opportunity of Polo for Women's, as well as the Denim business. So we have product category opportunities as well as geographic opportunities. And the last leg of that stool is really the ongoing opportunity in e-commerce on a global basis. We're running significant increases in Europe in e-commerce. In our second year, we'll be breakeven or profitable. We are making big investments in Asia, first in Japan, Korea, but after that, China. We think we have a compelling product. We have the brand integrity and the product integrity that allows customers to comfortably buy our products online, with low return rates. So these are very profitable ways to reach customers, particularly in new markets. It's a much more efficient way to talk to customers than trying to build a very big network of retail-only brick-and-mortar stores in these countries. So those are the headlines of growth. We're very committed to them. We've talked about the investments necessary to make. We think we're being prudent about balancing that and delivering ongoing shareholder value. But at this point, those opportunities remain unchanged and unshakable in our mind in terms of where we want to put our management time, energy and our money.","Operator","The final question comes from Barbara Wyckoff with CLSA.","Barbara Wyckoff - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Can you talk about the number of -- the points-of-sale that you have in Greater China now versus last year? How many -- could you break out how many concessions you have versus owned retail? Are we likely to see Polo stores increasing in China versus concessions in the future? And then just sort of thoughts on flagships, after these flagships open next spring, is that going to be pretty much it for China? And then you will focus on other stores like the Blue label?","Roger N. Farah","Okay, Barbara, let me see if I can summarize, and this will be more directional than absolute specifics. We took back the licensed distribution in China, which was heavily focused on department stores and partners, multiple partners in multiple cities around China. And when we made the decision to shut that down, it wasn't because they weren't doing business or there wasn't an appetite for the product or it wasn't making money. We just thought it did not lay the foundation for the kind of brand we wanted to build long term. So as we've said, about 95 points-of-sale were closed in China over the last 5 quarters. Some of that dribbled in to the first quarter of this year, when Chris talked about discontinued ops, but it wasn't meaningful. So in essence, we shut the network. We have been rebuilding really at this point with standalone stores, mall or street locations. And I think at this point, we have something in the low-teens. But the flagship we just opened in Hong Kong, Men's only, and the flagships we're opening next fall is part of a strategy to have key important flagships in Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong. We are not at this point looking to go into second or third tier cities in any meaningful way until we establish the full complement of the brand in those flagship locations. Once we've done that and we begin to raise the brand, the visibility and knowledge, which today only 7% of the population really knows us there, which is in stark contrast to our recognition in the United States or Europe, but we'll begin to cascade strategies, distribution points and brands in those markets. We also are looking to overlay that with a thoughtful e-commerce strategy, which will give broader access to the product than we can reach in a reasonable time frame with brick-and-mortar.","So with that, I'd like to thank you all for listening. We continue to remain very committed to our long-term growth initiatives and think we've managed the short term as a team very well. Look forward to talking to you in November.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference for today. Thank you for your participation.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mrs. Evren Kopelman. Please go ahead.","Evren Kopelman - Investor Relations","Good morning and thank you for joining Ralph Lauren's third quarter fiscal 2016 conference call. With me today are Stefan Larsson, the company's President and Chief Executive Officer; Christ Peterson, President of Global Brands; and Bob Madore, Chief Financial Officer. After the company's prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions, which we ask that you limit to one per caller.","During today's call, we will be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including our financial outlook. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees and our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Our expectations contain many risks and uncertainties. The principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from our current expectations are detailed in our SEC filings.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Stefan.","Stefan Larsson - Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Evren, and good morning, everyone. I'm happy to meet with you today. I'm here to share with you how I spent my first three months, my initial observations, and a rough outline for how we will build the long term growth plan for this great company. Chris and Bob will then share financial results for the quarter and give you guidance going forward. I will then come back again to conclude the presentation part of the call and open up for your questions. But before we get going, I would like to take the opportunity to thank Ralph and the Board for their partnership and trust that they have given me in leading this great company forward.","Now, let's start with how I spent my first three months in the role. Over the last 90 days, I've done a lot of travels. I've been to London, Paris, Geneva, Frankfurt, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Beijing, and all over the U.S., including our Distribution Center in North Carolina. I've also met with our biggest customers and spent time with many influencers in the industry, and I met with thousands of our team members across all the functions and levels of the organization. And in many of these meetings, I've received direct feedback from frontline team members and customers.","The goal of the travel and meetings has been to learn as much as possible about our brand, our team, our customers and the environment we compete in. Parallel to the travel and meetings, the senior management team is in the process of conducting a formal and comprehensive assessment of our entire organization and every function we do. This review goes beyond the cost savings initiatives and brand planning processes that were underway when I joined; covers all the value creators in the business from brand, product, marketing, to supply chain distribution, geographies, as well as customers and competitors. This assessment and our multi-year growth strategy will be completed in the coming weeks and months. And I look forward to sharing that with you in late spring.","While it's still early days in the assessment, a picture is starting to develop of our strengths and opportunities, as well as a rough outline for how we would build our long term growth plan. So, let me start with our strengths. Our brand, our team, and the infrastructure we are building are by far our biggest strengths. Our brand is very strong and unique. Ralph and the team have built a brand on a dream of an aspirational life, in a way it's the quintessential American dream, but it's bigger than that. It's a life in style that goes far beyond apparel. It's built on authentic style, quality, and specialness. And it became the customers' dream, and at its best is both highly aspirational and highly relatable at the same time.","Right after I came in, we did a comprehensive brand study that confirms not surprisingly, that our customers see our brand as one of the strongest in the industry. The strength, depth and uniqueness of our brand that Ralph created 48 years ago is a very strong platform to build on.","Another key strength we have is our team. Our team members, and I've met many of them already, are highly dedicated, they're passionate and they care deeply about our brand. They can't wait to get back to consistently beating our competitors and there is a hunger for change that will be critical for realizing the full potential of this company.","Finally, the infrastructure we are investing in, like SAP and our new e-commerce platform that will enable us to have best-in-class digital capabilities, that's especially important in the world we're living in today.","Moving to our opportunities, and here I want to start with our performance trend over the last several years. Our recent financial performance has not been living up to the strengths of our brand. It's been very disappointing on both on a top and a bottom line level. With this underwhelming performance, we're asking ourselves the tough questions needed to identify where the opportunities are to get back to leveraging our strengths to consistently drive higher performance. In our assessment work, we started by asking the following questions, starting with brand. With our multiple brands, how do we increase focus on the brands where we have the biggest opportunity to win? Even though our brand is strong, how do we build on the authentic core of what we stand for and continuously evolve it?","Relating to product and assortment, how do we improve the balance in our assortment? Do we have a systematic way of continuously strengthening our assortment? Relating to marketing, how do we focus our resources on cutting through in today's market? How do we evolve our brand voice in a way that makes our brand DNA stand out, and excites and surprises the customer more than anyone else? We want our customers to love us more than anyone else.","Relating to supply chain and inventory management, how do we shorten our lead times to be disruptive? How do we optimize our inventory in relation to sales? Relating to distribution and international expansion, how do we improve the quality of our distribution to be able to grow with higher full-price selling and lower discount levels? How do we strengthen our direct-to-consumer channels given where the market is going? How do we make our online channel show up the way it should and drive brand strength and profitable sales growth at the same time? How do we pursue our global growth potential in a much more strategic way?","Relating to cost structure, how do we make the cost structure competitive with our best competitors? How do we make sure that we invest in a disciplined enough way for the future to give us the highest return on investment? Relating to customers. How do we get closer to our customers to know what their aspiration, wants and needs are? How do we engage and build enough long-term relationships with our customers? And finally, relating to the increasingly-disruptive environment we're in. How do we strengthen the brand and develop the business model fast enough to succeed in an increasingly disruptive world?","Finding the right answers to these type of questions, putting action in place to drive execution will be the most important work we have in front of us over the next few months. It will be the foundation to building our growth plan. Even though our complete plan will not be ready until the end of spring, I would like to share some thinking on where we're driving tourists and how we're going to build up the plan. We are working towards a vision centered on becoming the most admired, aspirational and high-performing style brand in the world. And we will measure our progress towards the vision through brand strength, profitable sales growth, and shareholder return. The foundation of our plan will be our commitment and focus on developing our brand, our teams and our customers.","There will be two main parts to our plan framework. The first will be the customer facing part of the brand where we will evolve and strengthen the products, the marketing, and the shopping experience. The second part will be to radically strengthen the underlying business engines. These engines will include developing a systematic repeatable way of creating a stronger and stronger assortment, a more demand-driven supply chain, and a holistic global expansion strategy, as well as the best-in-class consumer insights capability. Underlying all these initiatives, are the strengthening of our team and the right-sizing of our cost structure.","When it comes to our costs, we just have to become more competitive. The work we are undertaking is the work we need to do to build the company back to high performance and position ourselves to lead in an increasingly disruptive environment. It's complex work that will take time. We will show you the pacing through the plan we will present in late spring and we'd show progress every year. I know how critical it is to build and maintain the trust of our shareholders. This will require clear and consistent performance and communication going forward. I am committed to both. We are going to be laser-focused on transitioning our business back to excellence.","And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Chris.","Christopher H. Peterson - President-Global Brands","Thank you, Stefan, and good morning, everyone. Revenues in the third quarter were down 1% in constant currency and down 4% on a reported basis, below our guidance of 0% to 2% reported growth. Despite the sales shortfall, we were able to generate operating margin above our guidance range due to both better expense management and a solid gross profit rate. The sales shortfall in the quarter was driven by our North America business due to the above average temperatures that persisted for most of the fall and holiday selling period, a significant drop in foreign tourist traffic, challenges in the Lauren brand, and general macroeconomic weakness. Our performance in international markets was much better as revenue grew 6% in constant currency outside of North America.","Let me provide you with more color on our performance by key geographies. Starting with Europe, our revenue grew 8% in the third quarter in constant currency. Wholesale demand was particularly strong with robust sell-throughs that drove strong reorders. By region, northern and central Europe performed the best. In Asia, third quarter revenue was up 3% in constant currency. While this growth rate is below the high single-digit growth rate we posted in the first half of the year, it was within our expectations. We reduced markdowns and the length of the sale period in Japan and Korea, our two key markets within Asia. This pressured sales growth in the quarter, however drove gross margin improvement and gross profit growth. We believe these actions will continue to help us elevate the brand in this region.","Looking at performance by country, Hong Kong and Macau continued to underperform due to reduced tourist traffic, while Japan and Australia continued to outperform. As we spoke about previously, we implemented price increases in key international markets to help mitigate the negative margin impact from currency fluctuations. I want to provide some perspective on how that's gone. In Japan, Australia and Canada the pricing actions we have taken have been well received by the customer and we have continued to gain market share in these markets. In Europe, we raised prices for the cruise and spring 2016 seasons. Early indications based on sell-in are encouraging, but it is too soon to have a definitive read on the consumer response.","Moving on to the Americas, net revenue was down 4% in constant currency below our expectations. While we anticipated a challenging holiday season given the slow start to fall, it was even more difficult than we expected. The silver lining is that comps were positive in store locations where domestic customers represent more of the traffic similar to last quarter. As a result, we are optimistic that comps can show improvement as we begin to lap the foreign tourist traffic issues this coming summer. The sales challenges we faced in the third quarter are reflected in our operating margin guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 as we are proactively clearing end of season inventories. We will carefully manage expenses to mitigate as much of the negative impact from these actions as possible.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bob for a review of additional financial results and balance sheet dynamics.","Robert L. Madore - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Gross profit margin in the third quarter was 56.8% excluding restructuring and other charges. This was 20 basis points lower than the prior-year period primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency affects. On a constant-currency basis, gross margin was up 30 basis points compared to the prior-year period due to benefits from the initial phases of SKU and style rationalization, product cost negotiations, and favorable mix shifts. Operating margin in the third quarter was 13.7% excluding restructuring and other charges, 180 basis points below the prior-year period. This is better than the November outlook we provided of a 200 basis point to 250 basis point decline and was due to better expense management.","The lower operating margin year-over-year was primarily attributable to negative foreign currency affects, fixed expense deleverage and incremental investments in infrastructure. Net income for the third quarter was $193 million or $2.27 per diluted share excluding restructuring and other charges. This compared to reported net income of $215 million or $2.41 per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. On a reported basis, net income was $131 million or $1.54 per diluted share in the third quarter. The effective tax rate was 25% in the third quarter excluding restructuring and other charges and was 28% on a reported basis. This was lower than our guidance of 31% due primarily to discrete items recorded in the quarter and the effective tax rate of 29% in the prior-year period.","Moving to the balance sheet, consolidated inventory was $1.3 billion at the end of the third quarter up 5% year-over-year. This growth reflects investments to support sales growth for existing operations, new businesses, and new store openings. At the end of the third quarter, we had 31 more directly-operated stores and 85 additional concessions compared to the prior-year period which is contributing to the growth. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.2 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet and $611 million in total debt. The company repurchased 803,000 shares of its common stock during the third quarter at a cost of $100 million. This brought year-to-date repurchases to $380 million.","With that, I'll turn the call back to Chris, who'll provide guidance for the remainder of fiscal 2016 and some initial thoughts on fiscal 2017.","Christopher H. Peterson - President-Global Brands","Thanks, Bob. For the fourth quarter we are taking proactive action to clear end of season inventories for fall and holiday in the U.S. so that we start the spring selling season in a strong position. As a result, we expect reported revenues to be flat to down 2% on a reported basis, due to continued pressure from lower foreign tourist traffic, as well as higher allowances in the U.S. wholesale channel to move excess inventory. The fourth quarter includes the 53rd week which we estimate will contribute approximately $65 million in revenue. We estimate the negative currency impact on sales growth in the fourth quarter to be approximately 150 basis points based on current exchange rates.","Our operating margin for the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately 400 basis points to 450 basis points below the prior-year period due to the proactive action we are taking on inventory in addition to infrastructure investments and negative foreign exchange impacts. The fourth quarter tax rate is estimated at 32%.","For the full year, fiscal 2016 period, revenues are expected to decline approximately 3% on a reported basis with 400 basis points of negative impact from currency. This compares to our prior outlook of flat revenues on a reported basis and 400 basis points of foreign exchange impact. The full year fiscal 2016 operating margin is now estimated to be 290 basis points to 320 basis points below the prior-year's level which compares to our previous expectation of 180 basis point to 230 basis point decline.","This guidance excludes restructuring and other charges that are primarily related to restructuring activities associated with our global brand reorganization and a pending customs audit. We expect these restructuring charges to approximate $120 million to $150 million for fiscal 2016 excluding $34 million for pending customs audit. We recognized $42 million of this charge in the third quarter and $113 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2016. We remain on track to deliver the $110 million of annual expense savings associated with our global brand restructuring effort. We will get a partial benefit this year and the entirety of the benefit in fiscal 2017. Our fiscal 2016 tax rate is expected to be 28%. We continue to plan $400 million to $500 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 to support our global direct-to-consumer and infrastructure investments.","Now let me provide some initial thoughts on how we're thinking about fiscal 2017. We recently started the planning process for fiscal 2017, which as Stefan said, will include a deep dive into all aspects of the business. The plan will include the following key elements; first, we plan to right-size and increase the quality of our distribution; second, we plan to intentionally reduce the depth of the inventory buy to decrease discount rates and promotional selling levels; and third, we plan to take significant action to improve the company's cost structure. While we are still working through the details, at this point, we expect fiscal 2017 total revenues to be down versus fiscal 2016, and operating margin to be up versus fiscal 2016 excluding restructuring and other charges. The operating margin improvement will be despite an approximate $90 million negative operating income impact from foreign currency in fiscal 2017. We look forward to sharing more details on our outlook in late spring.","With that, let me turn the call back to Stefan for some closing remarks.","Stefan Larsson - Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Chris. In closing, let me reiterate, within the company we see the current performance of the business as very disappointing and we have full focus across the whole organization to drive the business back to higher performance. The challenges we are facing did not materialize overnight. They developed over years and our solutions will take time as well. I want to be very clear. The growth journey we set out on is not to drive results next quarter, but rather position Ralph Lauren for success and relevance over the next decade and beyond. We have an opportunity to do something that will build Ralph Lauren stronger than ever before.","In a world where the customer is in charge, we will build everything we do around our customer's dream of a life well-lived. We will give them access to authentic-style, quality and specialness in all aspects of their life, and we will do this in a way that we build on what made us great and we evolve it in new and innovative ways. I look forward to providing more specifics when we share our detailed growth plan in late spring.","One thing is clear; I never had a stronger vision to build on. The combined strength of the brand of Ralph, one of the most iconic designers in the world, our talented team, and my experience of driving high performance in this industry, makes me very excited for the future ahead. With the full support of Ralph, our Board of Directors, we will move forward to create significant shareholder value.","And with that, I would like to open up the call for your questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The first question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Thank you. Good morning. Stefan, I'd like to ask you, obviously you've (23:49) got a lot of different things on your plate, but if I could get some of your initial thoughts potentially on the complexity of the brands and is there a need to simplify the brands, not just from a management perspective internally, but also maybe it's confusing to the consumer side as well. And then also, do you think there is a need to right-size any of the lower-end businesses like the outlet and off price? Thank you.","Stefan Larsson - Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Omar. Yes, you're right. There is \u2013 we are in the middle of assessment, so I can give you some early reads, which is we need to focus. I'm a big believer in my leadership approach overall to focus, and that includes our brands. So in the plan that we will come back with in late spring, I will be very detailed in terms of how I look at being focused given the multiple brands we have. What excites me though is that the more I learn about the brand, the more I realize the strength of the brand.","So focusing on where we will win when it comes to the brands will be essential, and I'll come back and give you more details. When it comes to the quality of our distribution, that's also something that we are looking through in detail and as I shared in my initial remarks, we will build Ralph Lauren into stronger position it's ever had. That's a long-term job. I'll be able to give you more details in May, but we are looking through every single channel and I'm going to make sure that the plan that we move forward with enables us to drive brand strength and drive profitable sales growth at the same time.","Operator","Thank you. The next question...","Evren Kopelman - Investor Relations","Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Michael Binetti with UBS Investment Research.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","(25:57 \u2013 26:06) for next year that's going to be fairly hard for us to pencil out with some \u2013 any kind of clarity in our models. Just maybe directionally how you're thinking about \u2013 I know, it's early, but directionally how you're thinking about magnitude, particularly on the revenue line. Just to help us with our longer range thinking. And then if we could just go back to try and connect some of the comments you made today to some of the investment buckets that we're used to hearing about from you over the last few years and maybe how much leverage we can think about for fiscal 2017 in terms of the buckets you've given, one the retail strategy, two the SAP and e-commerce, and then three the cost restructuring, Chris, it sounded like from your deep-dive comments that there could be something you guys are looking at that's incremental to the original plan that's led to about $110 million in cost savings. Thanks.","Christopher H. Peterson - President-Global Brands","Yeah. Thanks, Michael. I think the answer to that is, what Stefan started with, which is we're in an assessment phase on all aspects of the business, and we're working through to create a strategic and financial plan that can drive shareholder value, can drive profitable sales growth and can strengthen the brand over the midterm. We plan to share that plan in more detail in late spring, and so we're not yet at the point where we're ready to quantify the elements of the guidance for fiscal 2017 beyond what we shared in the script this morning.","What I can say on the buckets is that, particularly we shared I think, on the call, the FX impact that we expect next year. We remain on track on the infrastructure on both SAP and e-commerce to complete the SAP European implementation next year, as well as the e-commerce re-platforming next year. And we remain on track, as I mentioned, to deliver the $110 million of cost savings from the initial global brand restructure, but we are in the assessment phase and we'll share more details in late spring.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning. So, I guess, if we kind of piece this together and think about multi-year constant currency revenues, beyond the impact of FX today, what's \u2013 I guess, what's the best way to think about wholesale and retail constraints today both here and also abroad versus, Stefan potentially maybe the opportunity you see for a return to growth? Kind of, some of the things that may be impacting you next year versus some of the opportunities that you see; and with that, if you kind of broke down into the product, Polo versus Lauren, just kind of from a pricing perspective, do you think that you're appropriately set or do you think that there is changes that need to be made to the core infrastructure of the price that's going out the door to the customer today?","Stefan Larsson - Chief Executive Officer","Yes. Thank you, Matt. So starting with the pricing. It's going to be an important part and it is an important part of our assessment to look through our whole offering to our customers. So given the recent very disappointing performance, we are asking and I'm driving that \u2013 we are asking the tough questions in every single area of the business. Because what I am determined to do with the team and with the support of Ralph is to match the business performance with the strength of the brand. So when I look at the brand, it's one of the strongest in the industry.","And when I looked at our performance over the last couple of years, including the recent quarters, it's very disappointing. So I see significant untapped value in both the idea behind the brand and as well as how we drive the business. And therefore, in the way I outlined the way we approach, building the growth plan for the future, there will be a customer facing component which is about evolving the brand, evolving our product, marketing, shopping experience, and then radically improve some of our business engines. And I believe that driving brand strength for the future and driving consistent profitable sales growth, and in turn giving high shareholder return is to strengthen both those components, both the customer-facing part and the underlying engines and have them play together. That's also what I have experience of doing from my two previous brands.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Ms. Kate McShane with Citi Research.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Thank you. Good morning. My question is just with regards to the brand. Stefan you said you have done a lot of work on assessing the brand and just in some of the questions you've just answered, you again attested to the strength of the brand. Could you let us know a little bit more detail about maybe what some of the strengths are? What is so appealing about the brand to the consumer and what can you leverage over time?","Stefan Larsson - Chief Executive Officer","Yes, absolutely. Thank you, Kate. So when it comes to the brand, what excites me is that Ralph's original idea behind the brand when he created it, it was much bigger than apparel, and it was much bigger than product. So it was about inviting the customers into an aspirational life, their aspirational life. And being very consistent and offering authentic style, high-quality, and deliver specialness in the experience. And if you look at the disruptive market today, I believe that that's exactly what you need to do to win. You need to be special. You need to deliver a value that goes beyond apparel, and if you look at the customer, it's \u2013 the customer is now in charge. And the customer is living a busy life. And what excites me about the original brand vision and building that out and why I see so much potential in it, is that we should deliver style to the customer. And we can do that and we are known to do that and why we are so loved is because we have been so consistent in delivering authentic style, quality and specialness.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","The brand has a number of different avenues of distribution, wholesale, off-price, full-price retail, outlet. Can you just talk a little bit about what area do you view as quality and what function each of those avenues of distribution serves? And then just a quick follow-up for Chris. I'm curious what gives you visibility to margin improvement year-over-year in light of the potential deleverage on the sales shortfall and some of the other puts and takes that you talked about. Thanks.","Stefan Larsson - Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thanks. Let me start. It's Stefan. Quality of distribution for me is any channel that gives us an ability to strengthen our brand and drive profitable sales growth at the same time. So we'll come back in late spring and give you more details on how we see our portfolio of distribution going forward.","Christopher H. Peterson - President-Global Brands","And relative to the operating margin visibility for fiscal 2017, I think the thing that gives us visibility into that from the initial planning phase is a number of factors, including the full-year impact of the cost savings that we've generated from the global brand restructuring. The full-year impact of the pricing that we've taken in devaluation markets that should kick in next year. Cost savings that we're going after through the SKU and style rationalization, and the work that we're beginning on right-sizing the company's cost structure for next year as part of the planning process, which we'll share more detail on in late spring when we come back with the plan. And I think all of those things taken in aggregate, we have visibility to suggest that that is going to result in operating margin being up versus the drag of foreign exchange that we have for next year and fixed expense deleverage.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Rick Patel with Stephens, Inc.","Rick Patel - Stephens, Inc.","Thank you, and good morning. So, Stefan, we'd like to hear your thoughts on the product and concept pipeline? Over the past several quarters we've heard the company introducing woman's Polo, Polo retail, they reintroduced Polo Sport. As we think about the median term, should we expect the primary drivers of organic growth to be the ramp up of these newly-introduced areas? Or are there new sub-brands and concepts that we may be hearing about in the future as you do your assessment of all the brands?","Stefan Larsson - Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Rick. Well, I come back to that, it's a part of the assessments. I will give you detailed outline of how I think about these questions in May. But just initial thoughts is that my experience of driving high performance in this industry is very much connected to finding a systemic repeatable way of creating a stronger and stronger assortment, and it's still early days but I see big untapped value potential there.","When it comes to evolving assortment in terms of the balance of the assortment, and in terms of sports and catering to the customer's different needs, I'm coming back to why I believe in the brand. I believe that we should give our customer access to a life in style better than anyone else and that means mirroring what their need is and how they build up their wardrobe. And we can do that more authentic with higher quality and with more specialness than anybody else. And we can also and we should think in new ways and innovative ways of how we can utilize the disruptive world we are in to actually deliver that specialness to the customer in a way that excites and delights them, but also that makes it convenient for them. And I'll come back in late spring with more details.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Dave Weiner with Deutsche Bank.","David Weiner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, good morning. So I just had two quick questions. Number one, just to follow-up on the prior one. Could you talk a little about your early reads on that you've seen so far on the Polo Sport business and the inclusion there in Dick's and some other wholesale partners, and then also maybe a little bit about Europe, you gave some commentary on your own business by geography, but could you maybe talk about whether you saw any incremental weakness due to the terrorist attack in Paris or if you feel any kind of shift in cadence among local consumers just broadly there relative to maybe the back half of \u2013 or earlier in 2015? Thanks.","Christopher H. Peterson - President-Global Brands","Yeah, let me start with Europe and then I'll turn to Stefan for Polo. In Europe, we delivered constant currency growth in the third quarter of 8%. So, it was a pretty strong performance from a revenue standpoint. We were disrupted from the terrorist attack in Paris. We actually had a number of our stores shut down both in France and the UK for a few days and we saw the shopping pull back. But it returned relatively quickly after that and so that's how we were able to deliver a relatively strong result of the 8% constant currency top line growth despite that short-term disruption.","Stefan Larsson - Chief Executive Officer","Yes, and when it comes to the Polo Sport question, I tie it to getting closer to our customers. Given that we are about style and we are going to be the customer's preferred supplier for aspirational style to their wardrobe, it's about getting as close as we can to them. That's why as one of the underlying business engine that we're going to develop is a consumer insights capability that gives us the possibility to reflect if it's \u2013 if the customer builds their wardrobe on more of an at leisure and sport component, our offerings should reflect that. And it also makes me think about how Ralph has been 10 years, 15 years ahead on many macro trends because we were one of the first in the industry several years back in thinking about sport, and what we have to do now is we have to get close to the customer and we have to evolve our offering so we reflect how they want to build their wardrobe.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes Laurent Vasilescu with Macquarie Capital.","Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Gross margin was up 30 basis points on a constant FX basis compared to 90 basis points last quarter. Was the difference due to lower benefits from sourcing, SKU rationalization, and product mix, or were there additional factors we should consider? How should we think about that for the fourth quarter? And then lastly, last February it was noted that your hedges for inventory purchases is six months to nine months out with 70% exposure rate. Has that \u2013 have those factors changed over the last year as we think about FY 2017?","Robert L. Madore - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, so let me address those. So, the gross margin performance in the third quarter was impacted largely by the U.S. market versus the second quarter because in the U.S. market we saw a difficult, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, fall holiday selling period. In our fourth quarter guidance is reflected on the gross margin rate, a plan to increase markdown monies and allowances to clear excess fall and holiday inventory so that we start the spring selling season strong. I would say that's really the driver in the gross margin trend in Q3 and Q4.","With regard to FX and hedging, our hedging policy has not changed; it's consistent. And so we expect at current exchange rates to have a very small to nominal impact on translation next year in fiscal 2017, but we will have a transactional impact, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks. The combination of those two we expect to impact the results by about $90 million negatively as the favorable hedges \u2013 we lap the favorable hedge benefit this year going into next year.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from John Kernan with Cowen & Company.","John Kernan - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Stefan, you talked a lot about disruption; you used the word several times. Can you help us understand what you see as the most disruptive factor to the apparel category in general right now?","Stefan Larsson - Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Good morning, John. Yes. When it comes to the disruption, I'm a firm believer that we're just seeing the beginning. So I believe that the biggest disruption is that the customer is now in charge. So the customer has better visibility and better choices than ever before. So any company that's in the business of providing generic products or don't have any real value add beyond the lower and lower price or who, more importantly, is not close enough to the customer will be in trouble. So that's why we are building on the strength that's made us great, and we are adding an even closer focus to what's going on in the market and what's going on with the customer.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from David Glick with Buckingham Research Group.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thank you. Just a follow-up question on some of the channels you're reevaluating. The department store channel obviously has been very, very important in the U.S. for the development of the brand, and it's evolved over the years. Certainly the shops are very brand enhancing, but obviously there's been a lot of promotional activity, a lot of focus on key items; selling at a discount. Is that an example of one of the channels you're taking a closer look at to perhaps shorten lead times and improve the quality of sales? And can you still maintain the same kind of space in those department stores if you end up shipping less into that channel?","Stefan Larsson - Chief Executive Officer","Yes. Thank you, David. So when it comes to department stores, they have been very important \u2013 you're right \u2013 to what has made us great from a business performance historically. And they will continue to be important to us. And yes, we are focusing in the plan we're building and coming back with the details in late spring, we are focusing on some of the underlying business engines that I see yes, it's early days, but I already see based on my experience that we have a lot of value unlock to do.","So one is how we systematically and repeatable build \u2013 how we in a systematic and repeatable way build assortment stronger and stronger. There is also a supply chain and inventory management component, which is to become much better at balancing supply and demand. And there is also an expansion strategy, which is to say how do we grow with quality in all the different channels we have because I believe in that department stores, direct to consumer are going to play together, and offline and online are going to play together. And what I've \u2013 again, coming back to my own experience, well, I have experience of this to drive a highly profitable global growth strategy. And I believe we have opportunities in being \u2013 taking a holistic expansion approach to our brand and our business, and by doing that unlock even more brand strength and unlock even more value in terms of driving profitable sales growth.","Christopher H. Peterson - President-Global Brands","Okay. Thank you all for joining us this morning. And as always, we will be available for follow-up questions after the call.","Stefan Larsson - Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference for today.

Welcome to the Ralph Lauren Third Quarter Fiscal 2019 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions on how to ask a question will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Ms. Corinna Van der Ghinst. Please go ahead.","Corinna Van der Ghinst","Good morning and thank you for joining Ralph Lauren third quarter fiscal 2019 conference call. With me today are Patrice Louvet, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jane Nielsen, Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions, which we ask that you limit to one per caller.","During today's call, we will be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws, including our financial outlook. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees, and our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.","Our expectations contain many risks and uncertainties. Principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from our current expectations are detailed in our SEC filings. To find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our financial results, you should refer to this morning's earnings release and to our SEC filings that can be found on our Investor Relations website.","And now I will turn the call over to Patrice.","Patrice Louvet","Thank you, Cory. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining today's call. We're pleased to report better than expected third quarter results during the important holiday season, as we continue to execute on our strategic priorities. As we discussed at our Investor Day last spring, our teams are focused on delivering long-term sustainable growth and value creation.","In the third quarter, we outperformed our expectations on both the top and the bottom line with double-digit EPS growth. Our results were driven by double-digit revenue growth in Asia and Europe and strong sequential progress in North America with better than expected AUR growth globally. During the third quarter, we continue to drive our execution and performance against the five strategic priorities that we laid out as part of our five-year Next Great Chapter plan.","These include; first, win over a new generation of consumers; second, energize core products and accelerate underdeveloped categories; third, drive targeted expansions in our regions and channels; fourth, lead with digital across all activities; and fifth, operate with discipline to show growth. As we look to close up the fiscal year, we remain on track to achieve our plans for the full year.","Let me now highlight some key progress points starting with new generation of consumers. In the third quarter, we increased marketing investments by 18% to last year. We continue to shift our spend to channels that matter most to consumers today, namely digital and social. Our key marketing initiatives this quarter centered around our limited edition collections and holiday camping.","On our last call, we announced an exciting new collaboration with UK-based streetwear brand Palace. Launched in November, the capsule collection consists of menswear pieces inspired by iconic Polo styles that the Palace creators Lev and Gareth have worn throughout their lives. The products sold exclusively on our Polo mobile app in the U.S, our digital flagship in Europe and across Palace's retail network.","We approach the collaboration as an opportunity to reach new and younger consumers with a fresh take on product that still remain true to the DNA of the Polo brand. The collaboration generated over 2 billion impressions globally exceeding our expectations. The Palace collection sold out in under an hour online.","We were encouraged that roughly 75% of the people who purchased it globally were completely new to Ralph Lauren. The collaboration was particularly effective in engaging the Millennial and Gen Z consumers with those purchasing the collection, 10 years younger on average than the typical Polo men consumer.","We are now little more than a year into our approach to drive energy and excitement around our brand with limited edition releases, and we continue to be encouraged by the traction these drops are gaining. In December, we launched our Winter Stadium collection which was available on our Polo mobile app in the U.S. and in key flagship stores globally. We also partnered with influential specialty retailers including Opening Ceremony and Clothing, Hypebeast's e-commerce site HBX and Selfridge's.","Winter Stadium generated over 1 billion impressions globally and achieved nearly 100% sell through on our Polo app in the first day. In addition to attracting new consumers to our franchise, we're excited to see new fan base developing for our drops. Over half of the Winter Stadium shoppers were repeat customers who had already purchased from at least one of our limited editions previously.","We also continued our 50th anniversary celebrations in the third quarter with our holiday gifts camping RL50gifts which we amplified through social media influencers and celebrities like Emmy Rossum, Rachel Zoe, Cameron Dallas and Olivia Palermo. About one third of the consumers who shop product highlighted in our holiday camping were new to Ralph Lauren and a meaningful portion of these new consumers were under the age of 35.","In addition to our holiday gifting campaign, we continue to leverage the use of celebrities and influencers across different areas of pop culture and sports. In the third quarter, Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, Alex Rodriguez, Gigi Hadid and the Chance the Rapper were among the stars featured in our brand. We kicked off reward season dressing with actors Chris Pine, Lady Gaga and Lupita Nyong'o.","You've also maybe have seen Ralph's incredible custom designs for the wedding of actress Priyanka Chopra to music superstar Nick Jonas in India in December. It was the first wedding dress that Ralph has designed for a bride outside of his own family. The wedding was a global event that transcended cultures and dominated social media platforms.","Moving onto our second key initiative, energize core products and accelerate underdeveloped categories. Our strong top line performance this quarter was driven by our core products as Ralph and the design teams continue to drive excitement in the marketplace. This is consistent with our year-to-date trends and expectations that iconic and updated core styles will be a more meaningful near-term driver while we continue to develop our high potential underpenetrated categories for the longer-term.","Top performing core products in the third quarter included Oxford shirts, Half-Zip sweaters, Women's Cashmere sweaters and Mesh Polo. In addition, we continue to build upon our customization program this quarter with monogramming services and expanded customization offerings in the European market. Customization continues to represent an important long-term opportunity for direct-to-consumer channels, driving AURs at a higher than our overall digital commerce AURs, higher gross margins and no returns.","Moving to our underdeveloped categories that have significant growth potential across our brands these include denim, outerwear, wear to work, footwear and accessories. Our sell of trends in denim and outerwear, which are the further developed of the five categories accelerated in the quarter with an improved merchandising and distribution focus, indicating a positive consumer response to our new initiatives. Outerwear performance accelerated this winter as we continue to focus on our core nylon and down jackets while also injecting the category with new fabrications, innovation like our RL Heat launch this month and focus on end users like active, weekend and weekday dressing.","In fragrance, we launch a new camping in January around the Ralph Lauren Romance fragrance for women bring a fresh take a new packaging to this iconic scent just in time for Valentine\u2019s Day. The spring campaign featured supermodel Taylor Hill as the new face of the fragrance, along with her boyfriend actor Michael Stephen Shank.","Moving on to our third key initiative, drive targeted expansion in our regions and channels. We are focused on building a compelling and competitive Ralph Lauren ecosystem in key cities globally. This includes digital distribution as well as new and renovated stores to drive growth. During the third quarter, we opened 39 new stores and concessions globally and closed 12 locations. This included 24 openings in Asia with nine in China, our fastest-growing market.","Our China openings this quarter were focused on our key city clusters of Shanghai, Shenzhen, Beijing, and Chengdu. We continue to drive strong growth in China in the third quarter. Greater China revenue was up 19% to last year in constant currency including nearly 40% growth in mainland China, driven by comp growth and new stores. We are taking a disciplined approach to our new store openings in China and closely monitoring macro trends. However, we are pleased with the performance of our new doors thus far as they are delivering above-average productivity and profitability.","Our digital business in China continues to expand following the launch of our directly operated digital commerce site last September. We also continue to see strong momentum in our distribution with pure play partners including Tmall, JD.com, and WeChat during the quarter with very positive brand exposure over single-stay. In Europe, we opened two new full-price stores and two net new factory stores in the third quarter. The new full-price stores in Leeds and Marseille are part of our broader ecosystem strategy in those markets.","Similar to China, we are actively monitoring the macro environment in Europe including the UK that will continue to take a cautious approach the store rollout in the region as we test and learn from each new opening. However, we are still significantly underpenetrated at brick-and-mortar retail with only 23 full-price stores across Europe, and we continue to see a meaningful, long-term opportunity to build out our ecosystem strategy in the region. Our expansion plans include two more openings in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year.","Moving on to our fourth key initiative, lead with digital. Our global digital business including our directly operated sites, departmentstore.com, pure players and social commerce was up 20% to last year in the third quarter in constant currency with strong performance across all regions. Our directly operated North America digital flagship continued on the positive growth trajectory as planned and delivered a 21% comp increase as we lap last year's transition to the cloud-based platform.","Our focus on strong brand building and enhanced consumer experience and higher quality of sales, all contributed to improve performance as we continue to reposition the site as our most important flagship. Our directly operated European digital commerce sites also showed strong improvement following the move to our new platform earlier this fiscal year. This business returned to growth in the third quarter as planned with a 13% comp. Enhancements to our European sites this quarter included the launch of shift from stores across Europe, enabling us to leverage our in-store inventories to service demand, customization services and our first fully localized Spanish digital commerce site.","Looking ahead, we expect to see more normalized positive growth in this channel as a result of improved brand building, consumer experience and functionality. We also continue to drive strong performance on pure play accounts across all regions of the third quarter. In the U.S. we expanded our presence on Stitch Fix with women's Polo and men\u2019s footwear and added 15 new digital pure play partners in Asia and Europe.","Finally, let me touch on our fifth key initiative operate with discipline to fuel growth. In the third quarter, we continue to challenge every cost and improve our efficiencies. This enabled us to continue ramping up our marketing investment and expand our global retail presence while increasing operating profit and expanding operating margin above our guidance. Adjusted operating expenses excluding marketing were slightly below top line growth in the quarter. Jane will provide more details on how were continuing to drive productivity.","So in closing, while we are mindful of ongoing market volatility, we are energized by our continued progress this quarter on our Next Great Chapter plan. Ralph and I along with our talented and committed teams around the world remain focused on things through to the timeless vision of our brand while evolving to meet the needs of consumers globally. While we are proud of the progress we're making, we will continue to relentlessly focus on excellent execution as we deliver on the commitments that we have made across every aspect of our business.","With that, I'll turn it over to Jane and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions.","Jane Nielsen","Thank you, Patrice and morning everyone. Our third quarter results demonstrate our teams continued disciplined execution of our strategy we delivered on key metrics including 9% AUR growth in retail, double-digit growth in digital commerce and growth and operating margin expansion, all while delivering both revenue and EPS growth. Importantly, we achieved these results in the context of navigating a more uncertain macro and geopolitical environments.","Third quarter revenue increased 5% on a reported basis and 6% in constant currently. Every region delivered top line growth led by strong 10% sales growth in both Europe and Asia on a reported basis and strong holiday season in North America. Adjusted gross margin expanded 90 point in the third quarter and 60 basis points in constant currency benefiting from reduced promotional activity and favorable product, geographic, and channel mix. Adjusted operating margin in the third quarter was 13.9%, up 70 basis points from last year on a reported basis and 50 points in constant currency. Adjusted operating profit dollars grew 11% to last year.","SG&A expense excluding marketing slightly leverage our strong top line growth. This quarter we made important proactive investment in our brand and our business. We increase our marketing spend by 18% to 4.2% of sale up from 3.8% last year. This marketing investment is overlapping the strong investments made in the second half of FY '18. Incremental investment centered on our holiday marketing campaign and limited edition collection.","In our digital business, we also made investments to strengthen our digital platform and capabilities. We continue to make progress toward our long-term objective of increasing marketing to about 5% of sale while also focusing on productivity to achieve our operating margin expansion goal. Our teams are intensely focused on driving operating efficiencies across our business.","For example in the third quarter our teams across the Company's work to our warehouse and office real estate footprint in North America, we completed the sale of our Beachwood distribution facility in North Carolina, reducing our footprint to two buildings from four buildings two years ago. This is an important step in our shared inventory strategy which went live this week, enabling us to reduce our overall inventory, maximize full-price selling, improve the CPU cost of our DTC fulfillment and lower overhead cost.","We are also significantly reducing our New York office footprint which includes our corporate office, and design studios. Over the next year, we will consolidate our footprint to four primary locations in the New York try state area, down from over a dozen locations two years ago. Following the move and 2020, we will reduce our square footage, cost per square foot and most importantly drive greater collaboration across our teams.","Moving to our segment performance, starting with North America, revenue was up 3% in the third quarter and adjusted operating margin was 22.6% representing a 20 basis point increase to last year's. In the retail channel in North America, we posted 4% comp growth in constant currency as brick-and-mortar comps were flat and our directly operated digital commerce business was up 21% as we anniversary the change of our own digital commerce sites last year's and saw strong double digit AUR increases during this holiday quarter.","We are also encouraged by strong performance across our total digital ecosystem including wholesale.com and pure play with double-digit growth in the quarter. We saw continued sequential improvement in our North America brick-and-mortar comp this year, driven by 7% AUR growth in the third quarter, which more than offset traffic headwinds.","Moving onto North America wholesale, third quarter was down 3% due to planned reductions in off-price sales. These reductions will continue through Q4. For the full year, we still expect to reduce our off-price penetration within our broader wholesale channel as we strategically reposition off-price back towards its original purpose as an excess inventory clearance vehicle. While we expect volatility in our full-price wholesale business on the quarter-by-quarter basis including the fourth quarter, our underlying trend is improving.","For fall 18, our Q3 sell out performance at wholesale improved on both of sequential basis and relative to the prior year. At the end of the quarter, based on our estimates, we believe our inventory at our full-price wholesale partners well-positioned and below prior-year levels. For full year FY '19, we continue to expect underlying revenue to be down low to mid single digits versus the mid to high single-digit declines last year. Our digital wholesale business continued to grow in the third quarter, delivering high single-digit growth to last year with continued share gains in core categories.","Moving on to Europe third quarter revenue was up 10% on a reported basis and 13% in constant currency. Adjusted operating margin expanded 100 basis points but were down 40 points in constant currency. SG&A leverage was more than offset by gross margin contraction to do the faster growth in wholesale shipment driven by timing shift from Q4 into Q3.","In the retail channel in Europe, comps were up 4% in constant currency, driven by 13% growth in digital commerce and a 3% increase in brick-and-mortar stores, compared to 4% comp decline in Q2. The sequential improvement in our brick-and-mortar trend was primarily driven by our investment to get back into inventory positions notably in outlet and improve the breadth and depth of our product assortment.","Comps in our directly operated European digital commerce business also continued to improve following our platform upgrade at the end of Q1. We saw strong quality of sales improvements, double-digit growth in AUR and a reduction in discount rate and are encouraged by the consumer response to our new platform. Across retail, our ongoing effort to improve quality of sales continued you AUR up 11% in the third quarter in Europe retail.","Wholesale revenue in Europe was up 20% in constant currency in the third quarter. Our third quarter growth benefited pull forward in the shipment timing which will negatively impacts the fourth quarter. Excluding timing shift, we now expect our reported growth to be mid-single digit range for full year fiscal 19, up from low to mid single-digit previously as we see the benefit from both distribution expansion and comp growth.","Turning to Asia, revenue was up 10% on a reported basis and 11% in constant currency in the third quarter. We saw strong performance across every market with positive growth across Japan, Korea, China and Australia. Growth was lead by Mainland China with constant currency revenue growth of almost 40%. Our product and marketing initiatives are resonating well in this region and we continued to increase our digital efforts engagement with local influencers and celebrities. Comps in Asia increased 4% in constant currency, driven by almost 10% AUR growth.","We expect continued comp growth in Asia as we invest in our distribution network and increase our marketing initiatives to amplify and elevate the brand. In the third quarter, adjusted operating profit grew 7% to last year, adjusted operating margin was down 30 basis points and down 10 basis points in constant currency, as gross margin improvements were more than half by increased marketing investments in the quarter. Excluding marketing, operating margin in the region would have expanded to last year.","Moving on to the balance sheet, our balance sheet is strong and we returned capital to shareholders, reflecting our continued operating progress. We ended the quarter with 2.1 billion in cash and investments and 687 million in total debt, which compared to 2.1 billion in cash and investments and 589 million in debt at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 18.","Consistent with our commitment to return cash to shareholders, we repurchased 208 million shares in the third quarter for a total of 400 million year-to-date. Including dividends and share repurchases, we returned a total of 542 million to shareholders this fiscal year-to-date, up from 122 million last year. We will continue to opportunistically buy back stock as a part of our plan to repurchase of billion dollars in shares through fiscal 20.","Moving onto inventory, at the end of the third quarter, inventory was up 11% to last year, moderating from a 15% increase in the second quarter. Similar to Q2, our inventory growth in the third quarter reflects strategic actions to support the following; one, earlier receipt of goods to maximize full-price selling; two, comp growth; three, new retail distribution; and four, getting back to normalize inventory in our Europe factory stores.","We are also utilizing significantly less airfreight this year in order to reduce shipment costs, which impact level of goods and transit. We remain comfortable with the health of our overall inventory at both retail and wholesale which continues to improve on year-over-year basis. Looking ahead, we expect to continue reducing inventories through the end of this fiscal year to be better aligned with our sales outlook.","Now, I'd like to turn to guidance for the full year and fourth quarter of fiscal 19. As a reminder, this guidance excludes restructuring and related charges. We are on track to deliver our goals for this year. We now expect revenues to be up slightly in constant currency for the full year fiscal 19. We expect a slight decline in North America and positive growth in our international businesses. Foreign currency is expected to have 80 to 90 basis points of negative impact on revenue growth in fiscal 19.","We now expect operating margin for fiscal 19 to be up 60 basis points in constant currency at the high end of our previous range of 40 to 60 basis points with minimal impact from foreign currency. This guidance reflects our solid performance in the first three quarters of the year and our view on underlying trends as we execute the Next Great Chapter plan. It also incorporates our plan to better align inventory levels to our scales growth outlook.","For the fourth quarter of fiscal 19, we expect revenues to be down slightly in constant currency with growth in North America retail and our international businesses offset by a planned reductions in North America off-price sale. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by about 300 basis points in the quarter. We continue to see several timing related headwinds to revenue growth in the quarter including a shift in European wholesale shipments from Q4 into Q3, and our strategic reduction in off-price sales, which is heavily weighted toward the fourth quarter of this year.","The time of Easter also negatively impacts our North America retail comps by about three points in the fourth quarter benefiting Q1 of next year. Operating margin for the fourth quarter is expected to be up about 70 points to last year in constant currency. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact operating margin by about 60 basis points in the quarter. We now expect capital expenditures of approximately 250 million in fiscal 19. Below our previous guidance of 275 million due to timing shifts into fiscal 20, our estimated effective tax rate for fiscal 19 is changed to 21%. Our fourth quarter effective tax rate is estimated to be 16% to 17%.","Finally, over the past several months, we have seen increased volatility in the market from macroeconomic and geopolitical events, and we continue to monitor the trade environment closely. While we\u2019re not immune to pressure in the broader environment, our teams are prepared for multiple scenarios importantly across the Company we have clarity of purpose under Ralph's unifying brand vision, focused strategic with aligned operational and financial goals, and the passion and commitment of our team around the world.","We are delivering on our plan and will continue to drive executing that finds the balance between addressing short-term pressures while managing for the long term. As we look forward to fiscal 20, we remain confident in the full year outlook we presented at our investor day in June. This concludes positive top line growth in constant currency along with operating profit growth and margin expansion for the full year. We plan to provide more details on fiscal 20 guidance when we report our fiscal year end results in May.","With that, let\u2019s open up the call for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Matthew Boss with JP Morgan. You may ask your question.","Matthew Boss","Your 3Q print exceeded expectations in holiday season with clear winners and losers across retail. I guess Patrice, as you reflect on the quarter, what factors do you think helped deliver the outperformance? And then Jane, on the expense front, I guess maybe how best to think about the core leverage that you're seeing versus strategic marketing investment as we think going forward?","Patrice Louvet","Listen, first of all, Ralph and I are really proud that our team has been consistently executing across all our sites of our new Next Great Chapter strategy. As we look at obviously quarter-to-quarter, there are some areas of businesses that are worth better that others, and we're clearly dealing with some level of volatility in the marketplace. But I have to say, we\u2019re really pleased with the progress that we made across several areas of this business this quarter.","There are three things I would call out that enabled us to actually come ahead of where we expected for Q3. The first one is AUR. They were better than we expected across actually all regions and all channels. And this is really the result of continued focus we\u2019re putting on elevating the brand through improved marketing, improve engagement with our consumers, improve products and then the continuing efforts that we have on promotional pullback.","We\u2019re able to drive high single digit, right. You've heard Jane talk about we were up 9% this quarter despite what we view as a more promotional environment this past holiday. Well, first driver AUR, second driver is digital momentum. Our digital momentum clearly accelerated across all of our digital sectors whether that's our own digital commerce site, wholesale.com or the digital pure players. Our overall digital ecosystem revenues this past were up 20%.","One of the important factors that was an enabler for this was our transition to the new platform, you'll recall, last year, we moved North America to a new platform for our website and then Europe more recently. And this is really allowing us to provide better storytelling, better brand building, combined with better functionality and consumer experience and we seen that play out in the result.","The third factor is Asia, right. I know there is lot of question marks what\u2019s happening in China and Asia in general, but our momentum continued in Asia. You've heard Jane talked about, we grew up 11% constant currency in total Asia, 4% comps led by greater China of 19%, led by Mainland China of close to 40%, but also continued strong performance from our more established markets Japan, Korea, and Australia. So, those are really the three key factors that enabled us to perform ahead of where we expected for the quarter. I will turn it over to Jane on\u2026","Jane Nielsen","Sure. On SG&A, Matt, in general our Q3 SG&A expenses were generally in line with our plan. But we had top line momentum that enabled us to proactively reinvest in the business. Meaningfully in marketing, where you saw our marketing increased 18% this quarter. And recall that's not half of a 27% increase that we did in Q3 last year.","As I look forward to Q4, I don't expect that level of year-on-year marketing increases in the fourth quarter. We significantly increased our marketing over 15%. So that will be a dynamic change as you look going through into the fourth quarter. But consistent with our strategic growth initiatives, we made some proactive investments in the faster growing areas of our business.","You heard Patrice talk about our 39 new stores that we opened and we made some important investments in digital. And this quarter we proactively worked to strengthen our digital capabilities including faster delivery times notably to the West Coast. Our test in L.A. shows that those are proving out and driving consumer demand.","We also invested to make sure that we have 24\/7 customer support capability. So those were notable in this quarter. I think you're asking a broader question in terms of, how are we looking at both short and long-term expense reductions? And what we called out this quarter, the reduction in our DC footprint is going to be an important -- and the inventory consolidation we're doing is going to be important part of our productivity as we move forward. We expect that to start to pay dividends as we look forward to FY '20.","And we're also continuing the work that we're doing in indirect expenses. We're really systematically as we've done this year which helped us produce SG&A leverage, if you exclude marketing, we're really driving into every cost challenging every vendor contract looking for scale benefits, consolidation benefits and we do see that pay dividends as we move forward. So we continue to be as we confirmed our long-term guidance for '20 we continue to be optimistic, also opportunistic to believe that as we return to growth, you will SG&A leverage.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question.","Michael Binetti","Jane, I guess, a couple of questions to help me unpack here further. As we look ahead the composition of revenues in the model here is going to be changing a little bit next year as you have the majority of this off-price pullback strategy done for example? AUR has been a big, big line item in the revenue growth line for a couple of years on the quality of sales work. Next year it seems like a couple of things will be a lot more on a like-for-like basis. How do you think -- how much do you think AUR should contribute here as the quality-of-sales initiatives may be slow? And what do you need from units or traffic to drive that low to mid single-digit growth you talked about on revenues?","Jane Nielsen","Yes. Well Michael, it's a great question, because one of the tenets of our strategic plan is that AUR growth is a driver of our top line growth through our long-term plan. So I see lots of opportunity for us to drive what we guided to which was low to mid single-digit AUR growth. And the reason I have confidence in that is the drivers that we've seen over the last 2.5 years are relatively consistent. We've been able to drive AUR growth through a mix of some modest like-for-like pricing. We've been able to reduce discounts and we see that we have more opportunities there. And we've been able to mix into higher AUR and higher gross margin product.","Those -- and the shift of our business international where we have higher AUR is also a tailwind benefit to AUR. So I'm very encouraged. I feel that AUR is what over delivered this quarter, but it's going to be durable as we move through our plan. The cutback in off-price does help us from an AUR perspective. It is that the -- AUR, it tends to be lower there. It tends -- we tend to move through more units there. So pulling back there is completely consistent with our plan of rising AUR fewer units which I think is also consistent with the elevation of the plan.","Operator","The next question comes from Alexandra Walvis with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.","Alexandra Walvis","We had a question around the North America wholesale business. So outside of that off-price pullback it seems like the North America wholesale business was very strong. I wonder if you could dive a little bit more into the drivers of that? And then on the off-price rationalization, I wonder if you can help us out with how fast with that process you think that we are today? And how much longer we should expect that to go on and the pieces of that business in particular that are being reduced? Thank you.","Jane Nielsen","Yes. So, Alexandra, in terms of what we saw in our wholesale trends, we really saw strength in the third quarter in some of our core categories notably in men's and notably in Polo. We saw good -- we saw benefits from reduced promotionality and accordingly better -- a reduction in our vendor allowances and natural margin increases. Those were really what we saw as core strengths in our North America wholesale business. Also our departmentstore.com business as we called out was particularly strong where we gained share again in key categories and saw strong high single-digit growth.","We're also starting to overlap some of the significant door pullbacks that we made during our reset, and so we're seeing that play through. As I think about off-price pullback, it's significant in this second half as we've been calling out for a while. Our strategic goal, so as you think about it going forward is to really reduce the penetration of off-price to our total wholesale business. So I don't expect the pressure from off-price pullback to be as significant in FY '20 as it was in this year. But I do expect -- I don't expect it to be a leverage point as we reduce the percentage of penetration to our business.","Operator","The next question comes from John Kernan with Cowen. You may ask your question.","John Kernan","Patrice going back to the 2000 -- to the Investor Day last year, the $500 million in incremental digital sales you certainly showed a lot of momentum this quarter particularly in North America with digital up 21%. Can you talk about some of the drivers going into next year in digital as you've repositioned the entire platform and how we should think about that going forward?","Patrice Louvet","Yes. So as we kind of feel the -- and what drove the acceleration this past quarter and what's durable to use Jane's terminology which I like, it's really three factors. One is the work we're doing on brand building. And if you look at past quarter we did a lot around our 50th gift campaign, we obviously had our special limited editions whether that's Winter Stadium or the Palace program. So the brand building piece of the storytelling piece enhanced by the platform upgrade that we have will continue. We really -- continuously raised the bar on that particularly in the way that really connects with Gen Z consumers and Millennials.","The second part is the consumer experience on our site. And we know we have a lot of opportunity to strengthen it. There's been good progress on functionality over the past quarter ranging from free shipping progress bar to monogramming services to a dedicated Polo shirt shopping experience. And then some of the technical elements of faster downloads of our pages, quicker delivery to consumers homes and so on. So we're going to continue raise the bar on consumer experience and functionality.","And then finally as all the work we continue to do on quality of sales which was obviously a big enabler for AUR here, which continues to be an area of focus and I think will be for as long as we're in business. So for next 50 years which is an important part of the block, so that's our own fight, right, which is really we think of our own digital flagship which then needs to set the stone for how the brand shows up on other digital platforms. If you look at then the other platform, obviously there's wholesale.com, Jane touched on that in previous question where we're seeing good momentum, we have really good partnerships with our -- the key wholesale players. We will continue to build on that momentum where we can really connect well with the target consumers that shop there.","Then there is pure play -- digital pure players. Right, around the world and we continue to build our stable, a select pure players that we partner with. For example we've spent on Stitch Fix with Polo women this past quarter in the U.S. and we continue to see good progress in Asia, in Europe with some of the key players there and obviously expanding our presence here in North America. So I think if anything -- that's going to accelerate.","And then the final one is social commerce, right. The ability to shop through WeChat, the ability to shop through Instagram and so on and so forth which today is still relatively small on the -- if you look at total picture, but we expect that to accelerate significantly because the consumer benefit the ease-of-use there is just very compelling for our consumer target. So I think as we look at the key elements of our strategy, what we've been executing and what we need to execute moving forward we have confidence that we can continue to stay on this track of accelerated growth with digital commerce so that we can reach to $0.5 billion that we called out for the full five-year period.","Jane Nielsen","Yes. John just as Patrice mentioned, we're really happy with the underlying momentum we see in our digital commerce site. In North America, I'll just recall this is the quarter that we overlapped that site conversion. So from a trajectory run rate perspective it's somewhat anomalous. But we feel really good about the factors that Patrice noted and the momentum it suggests for our e-commerce business.","Patrice Louvet","And then maybe one additional element which we actually didn't touch on, which is our new mobile app, particularly as we think we're bringing in new consumers, younger consumers into the brand. We launched our mobile app little less than two quarters ago. Half of the consumers coming through the app are actually Gen Z or Millennials. We are seeing very strong engagement rates. We are seeing fantastic sell-through of our special editions there. I encourage all of you to sign up if you haven't yet, but that's also an important asset that we have in our digital commerce toolbox that is just at the very early stages. So I think also a very promising potential there.","Operator","The next question comes from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.","Paul Trussell","I just wanted to touch base on your international performance. As you are well aware a lot of global macro concerns over the last few months, and while the European business did have some timing elements to it, it really outperformed, certainly versus my expectations. And you also already have mentioned Asia a few times. Maybe just give a little bit more color about what you feel is driving those top line results outside of the Americas?","Patrice Louvet","Yes. So maybe let's start the tour in Europe, where we did as -- overall delivered strong performance in Europe. We're obviously keeping a close eye on the various developments there, whether that's the uncertainty around Brexit whether those are the demonstrations going on in Paris, those at this point has not had an impact on our business. We are actually feeling good about our performance in Q3 and what we are able to do moving forward.","What's important to note Paul on this is for Europe, as we're still quite underdeveloped from a retail presence standpoint right, we have 23 stores. I think a year ago when we talked on this call we had 19. So now we're moving, we are starting to open stores and build our digital ecosystem so that we have a compelling ecosystem in key cities there. So relative to our competitors, we're incredibly underdeveloped and then we believe we still we have significant growth opportunities even in the challenging context. So we're being careful, we're monitoring the environment, but we are confident we have a number of growth factors for us in the future. In Europe, particularly in markets like Germany and Southern Europe which is where the underdevelopment is greater.","As far as Asia is concerned what's exciting for us across Asia is the broad-based growth, right. While of course China is doing well and we have significant opportunities there, we're seeing continued performance from our current key market in Asia which is Japan. We're seeing accelerated performance as the team applies the Japan formula to South Korea in South Korea and also in Australia. So it's broad-based. It's built on strong fundamentals.","And so I would say, I think similar to Europe, there are a lot of question marks around China and a potential slowdown in China. We have not seen that on our business in Q3. And again we are our highly underdeveloped in China. Chinese consumer domestic sales and traveling -- travel sales are about 5% of our total business. So when you compare that to a number of our peers that are more in the 25%, 30%, 40% penetration, you can see the upside that we have on this business.","And we -- while it's very early days, we're encouraged by the response we're getting both from a consumer standpoint there, the response we're seeing in how our Polo boutiques are performing, the response we're seeing as we work with various partners the Tmall Luxury Pavilion, JD Toplife and so on and so forth and that's pays WeChat more recently Golf society. So we're feeling encouraged that we've got the right elements and the right strategy to deliver growth in -- across Asia and therefore across international with what I mentioned for Europe.","Jane Nielsen","I would just add Paul that we were really pleased in Europe, with the investments that we made in inventory in outlet paid off not only to return us to positive comp growth in our outlet business, but at a meaningful AUR increase. So the -- our strategy to restore into higher AUR products paid off. It paid off on the top line. It also flowed through with a nice pick up in our AUR in Europe. We expected the timing shift in our wholesale business in Europe. We knew that because we are aligning our calendars that Q3 was going to be quite strong. We called that out last quarter, but really pleased with the outlet performance that we saw in Europe.","Operator","The next question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore. You may ask your question.","Omar Saad","Jane I wanted you to see if you could elaborate on -- you mentioned the share inventory going live. I remember in the past you've talked about a test in L.A. marketplace test retailing in wholesale and retail -- on retail kind of the inventories to drive quicker replenishment, more articulated products and inventory planning. Could you elaborate on what you're working on there and what you see as the opportunity, that you kind of integrate omni-channel capabilities into the business? Thanks.","Jane Nielsen","Sure. What we're seeing from our initiatives on shared inventory, right now, we're in the first phase of that which is the combination of our store, our ROS store inventory and our e-commerce inventory is a few benefits. One, it reduces inventory buffers. Two, it allows us to direct our inventory to the demand that has the highest selling price. So it's -- better full price selling, less inventory. It also speeds stick-times in our warehouse and reduces our need for warehouse footprint, which reduces our overhead costs.","So lots of benefits there from a shared inventory. And we are working on the next phase which could be even greater inventory sharing across our channels which should also generate the same kind of benefits from an inventory full price sellout and cost reduction. We're very encouraged by the teams. We're working very hard on it and it went live this quarter. So more to come there and I'm sure that that will give us even more opportunities as we look forward on allocations and store close as well.","Patrice Louvet","And then, yes, on the Los Angeles ecosystem project, so we're about a little more than six months in. The headline for -- my message Omar actually is L.A. is outperforming the North America region. So still early days in this pilot, but actually we're very pleased with the way the results are coming in. What we are seeing is shared gains across the market. What we are seeing is an acceleration of our digital commerce business actually very strong acceleration there.","And then what we're also seeing which is quite positive is that we're attracting new younger consumers through the franchise. So this elevation of the brand presence across all the touch points whether that's wholesale or own stores, full price or factory, and then the emphasis we are putting on digital with some localized messaging at this point is really paying off. L.A. is a huge region, so we really want to take advantage of the upside opportunities that we have there. But the headline point at this stage is delivering well ahead of the nation.","Operator","The next question comes from Jay Sole with UBS. You may ask your question.","Jay Sole","Patrice, I wanted to ask you about your comments around winning over new generation. You gave a lot of great stats about how your initiatives have created a lot of impressions and a lot of buzz with Generation Z and Millennials. Just share with some of your plans to kind of keep that momentum going into Q4. The kind of things you have planned and if you can talk about how you're converting some of that initial interest that you're getting from younger people into that repeat purchase that you talked about? Thank you.","Patrice Louvet","Sure. So here is how we think about the strategy for winning over new generation. We've got four specific areas. One, is we want to be where the consumer group is consuming media right. So you -- you've seen over time how we're shifting our marketing to much more digital, much more social and that's where the majority of our spending is going now. All right so being where they consume media, the second is being where that consumer group is shopping and purchasing, which is the shift you're seeing that we're making toward digital commerce because we know they are disproportionately tough in that space.","And the development of our app, as I mentioned earlier, we're seeing through the app, much younger consumer coming into the brand. The third area, so those two are -- continue. The third area is how we leverage influencers that really connect with that target audience. Right, so just as an illustration, we talked about our latest Romance re-launch and the face of that fragrance is Taylor Hill who really appeals to the younger population incredibly effectively, and that's just an illustration of how we're thinking about building this mosaic of influencers that can represent all the dimensions of the brand and also connect nicely in the local markets with the target audience that we're going after.","And then, the fourth one are these Limited Edition and drops, which we will continue to do. Obviously we'll keep an eye on it to surprise as part of the success is to surprise on that that comes with it. We're also very careful not to overdo it, because otherwise these things will run out of steam. We've been very intentional on how we paste it. But if you look at the results we've got behind Palace, 75% of the consumers who bought Palace were new to the Ralph Lauren brand. On average consumers who bought Palace were 10 years younger than the average consumer for Ralph Lauren. And we're also seeing that on Winter Stadium and others.","And to your point and then on retention, one of the interesting and encouraging data points for us is if you look at the purchases of our drops, consumers who bought Winter Stadium, actually half of them had already brought a drop, a prior drop, right which gives us confidence that as we bring in consumers through these special activities, we're then able to keep a majority of them moving forward. So that's the broad framework that we have in place. We feel good about the progress we're making around that. And we're doing that while not forgetting our core, because our core consumers are also important part of the business. And so our job is to successfully appeal to this new group of consumer, while also delivering what our current consumers are looking for.","Operator","Thank you. The final question comes from Rick Patel with Needham & Company. You may ask your question.","Rick Patel","I'll add, my congrats as well and thank you for squeezing me in here. Can you update us tour sales in the U.S. given the strong U.S. dollar? I'm curious if there was a change in trend versus last quarter and to what extent you think that helped fuel your performance in Greater China? And my second question is around department store refreshes. I believe you had about 80 or so of these refreshes last year and had planned to do more this year. Any updates on where you are with those and any call outs in terms of performance going forward?","Jane Nielsen","Sure. Hi Rick. So for tourism based on the data that we collect we saw foreign tourist traffic in our doors was up about 2% in the quarter. You'll recall that in Q2 it was down about 2% and in Q1 it was flattish. So we're seeing this sort of flattish to down slightly, up slightly trends, in the U.S. In Europe we saw that our foreign tourist traffic was up about 3%. That was off a down 21% you recall in Q2. Again this is our data, with the overall composition remain in terms of foreign tourist from other countries remaining about consistent as we've looked from quarter-to-quarter.","Patrice Louvet","And then on the door refreshes we're continuing that because we're very pleased with the results we've gotten so far behind the doors that we have upgraded. And I quoted earlier some of the progress we're seeing in Los Angeles which is obviously a key part of that. So we did 81 refreshes in fiscal '18, with just sales they were up double-digit, so this pay up -- paid up because actually the investment we're making is not that significant. A lot of it is improved lighting, improved layouts, fresher paint of code, better signage, better visuals but good returns on that.","We've completed 103 refreshes in the first half of fiscal '19, and we plan to do a total about 150 this fiscal year, and continuing to do that to effect, over time we want to effect at least 50% of our total business, on the way the 75%, we're doing that in close partnership with our key wholesale partners including the largest one, and they've completed the first 50 and now they are onto the next 100. We're working that hand-in-hand with them. So encouraged by the progress, it continues to be a focus area as we want to elevate our brand as possible in a single touch point.","All right Rick, well thank you. Thanks for all of you for joining the call today. As I hope you took away from this conversation in our press release we're encouraged by our progress and our results as we continue to elevate the iconic business Ralph as built with teams over the past 50 years. And as we continue to strengthen our connection to consumers around the world, and we look forward to sharing our fiscal year-end results in our fiscal year '20 guidance with you on the next call.","So thanks for calling in and talk to you soon.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"17759":["Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL) Q3 2012 Earnings Call February  8, 2012  9:00 AM ET","Executives","James Hurley - Director of Investor Relations","Roger N.

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Now for opening remarks and introductions, I will turn the conference over to Mr. James Hurley. Please go ahead, sir.","James Hurley","Good morning, and thank you for joining us on Ralph Lauren's Third Quarter Fiscal 2012 Conference Call. The agenda for today's call includes Roger Farah, our President and Chief Operating Officer, who will comment on our broader strategic initiatives; Jacki Nemerov, our Executive Vice President, will provide some product commentary; and Tracey Travis, our Chief Financial Officer, will provide operational and financial highlights from the third quarter, in addition to reviewing our expectations for fiscal 2012. After that, we will open the call up for your questions, which we please ask that you limit to one per caller.","During today's call, we will be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including our financial outlook. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees, and our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Our expectations also contain many risks and uncertainties. The principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from our current expectations are detailed in our SEC filings.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to Roger.","Roger N. Farah","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. We're reporting strong, better-than-expected third quarter and year-to-date results today. Our performance was supported by sustained focus on our global brand-elevation efforts and our strategic merchandise initiatives. Around the world, customers clearly recognize Ralph Lauren for its extraordinary cachet, quality and craftsmanship. We achieved double-digit revenue growth in all key geographies in the quarter and year-to-date. We also delivered excellent profit flow-through despite unprecedented cost of goods inflation and considerable economic turmoil in Europe and a holiday season that was promotional for apparel.","Worldwide revenue growth was well balanced across core apparel offerings. Emerging categories such as handbags, Denim & Supply and dresses were also important contributors to our growth. Our sales and profit plans for the holiday and fall seasons were aggressive to begin with, so to have exceeded those goals is a real testament to the vitality of the Ralph Lauren brand, the strength of our products and the operational discipline of our global teams. ","Our continued focus on our key growth initiatives, which include: Expanding our international presence, extending our direct-to-customer reach and new merchandising innovations have resulted in a more profitable mix of business compared to the prior year. ","Year-to-date, our international revenues have increased approximately 40%, more than the mid-teens expansion in our U.S. sales. We continue to make important investments in our long-term growth aspirations in Europe, such as e-commerce and several new stores of our own or our licensing partners. Our new merchandising introductions include the expansion of Lauren apparel, the launch of handbags, footwear and Club Monaco, all of which have been well received throughout the continent. And despite considerable near-term headwinds in Europe, we believe we are poised for meaningful growth over the next several years.","We also achieved great progress throughout Asia in the first 9 months of the year. Our teams are actively engaged in brand elevation and repositioning efforts across our major territories of Japan, South Korea and Greater China. They are successfully managing day-to-day responsibilities in these highly dynamic markets, while simultaneously planning for promising future. ","Sales trends throughout Asia continue to be very good for us in the third quarter, including double-digit comp growth in Japan, where we're benefiting from the successful implementation of more robust merchandising and planning disciplines that are yielding better-than-expected sales on a more profitable platform.","We are applying many of the same disciplines as we integrate South Korea, where we are already working off a substantial distribution network. South Korea is one of the world's most important luxury markets, not only for its strong local customer demand but also a major shopping destination for Chinese tourists.","As we turn to China, we're well in the process of resetting our distribution throughout the country, an initiative that will result in the closure of approximately 95 points of distribution or about 60% of the network we had in place at the beginning of this fiscal year. This is clearly a bold move, but one we absolutely believe is critical. We are taking accelerated action in order to build the strongest foundation possible to serve the world's most important luxury customers. This means we're taking some short-term hits, shrinking an already modest retail size in terms of revenue, while bearing an expense structure to support our long-term growth expectations. We are actively looking for new stores but will be deliberate in the pace of openings, because locations we want are among the most desirable in the world. But it's not a question of \"if\" for us in China, it's a matter of \"when,\" and we're allocating resources accordingly. ","In aggregate, our international operations gained 400 basis points of share in our overall revenue mix for the year-to-date. And while we are making progress diversifying our geographic mix of business, there is no question that our large U.S. operations have performed extraordinarily well. ","Sales from both our U.S. wholesale and retail segments expanded as a double-digit rate during the third quarter. Solid comp growth at our domestic stores, coupled with our wholesale momentum, clearly suggests we're gaining meaningful market share. We're growing these more traditional channels of distribution, even as customers are spending more of their discretionary dollars online. ","It is clear that e-commerce has become an increasingly preferred channel for many of our customers. And while we were pioneers in selling luxury products online, we remain committed to investing in this high-growth distribution channel and branding vehicle. As many of you know, RalphLauren.com has maintained strong double-digit growth over the last several years. Sales rose 30% during the third quarter, and traffic to the site continues to accelerate.","We recently launched e-commerce in several European countries, and while sales are still modest in scale, we are gaining excellent traction. Club Monaco will also launch e-commerce this spring in the United States and Canada. ","Our commitment to e-commerce is not limited to launching sites, it requires constant investment in technology and content to remain relevant and to involve and enrich the customer experience. We are already investing in exciting online content from interactive fashion shows to videos, style guides and even a magazine. We also create custom environments to showcase certain brands such as Collection, Purple Label, Denim & Supply, RLX or RRL. ","During the third quarter, mobile phones and tablets accounted for 20% of the traffic to RalphLauren.com and nearly 10% of the sales. These numbers are not only substantial, but they are also achieved in remarkably short period of time. We are focused on making the right investments to assure our brand experience is optimized for these important customers, who also tend to have a higher average transaction size and shop with us more frequently. ","We've achieved a lot in the first 9 months, and we feel good about the decisions we made to manage the unprecedented cost of goods inflation and the considerable macroeconomic challenges, while sustaining our investment in our long-term growth objectives. For those of you who have been following our company for a while, you know that we spent the better part of the last 10 years thoughtfully taking direct control of strategically important merchandise categories and geographies and working to develop a meaningful retail business. We've consistently made outsized investments in the near-term, with an expectation that we would achieve greater functional and financial leverage, as these high-growth merchandise categories, channels and regions evolve into the future.","Our year-to-day results reflect -- are reflective of the progress that we have made, executing our strategies in a fiscally prudent way. In the last few years, our decisions to directly operate Asia and add additional key product categories will fuel profitable growth for the next 5 to 10 years. ","Despite whatever near-term external challenges that might arise, it's important to remember that this is a long-term strategy for us. We have very clear objectives, and we invest in and manage the business for sustainable growth. We have an incredibly diverse operating model that not only supported our strong growth over the last 10 years, but has also proven to be remarkably resilient. In addition, we have tangible multidimensional growth objectives across geographies, merchandise categories and channels, and we're nurturing these initiatives with the appropriate capital investment and the best talent in the industry. ","And with that, I'd like Jacki to provide some insight into our product and merchandising strategies.","Jackwyn L. Nemerov","Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. As you heard earlier, our strong third quarter and year-to-date performance was a function of broad-based momentum across several of our core and emerging merchandise categories. As the Ralph Lauren brand continues to captivate more and more consumers around the world, we are simultaneously driving substantial market share and productivity gains with our existing customers. ","Design-driven product innovation results in highly desirable merchandise that is equal part iconic and novel, which has always been an appealing combination for the Ralph Lauren customer. We showcase these wonderful products with focused merchandising initiatives, so when the customer sees the products in our dedicated best-in-class shop environment, the message comes to life in a uniquely powerful way.","We had excellent fall and holiday seasons, as evidenced by the double-digit revenue gains across channels and regions. Our core gift strategies were presented across all key merchandise categories, and the customer responded with enthusiasm. ","The performance of our men's and Childrenswear merchandise was particularly strong, which was consistent with the trend we experienced throughout the year. These are categories where we enjoyed powerful leadership positions, and yet, are still gaining market share, even in the most developed markets. The multigenerational appeal of our men's product and the broad reach of our children's product from layette to infant and toddler to boys and girls continue to provide opportunities for these well-developed categories.","We also experienced solid women's trends during the quarter. The esthetic of our Blue Label line resonated globally and was particularly strong in international markets. We continue to evolve our Lauren assortments to address the ever-changing needs of the modern woman. Our well-developed core Sportswear is now complemented with strong denim, active and dress assortments. ","Club Monaco, it's distinctive contemporary sensibility resonates strongly with both new and existing female customers, and we're excited to be growing that brand on a more global platform over the next few years.","We continue to pursue new opportunities to participate in emerging merchandise categories. Our Ralph Lauren handbag and small leather good lines allow us to leverage the sensibility of our runway presentation in this high-interest category that the customer shops more frequently. This spring's Ralph Lauren handbag collections are amongst the most exciting and well-reviewed we've ever had. Soft silhouettes, light materials and bright colors had been particularly popular and add seasonal interest to our core iconic styles. ","We are also expanding the international distribution of our Polo and Lauren leather goods to capitalize on enthusiastic customer response to these products. This is due to the design of the product and the productivity we are generating in existing locations. As our assortments and distribution grow across all channels, we are buying and selling in greater depths and establishing our brand as a strong presence in this high-growth category.","The global introduction of Denim & Supply, which we executed in the second quarter, was a considerable achievement for us. We installed hundreds of shops around the world, with an eye to expressing a clear and powerful brand statement, whether in Macy's in the United States, Selfridges in London or at freestanding stores in Amsterdam and Hong Kong. The customer response has been encouraging, and we are particularly pleased with the balanced sales mix between men's and women's. ","This high-frequency fashion-centric customer is gravitating to the most novel and aspirational relevance in the assortment, which confirms our belief that the more deconstructive Bohemian aspect of the Ralph Lauren brand esthetic is meaningful to this younger customer. Performance at freestanding store locations has been particularly strong and believe we have an opportunity to open many more of them.","While there is no question that the design of our product is the foundation of our success, credit is also due to the clearly defined brand standards and the extremely disciplined approach to execution that define the Ralph Lauren organization. The increased control we've assumed over strategically important regions and merchandise categories over the last several years has enabled us to leverage cross-functional collaboration in a more impactful and efficient way. It has also supported our financial performance, particularly as we've navigated through substantial cost of goods inflation in the last 12 months.","As you know, we were thoughtful about how we responded to these unprecedented increases in raw material costs, primarily for cotton, but also for a host of other important materials such as cashmere wool, silk, leather and exotic skins. We always believed a portion of the inflationary pressure we were experiencing for cotton was due to short-term supply and demand imbalances. We were also very mindful of how any decision we made, as a function of near-term dynamics, might impact our long-standing relationships and the trust we have earned with our customers. ","We were not willing to compromise the quality and consistency of the make of our products, nor were we willing to risk disruption to our meticulously planned logistics and product flow. We ultimately made select and strategic pricing adjustments in the fall that we believe maintained an excellent value proposition for our customers. And while we did experience margin compression as a result of our action, we do expect to begin to see some relief with our fall '12 shipments.","As we reflect on the last year, we believe we made the right decisions and that we've gained meaningful long-lasting market share as a result. ","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tracey.","Tracey Thomas Travis","Thank you, Jacki, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen in this morning's press release, our third quarter and year-to-date performance reflects strong top line momentum, which has driven better-than-expected results. We've managed through extraordinary cost of goods inflation in a thoughtful manner, and we've achieved leverage in our operating expenses, even as we continue to fund our growth objectives throughout the year. ","In the third quarter, consolidated net revenues were $1.8 billion, a 17% increase from the prior year period, with double-digit growth in both our wholesale and retail segments. The increase in revenues was better than our low-teens expectation for the quarter, with outperformance in both our retail and wholesale segments. ","Across channels, revenue growth was supported by strong gains in our men's and children's apparel, as Jacki indicated. We also benefited from the incremental contribution of certain formally licensed operations, such as South Korea and home textile, which collectively contributed to our reported revenue growth by approximately 5%. ","The net impact of foreign currency translation was negligible for the third quarter. The gross profit rate of 57.1% in the third quarter was 150 basis points below prior year, which was essentially in line with our expectations, and reflects the full impact of the peak cost of goods inflation we experienced for the fall and holiday seasons. This gross margin pressure was partially mitigated by selective price increases, greater retail segment penetration, which is largely driven by our growing international retail network and accelerated e-commerce growth.","Operating expenses of $761 million were 15% above prior year. And we achieved approximately 50 basis points of operating expense leverage in the third quarter, which was meaningfully better than the deleverage we had initially anticipated. The increase in operating expense dollars, primarily reflects overall business expansion, including strong retail segment growth and the incremental rent, depreciation and labor that are incurred as a result of it. It also includes incremental costs associated with the transition of our formally licensed South Korea and home textile operations. The leverage we realized was mostly a result of our better-than-expected revenue growth, in addition to a shift in timing of certain corporate expenses into the fourth quarter.","Our operating income of $270 million was 10% above the prior year period, generating an operating margin of 15%, which was 90 basis points below prior year. The decline in our operating margin was principally due to gross margin compression from cost of goods inflation and was partially offset by operating expense leverage in the quarter. ","Our net income of $169 million for the third quarter was relatively flat to the prior year period, as the increase in operating income I just discussed was offset by a higher effective tax rate of 36% this year compared to 29% last year as we anniversaried the favorable resolution of discrete tax items in last year's quarter. The 3% increase in net income per diluted share to $1.78 in the third quarter was a function of lower average diluted shares outstanding.","Moving on to segment highlights for the quarter. Our wholesale sales rose 11% to $750 million, a result of double-digit growth in both the United States and in Europe. Continued momentum in men's and children's apparel worldwide was accentuated by the contribution from newer merchandise categories such as Denim & Supply and Home in the U.S. and the expansion of wholesale distribution for accessories, specifically handbags and footwear and Lauren apparel products in Europe. Strength in the department store channel globally, offset continued softness in select specialty store markets.","Third quarter wholesale operating income of $116 million was 11% below the prior year and the wholesale operating margin declined 390 basis points to 15.4%. The declines in wholesale operating income and operating margin rate are primarily due to the cost of goods inflation and the impact of new and emerging merchandise categories, such as home textiles and Denim & Supply. We continue to make excellent progress with extending our direct-to-customer reach, as our retail segment sales increased 22% to a record $1 billion in the third quarter. We achieved double-digit comparable store sales growth in all major geographic regions, and this momentum was further enhanced by the contribution from our newly opened stores, as well as incremental sales from our newly assumed South Korea shop locations. ","Our overall comp store sales rose 12% during the quarter, reflecting a 31% increase at RalphLauren.com, 7% growth at Ralph Lauren stores, 9% expansion at our global factory stores and 17% growth at Club Monaco stores. ","As you are all aware, the weather was unseasonably warm in both the U.S. in Europe for much of the quarter, which affected sales at most of our retail formats in October and November. Consumers also shopped later in the season this year, taking advantage of what was a highly promotional environment in the U.S. and certain European countries. Traffic and transactions improved in December and were ultimately positive for the quarter for most formats. Traffic trends continue to be most challenging at our U.S. and European Ralph Lauren stores, where we also experienced a stark deceleration in tourist sales relative to the first half of the year. Growth in Asia continued to be strong, as were sales at our factory stores worldwide.","Club Monaco continues to benefit from well-balanced, trend-right women's fashion assortments, which drove large improvements in their conversion, as well as units per transaction. And RalphLauren.com's 31% comp continues to lead all channel growth, with men's, children's and Denim & Supply among the top performing merchandise categories during the quarter. ","We opened 7 directly operated freestanding stores and closed 3 directly operated freestanding stores during the quarter, ending the period with 378 company-operated stores. We also operated 508 concession shop locations worldwide at the end of the third quarter.","Retail segment operating income grew 27% to $194 million in the third quarter, and the retail operating margin increased 70 basis points to 19.3%, which is a new peak level of retail segment profitability for the third quarter period. Our considerable improvement in retail operating income and the expansion in margin rate were achieved on top of exceptional gains in the prior year period and our result of strong comparable sales growth, as well as improved profitability in our international markets. The growth in retail segment profitability was partially offset by cost of goods inflation and continued investment in international e-commerce development. ","Licensing royalties of $50 million in the third quarter were 1% below the prior year. Lower international and home product licensing revenues, as a result of their transition to directly controlled operations this year, more than offset higher domestic apparel product licensing and global fragrance royalties. However, operating income for our licensing segment increased 7% to $32 million, primarily as a result of lower net costs associated with the South Korea and home transitions.  ","We ended the quarter with consolidated inventories of 28% from the third quarter last year. Approximately 12% of the inventory growth relates to non-comp items included in inventory this year, those being home textile, South Korea, new stores and international e-commerce. Approximately 9% of the growth in inventory was for merchandise to support revenue growth on comparable products, geographies and distribution. The remaining 7% inventory growth is attributable to cost of goods inflation and foreign currency impact. ","We spent approximately $68 million on CapEx during the quarter to support new retail stores, shop installations and infrastructure investments. We bought a modest amount of stock during the quarter and have repurchased $395 million worth of our Class A common stock in the first 9 months of this year. ","At the end of the third quarter, we had $577 million remaining under our authorized share repurchase programs. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.3 billion in cash and investments and $1 billion in net cash, both essentially equivalent to the prior year period and reflective of our strong financial condition.","Our first 9 -- our results for the first 9 months of fiscal 2012 clearly showcased the momentum supporting the Ralph Lauren brand across our various merchandise categories and distribution channels worldwide. They also reflect the diligence of our global teams, as we have navigated through unprecedented cost of goods inflation  in an uncertain consumer backdrop, even as we funded the investments we are making and will continue to make in Asia, in product initiatives like Denim & Supply and accessories and in global e-commerce development. ","We are mindful of the fact that as you are all aware, the global retail environment is still fairly unpredictable, although very recent macro indicators have been more encouraging in the U.S. The apparel customer still appears to be somewhat price sensitive. International tourism in the U.S. and Europe in our stores have been erratic. And while Asia comp growth has been strong, we will have closed, as Roger mentioned, approximately 60% of our Greater China distribution network by the end of fiscal 2012. ","So while we are raising our sales and profit outlook for the year on the strength of our third quarter financial performance, we continue to monitor trends across all of our channels and regions in order to proactively address any material changes that could affect our plans and outlook. And I'd like to review that with you now.","For the full year fiscal 2012 period, we now expect revenues to increase by approximately 20%, which compares to our prior expectation of high teens to low 20s. Implicit in this outlook is an expectation for mid-teens growth in wholesale shipments and mid-20% growth for retail segment revenues. Continued Europe macro concerns and the resulting decline in consumer confidence; a reduction in Hong Kong and China doors; and the anniversary of the South Korea acquisition in the fourth quarter, which has contributed to our retail segment growth on a non-comp basis in the first 3 quarters of the year, are all embedded within this outlook. Additionally, exchange rates, primarily the euro, are expected to have a net negative impact on our consolidated revenue growth given current level.","We are also raising our full year operating margin outlook for the year. Currently, we expect our fiscal 2012 operating margin to be approximately equal to or just slightly below the prior year's level, which compares to our previous expectation of a 50 basis point decline. And if you'll recall, we started the year anticipating a 100 to 150 basis point decline in our operating margin, so we are very proud to be able to expect to stabilize our annual profitability considering that we've navigated unprecedented cost of goods inflation, while still funding our growth initiatives.","Our revised full year operating margin outlook assumes continued gross margin pressure from cost of goods inflation in the fourth quarter. Keep in mind, our fourth quarter has built a large wholesale shipment quarter for our spring merchandise, as well as the quarter wherein we will resell residual fall and holiday merchandise at our retail stores. And our retail segments related to clearance have a larger margin impact this year due to our higher penetration of retail sales in the quarter. ","We expect to incur approximately $5 million to $10 million in restructuring charges associated with our Asia repositioning program in the fourth quarter. This estimate includes incremental expense related to closing the remaining stores and shops left in our plan. By the end of this year, we will have closed 95 points of distribution, somewhat more than our original expectation of 65 closures, as we continue to refine our assessment of the network. And as a reminder, these costs have been consistently segregated and excluded from the operating margin guidance we've provided to you. We currently expect a fiscal 2012 tax rate of approximately 34%. ","As Roger and Jacki articulated earlier, our success is rooted in our culture of clearly defined brand standards and merchandise strategies and an extremely disciplined approach to execution. We are not providing fiscal 2013 guidance on today's call, but I do think it is important to acknowledge that we do expect the moderating of fiscal 2012's very strong top line momentum in the next fiscal year. ","In addition to the continued uncertain consumer outlook in Europe, our sales base in Greater China will be significantly reduced as a result of closing  60% of the shop network by the end of this year. It will take time, as Roger mentioned, to rebuild an appropriate, more elevated network to properly represent our luxury apparel and accessory assortments. Additionally, both home and South Korea will now be comp next year.  Having said this, we are incredibly encouraged by the outlook for the global luxury market over the next several years and our increasing participation in that growth with our geographic expansion, luxury store openings and expanded accessories assortment. ","Indeed, we are investing today to capitalize on this opportunity, particularly in international markets online -- and online. Our company has a clear, compelling growth strategy, and we have a long-standing track record of success, consistently, in executing against our strategies. This bolsters our confidence in continuing to make the proactive investments and decisions that we believe are appropriate to drive incremental, long-term shareholder value creation.","And with those remarks, I'll conclude the company's remarks and open the call up for your questions. Operator, would you assist us with that, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Omar Saad with ISI Group.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I guess, my one question would be -- and I know you spend a lot of time talking about this quarter and previous quarters, the global opportunity. But I thought it might be an interesting chance, Roger, for you to give an update on your view on the U.S. landscape, especially in light of some of the changes going on, like one of your bigger customers, jcpenney, new management there. It seems like they're taking a new approach to the department store format. Would appreciate any of your views on that.","Roger N. Farah","Okay, Omar. Where to begin? We talked in the prepared remarks about the extraordinary overall growth of our business. And clearly, the international year-to-date trends in the 40s has led the charge, but we've been surprised by the incredible resilience and strength of our domestic business. And as I said, that's come to our own direct-to-customer initiatives, as well as our wholesale. The results you've heard about third quarter from the wholesale landscape are sort of a mixed bag of strong to medium to more challenging. And I think the mid-tier channel had a more challenging third quarter. We've met with Ron Johnson and his team several times, Ralph and Jacki and I. So we've been very interested and excited to learn about his strategy and his revolution. It's an interesting time for Penneys, as they try to lead that organization in new direction, and we're very excited as everybody else is to see how that plays out. But we were at the end of a 5-year commitment to American Living, and I think upon reflection, we decided mutually to move away from that business after the spring\/summer shipments. We have a lot in our plate that is very exciting and challenging, and we want to make sure our efforts and energies are aligned with the opportunities. I think, Penneys has a lot of change and transformation going on, and in some cases, that's going to take time to play out. So we've left the door open to further dialogue for the relationships, but at this point, we're going to spend our time and energy building and controlling our brands the best way we know how. It has a de minimis impact on our financial results to upon the completion of spring\/summer really will be in a much smaller mode with that. Our domestic wholesale efforts focused on our existing customers, particularly with Chaps being the #1 brand at Kohl's. We think we have that channel well covered.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kate McShane with Citi Investment Research.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","On your last conference call, you had mentioned, I believe that you had, 3 flagships earmarked in China. And just with the announcement today about the 95 points of closure, can you update us on -- or your view on flagships in China and the timing of those buildouts?","Roger N. Farah","Sure. The 95 points of distribution is a slightly larger number than we talked about earlier in the year. As we looked at our strategies in that part of the world, we became convinced that the customer there would respond to our elevated assortments. So when we built a store in The Peninsula in Hong Kong, and one in Shanghai and saw the extraordinary reaction to our luxury products, we decided to get more aggressive about closing the B and C locations formally selected by our licensing partner. So we are continuing to look and negotiate in Beijing and Shanghai and Hong Kong for flagships. But at the same time, we're looking for additional locations throughout China and have a exploratory list that's quite long. How many of them will come to fruition at fiscal '13 versus '14 or '15 is still up in the air, and we'll keep you informed. But the flagships statements we've made in the New York or Paris or in Omotesando in Japan, we think, are critical for the brand expression. And we need to build awareness of our luxury profile in Japan. We needed to build it in Paris, and we certainly need to do it in China, not only for the customer shopping in China but for those travelers, because they shop in Seoul, Korea. They shop in the United States. They shop in Europe. And our ability to tell our story is best expressed through flagships. And so at the moment, we're hard at work looking in those 3 markets.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adrianne Shapira with Goldman Sachs.","Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Roger, just if we could talk a little bit about the share gains. Obviously, very impressive, but what's even more impressive is in margin opportunity, as you talk about capitalizing on growth across more compelling and more accretive geographies, categories and channels. Maybe if you could help us think about the margin's potential, those in the near-term, as I think, in the call you talked about relief in fall '12 shipments, given cost of goods but also the long-term, as you capitalize on these share opportunities across an even healthier margin platform?","Roger N. Farah","Okay, Adrianne. Let me break my answer into 2 pieces. The cost of goods discussion, which has been well dialogued among the industry, we took the position, when that began to occur, that we thought it would be a period of time of extraordinary inflation in raw materials and in labor, but believed it would not sustain. So a lot of the action that Jacki talked about and decisions that we made, we think it played well to our customers. We maintained quality. We did not change, make or raw material or trim or fit. And I think we've picked up market share, because the customer has come to expect that from Ralph Lauren. We passed along certain of the price increases, and that did affect, in the end, some of our margin. But we're all seeing now fall '12 and beyond raw materials, but particularly cotton coming back to a more appropriate level. And we think our margins will begin to rise in the fall '12 and beyond period. So we think we made the right decision there. And that's playing out around all product categories, particularly those that are dominated by cotton. Separately, we are seeing a mix change that's helping our margins. One, the retail margins are higher in rate than wholesale. And as you've seen this quarter, particularly, we're getting extraordinary growth out of our direct-to-consumer business around the globe. Second, the international markets actually have higher margins than the domestic markets. And so as that growth continues and the penetration rises, that will help margins. And then in certain other product categories, as they continue to grow, including accessories and others, those should be, over time, margin-rich categories. So the mix is working to our advantage as it plays out over the next 2 or 3 years, in addition to what we think is more normalized and predictable cost of goods changes. That's the end of my answer.","Operator","And next, we'll hear from Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I have just 2 quick questions. One is if you could give us a little bit of a comment on, I believe, you said there was going to be a shift to some operating expenses from third quarter into fourth quarter. If you could help us understand what that is, and perhaps what the size of that is? Obviously, it's in the guidance, but just maybe a little bit more detail. And then my question is, really, just if you could give some more conversation on Europe. I think everybody\u2019s seeing the volatility there. In last conference call, you spoke to it. And it's -- I believe, that market's about 70% wholesale for you. So you do have good visibility from your retail partners there and what the orders will look like. Maybe we can just -- walk us from last quarter to this quarter, as far as what you're seeing in the backlog there in Europe and what the latest trends are there. And I guess, I'll just end up by give my congratulations on what I thought was a very good result in Europe for the quarter for you guys, considering the volatility over there.","Tracey Thomas Travis","Well, I'll take that first part of that question, even though that was 2 questions. And then Roger will take the second part, as it relates to Europe. In terms of the expense shift that we saw from the third quarter and into the fourth quarter, it was a combination of corporate expense areas, advertising, some e-commerce investment, some headcount expenses that shifted into the fourth quarter that we had initially anticipated in the third quarter. And also, we talked about the fact that we will have restructuring and impairment charges in the fourth quarter. So that is the bulk of the incremental expenses that shifted from third quarter into fourth quarter. Magnitude of that is somewhere in the $15 million to $18 million range.","Roger N. Farah","The European environment is volatile, as you know. And having just been there recently, you actually feel it even more so in the different markets, because it's daily headlines. So with that, as a backdrop, and with no attempt to be an economist or a federal officer in terms of fiscal policy, I think there is a sense of uncertainty among the local customers about how the debt crisis, the euro crisis will be resolved and a question about whether or not the fix for some of these unbalanced country budgets will be either higher taxes or cut back in services in a way that will make for a longer-term recovery. But with that as a backdrop, our wholesale bookings, which at this point through early February are really mostly men's because we haven't really fully booked spring\/fall products for women's. But the early reads by the products we have booked are up, and we\u2019re getting market share, albeit with most retailers in Europe operating cautiously. I think they're taking a cautious view about inventory. I think they're taking a cautious view about capital, but within that, as they look to pay their resources and invest in the brands that they feel the strongest about, we feel good about our position and our opportunity. The second piece of what will happen over time in Europe is a lot of the small specialty stores are being squeezed by these conditions, particularly in markets like Italy and some of the southern parts of Western Europe. And so over time, we will be looking to build up what we call monobrand or Ralph Lauren branded stores throughout Europe, whether owned or licensed, we will go more direct to the customer. And we also are seeing customers making choice about shopping Internet. While the Internet, in general, in Europe is trailing the United States, our early reads on England, France and Germany have been encouraging. So we think we'll be taking our message more directly to the customer online through our own stores and then through taking share out of the key department store accounts in the other markets. So maybe not as buoyant as what we've reported to date, but we still think there's growth opportunities in Europe.","Operator","Next we hear from John Kernan with Cowen and Company.","John D. Kernan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Wanted to focus onto what seems to be expanding initiatives for you guys, specifically Denim & Supply and Club Monaco. I think Jacki talked about 100 doors of distribution for Denim & Supply right now, and then you talked about e-commerce launch for Club Monaco. And certainly that brand is growing in Europe. How do you look at the global potential for both of these initiatives going forward?","Roger N. Farah","Well, I think Jacki said hundreds, more than 100, because for us, it's an international launch, Europe, Asia and the United States. Here in the United States, it's really closer to 200 through Macy's, and then there's the incremental doors outside of the U.S. So we're actually very bullish on that brand, into full lifestyle offering in men's and women's and accessories. And the early reads, which we are hoping, were particularly good for the denim part. A lot of times when you read about denim businesses, they're more about the sportswear and less about the denim. But in this case Ralph and the team have come up with a spectacular balance, and so we're getting at both Men's and Women's. Club Monaco, which I think you've all seen, has experienced significant comp store growth, compounded quarter-after-quarter, has really led, what we think, is a women's offering that is now being accepted globally. Here, in the United States, we distributed through our own stores, soon-to-be e-commerce in Asia. We do it through license partners and our growing our footprint and being well received in Asia. It's a look and a style that the customer there is enjoying. And in Europe, we've recently launched through shop-in-shops and department stores and are studying whether or not freestanding stores in key markets are a opportunity as well. So we're really seeing the worldwide acceptance of Club Monaco and really believe we're on a unique track there in a market where women's has not been particularly strong for a lot of competitors. So we think we're getting at that opportunity globally, and we think the brand has tremendous potential.","Operator","Next we hear from Christian Buss with Credit Suisse.","Christian Buss - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I have a little more thematic question regarding the up positioning of the brands in your key regions. Can you talk about how much of your assortment is at the desired price value points in the U.S., Europe and Asia?","Roger N. Farah","Well, I'm going to give you a response that may not get exactly what you're asking. So if not, you'll ask me again. We think we give good price value at all ranges from Collection through Chaps. We think the product and the price value is a fair one and represents fair value for the consumer. We put a lot into the product, and I think that consistent approach to high quality has served as well. But I'm not sure how to answer that by brand or by channel beyond what I've just said.","Christian Buss - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess, if I could get some more color about what you mean by the up positioning of the brand and how we should think about that going forward?","Roger N. Farah","The up positioning?","Christian Buss - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes. I guess, I'll take the question offline.","Roger N. Farah","Okay. Sorry, Christian. Do you have another question?","Christian Buss - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That's good for me.","Operator","And our final question will come from David Glick with Buckingham Research Group.","David J. Glick - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","I was wondering if you could comment, Roger, on the importance of your new hire for the head of -- you created a new position over International, Daniel Lalonde, if I pronounced that correctly. And the thought process behind creating the position, what you think he will add to the strategy and whether or not this may be a clue in terms of succession planning at the company?","Roger N. Farah","Well, let me -- I'm going to broaden my answer a little bit. Daniel has been hard at work now for 2 days. So we are putting him through a crash orientation course. But I got to know Daniel over the last year through a variety of discussions. And I think he's a unique talent that's chosen to join us at a very opportunistic time. His background is steeped in running luxury businesses. It's steeped in the accessory world, both LV watches and is steeped in international customers. Every one of those subjects are high priorities for this company. To date, we had International reporting to Jacki in Asia and to me in Europe, and our desire was to make sure that the International voice is well represented holistically. And while Jacki and I want to take some credits for oversight, we also have new talent in Europe in John Hooks who joined us in the fall and Mark Daley in Asia, who joined us about this time last year. So we think we've built an incredibly talented experienced group of people now with the ability to take us to the next step. And then under them, we are cascading down through the ranks, looking to upgrade our talent in this critical subject. We set out a desire to make our business 2\/3 international at some point, and we're making extraordinary progress. The only problem is the U.S. keeps growing quickly as well. So our timetable gets pushed back. The other thing I'd also comment on is we've made some other key hires over the last couple of months in product categories like home. We hired was Ian Sears, who's come in to run our home business and several other key strategic talents. We have a long-standing commitment to talent, because we won't get far with just a strategy and a good balance sheet, we need the talent. So internally, we've spent a lot of time and energy on development of our own people, but strategically, where we need to bring in a key hire that we think will take us to a new level, we've done that as well. I think the results we\u2019ve reported today are really a function of a world-class team. And I'm very proud of the hard work that we've put into this group, whether it's design, merchandising, advertising, supply chain, on and on and on. And this is not easy in this environment. This is not as simple as it looks, when we report it 4 times a year. But we expect Daniel and Mark Daley and John Hooks and others to contribute internationally, and the rest of the team here in New York is hard at work. So I thank them all, I thank you for your interest. Hopefully, we'll get a chance to complete the year with the May call, but we're very excited about the future and have a lot of opportunities to challenge us for the next 5- or 10-year period.","James Hurley","Thanks very much.","Operator","And we have no further questions.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. James Hurley. Please go ahead.","James Hurley","Good morning. Thank you for joining us on Ralph Lauren's Third Quarter Fiscal 2014 Conference Call. The agenda for today's call includes Jacki Nemerov, our President and Chief Operating Officer, who will comment on our broader strategic initiatives and provide some merchandising highlights from the quarter. Chris Peterson, our Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer, who will provide operational and financial perspective on the third quarter, in addition to reviewing our outlook for the balance of fiscal 2014. After the company's prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions, which we ask that you please limit to one per caller.","During today's call, we'll be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including our financial outlook. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees, and our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Our expectations contain many risks and uncertainties. The principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from our current expectations are detailed in our SEC filings.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jacki.","Jackwyn L. Nemerov","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to be reporting exceptional third quarter results that demonstrate an acceleration in revenue and profit growth. You'll recall that we established aggressive sales and profit plans for fall and holiday, and we are proud to have met the high expectations.","Our 9% revenue growth and 11% increase in earnings per share were achieved in the face of one of the most challenging holiday seasons in recent memory. Revenue momentum was broad-based, supported by strong trends across every major geographic region and most merchandise categories. Disciplined operational management enables us to deliver robust expense leverage, even as we continued to make substantial investments in our longer-term growth initiatives.","We achieved quite a lot in the first 9 months of the year, including the successful transition of our Chaps men's sportswear business from licensed to owned, the integration of the Australia\/New Zealand territories, the doubling of ralphlauren.com's North American distribution center and a smooth transition to SAP for several our most critical operations. Our year-to-date results confirm that fiscal 2014 is actualizing as the tale of 2 halves that we outlined at the beginning of the year. In the back half, we are delivering accelerated revenue momentum and we're leveraging our operational -- operating expenses while continuing to invest in the future.","Our financial performance not only demonstrates the operational excellence of our global team, but also confirms the tremendous scope and breadth of the World of Ralph Lauren. We continue to be uniquely capable of servicing both the discerning luxury customer and the quality seeking aspirational customer.","The continued growth of our men's, women's and children's assortments, reflects Ralph's ability to consistently deliver fresh interpretations of his iconic design sensibility. Women's was particularly strong in the quarter, with momentum across sportswear, dresses, footwear and the handbag categories, and we also achieved outstanding growth for Purple Label and men's and women's Black Label.","Growing our global presence is an important area of strategic focus, so I'd like to spend some time on our performance by region. Beginning with the Americas, which account for over 2\/3 of our revenue and where sales accelerated to double-digit growth from mid- to high-single increase in the first half, supported by strong trends in both wholesale and retail segments. This growth is particularly noteworthy, given the decline in store traffic and highly promotional environment of the holiday season. The diversity of our operating model, which is a carefully constructed mosaic of customized product assortments for each distribution channel, enabled us to capture share.","Given the scale of the Americas, this growth is clear proof that our winning combination of terrific product, thoughtful planning and merchandising, and powerful brand presentation leads to sustained market share gains.","European revenues increased at a high-single-digit rate in constant currency in the third quarter, fueled by the strength of our retail business. Our European wholesale operations reached an important inflection point in shipment trends for 2014 spring\/summer season, following several quarters of strategic reductions and wholesale shipments to Southern Europe, we are now returning to growth.","Before the financial crisis, Europe was a substantial driver of the company's sales and profit growth. We are pleased the region's economic climate has stabilized to a point where we feel more confident about returning to our pre-recession trajectory. At 20% of our consolidated revenues, Europe remains a significant area of opportunity for the company in wholesale and retail channels throughout the region.","Sales in Asia also gained momentum in the quarter, growing at a double-digit rate, supported by the contribution from our newly integrated Australia and New Zealand operations, improved trends in Japan and accelerated growth in Greater China. As many of you know, Asia is an area of substantial opportunity for our company. Today, it represents just over 10% of our total sales, with Japan and Korea accounting for 70% of the region's total. Our focus in Japan and Korea is on reinvigorating the performance of department store concession shops. We have made good progress in the last few months by implementing read-and-react merchandising strategies and customer engagement initiatives.","In Greater China, our focus is on elevating the brand's image by expanding our points of distribution. Over the last 2 years, we've tested a variety of comps in the region and we've gained valuable customer insight and feedback. The investment we've made in the new distribution has increased our brand awareness among Chinese consumers, both in the region and throughout the world, and we've begun to see a greater number of Chinese tourists visiting our stores in the U.S. and Europe.","Next fall, we will establish our first dual-gender flagship presence in Greater China with a 20,000 square foot Ralph Lauren store in Hong Kong's prestigious Lee Gardens' shopping district. As flagship stores offer the most elevated and comprehensive representation of the World of Ralph Lauren, this opening will mark a significant milestone for us in the region.","Based on the improved awareness we've established for the Ralph Lauren brand, in fiscal 2015, we will begin a multiyear plan to open Polo stores throughout Greater China. This is an important evolution in our approach to the market as we expect Polo stores to become a powerful catalyst for our anticipated growth in Greater China. The Polo stores' strategy represents a tremendous global opportunity for the company. We are already securing several locations around the world for this exciting new concept.","You've heard me speak about the Fifth Avenue flagship store we'll open in New York City this fall. And today, I'm excited to tell you we've secured a 20,000-square foot space on Regent Street in London. In addition to New York and London, we expect to open several other locations in the U.S., Europe and Asia over the next couple of years.","Our decision to accelerate the rollout of these Polo stores coincides with several important product initiatives. First and foremost is the debut of women's Polo this fall, which marks a major milestone in the brand's history. We are also excited to unveil a fantastic assortment of men's polo suits, suit separates, sport jackets and trousers this fall, as a result of taking the men's clothing license in-house. The line features the more refined, dressier aspect of the Polo brand's DNA and fill the white space in both the consumers' wardrobe and our offering.","E-commerce is another very important area of focus for our company. The holiday season sales data clearly validates the customers growing comfort level with the channel. In the third quarter, our global e-commerce operations achieved high-teens comp growth, with our North American operations being the most significant contributor to that increase. Our newer Ralph Lauren international e-commerce and Club Monaco businesses are expanding even faster. Our international e-commerce revenues have grown more than 50% this year, with excellent trends in both Europe and Japan and clubmonaco.com is up over 70%.","In the wholesale online space, where we have focused quite a lot of our attention, our performance has also been exceptional. Given the rise of both browsing and buying with mobile devices, we are enhancing our capabilities in that area, while also continuing to strengthen the customer experience online.","The importance of our consistent investment in world-class advertising, marketing and public relations is undeniable, particularly in the current environment. Consumers clearly recognize that the Ralph Lauren brand signifies style, quality and enduring value and our communication strategies provide immediate call to action that generate sales. While we support our entire portfolio with the appropriate messages, I'd like to highlight 3 of our current campaigns.","First is the star of our Ralph Lauren accessories line, the Ricky handbag. On our last call, I shared the momentum we were seeing from the global campaign for our Soft Ricky handbag. This is an effort that was executed consistently across all key customer touch points and that was supported by the complete alignment of our production, merchandising, visual presentation and sales teams. I'm pleased to report that the ongoing results have been tremendous and have, in fact, exceeded our expectations. The Soft Ricky has been extremely well received in our own Ralph Lauren stores, as well as our select specialty store partners around the world.","As we hoped it would, the Soft Ricky has generated awareness and interest in our complete Ricky line, and has proven our credibility in the luxury accessories arena. This strategy continues into spring season, which 3 exciting new styles will be introduced: A mini version of the original Ricky, a two-tone Soft Ricky in 8 color combinations and a new Ricky model with a chain detail on the strap. For the luxury accessories consumer, who is always in the market for something new, these 3 new styles are sure to catch her eye.","Next, the Olympics. In the coming weeks, our brands will enjoy extraordinary global visibility at the Winter Games in Sochi, where we are the proud sponsors of team U.S.A. for the fourth time. We wish our athletes the very best, and we thank everyone at Ralph Lauren whose hard work and dedication allows us to support their efforts and represent our country so beautifully.","And finally, our sponsorship of Downton Abbey, which provides us with a perfect environment to bring our Ralph Lauren luxury brand message to the right television audience.","While year-to-date, our performance reflects the consistent operational excellence of our teams, it is also the result of many years of careful planning, strategic decisions and wise investments that at times may have had a negative short-term impact, but ultimately made us a stronger and more profitable organization. We are confident that the investments we are making today in our growth initiatives, infrastructure and communications will continue to support top line momentum and create shareholder value for the long term.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Chris.","Christopher H. Peterson","Thank you, Jacki, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen in this morning's press release, our third quarter performance reflects accelerated top line momentum and resilient operating profitability that were in line with the high end of our expectations. We are proud of these results, especially in the context of a shorter and highly promotional holiday environment.","Consolidated net revenues in the third quarter were $2 billion, a 9% increase from the prior year period, with strong growth for both our wholesale and retail segments. Excluding the impacts of discontinued businesses and unfavorable foreign currency translation, revenues were up 11%. Revenue growth was broad-based, with the Americas, Europe and Asia all growing revenues by high-single digits or better in constant currency terms.","Gross profit margin of 58.2% was 110 basis points lower than the prior year period, as unfavorable foreign currency dynamics and the mix impact from integrating the Chaps menswear operations more than offset improved profitability in our core business.","Operating expense rate of 41.6% was 120 basis points below the prior year, as disciplined operational management provided strong expense leverage on accelerated revenue growth. Operating income was $334 million and operating margin was 16.6%, 10 basis points higher than the prior year, which was at the high end of our expectations.","Net income for the third quarter was $237 million or 10% higher than the $216 million achieved in the comparable prior year period, and net income per diluted share increased 11% to $2.57. An effective tax rate of 27% in the third quarter was in line with the prior year period. The lower-than-expected tax rate reflects the favorable resolution of a discrete onetime item during the quarter.","Moving on to segment level details. Wholesale revenues rose an impressive 14% to $840 million, driven by the strong momentum in our core North American merchandise categories, where we continue to gain market share, the addition of Chaps menswear operations and improved trends in Europe as we've annualized the rebasing of the business in Southern Europe.","Wholesale operating income of $168 million was 16% above the prior year period, and wholesale operating margin increased to 20 basis points to 19.9%. The improvement in the wholesale segment margin was due to stronger profitability in core operations that was partially offset by the mix impact from the integration of the Chaps menswear operations and negative foreign currency effects.","Our retail segment sales rose 6% to $1.1 billion in the third quarter, reflecting the incremental contribution from new stores, including the recently transitioned Australia\/New Zealand operations and comparable store sales growth. Excluding the impacts of discontinued businesses and negative foreign currency effects, retail sales increased 10%.","Consolidated comparable store sales rose 1% on a reported basis and were up 2% in constant currency during the third quarter on top of challenging multi-year comparisons. Comp growth was primarily driven by strong global e-commerce performance.","We experienced lower traffic to many of our brick-and-mortar formats during the quarter, but the teams mitigated this pressure with exceptional customer service that drove improved conversion and higher units per transaction at most of our retail concepts worldwide. Retail operating income of $223 million was 11% higher than the prior year period, and retail operating margin improved 90 basis points to 19.8%. The improvement in retail segment profitability reflects the extraordinary operational discipline of our global teams and was achieved despite increased investments in new store rollouts and e-commerce expansion efforts.","Licensing revenues of $45 million were 12% below the prior year period as higher licensing revenues for Ralph Lauren products were more than offset by lower Chaps and Australia\/New Zealand licensing revenues as a result of recent license take-backs. Licensing operating income of $34 million was 8% below the prior year period.","Consolidated inventory of $1.1 billion at the end of the quarter compares to $981 million in the prior year period, reflecting the integration of formerly licensed operations to directly controlled businesses and investment to support anticipated sales growth, including inventory for new stores and e-commerce operations.","We spent approximately $81 million on capital expenditures compared to $78 million in the prior year period, primarily to support our global retail development initiatives and infrastructure investments. The company repurchased about 1.1 million shares of its common stock in the quarter, bringing year-to-date repurchase activity to 2.3 million shares or about $400 million.","We ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in cash and investments and our net cash balance was approximately $1.1 billion, both of which were in line with the prior year's levels. So a fantastic quarter by any standard and even more so when we consider the challenges of the shorter and highly promotional holiday environment. At this point, I'd like to review our outlook for the balance of the year.","For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue growth to accelerate and increase by 10% to 12%, with wholesale growing faster than retail. Foreign exchange and discontinued operations are estimated to negatively impact revenue growth by approximately 100 basis points in the fourth quarter, with most of that headwind affecting the retail segment.","Operating margin for the fourth quarter is expected to improve 50 to 90 basis points from the 11.1% achieved in the prior year period, as a lower gross margin is more than offset by operating expense leverage even as we continue to make significant investments in the company's strategic growth objectives. The fourth quarter tax rate is expected to be approximately 30%.","For the full year fiscal 2014 period, we are raising our revenue growth guidance to 7%, which is at the high end of our previous range of 5% to 7%, due to stronger-than-anticipated wholesale momentum. Our revenue guidance includes an approximate 150 to 200 basis point negative impact from foreign currency effects and discontinued operations.","Our new outlook calls for the full year fiscal 2014 operating margin to be 110 to 120 basis points below the prior year's record level of 16.2% and compares to our prior expectation of a 75 basis point decline. The change in operating margin guidance is driven by 3 factors: The channel mix impact from stronger wholesale revenue growth; the higher-than-anticipated restructuring and other charges; and incremental pressure as a result of the intensified promotional tenor of the U.S. retail landscape in the post-holiday period.","While we experienced strong sales and gross margin trends on our core business in the third quarter, we believe that being proactively competitive with the overall marketplace will position us well for the start of the spring selling season.","As a reminder, the primary drivers of the year-over-year contraction in operating margin are the successful integration of newly assumed operations, accelerated investments in our strategic growth initiatives and foreign exchange impacts.","The fiscal 2014 tax rate is now estimated at 29% compared to our prior expectation of 30%. The net impact of our updated 2014 outlook keeps us in the range of our prior expectations, although we get there in a slightly different manner with stronger revenue growth, a slightly lower operating margin and a more favorable tax rate.","We remain committed to investing in the growth initiatives that have supported the company's strong financial results over the last several years, and that provide us with a more robust platform for future sales and profit growth. While we are still in the process of refining our fiscal 2015 budget, I did want to provide some qualitative insight into how we are approaching the next fiscal year.","On the top line, we expect significant contributions from a number of the growth initiatives we've invested in this year, such as the Polo and Ralph Lauren flagship stores Jacki spoke about earlier, global e-commerce expansion and new product development. Specifically, we expect the continuation of our strong momentum and our planning for revenues to increase at a high-single-digit rate.","Fiscal 2015's consolidated revenue growth is expected to be retail-led with international markets and e-commerce providing outsized contributions to growth. There are several areas of incremental investment in fiscal 2015 that are expected to become important contributors to our growth over the next 3- to 5-year period. These include the global expansion of the Polo brand, continued investment in our luxury business and sustained investment in IT infrastructure.","With respect to the global expansion of the Polo brand, we'll be investing on several fronts. First and foremost, we plan to accelerate our global store development for Polo. In addition to the Fifth Avenue flagship and Regent Street flagship locations, we'll be actively looking for locations throughout the U.S., Europe and Asia, including China, where we think the time is right for us to reenter the market with Polo product.","We're also investing in broadening the Polo product portfolio, including the launch of women's Polo and the introduction of a men's tailored clothing line that we are now directly operating. As with other product launches and license take-backs, these will require incremental resources for design, merchandising, production and sales. We'll also support the Polo expansion strategy with increased global advertising and marketing to build awareness for the new stores and merchandise categories.","For our luxury business, we're increasing our advertising, marketing and PR activity to support the opening of our Lee Gardens flagship store in China and also to drive the growth of accessories based on the success we have had with our Soft Ricky campaign. We will also be investing in the product by using finer materials and higher-quality manufacturing resources. While this will result in a higher cost of goods, it will allow us to offer even more compelling value to the consumer and to support strong global momentum we are experiencing with our luxury merchandise.","Regarding IT infrastructure, we will begin the next phase of SAP implementation, which is focused on our European operations. We'll be starting this phase as we are simultaneously completing the successful implementation of our North America wholesale and global supply chain operations. Over time, we believe SAP should enable appreciable productivity improvements and procurement savings.","We also plan to start a multiyear project to upgrade our core e-commerce technology platform globally. Our e-commerce revenues have grown at a 25% compound annual rate over the last decade, and we expect e-commerce to remain one of our fastest-growing businesses. This fiscal year, we invested $75 million in capital in ralphlauren.com's North Carolina-based customer fulfillment center, doubling the facility in order to support a doubling of the business from current levels.","The global platform upgrade we are beginning in fiscal 2015 will require a substantial investment in both capital and operating expense. We were pioneers in selling luxury products online and have made tremendous progress in the last decade. As we build the new platform out, it will allow us to improve our omni-channel capabilities and significantly enhance our online and mobile shopping experience, ensuring that ralphlauren.com remains a world-class destination for our customers. We believe a more sophisticated technological backbone is a necessary enabler of sustained revenue growth, allowing e-commerce to become a more important part of our business.","The investments we're making in Polo, luxury and e-commerce are consistent with our strategy to distort resources to high-growth, high-margin opportunities. While each of these areas of investment is expected to generate returns that greatly exceed our cost of capital, the near-term impact on operating expenses means that the fiscal 2015 operating margin will likely be below 2014's level. We'll be completing the fiscal '15 planning process over the next few months and we will provide a more detailed outlook for next year when we report our fourth quarter earnings in May.","We are confident that we are making the right investments to expand the Ralph Lauren brand in a manner that maximizes our global sales and profit potential over the intermediate and long term. We have consistently made outside investments in the near term with an expectation that we would achieve strong returns as high-growth merchandising categories, channels and regions evolve in the future. You can see those returns playing out in the second half of fiscal 2014, which gives us the confidence to proceed with the next wave of important investments.","Our Board of Directors shares our conviction, which is evidenced by the additional $500 million share repurchase authorization we announced today, bringing our total authorizations to $730 million.","And with that, I'll conclude the company's remarks and open the call up for your questions. Operator, can you assist us with that, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Omar Saad with ISI Group.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask a little bit about this kind of mix. It sounds like your wholesale is accelerating, but retail has been such a big driver. Chris, your initial comments for next year sounded like retail is going to continue to be a big driver. But maybe there's some margin pressure because of the wholesale growth and it's obviously, at least, at the gross margin level. I think you made a comment about proactively -- being proactively competitive. Just help me put all this into context of what it means for margins looking out?","Christopher H. Peterson","Yes. So I think in the fourth quarter, as we mentioned, we're expecting operating margin to be up 50 to 90 basis points, and that brings our fiscal '14 full year margin, operating margin, a little bit lower than our previous guidance. And really there's 3 factors impacting that. One is the revenue being stronger in wholesale than what we had anticipated previously, which does put a little bit of mix pressure because the wholesale business operates at a lower gross margin rate than the retail business. The second is we're going to incur a little bit higher restructuring charges than what we had originally anticipated. And then the third is although we had a very strong third quarter result in our core business, so if you looked at our gross margin in the third quarter, excluding the impact of -- the mix impact from Chaps and foreign exchange, our core business gross margin globally was actually up 50 basis points versus a year ago in the third quarter. We're just being a little bit cautious with regard to the environment we're operating, because what we're seeing from a competitive dynamic standpoint is an intensified promotional environment. And we want to make sure that in the fourth quarter, we work through our inventory plans so that we can convert in a strong fashion into the spring selling season. So that's really what's happening with regard to sort of margin dynamics this year. With regard to next year, I think we're still early in our planning phase for next year. And I would expect that next year, we'll see gross margin higher next year than we are this year. But because of the significant investments that we're making in future growth initiatives, at this point, we think it's likely that operating margin will be down next year versus this year, as I mentioned in the prepared comments.","Operator","The next question is from Kate McShane with Citigroup.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I was wondering if you could help us reconcile the rollout of Polo stores in China. It seems like most recently, the focus has been on the luxury end of Ralph Lauren in China, and now it seems there's a sooner-than-expected rollout of Polo stores in China. So can you help us understand what's changed there?","Christopher H. Peterson","Sure. Let me start on that. So that's right. I think as we've taken the license back from the licensee that we had previously, several years ago, and we've rebased the distribution in China with closing 95 points of distribution and sort of resetting the brand image with opening our luxury store portfolio, we've been very closely monitoring the consumer reaction, both from an awareness standpoint and from a perception of the brand standpoint, not just in China through our store performance, but also outside of China as consumers are -- Chinese consumers are shopping when they travel. And so one of the things that we've been focused on is how is the Chinese consumer responding in our European business and in our U.S. business. And at least in the most recent periods, we've seen as a result of this resetting of the brand image in China, that, in the most recent period, for example, in Europe the Chinese consumer in Europe business is actually up 50% versus year ago. So we're starting to see the impact that we wanted to see from a consumer perception translate into increases outside of China when the Chinese customer travels. In the U.S., the Chinese consumer is now in the top 5 of our foreign customers that are buying in our stores as we're tracking that. And because of that, and because of the opening of the Lee Gardens flagship store that we have this fall, we think the time is now right where we've appropriately reset the brand image to begin to rollout Polo stores in that marketplace. And so that has been an active dialogue inside the company and is a decision that we've just made.","Jackwyn L. Nemerov","And since -- let me add to Chris' comments, we are seeing that over 55% of the consumers that are Chinese consumers are actually shopping outside of China. So many of the important statements that we've made throughout the rest of the world, whether that's in Europe or in the U.S., we're starting to really see an acceleration of that customer. What we're also seeing is an important difference in the unit transaction with the Chinese consumer versus our more standard consumer that, that transaction is actually double the size of our standard transaction. So we're seeing that also as quite a meaningful opportunity for us.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a couple of questions for you. Could we hear a little bit more about the change in trajectory? It sounds like you saw in Japan, in the quarter, I mean, obviously, the FX exacerbated an already challenging market there over the past few quarters, but maybe we could hear about a little bit more about what caused an inflection and if those concessions were actually positive and sustainable there. And then if I could ask one other question, it will be about the Polo women's opportunity that you talked about. Maybe if we can just hear a little bit more about that as an opportunity and how big you think that is and perhaps, how you see the distribution going for that. Is that a wholesale opportunity as we get through calendar '14 after you open the store later this year?","Jackwyn L. Nemerov","Okay. I'll start with Japan and Asia, and then Jacki can comment on the Polo store, women's Polo plans. So in Asia, you're right, we did see an acceleration of our growth rate in Asia, specifically, and in Japan in particular. So if you look in Asia, our business was up, our revenues were up double digits in constant currency versus year ago in Asia, broadly defined. And in Japan, we went from a period where, on a constant currency basis, our sales were challenged to a period where our sales in Japan were up low-single digits on a constant currency basis. I think part of what\u2019s happened in the Japan market is, with the significant devaluation in the Japanese yen, we decided to take pricing back in May because we thought that it was the right thing for us to do as market leaders, to try to price to recover the cost impact of the yen devaluation. It takes some time for competitors to see what we've done and then to decide, whether they want to or not, adjust their pricing in the market. We think we're at a better place now having adjusted our pricing and having seen some of the competitors adjust their pricing. And so we're now at a point where that price gap that we established when we first took pricing is narrowing and is allowing us to return to a more normalized growth rate for that market.","Jackwyn L. Nemerov","In addition to Chris' comments, we've put a task force in place around our Japanese opportunity. And we have solicited help from our very strong sales and merchandising teams kind of around the world to really build some of the very dynamic things that we've done in other parts of the world to help us really transition that business into what we believe is a wonderful opportunity. So whether it's the content or merchandising or store presentation, we've really worked hard to step up our game and we're starting to really see some nice results from that. In addition, on your comment about Polo women, we are actually doing a brand launch, both in retail and wholesale simultaneously. So our store will open in the fall season. And simultaneous to that, we will begin to ship Polo women in about 150 U.S. doors and then significant number of doors in Europe and in Asia, all simultaneous with this very unique launch. We previewed with many, many, many customers from all over the world, actually late December into early January, met with some very positive response to the line. And so that launch will be simultaneous in both retail and wholesale. We also intend to put an important marketing and advertising and PR strategy around that launch, around the world, doing something more similar to what we did when we launched our Soft Ricky. And so we will have a unified message around the world, around the Polo brand in general, and both Polo men's and women's.","Operator","The next question comes from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffrey.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I just had a question on Europe. I mean, very encouraging that you see some of that strength return to that market. Could you just elaborate a little bit more on some of the regional nuances during the quarter and just how the local versus the tourist customer responded? And then secondly, if we think about the fiscal '15 top line guidance in the high-single-digit range, maybe could you just help us prioritize the rank of the potential sales growth rates from the key regions, so between Asia, Europe and North America.","Christopher H. Peterson","Okay. So I'll start with Europe. So in Europe, about half of our business is wholesale and about half of our business in retail -- is retail. And what has been sort of happening in Europe over the last 18 months as we made this decision, as we talked about 12 or 18 months ago, to proactively pull back on shipments in the wholesale channel in Southern Europe, particularly to the specialty wholesale customer which was, in our view, more at risk from a credit macroeconomic standpoint. During that period, we continue to see strong growth in our retail segment, but the decline in the wholesale business from the pullback proactively in shipments sort of mitigated that trend of European revenue growth over the last several quarters. In the third quarter that we've just reported, we've now annualized that. And so if you look at the wholesale business in Europe, we actually were up low-single digits in wholesale across the European region, and we were up double digits in the retail segment. And the combination of those businesses resulted in Europe on a constant currency basis being up high-single digits as the strength in the retail business is now coming through. So that's a little bit about what's been going on in Europe. If you continue to look at, geographically, at the strength of the business and the strength of the consumer holistically, I think we continue to be in a period where Northern Europe continues to be stronger than Southern Europe. But our view is that Southern Europe has stabilized now, so it's not in as tough a situation compared to year ago, as what we are facing 12 to 18 months ago. But certainly, the Northern European business continues to be stronger than the Southern European business. The other thing that we're excited about in Europe is that when you look out on the wholesale business at future bookings, the future bookings are stronger and auger for continued growth in the wholesale business going forward. I think the fiscal '15 in terms of the high-single-digit range was the other part of the question. So I think it's a little bit premature to talk about the specifics between Europe, Asia and North America. Certainly, we expect Asia to represent disproportionate growth, as a region, as we've opened some of our new stores that we've had in the pipelines like Lee Gardens and continue the momentum in that business. We continue to expect to grow market share with the plans that we have in place in the U.S. marketplace. And I think -- we think Europe is going to be strong because we think we're starting from a base now where we no longer have to sort of rebase the business. But we'll provide more specifics on the next call.","Operator","The next question comes from Liz Dunn with Macquarie.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","I'm interested in whether or not you see any potential for channel conflict as you rollout these Polo stores. As well as, longer term, what percentage of retail do you think will be achieved in the mix and what kind of store growth are you targeting?","Christopher H. Peterson","I think we don't see a significant channel conflict risk in the Polo store rollout strategy. And part of the reason for that is, I think, where you'll see us go with the Polo stores is we believe we'll have the flagship store on Fifth Avenue, which really sets the tone and the aesthetic of the brand globally, which we think will strengthen the Polo brand. But when you look at a lot of the other Polo stores that we're going to be looking at, they're going to really be focused on areas that are more whitespace to us. So if you think about China or if you think about parts of Europe or parts of the Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe, really, a lot of the locations that we're going to be going into are locations and geographies where there isn't a strong Polo distribution to begin with. And so it's not so much a conflict as it is an opportunity to fill out whitespace, I think, going forward.","Operator","The next question comes from Christian Buss with Credit Suisse.","Christian Buss - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was wondering if you could provide some color on the performance of your e-commerce business in the quarter? And how should we be thinking about the return on those incremental investments? It would really be helpful for me if you could talk about that e-commerce penetration you've gotten where the targets are longer term.","Christopher H. Peterson","E-commerce in the quarter grew high-teens, which we feel very good about. It continues to be a channel where consumers are choosing to shop. I think the convenience of e-commerce and the brand experience that we have on our e-commerce site are really resonating with consumers. We believe that trend is likely going to continue. And so we're planning for e-commerce to continue to be a disproportionate driver of growth. It is a high-profit business in the U.S., where we have scale. So in the U.S., our e-commerce business is about 10% of our overall U.S. business today from a penetration standpoint. And the operating margin of the e-commerce business in the U.S. is at or above the balance of the U.S. business. And so we feel very good about where we are there. In Europe, we're at an earlier stage, so we're not yet as penetrated in e-commerce in the European business because we didn't start as early as we did in the U.S. This year, we're expecting the e-commerce business in Europe to turn profitable, but we still aren't yet at going operating margins because we are not yet at full scale. And in Asia, where we have just started e-commerce with really just a launch just in 2 countries, Japan and Korea, we're off to a strong start. But we're still in investment mode in those markets because we haven't yet reached scale. The other thing that may be worth talking a little bit about is we have a technology platform that underpins our e-commerce operation that the company put in about 8 or 10 years ago. And that technology platform has served the company very well. But as the e-commerce channel and shopping experience continues to involve, we believe there's an opportunity to upgrade that e-commerce technology platform to better service the consumer, improve the shopping experience. And so that's a multiyear project that we're going to be starting shortly here, that we'll talk more about over the upcoming calls.","Operator","The next question comes from Barbara Wyckoff with CLSA.","Barbara Wyckoff - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Could you talk about Denim & Supply performance U.S. and overall? Also can you comment on Club Monaco and what's going on there?","Jackwyn L. Nemerov","Yes. Our Denim & Supply performance has been very strong, both internationally in Europe and Asia, and in the U.S. as well. We're rolling out both wholesale and retail points of distribution for the brand. And we're very encouraged as we continue to be a top performer in this space. It's a new business and there's an interesting learning curve. But the Denim penetration, which was something that we were very focused on has -- it's been quite impressive. And I think what we do in the tops and sweater area and outerwear area of the business are quite unique to this space. So we've really had a great acceleration in this brand that we expect to see continue. In Club Monaco, our businesses have been quite good. And we just, as you know, opened a new store in Fifth Avenue, which has been very exciting and a top performer in the company. And then a week ago, we opened our new store in SoHo, which is also off to a very, very strong start. So with the strength in the U.S., strong Asia business and a growing Europe Denim & Supply business -- I'm sorry, Club Monaco business, we're very, very excited. The business in Asia is a license business and we're over 100 stores in Club Monaco today. And we have similar plans for Europe, while we're in early and beginning stages as an owned and operated business in Europe.","Operator","The final question comes from Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Jacki, can I get you to talk a little more about the Polo women's business? And how that will be positioned globally relative to -- well, I guess, in the U.S., relative to the Lauren business? You were talking about Denim & Supply maybe relative to the Denim & Supply growth on the women's side. And just help us understand how these different women's apparel, wholesale businesses you're doing will be differentiated globally.","Jackwyn L. Nemerov","Absolutely. Let me start with our Lauren brand, which is foundational today and the backbone of the department stores better business, and has had quite a strong year. And we're very pleased with where Lauren is and where it's positioned. While Lauren serves a broad customer, the foundation of that business is a customer who is essentially in the 35-plus area and who really looks for our brand and our style to supply her broad wardrobe, whether it's her daywear, her evening wear with a great success in our dress business. But again, very broad-based and it tends to be sort of the backbone customer in the department store. In Denim & Supply, it's a new space that's defined under the millennial umbrella. And in that space, as I said, we've really accelerated with our strengths. And in most cases, in that competitive space we're, now, kind of in a #1, 2 or 3 position. In our new Polo women's business, we tend to really see our competition there as a Burberry, as a Tory Burch in that of more contemporary sensibility. And while the line is defined through the iconic Ralph Lauren perspective, it is really appealing to what we see as a younger customer. It has a slimmer fit and the expression of the brand is very eclectic in the way we mix our pieces together and make it very fresh looking, and we think something unique in the marketplace.","James Hurley","Great.

Please go ahead.","James Hurley","Good morning, and thank you for joining us on Ralph Lauren\u2019s Fourth Quarter and Full Year Fiscal \u201814 Conference Call. The agenda for this morning\u2019s call includes Jacki Nemerov, our President and Chief Operating Officer, who will give you an overview of the year and comment on our broader strategic initiatives. Chris Peterson, our Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer, will provide operational and financial perspective on the fourth quarter, in addition to reviewing our initial expectations for fiscal \u201815. After the company\u2019s prepared remarks, we will open the call up for your questions, which we ask that you limit to one per caller.","During today\u2019s call, we will be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including our financial outlook. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees, and our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Our expectations contain many risks and uncertainties. The principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from our current expectations are detailed in our SEC filings.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jacki.","Jacki Nemerov","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to be reporting better-than-expected fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2014 results today. Our 14% revenue growth and 23% increase in earnings per share for the fourth quarter were result of double-digit top line expansion in each of our major geographic regions, with Europe and Asia leading the pace in addition to strong profit flow-through for core operations.","The results reflect an acceleration from the third quarter\u2019s strong growth rate despite a challenging retail environment, particularly in the United States. Our full year sales growth of 7% and earnings per share of $8.43 represents record levels for us and were achieved even with substantial investments in our growth initiatives and infrastructure, and in the phase of unfavorable foreign exchange headwinds through the quarter.","When we provided our fiscal 2014 outlook a year ago, we characterized it as a tale of two halves. We spoke about our spending margin being down in the first half impacted by more modest sales growth and upfront expenses related to the integration of formally licensed operations and pre-opening costs for new stores.","And we spoke about our second half in terms of an acceleration in revenue trends and improved profitability, as a result of realizing the benefits of those newly integrated businesses and the store openings.","The year played out as we anticipated, in fact a bit better than expected in the second half, which clearly demonstrates the discipline of our organization, to both, manage the business in real-time and plan for the future.","Fiscal 2014 was also a year of important progress on each of the company\u2019s long-term growth objectives of extending our direct-to-consumer reach, expanding our international presence, innovation with new products and investing in our infrastructure.","Our achievements included the creation of Polo for women, the seamless transition of our Chaps men\u2019s sportswear business from licensed to owned, the integration of the Australia\/New Zealand territories into our organization and a doubling of the size of ralphlauren.com\u2019s North American distribution center and a smooth transition to SAP for many of our most critical operations.","We also established a new leadership structure designed to enhance our progress on our long-term growth objectives. We opened 46 stores during the year, which was an acceleration from the prior year and consistent with our focus on extending our direct-to-consumer reach.","We also established greater clarity around our retail growth objectives with Polo stores being an exciting new evolution in our direct-to-consumer efforts and a compelling complement to our Ralph Lauren luxury stores. Our global e-commerce operations experienced another year of strong double-digit expansion.","We expect this to continue to be one of our fastest growing channels over the next several years, bolstered not only by consumer confidence in buying online, but also by new leadership of our e-commerce team and a site re-platform that will enhance functionality and allow us to provide an even stronger brand and customer experience.","Turning now to our product. Both luxury apparel and accessories experienced significant growth during the year. Our men\u2019s Purple Label and Black Label lines were more fully developed through additional sportswear and Denim elements respectively to provide more breadth to the product offering and more depth to their lifestyle expressions.","Men\u2019s and Women\u2019s Black Label performance was particularly strong as we see customers around the world connecting with this brand\u2019s modern streamlined sensibility. We also saw a continued momentum in outerwear and handbags, with consumers responding positively to the distinctiveness of our aesthetic in these areas.","Dresses were important driver of growth in women\u2019s wear during the year. We began a more concerted focus on dresses about five years ago to both capitalize on an emerging trend and to express our brand voice in a category that was becoming increasingly important to the consumer.","In a short period of time, through a combination of design trend, fit expertise and excellent value proposition and of course the stronger feel of our brand, we\u2019ve established ourselves as a dominant force in the dress category with market leadership across nearly all of our wholesale distributions.","Club Monaco also had a fantastic year building on strong multiyear trends. The momentum has been equally strong at Club Monaco\u2019s 57 directly owned North American stores, e-commerce operations and in international markets with the brand that is present in over 120 points of distributions, mostly concentrated in Asia. Club Monaco occupies a unique niche in the market offering the contemporary customer distinctive, on-trend merchandize at a great price.","While women\u2019s has been a consistently strong performer over the years, the men\u2019s business have made great progress, thanks to the clarity of design direction in aesthetic which is coming through in both the product and the shopping environment.","We supported Club Monaco\u2019s development by investing in growing and renovating the store base, most notably with the brand\u2019s spectacular new flagship in New York. Based on the success we\u2019ve already seen, we intend to accelerate store development for Club Monaco in fiscal 2015.","As we look to the future, I\u2019d like to provide some perspective on three key initiatives that we believe will become meaningful drivers of sales and profit growth over the next three to five years. The first initiative is what I\u2019ll call the intensified development of the Polo brand. Polo achieved significant milestone in fiscal 2014 with the creation of Polo for women.","We are very excited about the long-term potential for women\u2019s Polo, especially given the broad global success of our men\u2019s Polo product. Today, the split between our men\u2019s and women\u2019s mix is about 60\/40. The overall marketplace is in the reverse, and we believe the introduction of women\u2019s Polo is an opportunity for us to increase the penetration of our women\u2019s business. Women\u2019s Polo will replace our existing women\u2019s Blue Label line, so the launch is not entirely incremental for us in the near-term.","Over the long-term however, we believe the breadth and scope of the lines aesthetic, fitting price points will address a much broader market than we did with Blue Label. We are also taking back our men\u2019s clothing license and will be launching an expanded line of Polo tailored clothing this Fall.","This more comprehensive assortment of suits, sports clothes and trousers will allow Polo to establish its strong foothold in these essential aspects of a man\u2019s wardrobe. Tailored clothing has always been an integral part of the Ralph Lauren DNA and is the perfect complement to Polo\u2019s leadership in sportswear.","We are also in the early stages of executing our plan to open Polo stores worldwide. We believe these stores will be a wonderful counterpart to our valued North America and European wholesale distribution. Polo stores will likely become the brand\u2019s primary distribution platform in certain international markets such as Asia and parts of Latin America, where the wholesale channel is less developed.","Between those operated by us and those operated by local partners around the world, we have 13 Polo stores today with approximately 15 to 20 planned for fiscal 2015. We are testing a variety of store formats as we refine our approach to market before accelerating growth.","Over the long-term, we believe there is an opportunity to have between 100 and 200 Polo stores worldwide, and with also concentration in international markets.","Our second initiative is the global e-commerce development. In fiscal 2014, we achieved $500 million in revenues through our directly operated e-commerce sites. That milestone was achieved as a result of sustained investment in the business, including distribution centers, customer service centers and building out our international operations.","Based on the high growth and the profit creative dynamics of the channel, we intend to continue investing in this space. In fiscal \u201815, we will begin a three-year project to upgrade our e-commerce operations by transitioning to a new global operating platform.","This is a proactive investment to advance our ability to continue to deliver best-in-class online and mobile customer experiences, as well as leverage omni channel opportunities more effectively. The global nature of the platform will provide a singular way for us to manage our customer touch points and experiences across regions and channels ensuring a consistent brand experience worldwide.","With the additional capabilities of a more sophisticated platform, and an expectation of continued double-digit growth for the channel, we\u2019ve set our sights on achieving $1 billion in annual e-commerce revenues.","The third initiative is accessories in general and leather goods in particular. I\u2019d like to provide some perspective on the excellent progress we\u2019ve made with our leather goods offerings which include handbags, footwear, belts and small leather goods.","Beginning with footwear, which we converted from a licensed to owned model in 2006, we\u2019ve now spent two years reimagining our offerings and building the appropriate leadership, design talent and sourcing capabilities to elevate the quality and support our distribution and growth aspirations.","We relaunched footwear in 2008 and have made tremendous progress since then establishing ourselves as an important player in the category. 2008 was also the year we assumed direct control of our handbag and small leather goods licenses. We\u2019ve grown the leather goods category at a 20% compound annual rate. As you know, we\u2019ve made big commitment to the Ricky bag as our most iconic silhouette. The customer response to the quality and versatility of the product, and to our advertising and marketing efforts has been extraordinary and the momentum continues to build.","In total, handbags, footwear and small leather goods represented a high-single-digit percentage of our consolidated sales in fiscal 2014. We expect leather goods to grow faster than the overall company for the next several years, supported by expanded offerings and increased distribution.","Our initial goal is for leather goods to represent 20% of our consolidated revenues, a target that should also have favorable margin implications.","The three initiatives I\u2019ve just highlighted make it clear that we have a lot to achieve. With this in mind, we\u2019ve spent a considerable time developing and implementing the optimal leadership and organizational structure over this last year, one that we believe positions the company for continued growth and success.","As you know, we recently appointed a President of Ralph Lauren Luxury Collections with global responsibility for the strategy, merchandizing, distribution and overall expansion of apparel and accessories for our men\u2019s and women\u2019s collection brands.","We\u2019ve also made other important structural changes to our broader senior management group. These changes have moved some of our high performing talent into roles with more global oversight. This leverages their experience and subject matter expertise allows us to more easily and confidently apply successes in one channel or region to another and evolve the more regional orientation we had in the past.","We have consolidated oversight of the Americas under one leader, which is consistent with how we manage our operations in Europe and Asia. This new structure should enable us to better execute an omni channel approach, more effectively leveraging our robust planning, allocation and merchandizing expertise.","We also combined our sourcing and manufacturing operations with our distribution and logistics team, creating a fully integrated end-to-end supply chain organization. These changes are aligned with the progress we\u2019ve made in other areas of the company, such as the creation of the global merchandizing team we\u2019ve spoken about before and the more global oversight that Chris has instituted in finance and IT.","We believe that this streamlining of responsibilities allows us to be more nimble and responsive as an organization and to operate with a higher degree of global consistency. This new structure will enable us to make faster decisions, drive greater operational efficiencies and build a more effective go-to-market process.","The changes have all been well received by the organization and we are settling nicely into the new structure with Ralph, Chris and I spending the appropriate time to ensure that everyone is transitioning smoothly into their new roles.","I am sure most of you have seen that Roger Farah will retire from Ralph Lauren at the end of May. We are enormously grateful for the leadership and dedication, Roger has provided over the last 14 years.","In partnership with Ralph, he has guided the company to a period of tremendous growth in sales and profits. In doing so, he has built an impressive team and his characteristic balance of prudence and creativity is a legacy that is ingrained in our culture, and certainly in everyone he has mentored over the years. Roger, you are like none other and we wish you and your family all the best.","The strength of the Ralph Lauren brand and the positive customer response to our expanding range of product offerings puts us in the best possible position to achieve our growth objectives.","Before I turn the call over to Chris, on behalf of the office of the chairman, I\u2019d like to thank our global team for their contribution to our record fiscal 2014 results. As Ralph said in this morning\u2019s press release, their creativity, passion and diligence is incredibly invigorating and they are a critical ingredient in our ability to deliver sustainable, profit enhancing growth over the long-term.","Chris Peterson","Thank you, Jacki, and good morning, everyone. As you\u2019ve seen in this morning\u2019s press release, we\u2019re reporting strong fourth quarter sales and profit results today.","Let me start with a brief recap of the quarter. Consolidated net revenues rose 14% to $1.9 billion, reflecting robust wholesale segment growth and strong retail segment expansion. Revenue was up double-digits in each of our geographic regions during the quarter.","The revenue results were better than the expectations we articulated in February due to stronger wholesale revenue as we gained market share in North America and returned to robust growth in Europe. For the full year, net revenues grew 7% to $7.4 billion and were up 9% excluding the impact of discontinued businesses and foreign exchange.","Gross profit margin of 56.2% was 310 basis points below the prior year period. The decline in gross profit margin is primarily attributable to the mix impacts from the integration of the Chaps men\u2019s sportswear operations, the mixed impact from stronger wholesale revenue growth and negative foreign currency effects in the quarter.","Operating expenses rose 4% to $825 million, but the operating expense rate of 44.2% was 400 basis points below the prior year. We delivered substantial cost leverage on strong sales growth, which was achieved despite continued investments in the company\u2019s long-term strategic growth initiatives in infrastructure.","Operating income rose an impressive 24% to $225 million in the fourth quarter, which was achieved on top of a 33% increase in the prior year period. Operating margin improved 90 basis points to 12%, which was at the high-end of the outlook we provided in February.","Operating income of $1.1 billion for the full year of fiscal 2014 period was modestly above the prior year. Operating margin declined 100 basis points to 15.2% due to unfavorable foreign exchange and the mix impact from integrating the Chaps men\u2019s sportswear operations.","Net income for the fourth quarter was $153 million, 20% greater than the prior year period and net income per diluted share increased 23% to $1.68. The significant increases in net income and net income per diluted share were achieved on top of strong double-digit increases in the prior year.","Higher operating income drove the strong growth in net income and net income per share. The effective tax rate of 30% compared to 25% in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201813 primarily due to a favorable discrete tax item in the prior year period.","For fiscal 2014, net income rose 3% to $776 million, and net income per diluted share increased 5% to $8.43.","Before I move onto segment level highlights, I want to discuss some changes we\u2019ve made in our segment reporting. As Jacki mentioned, we\u2019ve reshaped our organization structure to better support our long-term strategic growth objectives.","Specifically, we\u2019ve expanded the scope and reach of our centralized global shared service organization. We believe this change will increase productivity by enabling faster and more consistent execution against the company\u2019s key growth strategies.","It also provides an opportunity for us to leverage our scale in a more cost effective manner going forward. As a result, we\u2019ve organized key functions such as design, merchandizing, advertising, supply chain, finance and IT to operate on a global basis. And certain of those costs that used to be allocated to our wholesale, retail and licensing segments are now reflected in the unallocated corporate expense bucket.","While this changes the financial information of our segments, as you see in this morning\u2019s press release, the change has no impact on the company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.","Moving onto segment highlights for the quarter. Wholesale revenues of $983 million were an impressive 24% greater than the prior year period, driven by double-digit expansion for most merchandize categories in the Americas, including strong growth in accessories, the contribution from Chaps men\u2019s sportswear operations and double-digit growth in Europe.","Wholesale operating income grew 25% to $296 million in the fourth quarter on top of double-digit growth in the prior year period. And wholesale operating margin increased 40 basis points to 30.1%. The improvement in wholesale operating margin was due to stronger profitability for core operations, which more than offsets the mix impacts from the integration of Chaps men\u2019s sportswear and negative foreign exchange effects.","Fourth quarter retail segment sales rose 5% to $845 million, driven by growth in international operations and global store expansion, including newly transitioned operations in Australia and New Zealand. Excluding the impacts of discontinued businesses in foreign exchange, retail sales rose 7%.","Our North America retail operations were negatively affected by the cold and late start to spring and the Easter shift from March to April, which caused traffic to decline during the quarter. Double-digit growth in our European and Asian retail sales was strong enough to overcome the pressure in North America.","Retail segment operating income was $51 million in the fourth quarter and the retail operating margin was 6.1%, 400 basis points below the prior year. The lower retail operating income margin reflects costs associated with the company\u2019s global store and e-commerce development efforts and negative foreign exchange impacts.","Retail operating margin was also affected by increased promotional activity in the U.S. where the promotional tenor of the marketplace intensified in the post-holiday period due to the unseasonable weather conditions.","We anticipated a more intense promotional landscape when we provided our fourth quarter outlook in February, and our results actualized better than we expected at that point in time.","Licensing revenues of $39 million in the fourth quarter were 10% below the prior year as mid-single-digit growth in licensing revenues for Ralph Lauren products was more than offset by lower revenues as a result of the Chaps and Australia\/New Zealand license take-backs.","Operating income for the licensing segment was $35 million, in line with the prior year period.","Consolidated inventory was $1 billion at the end of the fiscal year, reflecting incremental inventory associated with newly transitioned Chaps and Australia\/New Zealand operations and investments to support anticipated sales growth for existing operations and new store openings.","We spent approximately $390 million on capital expenditures to support new retail stores, shop installations and infrastructure investments during the year.","Company repurchased 3.2 million shares of its common stock during fiscal \u201814 at a cost of $548 million, and returned an additional $149 million to shareholders via dividend repayments.","In total, the company returned approximately $700 million to shareholders during the year. At the end of the fourth quarter, the company had $580 million available under previously authorized share repurchase programs for future buybacks, and we ended the year with approximately $1.3 billion in cash and investments.","We are pleased with the strong fourth quarter and full year results, particularly with the accelerated top line trends. Disciplined planning and day-to-day execution enabled us to overcome meaningful foreign exchange and environmental headwinds and deliver higher profits even as we continue to make substantial investments in our global retail development and product innovation and in our infrastructure to support our long-term growth objectives.","Now I\u2019d like to turn to fiscal \u201815. As we articulated to you in February, we expect to maintain strong revenue growth this year. We are increasing our investments in the business to support that momentum and longer term shareholder value creation. The key areas of focus in fiscal \u201815 include global retail development, infrastructure investments and increased advertising and marketing.","With respect to retail store development, we plan to open approximately 40 to 45 new stores in fiscal 2015, a pace we\u2019ll likely maintain over the next several years. As a result, we\u2019ll incur substantial increase in pre-opening costs, particularly since our plans included a handful of large high-profile stores that are scheduled to open in the next two years.","Among the new store investments is a dual-gender Ralph Lauren flagship store in Hong Kong, as well as flagship stores for the Polo brand in New York and London. This confluence of flagship store activity is important to elevate the brand equity and image, but puts near-term pressure on our retail segment, as stores of that scale has significantly greater pre-opening costs and a lower profit contribution early in their development cycle.","With respect to infrastructure, the largest area of investment continues to be SAP implementation. In fiscal 2015, we will be completing the transition of our North America wholesale operations from legacy systems to SAP, and we will begin the implementation process in Europe.","Based on the current scope of the SAP initiative, fiscal \u201815 will likely represent the peak level of investment for us. While we anticipate substantial SAP costs in fiscal \u201816 and \u201817, we currently expect them to be below 2015 level. Over time, we believe SAP will enable productivity improvements and procurement savings in addition to providing the company with a robust global platform for future growth.","We also intend to begin a three-year project to upgrade our global e-commerce operating platform. We\u2019ve been operating on our existing platform for over a decade. While it continues to serve us well, we are proactively investing in capabilities that we believe will support accelerated revenue growth through increased productivity and improved conversion rates.","Consumers are clearly choosing to shop more online and our objective with the new platform is to create world-class shopping experiences that place us on the leading edge of the industry. To do this, we\u2019re moving to a more flexible platform, one that can better service a growing range of devices and enable more omni channel capabilities, as well as more sophisticated CRM activities that should drive stronger engagement, retention and repeat purchases. This initiative requires a mix of capital and operating expense that will likely intensify as the project progresses.","We\u2019ve also planned to substantial increase in advertising and marketing. There are three main areas of investment, each of which is aligned with our core growth objectives. The first is incremental funds for Polo brand, largely to support the launch of women\u2019s Polo, the opening of the Polo flagship store in New York City and additional Polo stores around the world.","Second main area is to improve our brand awareness in Greater China. We\u2019ve made excellent progress since opening the Prince\u2019s Building store last year, and we intent to build on that with stepped up outreach and messaging, including activities surrounding Ralph Lauren flagship store opening in Lee Gardens.","Final area of investment is for our luxury products, both to support the strong trends we are experiencing and to showcase our accessories offerings. All totaled, our planned investment activities represent about 200 basis points of operating margin pressure for 2015 compared to 2014, with global retail development accounting for about half of that investment.","We continue to expect these investments to deliver a rate of return that is well in excess of our cost of capital and they are meant to support shareholder value creation over the long-term.","With that as backdrop, I\u2019d like to review our initial outlook for the year, which was outlined in this morning\u2019s press release. For the full year fiscal 2015 period, we expect consolidated revenues to increase by 6% to 8%, led by retail segment growth. Revenue growth is expected to be primarily organic, as there is no material contribution from license take-backs this year and we expect foreign exchange impacts to be relatively neutral.","We expect our full year fiscal 2015 operating margin to be approximately 75 to 125 basis points below fiscal 2014 level, due to accelerated investment in our strategic growth initiatives and infrastructure. Excluding the impacts of the incremental investment in the company\u2019s strategic growth initiatives, underlying operating income growth would be up low-double-digits for the year.","Our fiscal 2015 tax rate is expected to be 30%. A higher level of investment that\u2019s flowing through the P&L is also reflected in our capital spending plans. We are planning approximately $400 million to $500 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2015 to support our global direct-to-consumer and infrastructure investments, as well as wholesale shop development for the women\u2019s Polo launch.","For the first quarter of 2015, we expect consolidated net revenues to increase by 3% to 5%, led by retail segment growth, as wholesale segment sales are expected to be essentially in line with the prior year period.","Our operating margin for the first quarter is expected to be approximately 300 basis points to 350 basis points below the prior year period, primarily due to higher operating expenses related to the timing of investments to support the company\u2019s strategic growth objectives.","In addition, we will not be anniversarying the one-time gain on the Chaps acquisition that we had in the prior year period, which accounts for about 100 basis points of this decline. The first quarter tax rate is estimated at 30%.","Our opportunities for growth are tremendous and our strategies are clear. We are focused on executing with excellence and are committed to being prudent stewards of capital and global brand development. The investments we are making in our long-term growth initiatives along with our new management structure are intended to maximize our sales and profit growth over the long-term.","At this point, we\u2019d like to open up the call for your questions. Operator, can you assist us with that?","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) One moment please for the first question. The first question comes from Omar\u00a0Saad with ISI Group. Your line is open.","Omar\u00a0Saad \u2013 ISI Group","Thanks. Good morning, and thanks for all the color heading into \u201815. It\u2019s really helpful. I wanted to ask you a question to maybe get you to elaborate a little bit on some of the realignments in the organizational shifts that are going on and the shared services, especially in the context of the recent announcement around Valerie becoming the President of the Luxury Ralph Lauren brands. Are you going to do something similar maybe with the Polo brand as its growing, and how it kind of all fits together and what\u2019s some of the benefits do you think are some of these realignments around the org structure? Thanks.","Jacki Nemerov","What we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve really looked at our overall structure, and what our plan was to consolidate our viewpoint of all three regions. So Europe and Asia had already had a consolidated approach between our retail business and our wholesale business.","We decided that there was value in doing that in the Americas, and in looking at the overall business in the region between North America and now South Americas in that world, and to be able to really strategize our viewpoint in an omni channel way. So to really look across our wholesale businesses, our retail businesses and make the best decisions as to how we should move forward in the region, rather than with a more siloed approach that we had operated under.","So the leadership of that is under Joy Herfel, who has spent 25 years in our company and ran our Polo and children\u2019s businesses, and has obviously run our biggest and most profitable businesses within the company.","Reporting to Joy is Kim Roy, who is Head of our U.S. Wholesale business, also a veteran of Ralph Lauren and has been with the company for 11 years. Has done an outstanding job in building the world of Lauren and Chaps and has great visibility during that time for the \u2013 to strengthen the balance of our wholesale division. And Kim is often running in her new role.","We also promoted and expanded Don Baum\u2019s role, who was Head of all of Manufacturing and Sourcing. We really saw great benefit in combining manufacturing sourcing with supply chain, and Don now has full oversight of that end-to-end seamless execution from beginning to the end of process from distribution out to our stores and our customers. And we believe that there will be great benefit overtime in the seamless and view of that organization.","We\u2019ve also had very strong success in our merchandizing organization by taking a global view in our product and our presentation worldwide. And led by David Rosenberg, we started with the consolidation in our men\u2019s merchandizing world and now we are expanding that based on its success addressing SKU count and a more cohesive presentation around the world to the balance of our businesses. And that\u2019s moving along quite well.","Valerie in her new role is focused on our luxury opportunity. As you know, Valerie comes to us with tremendous experience. Spent her career in that sector, and we believe that there is great opportunity in building both our apparel and of course our accessory business under her leadership.","In addition, we brought in Denise Incandela, who is now heading \u2013 came from Saks Fifth Avenue is now heading our online business. And we are very excited about having Denise on board, and the understanding of this space, both as a merchant and as a marketer, as you know she had the CMO role as well in Saks, and think there are many opportunities that we have not yet taken advantage of that Denise has really brought to the table.","So, as we are looking at our entire organization and we are looking at the strength of that leadership and the past seven months that we\u2019ve all been operating under this structure, we\u2019ve already seen some very, very positive results.","And our Polo brand is really built centrally designed, merchandized, marketed and then distributed in the regions, each taking that as a key centerpiece for what we believe the opportunities are going forward, both in Polo stores, Polo product expansion with women\u2019s and clothing for men\u2019s and of course with the exciting entry into the market of our new store on Fifth Avenue, which is expected to open at around Labor Day, and then of course the Ralph Lauren Restaurant that will follow that opening. So that kind of summarizes our leadership changes.","Chris Peterson","The other thing I would say, Omar,\u00a0to your question is that, as we\u2019re \u2013 really a lot of these moves are meant to globalize the company. And it starts with an underpinning from a system standpoint which is what the SAP project is about, which is what the e-commerce re-platforming project is about. A lot of the management moves that we\u2019re doing are taking multiple organizations that we had acquired over the years through license take-backs that operated in silos, and combining organizations so that instead of doing the same job three times or four times, we do it once.","And over time, what we believe and what we\u2019re already starting to see opportunity for is we think that\u2019s going to lead to significant opportunity for cost leverage, which should result in SG&A leverage overtime as we get into the new structure and as we begin to leverage. It also should allow us to be more consistent as a brand across the world, and it should allow us to rollout faster new initiatives from an innovation standpoint.","So we\u2019re excited about it. I think we\u2019re early days into sort of this globalization. And I think a lot of these themes are going to play out more fully when we get into fiscal \u201816 than in fiscal \u201815.","James Hurley","Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti \u2013 UBS","Good morning guys. I guess two quick questions here. One is, as I think about the factory outlets in the U.S. I think those have been struggling with traffic for a lot of last year. And those are obviously very big percent of the U.S. retail comps. Can you tell us a little bit more about your thinking in that channel based on what you\u2019re seeing now, and if you think sales there turn back to positive in fiscal \u201815? And then Chris, you also talked about \u2013 obviously gave us a lot of good color on a number of initiatives that are baked into the SG&A guidance for this year. There was a lot of projects that have varying durations, and as we look at the longer term comments that you\u2019re making and think about our models which tend to focus on longer term for the Ralph Lauren company in particular, how you guys are thinking about maybe some of the payback period analysis that you did, or whether the EBIT margins can start to expand as soon as fiscal \u201816? Thanks.","Chris Peterson","Okay. I\u2019ll start with the factory channel. So in the fourth quarter, we saw actually very good growth in the factory channel in Europe and Asia. The U.S. factory business was down in the fourth quarter and that was because we saw traffic \u2013 again our fourth quarter is Jan through March, and the traffic trend that we experienced in the fourth quarter was down double-digits in traffic in that period, which had a significant impact in the company\u2019s comps.","The encouraging part of that is that in the first quarter, to-date, the first part of April and May, we\u2019re already seeing the traffic trends reaccelerate in the U.S. to the factory outlet channel. So we\u2019re seeing not the same trend that we saw in January-March in the U.S. market.","From a longer term perspective on some of the margin trends going forward. I think you\u2019re right that some of the things have different payback periods. So I would characterize if you wanted to parse it into two broad areas. The infrastructure investments that we\u2019re making, whether it be SAP or the e-commerce platform, we\u2019re likely to be in investment mode on an aggregate of those two things for a couple of years, because the e-commerce re-platforming is a two or three year project, where you\u2019re investing before you turn on the new platform.","On the flipside, the Polo investments that we\u2019re making, whether it be women\u2019s Polo or the flagship stores, the start of the rollout of new stores, we should start seeing and be able to report a much stronger progress on that as we get towards the end of this fiscal year, because we\u2019ll have experience in the market when women\u2019s Polo launches in the fall, and we\u2019ll began to get some initial reads from the stores that we\u2019re opening.","So it\u2019s too soon for us to say how all of that nets together from a fiscal \u201816 and beyond perspective externally, because we typically provide guidance one year out, but that\u2019s a little bit of how we expect the underlying trends to play out.","James Hurley","Next question.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from David\u00a0Glick with Buckingham Research.","David\u00a0Glick \u2013 Buckingham Research","Thank you. Just continuing on that trend, I think the concern that we\u2019re hearing from investors is that the operating margin has been down, let\u2019s just call it 100 basis points a year FY\u201914 and then kind of taking the midpoint in FY\u201915. You\u2019ve given us a lot of qualitative. I mean is it reasonable to assume that you could see at least some margin stabilization in FY\u201916 assuming that the Polo initiative and the new store openings open as you plan them? And then second for Jacki. Just when will we start to see the Polo women\u2019s merchandize in stores? And I am curious what to make up the American Living appearance at Macy\u2019s, whether that\u2019s a significant opportunity for you guys?","Chris Peterson","So I guess on the operating margin. Let me start with fiscal \u201814 just to make sure we\u2019re clear. So in fiscal \u201814, the primary driver of the operating margin being down in fiscal \u201814 versus the year ago was foreign exchange. So if you took out the impact of foreign exchange on our profitability, our earnings per share would be up double-digits in fiscal \u201814.","In fiscal \u201815, I think we\u2019ve provided perspective around the impacts of the investments, which together account for 200 basis points of the operating margin pressure, which the midpoint of our guidance range is down 100 basis points. So if you looked at the operating margin excluding those investments, the operating margin would be up 100 basis points in fiscal \u201815.","As I mentioned on fiscal \u201816, there is going to be varying impacts of these investments, because they have different payback periods. And we\u2019ll provide more color on that in our normal guidance pattern as we go forward.","Jacki Nemerov","On Polo women\u2019s, David, we\u2019ll start to ship Polo women\u2019s in mid-to-end August and the first impact will be in our retail stores over the Labor Day weekend, and in our wholesale customers approximately the same time. We are building beautiful shops as a backdrop for the Polo women\u2019s brand. We have a lot of confidence in that opportunity, and feel that, as I said we can get relation to what we are doing in Polo men\u2019s and which we\u2019re fairly confident about that we can really grow that business and we\u2019re really excited about our fall shipments for that brand.","As it relates to American Living, as you know we had exclusively at J.C. Penny up until the time that they have their change in management. And for many reasons we decided to withdraw the brand from J.C. Penny. Interestingly, we had built it into quite a big successful volume brand for J.C. Penny and felt that it had that a great future and kind of put it on the sidelines until we could determine what the next opportunity might be.","We had a great conversation with Macy\u2019s and we decided that we would utilize the American Living brand in conjunction with their American Icon marketing strategy which incorporates Memorial Day into July 4 into Labor Day. And so we shipped the brand for beginning of April. And it has been a very exciting launch so far, and we are very, very pleased with the results.","We have another concept package going in for holiday. And then I believe we\u2019ll determine how we build the brand and opportunity from there. And that\u2019s \u2013 as I said, it\u2019s very early days at this point, but nice results.","James Hurley","Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Kate\u00a0McShane with Citi Research.","Kate\u00a0McShane \u2013 Citigroup","Thanks, good morning. Is there any sales pulled into Q4 from Q1 and that\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing deceleration in the Q1 top line guidance, or just Q1 fiscal year \u201815. And is there a change in guidance as you conveyed today on the top line, I had noted that you were guiding high-single-digits for fiscal year \u201815 and now 6% to 8% it seems a little bit lower than that, so I was hoping you can reconcile that for us? Thanks.","Chris Peterson","Sure. So on the first question, I would say, yes. There was a little bit of shift in timing of the wholesale business. March and April are in a lot of cases viewed somewhat together. And so we do have a set of shipments that go out March 25. Some of those shipments went out a little bit early at the request of our customers, but it wasn\u2019t a material impact.","One of the key drivers of that is Easter. So I think it\u2019s probably a fair comment that looking at the wholesale business on a rolling basis as opposed to a quarter-to-quarter basis is a more accurate \u2013 is a better reflection of the trends in that business. And you see that in our guidance for the first quarter where we had very strong wholesale shipments in the January-March period, but in the April to June period, we\u2019re effectively guiding wholesale shipments about flat versus year ago. Over the six month period, it will be a very strong wholesale pick-up.","On the top line for the total company, yes, we expect high-single-digits. I think 6% to 8% is consistent with that in my view. So there is really no change in our thinking there going forward.","James Hurley","Next question.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Lindsay\u00a0Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay\u00a0Drucker Mann \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thanks. Good morning everyone. Just to follow-up on that question. It sounds as if \u2013 even if we were to adjust for some of the shipment timing that you U.S. wholesale business is still running up very strong high-single, maybe a low-double-digit type of growth. Is that \u2013 first of all, am I right in thinking about it that way? And second of all, do you contemplate that sort of growth rate continuing as we move into the back part of the year? And for your sales guidance of the 6% to 8% for the full year, how much incremental sales from these new initiatives are contemplated in that guidance?","Chris Peterson","So yes, I would say that the U.S. wholesale business continues to operate very strongly. If you look at the sell-out of the business and our customers, we continue to gain share consistently in that channel. I think the other encouraging thing in our wholesale segment results, is as we talked about at the last call, we had made a strategic pullback in shipments primarily in Southern Europe on the specialty store channel. We\u2019ve now annualized that, and so we\u2019re starting to see a return to strong wholesale growth in the European business as well. And so we had a double-digit increase in wholesale in the quarter in Europe as well.","So I think the trends in our wholesale business broadly are very encouraging, and I think we expect them to continue.","On the new initiatives, I think the 6% to 8% revenue growth is effectively organic growth in our view. There is no acquisitions in that. There is no foreign exchange in that. I think the women\u2019s Polo impact during the year is going to be somewhat muted, because we\u2019re launching in fall, so we\u2019ll have a part year impact, and we\u2019re replacing the Blue Label business. And so during the transition, I think we see opportunity, but I think we see even stronger opportunity as we begin to get into fiscal \u201816, as we really get behind the women\u2019s Polo line, and as we open more freestanding Polo stores.","James Hurley","Next question.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Liz Dunn with Macquarie.","Liz Dunn \u2013 Macquarie Capital","Hi, thanks for taking my question. If Roger is listening, best of luck. It\u2019s been an absolute pleasure. And Jacki and Chris, thank you so much for all the detail, particularly quantifying some of the things like e-commerce and the amount of pressure that you\u2019re expecting next year on the operating margin. In terms of that 6% to 8%, I don\u2019t mean to keep hitting the same point, but does that imply that as we go forward perhaps beyond fiscal \u201815 that the 6% to 8% will accelerate or could potentially accelerate as some of these growth initiatives begin to really kick in? And then relative to the accessories business, are you Jacki, do you think that the progress that we\u2019ve seen so far has been slower than you anticipated, or is it just one of these businesses that takes time to build and now you\u2019re finally seeing some signs that that growth is beginning to accelerate? Thanks.","Chris Peterson","I\u2019ll address the long-term revenue growth. So on the long-term revenue growth, I think our view is that we\u2019d like to try to target high-single-digit growth, sort of on a continuous basis, but in any given year I think we want to be prepared for mid-single-digit growth. And a lot of it\u2019s going to depend on the macroeconomic environment, the timing of initiatives, the timing of store openings. But I think our goal, if you will, is to try to be a consistent high-single-digit type of grower.","Jacki Nemerov","On the accessory front, Liz, I think that we are pleased with our introduction, beginning in accessories in 2008 as that was not a core competence of the company, and we have made it one since in two critical areas, one being the luxury accessory business. And I think that over this last year, we\u2019ve seen some great traction with the Ricky and continue to fuel that opportunity.","We\u2019ve also had some great success with our Lauren accessory business. And we are seeing very nice growth in that brand as well. So I would say that in our whole leather goods category, we\u2019ve accomplished a 20% compound annual rate growth. So, look, we always hope for more, but we are pleased with where we are and we think we finally have put in the right foundations to continue to build from.","James Hurley","Next question.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray.","Erinn Murphy \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Thank you. Good morning. I was just hoping, if you could follow up on the strength that you saw in Europe in the fourth quarter. Could you elaborate a little bit more about country specific regional trends that you are seeing? And then with the pace of wholesale growth there, should we assume that whether you are also seeing that type of double-digit growth in the fall order books? Thank you.","Chris Peterson","Yes. So I guess if I were to step back and talk about Europe for the year, we\u2019ve pretty consistently grown our retail segment revenues in Europe, double-digits every quarter for the past year, but we saw wholesale really start to accelerate a little bit in the third quarter and then get to double-digits in the fourth quarter. And that\u2019s what allowed us to translate into double-digit growth in Europe in the fourth quarter, with both, retail and the wholesale at that pace.","I think we\u2019re at a place where we expect that to continue in terms of revenue growth going forward in a strong way. If you look at the trends within the region, I think we\u2019re seeing the U.K. is probably the strongest part of our business, the GDP has improved there markedly. I think we\u2019re seeing Southern Europe stabilize. So it\u2019s no longer going down, it\u2019s not necessarily going up, but it\u2019s stabilizing. And I think we\u2019re seeing some strength in the Scandinavia region in Germany and some stability in France.","The other encouraging trend that I would point to in Europe is that, as we\u2019ve invested in resetting the brand image in Greater China, particularly with the opening of the men\u2019s Prince\u2019s flagship store and a number of the other luxury stores, we\u2019re starting to see the Chinese tourist business in Europe increase at a significant rate, off of a low base, but we\u2019re up very, very strong double-digits in terms of our business to Chinese tourists in Europe, which is helping to fuel the growth of that business right now.","And we think as we open the Lee Gardens flagship store and increase the marketing and advertising spending behind Greater China, where we have a low awareness, we think that\u2019s going to translate through both in Europe and in the U.S. business.","James Hurley","Operator, we\u2019re ready for our last question.","Operator","Thank you. The final question comes from Joan\u00a0Payson with Barclays.","Joan\u00a0Payson \u2013 Barclays Capital","Hi, good morning, and thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to ask another question on Europe actually and the Polo full price opportunity in particular. Given your store network over there, how many retail stores do you think the region could support overall? And you also mentioned the 100 to 200 store number for Polo full price being a little more weighted towards Asia and Latin America, but how do you really think about the allocation in terms of the regional perspective with those?","Chris Peterson","I think we see a big opportunity for full price stores in Europe. We\u2019re in the middle of prioritizing locations around the world and we\u2019re doing it on a global basis. I think, we think there is both in opportunity in Western Europe and we think there is an opportunity in Central and Eastern Europe and the Middle East for Polo stores. If you think about the allocation of that 100 to 200, I would expect that maybe we could have 20% to 30% of those stores in Europe over time.","Jacki Nemerov","We\u2019re excited also about our London opening on Regent Street for Polo, which we believe will set the tone for Polo in Europe.","Chris Peterson","All right. Well, thank you for joining us this morning. I think we\u2019re pleased with the fourth quarter results that we have reported today I think. And we\u2019re looking forward to coming out and talking more about it and following up with you. And please feel free to call Jim or myself with any additional questions. Thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation.

Instructions on how to ask a question will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mrs. Evren Kopelman. Please go ahead.","Evren Kopelman","Good morning, and thank you for joining Ralph Lauren's second quarter fiscal 2018 conference call. With me today are Patrice Louvet, the company's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jane Nielsen, Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions, which we ask that you limit to one per caller.","During today's call, we will be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal securities laws, including our financial outlook. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees. And our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.","Our expectations contain many risks and uncertainties.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. Our second quarter results demonstrate that we continue to execute on our plan to drive efficiencies and set a strong foundation for future growth.","While we're certainly not where we want to be yet, we are encouraged that second quarter revenue was at the high end of our guidance and we outperformed on operating margin, as our quality-of-sales initiatives over delivered our expectations. This focus will continue through the rest of the year, and we are on track to deliver our full year targets.","Over the past several months, I've met with many of our key suppliers and customers and thousands of our employees all over the world, these interactions have reaffirmed my excitement about the opportunity for our brand globally, I am incredibly inspired by the passion and commitment of our teams and confident in their capabilities.","I've also spent a lot of time with Ralph, and we have developed a very close and productive partnership. I'm particularly excited by some of the early progress we're making together to drive the business forward.","Moving ahead, we are focused on reigniting quality growth, while continuing to drive productivity. This balance of growth and productivity will translate into value creation for all of our stakeholders. Our key initiatives include: First, elevating our brand by improving quality of sales and distribution.","Second, evolving our product and marketing to increase our reach and appeal with new consumers. Third, expanding our digital and international presence, and fourth, working in new ways to drive productivity and agility.","While there's still a lot of work to be done, I'd like to take you through some of the early signs of progress across each of these initiatives. First, elevating our brand by improving quality of sales and distribution.","In the second quarter, we continued to reduce our discount rates and increase our average unit retail, which was up 5% across the company's direct-to-consumer network.","Gross margin was up 300 basis points to last year. We continue to close unproductive distribution in retail and wholesale and significantly reduced off-price shipments.","Second, evolving our product and marketing to increase our reach and appeal with new consumers. Within product, we are driving a much more disciplined assortment, focusing on our icons, renewing our core items to make them relevant to today's consumer and developing limited editions to inject energy and excitement into our brand.","The result of this work is most evident in the improving sellout trend we're seeing in Polo with fall seasonal product. While it is still early in the season, we are seeing increased full price sell-through with higher AURs and gross margins versus last year in both men's and women's apparel.","Within Polo Fall seasonal products, some of the bestsellers are our icons and updated core items, including the varsity jacket, the American flag in polar bear sweaters, the denim trucker jacket, embellished military-inspired styles and novelty mist [ph] with color blocking. These renewed icons are especially resonating with millennials. We're also seeing success in the denim category with updated fits, washes, lighter weights and incorporating stretch into the majority of the overall offering.","In addition, we're beginning to offer limited-edition products on a regular basis to create more reasons for consumers to engage with us. These launches are integrated across product, digital media and our sales channels to create a consistent experience for the consumer.","As part of this, we launched the Stadium collection in September. The original Stadium collection was introduced to celebrate the 1992 Summer Olympics, and many pieces became iconic collector's items.","We released both replicas and modern interpretations at select Ralph Lauren and third-party stores around the world. We sold out several million dollars' worth within hours. Importantly, 78% of the people who purchased Stadium at a Ralph Lauren store in North America were new consumers to the brand.","Another example of limited-edition is our monthly Polo shirt launches, including the collegiate, Eldridge and torn jacket. Each has achieved strong full price sell-through worldwide. We will continue limited-edition series in the future.","In marketing, we are leveraging new channels and partnerships, especially in digital and social media that will help the brand reach and acquire new consumers. For example, I'm sure many of you saw our terrific show in September where Ralph and the team created a truly unique experience in its garage in Bedford.","We leverage our fashion show as a media event with a specific focus on Instagram, Facebook, Tmall, WeChat, Youku and RalphLauren.com. The show generated over a billion social media impressions, more than double our February show through an expanded list of global social live stream hosts and 24 hours of Instagram stories.","We also had many celebrity dressing moments that increased our social media impact, including Blake Lively, Shailene Woodley, Elle Fanning, Chance the Rapper, Bella Hadid and Kendall Jenner, both of whom walked our September show, Brooklyn Beckham and Romeo Beckham, Li Bingbing and Yao Chen among others, as well as the face of our new fragrance and brand ambassador, Jessica Chastain.","In addition, in the U.S. alone, we have three major magazine covers over the past couple of months featuring our collection dresses. These included Angelina Jolie on the cover of Harper's Bazaar 150th Anniversary issue, Jennifer Lawrence on the cover of Vogue for its 125 December anniversary issue, and J. Lo on the cover of Vanity Fair this month.","Our sports marketing also had a good summer. Based on an outstanding season, 24-year-old Polo golf ambassador, Justin Thomas, was voted PGA Tour Player of the Year, generating tremendous media exposure, including 520 million estimated impression at the PGA championship.","And our sponsorship of the U.S. Open Tennis Tournament featured our successful create-your-own customization initiative with on-site printers that drove significant traffic to our shops. In addition, the special edition court sneaker, worn by on-court tournament staff, was completely sold out and attracted new consumers to our brand.","Moving onto our third initiative, expanding our digital and international presence. We have significant growth potential in Asia, specifically in China, which represents our greatest geographic growth opportunity for the company. Over the past two years, we've elevated the brand in Asia and built a strong foundation for the business by improving quality of sales and overall profitability.","We are now beginning to pivot to quality growth while continuing our productivity work. As you know, we are underrepresented in Asia, with only 13% of our business in the region.","In the second quarter, constant currency revenue grew 4% in Asia and comparable store sales were up 3%. We expect this trend to continue in the balance of the year. A key driver of our Asia growth going forward will be Mainland China, where we have very low levels of penetration but strong brand awareness.","In fiscal 2017, we generated approximately $50 million of revenue on Mainland China, which represents less than 1% of our total company revenue. Based on Millward Brown data, we know that Polo's aided brand awareness in Mainland China is 83%.","This is a significantly higher figure than many of our competitors which have greater penetration than us in China. We will drive growth through both increased marketing and distribution, both online and with physical stores.","Within marketing, we have increased our digital efforts and engagement with local influencers. We are tailoring social content to the Chinese consumer and dressing many Chinese celebrities with social followings nearing 1 billion in total.","In September, we had over 12 million Chinese views of our fashion show. We're also ramping up our presence on digital platforms. And in the second quarter, we successfully launched on T-mall and JD.com, and with commerce on WeChat.","On these sites, we are creating digital shop in shop environments with a consistent brand experience, tailored product stories and an assortment that is carefully curated by our merchants.","On WeChat, we sold out the limited-edition Polo shirt within 48 hours. We are offering many omnichannel features to Chinese consumers, including free in-store tailoring and returns and an innovative mobile-based product authentication process using WeChat to recognize QR codes.","Complementing this digital presence in China, the team is successfully expanding our fleet of physical stores while also improving the profitability of the portfolio. Importantly we have a harmonized pricing architecture across channels.","We've opened 15 smaller format stores year-to-date in Mainland China and by the end of fiscal 2018 we expect to have a total of 60 stores on the Mainland. We have a much more rigorous approach to site selection, and these stores are generating strong sales productivity and returns that are accretive to our overall business. The average age of our customer in these stores is 34 years old, with a 50-50 male-female mix.","We're seeing clear demand for our higher-priced more fashion-forward merchandise and a higher accessories penetration rate in China compared to other geographies, which shows opportunity. These achievements provide strong proof points for our accelerated growth strategy in Mainland China.","Taken together with Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, our goal for Greater China is to reach almost $0.5 billion of revenue in five years from about $170 million in fiscal 2017, driven by both comp growth and new distribution guidance. We will continue to act with rigor in this market and are committed to elevating the brand and delivering sustainable, profitable growth.","In closing, we are moving in the right direction with a clear focus on creating value for all of our stakeholders by continuing to drive productivity and reigniting quality growth. Ralph and I have the same vision for the brand and the same goal, which is to get our great company back to winning. He and I are deeply committed to evolving how our iconic brand is experienced and expressed to win over consumers.","We will continue to build on our early progress by driving the four key initiatives I outlined. Elevating our brand by improving quality of sales and distribution; evolving our product and marketing to increase our reach and appeal with new consumers; expanding our digital and international presence; and working in new ways to drive productivity and agility.","With that, I'll turn it over to Jane and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions.","Jane Nielsen","Thank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results showed strong progress on resetting the business to a healthier base. Our quality of sales improvements are delivering higher AURs, lower discounts, expanded gross margins, higher inventory turns and significant growth in free cash flow.","Our performance this quarter was achieved despite meaningful impact from the tragic hurricanes that affected Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico. In total, we experienced about 1 point of comp pressure in North America as a result of the hurricanes.","But our results do not tell the full story, and I am incredibly proud of our teams for their swift and tireless actions to ensure that all our employees were safe, to bring relief their communities and to reopen our stores quickly following these devastating events.","Let me now turn to our results. Second quarter revenues declined 9% on both a reported basis and in constant currency, which was at the high end of our guidance. Adjusted operating margin was 13.4%, 100 basis points above last year on a reported basis and 70 points higher in constant currency.","Gross margin in the second quarter was up 300 basis points to last year and up 290 basis points in constant currency, driven by both average unit retail increases and discount rate reductions.","Consistent with previous quarters, approximately half of the increase was driven by reduced promotional activity and half by favorable geographic and channel mix. We also remain on track with our target expense savings for the year.","Operating expenses were down 5% to last year in the second quarter, driven by rightsizing our cost structure, closing unprofitable distribution and changing product development processes through SKU optimization. This productivity allows us to fund our early growth initiatives while delivering our performance commitments for the year.","Moving on to our segment performance. Starting with North America. We continue to execute our plan to come back to profitable growth. Revenue was down 16% in the second quarter, reflecting substantial progress on quality-of-sales initiatives. Despite the challenging top line, our team was able to expand adjusted operating margin 150 basis points.","In North America wholesale, we continue to take deliberate actions to ensure the health of our brand and to set us up for long-term success. Execution progress this quarter focused on distribution closures, brand exits, off-price reductions, receipt fullbacks and lower promotional level. These actions accounted for approximately 70% of the 22% decline in the U.S. wholesale revenue this quarter.","Our pullback in the off-price channel drove lower penetration within our North America wholesale business. This will continue through the remainder of the year. Consumer demand and channel dynamics remained challenging in North America wholesale and contributed to comp declines estimated in the mid- to high single digits.","However, our digital wholesale business continued to be a highlight and posted growth last year. We are addressing the weak underlying demand by evolving our product and marketing and by investing in our wholesale store environments to improve the consumer experience.","As an example, as part of our Stadium launch in September, we dropped a special capsule of knitwear items with the famous P wing logo in select Macy's and Bloomingdale's stores with customers lining up for the product overnight. As Patrice highlighted, early reads on fall product performance in Polo has shown an improving trend, which is promising.","In our directly operated e-commerce business in North America, comps were down 18% in the quarter, as expected, but gross margin expanded significantly as we continued our strategy to aggressively reduce promotional activity to both ensure price coherency across our channel and to enhance the overall brand and shopping experience for our digital flagship consumer.","Following our decision to shift to a cloud-based e-commerce platform, our digital and IT teams moved with urgency and outstanding dedication to implement the platform switch in time for the upcoming holiday season. As a result of their work, two weeks ago, we went live with our new cloud-based platform for RalphLauren.com in North America.","Now that our new infrastructure platform is in place, we will grow the digital flagship experience for our customers by adding functionality and evolving the creative to the second half of this year. As the new site develops, it will help us create a more brand-enhancing and consistent experience for consumers and better insights and functionality for us.","Moving on to Europe. Revenue increased 4% on a reported basis and was relatively flat with prior year in constant currency in the second quarter. Our teams in Europe delivered adjusted operating profit growth with margins up 350 basis points to last year and up 370 basis points in constant currency, driven by gross margin expansion.","Wholesale revenue in Europe decreased 1% in constant currency. The negative impact of brand exits and significant reductions in off-price liquidation was partially offset by a shift in shipment timing from the first quarter that benefited the second quarter. The underlying trend of the full price wholesale business is about flat to last year.","In the retail channel, constant currency comps were down 6% in Europe as we continued quality of sales work to rebalance pricing levels across channels. While this impacted comp growth negatively in the second quarter, gross margin and AUR were both up and the discount rate was down significantly.","Going forward, we will continue this focus in Europe, which will negatively impact comps. This is similar to the strategy we pursued in Asia, and they are now delivering positive comps.","Turning to Asia. Revenue was flat to last year on a reported basis and up 4% in constant currency. Adjusted operating margin was up 750 basis points and up 580 basis points in constant currency. Our team is reigniting growth in the Asia region while continuing to focus on productivity.","This was the second quarter of positive comps, which increased 3% in constant currency, comp growth was driven by increased traffic and conversion and were keyed in the context of strong quality-of-sales initiatives. We expect continued comp growth in Asia as we upgrade our distribution network and continue our marketing initiatives to amplify the brand.","Turning to our store fleet. We continued to improve our retail network through the closure of underperforming locations and opening new stores with improved adjacencies. In the second quarter, we opened 14 stand-alone stores and 34 concessions.","We closed 12 stand-alone stores and 37 concessions, ending this quarter with 469 stand-alone stores and 622 concessions on a global basis. At yearend, we expect our stand-alone count to be up slightly to last year and our concession network to have a net increase of 20 locations, primarily in Asia.","Moving on to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet is significantly stronger than last year and is a reflection of the operational progress we are making. At the end of the second quarter, inventory declined 26% to $865 million versus last year.","This inventory reduction is driven by prior year restructuring actions and more effective buying processes, including a proactive pullback in receipts. We will continue to focus on inventory productivity and matching inventory flows with demand.","We ended the second quarter with $1.7 billion in cash and short- and long-term investments, up from $1.1 billion at the end of last year's second quarter. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $590 million versus $692 million last year. We generated $362 million of free cash flow in the second quarter, up from $67 million in the prior year period.","Now I'd like to turn to guidance for the full year and the third quarter of fiscal 2018. As a reminder, this guidance excludes restructuring and other charges. We are maintaining our constant currency revenue guidance for fiscal 2018 and raising the low end of our operating margin guidance. We continue to expect revenues to decline 8% to 9% for the year, excluding the impact of foreign currency.","Brand and distribution exits in both wholesale and retail account for approximately half of the decline, with quality-of-sales initiatives and challenging traffic trends representing the remainder, partially offset by new distribution and product and marketing initiatives.","Foreign currency is now expected to have approximately 80 basis points of benefit to revenue growth in fiscal 2018 versus previous guidance of minimal impact, given the recent movements in foreign exchange rates.","Based on performance in the first half and targeted investments in the fourth quarter, we now expect operating margin for fiscal 2018 to be 9.5% to 10.5% in constant currency, up from our previous guidance of 9% to 10.5%.","Foreign currency is now expected to have minimal impact on operating margin for fiscal 2018 versus previous guidance of 40 to 50 basis points of pressure. For the third quarter, we expect revenues to be down 6% to 8% in constant currency. Foreign currency is expected to have approximately 160 to 170 basis points of benefit to revenue growth.","Operating margin for the third quarter is expected to be down 50 to 70 basis points in constant currency. While we expect gross margin to continue to expand into the third quarter, SG&A rate will create some pressure as we start the lap last year's expense reductions and invest in growth initiatives around marketing, product and stores. Foreign currency is estimated to benefit operating margin by approximately 10 to 20 basis points in the third quarter.","Looking towards the fourth quarter, revenue will continue to be pressured for two reasons: First, we expect to shift in wholesale shipments that benefit Q3 and pressure Q4; second, a large portion of the March quarter is driven by clearance sales post-holiday.","To support our quality-of-sales initiatives, we have planned for less clearance inventory, which will limit the clearance sales volumes this year year-over-year. This will offset some of the benefits from the Easter shift in Q4.","Also for the fourth quarter, we expect SG&A expenses to grow versus last year as we accelerate our marketing initiatives and grow our marketing investments double-digits in the second half. We believe this is the right decision for the long term as we balance near-term margin pressure with setting the company up to return to growth.","In terms of restructuring charges, we continue to expect approximately $200 million for the year. In the second quarter, we recognized $30 million of restructuring and other charges. We expect our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 to be approximately 25% and for the third quarter to be approximately 23%.","Let me finish by reviewing our priorities for cash and capital structure. In times of dynamic change, a strong balance sheet is a strategic asset. We are committed to maintaining our strong balance sheet and investment-grade credit rating to provide strategic flexibility, liquidity and access to the capital markets. Within that context, our first priority for cash is to invest in our business and lay the foundation for future profitable growth.","Our second priority is to return capital to shareholders with a commitment to maintaining our dividend. Excess cash flow beyond current and future investment and dividend needs will be considered for future potential share repurchases. We are not planning share repurchases for fiscal 2018.","We make this determination based on the cash needs of our business, sector dynamics and with consideration for the uncertain environment around U.S. tax reform. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2018 are estimated at $225 million, down from the previous guidance of $300 million.","We want to shift capital investments behind consumer-facing initiatives that have a demonstrated proof-of-concept and healthy rate of return. In closing, we continue to make strong progress on our operational efficiencies.","We are elevating our brand and have strengthened our balance sheet and improved our cash flow so that we have the resources to fuel future profitable growth. This, combined with Ralph's enduring vision and the commitment of our teams around the world, puts us in a strong position to drive value for all our stakeholders.","With that, I'd like to open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. You may ask your question.","Matthew Boss","Thanks and nice early progress. So Patrice, on the four initiatives you outlined, and as we think about that time line for change here, what inning would you say each of the 4 initiatives fall into that?","Patrice Louvet","Good morning Matt. So let's take them one by one. First, elevating the brand through quality of sales and distribution. I think as you've heard, we've made a very good progress on improving the quality of our distribution, shutting down stores, exiting brands like denim and supply, pulling back in wholesale both in terms of points of distribution.","You know we're down 20% to 25% points of distribution in department stores. And also, as Jane just mentioned, significantly reducing shipments to the off-price channel's. So if you use a baseball analogy, which is very topical, this morning, I'd say probably seventh inning when it comes to quality of distribution.","On the progress for quality of sales, I'd say, on this one, we're making good progress. You've seen us reduce the discounts and that's very visible through the 5% increase in AUR this past quarter. I struggle to provide an inning on this one because this is a game that never stops, right. We want to continuously reduce our level of discounting and improve our quality of sales. So that's on the first one.","On the second one, our product and marketing. I'd say early days on products, so probably the first inning. We're beginning to see the benefits of the work that started many months ago, starting to appear in-store now.","You heard some of the examples that we quoted. I think what we're seeing is a more disciplined assortment. We're seeing fewer SKUs, we're seeing the beginning of our limited additions.","So, again, I think probably first inning there. I'd also say probably first inning on marketing. You've seen the support behind the show. We're getting more influencers to come into the brand, but a lot of our programs actually are going to start to kick in more in Q3, Q4 and beyond. So I'd say very, very early days on this one as well, with a lot more to come.","On the third one, which is expanding our digital and our international presence, likewise, I think we're early earnings on digital. We very clear, that's going to be a good vector of growth for us in the future both in North America and globally.","I think as we talked altogether a few weeks back, we really look at digital through three lenses, our own site, wholesale.com and pure players, our own sites or RalphLauren.com, Jane talk about the site that we just re-launched our platform and so now, it's about creating an amazing experience for consumers. That's going to happen over the next few months, so I'd say probably first inning on that one as well.","Wholesale.com is something we're really keen to win in, so not just play, but play to win, which means growing share. We have really good partnerships across the various regions on that.","Couple encouraging data points for this past quarter, we actually grew share in wholesale.com in Europe in Q2, and we grew share in wholesale.com in the U.S. on men's apparel and women's apparel. So we're encouraged by that, obviously a lot more to be done but a key vector of growth for us in the future as well.","And then finally, on pure players, it's early days as well because if you look obviously, we have a very good partnership with Zalando in Europe and very happy with how that's playing out. We just signed up with Tmall, JD.com and WeChat, so it's been weeks so a lot more to be done on that front. But excited about what we can do and where we can go.","On international, and what's exciting on international is there's no lack of opportunity. When you look at how our business splits today international and North America. We have significant growth potential in our international.","You've heard us call out China and Mainland China as our number one priority internationally. The team on the ground has done a lot of work to get the fundamentals right over the past couple of years, so now it's really about accelerating our growth.","So I'd say early innings in terms of the accelerating the growth. We're opening stores, we're expanding our digital footprint. We're being more active in terms of marketing with the Chinese consumer.","And then, finally, our fourth initiative, which is working in new ways to drive productivity and agility. So as you've seen I think through the numbers, the team has done I think a very good job on productivity. And this is one where I can't innings either because this game never stops, right, productivity is going to be something we're going to do nonstop in addition to reigniting growth.","We know we have areas of cost that we can do a better job on and everyone's really focused on being as effective and efficient as we can be across the entire business. And then on agility, which is critical to winning today's context, I'd say, early innings as well.","We're putting a lot of emphasis culturally on empowerment and enablement and driving a sense of urgency, putting decisions on the clock so that we just move with pace because that's what the consumers and the retailer landscape demands if we're going to get back to winning.","So, overall, as we kind of summarize the game, some phases are kind of midway through the game towards the later end of the game, assuming the game ends in nine innings. And others were at the very beginning, which I think is quite exciting for what's possible moving forward for us.","Jane Nielsen","Next question, please.","Operator","The next question comes from Brian Tunick with RBC. You may ask your question.","Brian Tunick","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Jane Nielsen","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Tunick","Good morning, Jane. Two question, maybe Patrice can talk about how he envisions maybe the North America channel mix, particularly maybe in wholesale. What do you think the right mix of the department stores versus off-price or digital wholesale should look like over the next couple of years?","And then as we think about the revenue growth maybe in the next year or two , should we be thinking about that stabilization next year, is there a chance to grow once we get beyond sort of this pullback in distribution and quality of sales? Thanks very much.","Patrice Louvet","Yeah, good morning, Brian. So let me take the first one on the channel dynamics. So we really look at the whole ecosystem ranging go-to-market ecosystem, ranging from flagships all the way to off-price. And all the channels have a role to play for us in the future, obviously, including wholesale.","Specifically, I think as we look at wholesale, the areas we're focused on there is getting the foundations healthy, right. As I mentioned earlier, the challenging our distribution, make sure we have the right product that we show up in the right way in department stores and then we have the right marketing that goes with it.","But we do expect abutment stores continue to play an important role for us moving forward. I want to double-click on the wholesale.com part because that's an important growth factor for us in the future, as I mentioned earlier.","Off-price also has a role to play for us moving forward, but we actually want to deemphasize the role of off-price in our total business. We believe you've kind of a bit of our ahead of our in this channel, and so what it has a role to play and our consumers there anyone to appeal to. We are pulling back on off-price and we'll continue to do that for the rest of the overtime.","Jane Nielsen","Yeah, Brian I would say that definitely, as we think about the future, you're going to see, as you did this quarter, less penetration in our total wholesale mix from off-price. And obviously, as Patrice called out, digital has been a highlight in wholesale.","So I'd expect that to increase in penetration. And certainly, we have an opportunity once we right-sized wholesale to get back to share growth. So those are sort of how we think about the total ecosystem.","As I think about revenue growth following quality-of-sales initiatives, we absolutely believe that after we get through our rightsizing and quality-of-sales initiatives, quality of sales is going to be an ongoing scene I think it will be about balance and - but following the reset that we would get back to growth and obviously.","As Patrice said, in June, we're going to come back and play out the initiatives in more detail and give you a better road map for the timing of our financial metrics and our come back to growth. Next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from Kate McShane with Citi Research. You may ask your question.","Kate McShane","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wondered with regards to China, sounds like you're seeing some nice green chutes. Wondered what makes this launch into China the right strategy, what have you learned about the region that you think you understand more than you did before when you pursue this market? And is there product segmentation with the region, is there more of an emphasis on one particular segment like Polo?","Patrice Louvet","So we have relatively long history in China as a company actually. Right, so if I kind of rewind the tapes a little bit, we've come through three phases. The early phase was through licensees, which ended up building distribution that I think in hindsight wasn't the right distribution for us.","So when the company took over the license in 2010, a lot of our distribution was shut down and then there was an emphasis put on luxury with the expectation that establishing the brand at the high end would be the right way to enter the market, which I think strategically was spot on, because that is the type of equity we want to build for the brand in all new markets, particularly in a market like China. But obviously, we ended up being challenged in the overall economic model of being able to support a business that was exclusively focused on luxury.","So that did not play out I think as the way it was originally intended. So we now have the benefit of all those learning's for this third phase where we are going to focus really on establishing Polo as the core of the business. We will obviously drive our luxury business as well to drive overall image, but the heart of the business for us in China will be Polo.","We're also very clear in terms of how we want to show up relative to the ecosystem, the go-to-market ecosystem I was referring to earlier, with an almost digital first mindset, so I think you've heard us talk about how we're now on WeChat, JD.com and T-mall and then also opening different store format that we have historically there. So slightly smaller stores, more focused on Polo and the early results that we're seeing are quite encouraging.","We're also tailoring our marketing to the Chinese consumers. So I think you heard us share some examples of celebrities that we're working with in China, and we actually have a long list of terrific partners in that market.","That's really resonating with the Chinese consumer and then likewise, on product, we're looking at this through the lens of the local consumer, what is the local consumer excited about, what they're looking for and how do we ensure we serve them in a very unique way.","We just spent couple of weeks in Asia actually, Jane and I, including a lot of timing in China. And what was exciting to hear from our teams and the stores is the demand there is for our higher priced products on Polo, with consumers really looking for more elevated products and accessories. So we're actually feeling pretty good about where the demand is for our brands there.","And you heard me talk earlier, and I'll stop here and turn it over to Jane, but about the average age of our consumer in China which also gives us a lot of hope for the future, our average age is 34 years old, right, which is really in the sweet spot of where we want to be, good 50-50 male-female mix.","So I think we're well up for success there. But as we've also called out in the remarks, we will proceed cautiously and we'll be very rigorous in the way we approach our investments moving forward in China.","Jane Nielsen","Yeah, Kate, I can't say enough about how important the resetting of the base and the elevation of the brand has been in building our confidence for China in the future. As you can see in our segment reporting, just three years ago, we were not profitable in the Asia region and specifically, in China. And the team has done tremendous work as you've seen notably in this quarter in Asia to really expand operating margin.","So that now, China and Asia growth is accretive over all Ralph Lauren growth. And so from a profitability standpoint and a healthy base standpoint, we're on solid footing. The brand is in great shape. We've cleaned up our distribution, which is an effort that we're continuing, and we are opening doors in a way that makes sense.","We've got flagships that build the brand. We've got Polo doors that are smaller footprint that have excellent four-wall profitability that we're building out. And as you can see, we're building out a system of concessions that get us reach with our Chinese consumers and also provide a very healthy ROI.","The gross margin in Asia is the highest that we have in the company. And so building and scaling in the Asia market is an opportunity to continue to expand operating margin, but to really be a significant factor of growth for us. The time is certainly right, and we have the right team and we are in the right position to do so now.","Next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from John Kernan with Cowen and Company. You may ask your question.","John Kernan","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question.","Jane Nielsen","Sure.","John Kernan","Patrice, you obviously, have a lot of experience globally and Ralph Lauren's a global brand, just wondering, how you thinking about Europe. We've seen a transfer a lot of global apparel brands improve in Europe recently. I'm wondering when do you think Europe can become a growth market for Ralph Lauren again? Thank you.","Patrice Louvet","Good morning, John. Thanks for your question. Well, yeah, I mean, internationally, we have both distribution growth opportunities as well as comp growth opportunities. So clearly, exciting potential for us moving forward. We just talked about Asia has been paying this penetrated market, and obviously, our primary growth driver there will be Mainland China.","Looking at Europe, right now we're implementing an enhanced focus on quality of sales and distribution where I think, again, we got ahead of our season on distribution in some parts of Europe and we have to wheel that back. We're also working on getting the right level of discounting in that market.","So that's going to create some pressure on the number of transactions and comps in the short-term. However, in the long-term, we - to your point, I think, have significant growth opportunities both from a distribution and comp growth standpoint.","We actually - so Jane and I have been traveling quite a bit we were in Europe 10 days ago, U.K., Germany, France where we spent a lot of time in the market understanding where we are and what the opportunities are.","One interesting data point is across Europe, we only have I think the precise number is 19 full price stores across the entire region, which is an indication of the upside potential that we have there look at our store footprint. We also have very promising progress on digital, I mentioned Zalando earlier and many other partners that we're working with that also indicated the significant upside there.","Then finally, as we toured a number of our wholesale partners, we know we can do a better job with our wholesale partners in Europe. So I think across all these sectors, once we've completed the work quality of sales, which is critical, we have significant growth opportunity across the region.","For example, we don't have a store, dedicated store in Spain, which is relatively sizable market. So we will get the balance right between Asia and Europe, but we're certainly looking at both regions that's growth vectors for us in the future.","Jane Nielsen","Next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. You may ask your question.","Omar Saad","Thanks, good morning. Thanks for all the information. Nice quarter.","Jane Nielsen","Thank you, Omar.","Omar Saad","I wanted to ask about products. Patrice, you mentioned fashion forward product having a feel, I think that comment was probably more specific to Asia and China. But I wanted to kind of ask you more broadly how do you think about managing the different trends going on in the marketplace as you evolve product line?","Retro trends, fashion forward trends, the traditional kind of core heritage around the brand, maybe help us understand how you're thinking about evolving the product, where you it needs to go in concert with their efforts with Ralph's and the creative team? Thanks.","Patrice Louvet","Sure. Good morning, Omar. So we're looking at multiple vectors to evolve our product offering. The first one, which is going to sound pretty basic was actually critical. It's really driving a more disciplined assortment.","Having more discipline and understanding the role of this that we're introducing, eliminating the unproductive styles, better balancing offering across categories across price points, to have good, better, best propositions across the categories that matter.","The second point is there's a critical timelessness to this brand, and we have phenomenal icons and I think we've all come to the conclusion that we can do more with our Icons and put greater emphasis on our Icons and that as part of what - the early progress we are seeing this Fall season is actually driven by what's happening with our Icons.","The third area is the renewal of our - and again, this is a very important part of our business. On this area, we are looking at fits, we're looking at styles, we're looking at materials, we're looking at colors.","And you can imagine, I've been very impressed by the design team that we have in-house and have had a number of conversations with them, they're very in touch with what's going on in the market, both here and around the world, and really making sure that our propositions moving forward.","Take that into account, while also staying true to who we are, right. So we're not going to be jerked around by all the fashion trends out there in the market and lose kind of the fundamental what this brand stands for and the timelessness of it.","We will be in touch with the trends while staying true to who we are, and obviously, making sure that what we offer is exciting and relevant for the consumers that we want to serve.","You heard me talk about the limited editions and we've been excited about the reactions, the stadium and actually pretty need to see the long lines, the night before outside stores where people waiting to buy it. So we're going to continue to drive that, we're going look at partnerships moving forward as well, which I think will bring even more interest and excitement to the brand.","And then the final point, which is less about trends and style, it's more about strategic choices. There are three categories where we should be playing more actively, where we are underdeveloped and where I believe we have a basis to win. So that will also be another vector of growth as we look at overall product offering.","Evren Kopelman","Next question please?","Operator","The next question comes from Heather Balsky with Bank of America. You may ask your question.","Heather Balsky","Hi. Thank you for taking my call. Just actually a follow-up on Omar's question. Can you talk about how you're thinking about product in terms of your different channels distribution, off-price versus full-line versus outlet, and how you're going to differentiate between those channels? Thanks.","Patrice Louvet","Good morning, Heather. That's also a great question. And the headline thought here is we know we need to do a better job differentiating our propositions across channels. Things have gotten blurred and I don't think it's helping the consumer kind of navigate our brand and we want to get really clear on the role of each channel and what the value proposition is in each channel for our brand and drive greater differentiation.","And there are many different ways to drive differentiation, whether its different styles, different categories, how the products are presented and so on, and so forth. But clearly an area of focus for us moving forward, we need to and we will drive a stronger differentiation across the channels that we operate in.","Jane Nielsen","Heather, I do think that the inventory discipline in the - and the buying process discipline that we put in place will enable us to differentiate product assortments, but also maintain of the SKU efficiency and inventory efficiencies that we've been able to drive over the last year. Next question, please.","Operator","The next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. You may ask your question.","Nancy Hilliker","Hi, everyone. This is Nancy Hilliker on for Ike. Great job.","Jane Nielsen","Thank you.","Nancy Hilliker","Our question - hi. Our question is obviously, you had an amazing gross margin in the quarter. Can you just talk a little bit about more about puts and takes in the back half? And given the shift, what we should expect, any into the quarters for gross margin and also actually for SG&A as well?","Jane Nielsen","So, Nancy, as we look at gross margin in the second quarter, we feel that we'll have gross margin expansion in the second half of at least 150 basis points. So as we move forward and we're seeing our gross margin trends, we've been confident in moving up that guidance on gross margin.","What you'll see in the second half in terms of SG&A is a real shift in the fourth quarter where we are going to be investing in new stores, but most notably, marketing. Jonathan Bottomley, our new Head of Marketing, has been on board. And we have a Polo campaign coming out and some real amplification in marketing.","In fact, if you look at our marketing spend, as you can see in the Q, that's been down in the first half, and it's going to be up significantly in the second half, around double-digit in the third quarter, but up significantly in the fourth quarter.","As we really believe marketing and telling our story is a great opportunity for us and a great opportunity to really get back to telling our story to position us for growth. Next question, please.","Operator","The next question comes from Rick Patel with Needham & Company. You may ask your question.","Rick Patel","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and congrats on the progress.","Jane Nielsen","Thank you.","Rick Patel","A follow-up question on expenses. So you talked about investments in marketing, product and stores. Can you dig a little deeper and talk about which geographies will receive the most investment? I'm curious about how you're weighing investment in North America, which is your most challenging market right now, versus investing in growth areas like Asia? And if I can squeeze in a quick housekeeping one, any updates to report on tourism given the changes in FX? Thank you.","Jane Nielsen","Of course. So on the expense side, and as we think about investments by market, obviously, with our growth focus in Asia, that market will need more marketing. The marketing we've put is very effective, as Patrice noted. Our top-of-mind awareness in China is very high and really is another thing that gives us confidence for growth. So you'll see marketing go up in China.","Also, as we called out in our store profile, most of the new doors that are being opened are being opened in Asia, and most of the concessions that we're opening this year will be opened in Asia. So capital will be shifting to the China market as we build out. You'll also see capital going into Europe as we realize the opportunity for some greater store penetration in Europe, as well as some marketing.","In North America, what the focus in capital will be is more refurbishment, how do we refresh our store environment. We're fully, although there'll be some close store here opened ones there, but it really our opportunity is to show up really well in North America and give some of our stores the love that they deserve in terms of refurbishment.","You'll see marketing also in the U.S. I think we have to get back to telling our story in the U. S. Notably, on our digital site, as we - now that the - we're switched on our platform, you're going to see, especially in the third - later third and fourth quarter, more digital assets show up in marketing on our digital sites, but also telling our story in the market but in a much more digitally savvy social media way.","Patrice Louvet","There is a question, actually the latest data in North America for our U.S. retail stores, basically, sales are down low single digits. And in our European stores, sales were down from tourists mid-single digits. So, better in North America than we've seen in the long, long time actually this past quarter. In Europe, it's still pretty stable in mid down mid-singles.","Jane Nielsen","Trend continues in this quarter was up nicely, so it's encouraging.","Patrice Louvet","Yes.","Jane Nielsen","Next question, please.","Operator","The next question comes from Andrew Roberts on behalf of Bob Drbul with Guggenheim. You may ask your question.","Andrew Roberts","Hi. Good morning. So I guess, you guys launched T-mall and JD.com this quarter. I was wondering if you guys could give us any update on your thoughts of launching on Amazon in North America and elsewhere?","Patrice Louvet","Good morning, Andrew. So let me rewind a little bit on your question just to give the bigger picture on how we're seeing e-commerce, and I will answer your question. As I mentioned earlier, so e-commerce is very clearly critical for our future growth. This is going to be the way for us to reach the consumers, where they are, in the most effective way to drive - to build the brand and to drive the business.","I talked about the three buckets that we have, our own site, wholesales.com and pure players. When we look at pure players, the model we really like is actually the T-mall model where we manage our own shop in the - on their marketplace and we have a digital storefront for the brand. That's the model we're excited about.","So we continue to evaluate online partners including the one you just quoted. So we want to make sure we win in this channel. But we're also looking to do it in a way that we can build a brand and that we can show up the way the brand is intended to show up. So nothing new to report on Amazon in particular.","Evren Kopelman","We will take one last question.","Operator","The last question comes from Laurent Vasilescu with Macquarie. You may ask your question.","Laurent Vasilescu","Good morning and thanks for taking my question. Jane, I want to ask about the North American wholesale business I think it was mentioned it was down 22% and 70% of that was driven by active measures. How should we think about those metrics for the third and fourth quarter and potentially beyond?","Jane Nielsen","So we're comfortable with our guidance in terms of our total wholesale outlook, and specifically for North America, as we said. We expect that we'll see wholesale end the year in about the same range that you saw in Q2, so we're down about 22% Q2. I expect the full year will look about similar as our cleanup continues through the third and fourth quarter.","We are encouraged by what we see as progress on execution. Our underlying comp rate, as we view it, is in the mid to high single digits, and we know what we have product and marketing that we need to focus on as well as the store refreshments to change that trend as we move into FY 2019.","So about similar to the year to what you saw in this quarter, but I think that the pretty stable underlying comp trend that we are looking to address as we look at all the vectors product marketing and stores.","Patrice Louvet","Good. So we're going to close here. Thank you all for joining our call this morning. We look forward to talking to you next quarter. Have a great day. Take care.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"17601":["Ralph Lauren Corp.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions on how to ask a question will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mrs. Evren Kopelman. Please go ahead.","Evren Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Good morning, and thank you for joining Ralph Lauren's second quarter fiscal 2017 conference call. With me today are Stefan Larsson, the company's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jane Nielsen, Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions, which we ask that you limit to one per caller.","During today's call, we will be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including our financial outlook. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees, and our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Our expectations contain many risks and uncertainties. Principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from our current expectations are detailed in our SEC filings.","To find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our financial results, you should refer to this morning's earnings release and to our SEC filings that can be found on our Investor Relations website.","And now, I will turn the call over to Stefan.","Stefan Larsson - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Thank you, Evren, and good morning, everyone. Since we last spoke on our earnings call in August, the team and I have continued our intense focus on driving the execution of our Way Forward Plan. The Way Forward Plan, as a reminder, is our multi-year strategy to build on the unique brand strength we have, go back to the core of what made Ralph Lauren iconic, evolve from that core and build the business back to sustainable profitable growth.","We are two quarters into executing on the plan and my focus is leading our teams to ensure that every action we take today drives towards our long-term Way Forward goals, while at the same time optimizing near-term performance.","Today, I will share my key learnings from the second quarter and then provide an update on our progress in driving the execution of our Way Forward Plan. Then I'm excited about having Jane here with me and will turn it to her to review the details of the company's quarterly financial performance and our outlook for fiscal 2017.","In the second quarter, we continued to deliver against our expectations. Our performance keeps us on track to achieve our full-year fiscal 2017 guidance, with some changes in the quarterly flow (3:13). In the second quarter, revenue of $1.8 billion was consistent with our plan, while operating margin was ahead of our target, driven by higher gross margins in our international markets, quality of sales initiatives starting to get traction and planned SG&A expenses shifting into the third quarter. Jane will take you through these in detail.","Our revenue in the quarter declined in line with our plan, down 8% versus prior year, with continued and expected larger decline in wholesale than retail. Consistent with our Way Forward Plan, we continued to drive the quality of our sales up by moderating discount rates, tightening inventory buys and closing another seven underperforming stores in the quarter. These initiatives successfully reduced inventories which were down 15% to last year at the end of the quarter.","North America continues to be our most challenged market where revenue declined 12% in the quarter. As I shared on our last call, assessing our North American challenge, which to a large extent is self-induced, and building and executing a plan to get back to winning in North America is one of our biggest priorities. In our international markets, revenue increased 2% in the second quarter. Our teams there continue to drive up quality of sales, right-size the inventory and optimize the store fleets to build a foundation for profitable growth.","In Asia, we continued to see encouraging results of our proactive quality of sales actions. Over the last nine months, our team has now closed a total of 72 points of distribution that weakened the brand and opened 159 new high-quality points of sale. The new points of distribution have better locations, improved adjacencies and refreshed store environments relative to the locations we closed. In addition, we continue to reduce the length of the sales periods and significantly decrease the depth of markdown rates.","We continued to see the positive impact of our initiatives on profitability. Over the past nine months, our average unit retail prices are up 10% in constant currency and our gross profit margin continues to expand. In Europe, growth remained solid in the second quarter and our team centered on tighter inventory management, strengthening the assortment and resulting in improved margins.","Now, let me give you a few important updates on our progress on the execution of the Way Forward Plan. As we are still early in the execution of the plan, there will often be a lag time between when we take a Way Forward action and when it shows up in the P&L. However, I do see early indicators of success and I would use these calls to give you updates on the progress points of our execution.","The Way Forward Plan is built on two key parts. The first is consumer-facing where we're going to focus on and evolve from the core in product, marketing and the shopping experience. The second part is about evolving the operating model where we are developing four business engines: a systematic repeatable way of building a stronger assortment, a demand-driven supply chain, a best-in-class sourcing capability and a multi-channel global expansion strategy.","Underlying both of these two parts is the foundation of strengthening the leadership team and culture, as well as developing a strong economic model. With the addition of Jane Nielsen from Coach and Bill Campbell from Amazon last quarter, we are now very close to having our full operations team in place. The only outstanding role to fill is a Global Chief Marketing Officer, and we are underway with that search.","Delivering on our objective to increase our focus and resources on our core brands, we recently announced our decision to discontinue the Denim & Supply brand. We will address the denim market more effectively through our Polo brand by leveraging the brand strength of Polo.","Moving on to the work of evolving the assortment in product. I'm excited about the work that Val\u00e9rie and her team are driving in cutting the product tail, refocusing our core product offering and evolving from that core. In the second quarter, we continued to make good progress in identifying and cutting the long tail of unproductive styles, leading to a big reduction in the number of SKUs.","For fall 2016, we achieved a 10% reduction in SKUs across our apparel brands. And for spring 2017, we are on track to achieve over a 20% reduction. And for fall 2017, we're on the way to further SKU reductions.","The style and SKU reduction frees up time, resources and creativity to focus on and evolve our core icons, leading to a more productive and desirable assortment. Our improved discipline in the assortment creation enables us to buy closer to market and reduce early commitments.","We continue to expect to be halfway to our goal of a nine-month lead time by the end of this fiscal year and 90% there by the end of next fiscal year. The key unlock for our shorter lead times is the fabric platforming for our core styles. We made significant progress in this area during the quarter. Almost all of our core fabrics will be platformed by the end of this month. This enables us to increase the quality of our fabric, secure better prices and decrease our lead times and increase our flexibility to react to selling in season.","We can now, for the first time, work in partnership with our big customers and move from buying blind before their buys to buying our inventory based on their buys, and therefore, significantly improve matching our inventory to the real demand.","In the second quarter, we continued to drive down inventory levels across the company to get closer to matching inventory we demand. In addition to our inventory restructuring actions, I am pleased with our meaningful progress to reduce inventory buys. Although we're still in the early stages of this journey, optimizing our buys should improve sell-throughs and gross margin rate.","Now, I want to share our plan to come back to high-performance in North America. North America is our largest market and one where it's essential for us to return to profitable growth. The plan is based on leveraging our unique brand strength, solid market position, and strong relationships with our wholesale partners.","As we mentioned on our last call, Jeff Kuster joined in July as our new Group President for the Americas. Together with his team, Jeff has worked through a detailed fact-based assessment of our North American challenges. From that assessment, we have built a plan that will take us back to strength. And strength in North America starts with our U.S. wholesale business. The challenges we face there are similar to our overall challenges as a company that we shared during our Investor Day in June.","We have been buying too much inventory, letting that overflow to value channels, buying too much in the product tail, buying too early before the customers have bought, not created room to chase in season, and distributed too much in the low-volume shops, and promoted too deep and too frequently.","To start building strength back, we will work even more closely with our biggest wholesale customers, partnering together with them to build strength that will make us both drive high performance. Together, we will: first, reduce our overall buys to better match demand. This will reduce the overflow of inventory going to value channels.","Second, cut the product tail and refocus the investments in the evolved core. This will improve inventory productivity. Third, we will cut supplier lead times. This will allow our customers to buy much closer in and improve the flexibility to chasing season.","Fourth, we will refocus our marketing efforts, in line with our Way Forward Plan, to develop cut-through marketing campaigns for our main brands. This will be targeted to drive traffic and conversion. Our first initiatives will start with Polo in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.","Fifth and finally, working in collaboration with our partners, we will reduce and close the tail of our distribution, which accounts for 20% to 25% of the total distribution points. These shops represent a very small share of sales and profit for us as well as our partners.","Just as with assortment, we will refocus on and evolve from the core, which means the top-selling doors, and invest in refreshing and rebuilding the store experience. This will create an exciting shopping experience and supercharge the evolved assortment strategy.","It's worth mentioning again that we believe in a strong wholesale channel and a well-executed department store. We believe a well-curated department store offers a convenient and exciting shopping experience that saves the consumer time, while also bringing them into the brand. Our distribution plan will follow the consumer and department stores off and online represent one of the largest channels the full-price consumer shops today and in the near future.","Parallel to strengthening our wholesale efforts, we're also strengthening our e-commerce presence. But even though department stores represent one of the biggest channels for our consumers, the e-commerce channel has the highest growth rate and is increasingly important. Our assessment of our e-commerce challenges and our plan to strengthen e-commerce are also very much in line with our overall Way Forward assessment and plan.","We are reducing the overall buys, we are reducing the promotions, we are reducing the product tail, we are refocusing on and evolving our core products, and we'll start to present them in an evolved and refreshed way. We have taken the first steps here and you can now see our refreshed landing pages on both our mobile as well our desktop sites. We recently launched our redesigned mobile site, which features significant improvements in functionality. We improved the checkout process, navigation, and creative execution, and many more steps to follow on that.","Finally, a few words on marketing. In September, we held our first ever See-Now-Buy-Now runway show for the women's collection. The show was held in a glass structure on the sidewalk outside our Madison Avenue flagship. We even managed to close down Madison Avenue for a few hours. It was a big success and generated more than twice the global media value compared to the previous season's show.","We also recently launched a Ralph Lauren Icons campaign in our women's luxury business. It's built on our Way Forward goal to refocus on and evolve from core iconic products to make them even more desirable to today's consumer. The response so far has been very positive.","In conclusion, we are making good progress against our Way Forward Plan. While most of it is still to be done, I'm excited with what I see. During the last three months, while we have been getting ready to execute the holiday season, I've been traveling extensively and spent much time with our teams and our biggest customers.","From my perspective, whether I'm in Little Rock, Arkansas with our friends at Dillard's, or seeing our newly renovated flagship store come to life on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, or visiting our new Polo store on Regent Street in London, I feel the excitement from our teams and partners that we're starting to move towards unlocking the true potential of this great brand that Ralph started almost 50 years ago.","So, with that, I would like to turn the call over to Jane.","Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Thank you, Stefan, and good morning, everyone. It's great to be with all of you and to be a part of the Ralph Lauren team. I'm excited about executing our Way Forward Plan and sharing our progress with you.","Second quarter net revenues of $1.8 billion were down 8% to last year on both a reported and constant currency basis. This reflects our quality of sales initiatives starting to take hold and is in line with the guidance we provided in August of mid- to high-single-digit revenue decline. Foreign currency translation did not have a material impact on revenue growth in the second quarter.","On an adjusted basis, gross margin was 56.9% in the second quarter, excluding non-cash inventory-related charges of $81 million associated with our restructuring activities. This was 40 basis points above prior year, primarily driven by favorable geographic and channel mix shifts, improved product costing and initiatives to improve quality of sale, primarily through reduced promotional activity in our international businesses. This was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency effects of approximately 80 basis points.","Operating expenses on an adjusted basis were $809 million, excluding $69 million in restructuring and other related charges. These expenses were down 4% compared to last year, primarily as a result of expense initiatives under the Way Forward Plan, including head-count reductions and seven store closures. Store closures in the second quarter were lower than expectations. We delayed closures to take advantage of the peak holiday shopping period and to minimize store closure costs through negotiations with our landlords.","Adjusted operating margin in the second quarter was 12.4%, excluding $150 million in restructuring and other related charges. This was 110 basis points below last year due to fixed cost expense de-leverage on lower net revenues, which was partially offset by our improved gross margin.","The adjusted operating margin performance was better than the outlook we provided in August of a 200-basis-point to 250-basis-point decline. This was primarily driven by improved gross margin in our international markets and a change in the timing of about $12 million of planned SG&A expense, which benefited the second quarter and will shift into the third quarter.","Adjusted net income for the second quarter was $158 million or $1.90 per diluted share, excluding restructuring and other related charges. On a reported basis, net income in the second quarter was $45 million or $0.55 per diluted share. The effective tax rate was 29% in the second quarter on an adjusted basis, similar to the effective tax rate of 29% in the prior-year period.","Moving on to segment performance. Wholesale revenues decreased 10% to $831 million on both a reported and constant currency basis in the second quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by a decline in North America, as shipments were strategically reduced as a part of the Way Forward Plan. This was partially offset by wholesale revenue growth in Europe. Adjusted wholesale operating margin in the second quarter was 26.4%, excluding restructuring and other related charges. This was 40 basis points below prior year.","Retail segment sales decreased 5% to $942 million on a reported basis and were down 6% on a constant currency basis, driven by a comparable store sales decline. Consolidated comparable store sales decreased 9% in constant currency and 8% as reported, primarily due to challenging traffic and average dollar transaction trends. Similarly, global e-commerce revenues declined 7% during the quarter on a reported basis and 6% in constant currency, driven by our price harmonization initiatives.","Retail operating margin in the second quarter, excluding restructuring and other related charges, was 11.8%, which was 100 basis points below the prior-year period.","Licensing revenues increased 2% on a reported basis and were flat in constant currency. Licensing segment operating income increased 5% in the second quarter compared with the prior-year period.","Turning to distribution. At the end of the second quarter, we had 485 directly-operated standalone stores and 620 concessions globally. Compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2016, the company had five net new directly-operated stores and 44 net new concession shops at the end of this second quarter. In addition, our international licensing partners operated 102 Ralph Lauren stores and 20 dedicated shops, as well as 59 Club Monaco stores and 77 Club Monaco concession shops at the end of the second quarter.","We continued to close underperforming doors that we identified as a part of the Way Forward Plan. In the second quarter, we closed seven standalone stores, bringing the total for the first half to 15 store closures as a part of our restructuring activity. These stores were geographically dispersed and primarily in our full-price concept. For the full year, we still expect to close approximately 50 stores.","More of the closures are now slated for the fourth quarter, after the holiday period. We continue to take a pragmatic approach to closures, balancing closure timing with realizing peak holiday season sales volume, and minimizing door closure costs. Additionally, we continue to right-size our cost structure and expect to make continued progress as we close out our fiscal year.","Now, let me provide you with an update on our restructuring activities related to the Way Forward Plan. The company continues to expect restructuring activities to result in approximately $180 million to $220 million of annualized expense savings related to its initiatives to streamline the organization structure and right-size the cost structure, and our efforts to optimize the real estate portfolio.","We continue to expect restructuring charges of about $400 million as a result of our Way Forward Plan, and about $150 million in inventory charges related to our restructuring activities. These charges are expected to be substantially realized by the end of fiscal 2017. In the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the company recorded $150 million in restructuring-related impairment and inventory charges.","Moving on to the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory was $1.2 billion at the end of the second quarter, down 15%, or $200 million compared to the end of the prior-year period. The reduction was attributable to both restructuring actions and about 40% due to our operating process initiatives to reduce inventory, including a proactive pullback in receipts and our early efforts to move towards a demand-driven supply chain.","Our progress in the second quarter increases our confidence that inventory will continue to show double-digit declines for the remainder of the year, and inventory quality will continue to improve.","Moving on to capital expenditures. We spent $87 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, compared to $134 million in the prior-year period, mostly to support our retail store network and infrastructure projects.","During the second quarter, approximately 80,000 shares of Class A common stock were retired as a part of the $100 million accelerated share repurchase program the company initiated in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. There were no new share repurchases in the second quarter. At the end of the second quarter, $200 million remained available for future share repurchases.","We ended the second quarter with approximately $1.1 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet, and $692 million of total debt.","I'd like to now turn to guidance for fiscal 2017. As a reminder, this guidance excludes the restructuring and other related charges in connection with the company's Way Forward Plan.","For fiscal 2017, we are maintaining our guidance. We continue to expect consolidated net revenues to decrease at a low-double-digit rate, as we execute our Way Forward Plan. Key elements include a proactive pullback in inventory receipts, store closures, pricing harmonization and quality of sale initiatives. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is expected to have minimal impact on revenue growth in fiscal 2017.","The company continues to expect operating margin for fiscal 2017 to be approximately 10%, as cost savings are expected to be offset by growth in new store expenses, unfavorable foreign currency impacts in gross margin and SG&A, infrastructure investments and fixed expense de-leverage. Fiscal 2017 tax rate is expected to be approximately 29%.","For the third quarter, the company expects consolidated net revenues to be down low-double digits to down low-teens on a reported basis. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is expected to have a minimal impact on revenue growth, but should pressure gross margin by at least 120 basis points.","Operating margin for the third quarter is expected to be approximately 200 to 225 basis points below the comparable year-prior period. Key pressure points are FX pressures to gross margin and the shift in timing of about $12 million of planned operating expenses from the second to the third quarter. In addition, savings initiatives from the Way Forward Plan will be more fully realized in the fourth quarter, as more store closures are slated for after the holiday period. The third quarter tax rate is estimated at 29%.","In closing, we are pleased with the progress we are making on our Way Forward Plan. We have the key elements in place to ensure continued progress. We have strong and collaborative relationships with our wholesale partners, a strong brand, a strong balance sheet, and a motivated and committed team of over 25,000 Ralph Lauren employees around the globe.","With that, I'd like to open up the call for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The first question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Good morning. Congrats on the progress.","Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Thanks, Omar.","Stefan Larsson - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Thank you, Omar.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Sure. Yeah, I wanted to ask, I mean, kind of a macro question. It's super turbulent out there still, a lot of moving pieces from a top-down perspective in the markets on a global basis. You're making progress on the Way Forward Plan.","How do you think about your ability to stick to that plan and for the plan to hold up, given all the changes and turbulence in the marketplace, both from a near-term and a long-term perspective? Thanks.","Stefan Larsson - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Thank you, Omar. Well, my perspective has always been and will be that the highest performing companies and management teams out there are focused on what they can influence. So, when we look at the Way Forward Plan, it's largely within our control. So, independently of macro environment, it's the same macro environment for us as for all of our competitors, we are focused as a management team to execute on our plan.","And that's what both Jane and I and the management team are excited about, is to see the progress that we are making in executing from going from developing the plan to executing the plan, that we are seeing that we are making progress in all the areas that we set out to make progress with. And so, independently of where the environment is going, we are going to stay focused, increase our focus on what we can control, and continue to drive and continue to learn and improve and learn and improve. So, that's my philosophy.","Evren Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Okay. Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning and congrats on the progress. And, Jane, it's nice to hear you back.","Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Thanks, Michael.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Let me just ask you two quick questions. You have a lot of moving parts on the retail side, but with some of the store closures pushing into fourth quarter, I think it's important to kind of think about the change in the cadence in terms of what that means looking out past your fiscal 2017. It probably means we'd expect to see some of the year-over-year impact of those closures more focused in the first half of 2018, if that's safe to assume.","Can you help us fine-tune the guidance for revenues that were going to be stabilizing in fiscal 2018 based on that change and how we can think about magnitude? And then, just on the gross margin for our models in the third quarter, can the gross margin in the third quarter actually be positive year-over-year if we include that 120-basis-point drag from currency that you mentioned, Jane? Thanks.","Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Yeah. So, Michael, as you look at it, we have looked at those store closures. As I said, we're going to be very pragmatic about capturing holiday season sales and negotiating the best deals possible with our landlords. Obviously, if we close at the end of the year, there will be a spillover effect on growth into FY 2018 from store closures.","But remember, those stores are smallest and least productive doors. So, while that will be a factor and we'll play that into our initiatives, overall our guidance for FY 2018 that we will see stabilization is still intact. As we did with the North America comeback plan, we are working through 2018 on an initiative-by-initiative basis, and we'll come back to you in the fourth quarter, as is our practice, and give you much more specific guidance on that.","And then, as you look at the third quarter overall in terms of gross margin, here's what I see in terms of headwinds and tailwinds. The tailwinds that we saw in the second quarter of the benefit of product and channel mix, and the benefit of markdown rates, notably in our international markets, those are going to be intact as we move into quarters three and four.","The headwind, as you saw in Q2, will be FX, and it will increase. We are at 80 basis points in Q2. It's going to go up to about 120 basis points in Q3. But I still remain optimistic about our ability to move through on a conservative basis to hold, or even grow, gross margin.","Evren Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Great. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question is from Kate McShane with Citi Research.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. My question was on the discontinuation of Denim & Supply. How that could impact the sales outlook as well for next fiscal year? And how should we think about that space in the department stores? It seems to have pretty good real estate and prevalent space in the department store. How should we think about what that will look like going forward?","Stefan Larsson - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Jane do you want to start for the Denim &...","Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Yeah. Just overall, in terms of Denim & Supply, as we looked at that brand, it's a pretty small portion of our revenue. It's about 2% of global net sales. So it's not a material impact. And further, as we've looked at our portfolio of brands, we think we have a great opportunity in Polo and in Denim specifically to recapture those sales over time.","So we feel really good about continuing the plan of refocusing on the core, stretching our very strong brands like Polo to pick up the opportunity that we had in Denim & Supply, and to move forward from there.","Stefan Larsson - Ralph Lauren Corp.","And when it comes to the space in department stores, what's been important for myself and the team when we work on the North American comeback is that it's about the partnership with our wholesale customers, and we have had that from day one. So our space in the department stores comes back to our brand strength, our strong market share with the consumer, and our ability to come back to strength.","And what excited me from day one is the excitement from the wholesale partners in driving these initiatives that will drive us jointly back to high performance. One being the shorter lead times, being able to buy much closer in and being able to react to the sales trend in season. That's something that's viewed very favorable by our partners and they have, frankly, been waiting for us to get our assessment done and get going. And now we're in the exciting stage of getting going together.","Evren Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I had a quick housekeeping question for Jane. Given some of the volatility in currency, I was curious if \u2013 I don't think the outlook for FX impact on revenue has changed much, but has your view on the impact of gross profit or earnings changed at all? In other words, is there more of a headwind embedded in your updated guidance or is it consistent?","And then my bigger question for Stephan is \u2013 thank you for the initial detail on Jeff's thoughts on the North American comeback. You talked about cutting 20% to 25% of your sort of tail distribution points. Can you talk about the complexion of those changes retail versus wholesale? Whether that involves additional store closures of above and beyond what you've already announced? And how you plan to reinvest more aggressively in the core areas that you're sticking with? Thanks.","Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Yeah, Lindsay, as we looked at FX impact, we have seen an impact overall to FX, and largely it's playing out in terms of gross margin. Our guidance is still intact. We are accommodating that change within our operations. But as I look at operating profits, foreign currency will have about 100-basis-point impact to overall operating margin for the full year.","Do you want to do the 20% to...","Stefan Larsson - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Yes. So, when it comes to the 20% to 25%, cutting the tail of the distribution in wholesale, it's the shops. It's the bottom 20%, 25%, the least productive shops. So, even though it's a high number in terms of share of the shops being cut, it's a very low number in terms of sales and even lower number in terms of profit, both for ourselves and our partners.","So it follows the same strategy as the assortment strategy. It goes back to the core, and the core doors and the core shops for us are very important. And we're going to refocus our energy there and making sure that we provide an outstanding shopping experience there, and that will drive our comeback.","Evren Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Okay. Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Jane, welcome. Congratulations.","Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Thank you, Bob.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","The question that I have is, can you talk a little bit about tourism trends both in the U.S. and in your international stores and how that's impacting the results?","Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Yeah, Bob. As we've looked at foreign tourist trends overall, we continue to see a decline in overall tourist traffic. But I will tell you, both in the first and the second quarter, we've seen an improvement. Although they're still down, we've seen an improvement versus prior year. So it's not as severe as it was, but we do still see that traffic down, and it's most notable in our outlet business.","Evren Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Okay. Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo.","Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone, and welcome aboard, Jane.","Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Thank you.","Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Just curious, so wholesale down 10% in Q2. I think North America in Q1 was down around mid-teens. I'm just curious if you could comment on what the North America piece of wholesale looked like in the second quarter. And then, just for the back half, to hit your plan for the year, what you're kind of expecting out of the North America wholesale channel as well? Thank you.","Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Yeah. Overall, Ike, we do see that North America \u2013 one of the reasons that we focused the North America comeback plan to high performance, the first phase is on wholesale is because it's so important to our business and we're not satisfied with the overall trends.","So, as we continue to focus on pulling back inventory, closing doors, moving back from the heavy promotional activity, we expect to see continued pressure in that North America wholesale business and that was contemplated in our guidance.","Evren Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Okay. Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Steven Zaccone - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. This is Steve Zaccone on for Matt today. Thanks very much for taking our questions. I had a question, your second-quarter comps came in slightly below our model. Just looking for the full year, to hit your top-line guidance, how should we think about comps in the second half of the year?","Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Well, we are holding to our overall comp guidance of down mid- to high-single digits. So I think you can do the math and you'll see a little bit of an uptick in the second half.","Evren Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Okay. Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Good morning, everyone, and nice to see the progress.","Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Hi, Dana.","Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Hi. Jane, welcome. Jane, as you think about turnarounds you've done in the past, what's most similar or dissimilar compared to what you've executed in the past? And how do you see the progress here?","And Stefan, how do you look at the three brands that you're focusing on, the difference between price and margins, as you continue to evolve the business? Thank you.","Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Yeah, Dana. I'd say that one of the things that when I came into Ralph Lauren that pleasantly surprised me is this is an organization that's really ready for change. And although Stefan unveiled the Way Forward Plan in June, I think the organization has embraced it enthusiastically.","The difference between from what I see at Ralph Lauren is that we have to work in partnership with our wholesale partners in order to effect this comeback that we've outlined. I think, as we unveiled the North America comeback plan, that is certainly our intent. So the need for partnership is one of the most notable things that I see. But, overall, obviously with the early signs of progress, I'm very encouraged.","Stefan Larsson - Ralph Lauren Corp.","And, Dana, when it comes to our brands and our progress within our brands and my thoughts connecting through pricing and margin there. So, as I shared in the opening remarks, I'm excited by the work that Val\u00e9rie and the brand teams are doing in being very strategic in identifying the unproductive product tail, the assortment tail, and cutting that. And we see and measure the progress on that. But that's just an enabler to then put more focus and more creativity and to refocus on executing the core. And then, thirdly, it will be about adding strategic newness.","And so it should have a positive margin affect. And as of now, we are early into the execution of the plan and I see the brand teams taking the steps that are necessary for us to unlock the strength in the assortment. So I'm excited even though it's early days.","Evren Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Okay. Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Christian Buss with Credit Suisse.","Christian Roland Buss - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yes. Hello. Congratulations. And I'd like to ask what your plans are on the outlet side of the business. The penetration of outlets is increasing as store closures start. How do you think about the health of that outlet business and the potential for that outlet business and the mix over the long-term?","Stefan Larsson - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Yes. So my take on outlet is that it's an important channel for us and it's an important channel to keep in balance with the full-price selling. So, as we have mentioned before, our outlet presence in North America, given that that's our biggest market, is not high in relation to many other very strong brands and high-performing brands.","So what we are doing is two things when it comes to outlet. We are making sure that we keep outlet in balance with the rest of the channels, so that we can deliver on our overall Way Forward goals, which is to strengthen our brand and drive sustainable profitable sales growth. And in parallel, we are optimizing the outlet business that we have.","Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Yeah. And I would say that so many of the Way Forward Plan initiatives, the improvement of product assortment, buying closer in to demand are going to benefit the outlet channels, breakthrough marketing, are all going to benefit the outlet channel as well.","Stefan Larsson - Ralph Lauren Corp.","And one of our strengths as a brand is the masspirational appeal of what Ralph and the team have created over some 50 years that it appeals to absolute luxury, as you can see on the runway show that we had where we went back to the DNA, the mansion on Madison Avenue, and added newness and we created 2, 2.5 times the media value.","And then we have aspirational luxury in Polo and then we have entry through our outlets. So the strength for us is that appeal to every part of the market and our job as a management team is to keep the right balance.","Evren Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Great. Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Jay Sole with Morgan Stanley.","Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. My question is about your retail business. Can you talk about how unit demand has changed as the ASPs have gone up? And has that met your expectations and have you tested different ASPs to see how demand is impacted as prices change?","Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Yeah. So what we've seen, Jay, is we are always testing pricing. Pricing is such an important lever in our market. And what we've seen in Asia, where we've seen our AURs go up or ASPs go up 10%, is that we've been able, if I take outdoor closures, is that we've been able to hold on to most of our unit demand. And so, that's really the sweet spot for us.","Obviously, this Way Forward Plan is predicated on a long-term rise of AURs, but we'll take those sequentially over time as we're largely happy with our price points. But that is a part of the Way Forward Plan.","Evren Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Okay. Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow up on the wholesale strategy in North America. Could you just quantify the sales volume of that 20% to 25% doors that you're closing and then the timeframe of shuttering those doors?","And then, secondly, related to that strategy, you talked about further partnering with your top wholesale accounts, but reducing product going to value, or value channels. With that as the context, how do you view the role of T.J.Maxx going forward? Thanks.","Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.","So, Erinn, as I look at the volumes in, what I'm calling, what we're saying is the tail of our distribution, that 20%, 25% of the doors. It's about 1% of overall sales, so not a material amount of sales. And obviously it's not a material amount of sales, and it's our least profitable points of distribution in the wholesale doors.","And we've really taken time to look across the wholesale doors and look at points of distribution. Obviously, we have a portfolio of brand, look at points of distribution within the department store, and go in surgically to eliminate the least profitable and lowest sales points of distribution even within the door.","Stefan Larsson - Ralph Lauren Corp.","And when it comes to the distribution overall, including off-price, our distribution strategy is to follow where the consumer is going and keeping the balance between the different channels. And one way of improving the quality of sales and improving the full-price channels' performance is to reduce the buys.","So it's the number one driver in the North American comeback is to reduce our overall inventory buys to better match demand. And the way we reduce them is one is reducing them to demand and buying closer in, it's a way of reducing, and being more accurate and having to buy less. So our idea is to buy less and sell more at the higher AUR.","Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Yeah. And Erinn, right now we're working with our wholesale partners on this effort to cut the door tail and we're adjusting our buys, as we speak, to make sure that that's fully incorporated into our buys.","Evren Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Okay. We'll take one last question, and then come back for closing remarks.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from John Kernan with Cowen & Company.","John Kernan - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for squeezing me in. Welcome, Jane.","Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Thank you, John.","John Kernan - Cowen & Co. LLC","Stefan, I know the Way Forward Plan, two of the four key pillars did center around sourcing and supply chain. So I'm wondering what you're seeing in terms of product costs and your ability to bring product costs down as we look into spring 2017. And can you just comment on product costs and any direction there, and the impact on gross margin would be helpful?","Stefan Larsson - Ralph Lauren Corp.","So it's probably a combination between Jane and I. But I can start in terms of I'm very pleased with seeing how our sourcing teams are rising to the Way Forward challenge, and sourcing starting to become a strategic value driver for us.","So, one very concrete progress that we have made there is to platform our fabric. So, when we platform and consolidate our fabric of our core products, we can get a number of benefits at the same time. We increased the quality, to start with, because we are going to compete with quality. So we increased quality. We increased our ability to negotiate the better cost price for that fabric. And we increased our flexibility and can shorten our lead times dramatically. So, that's just one of a number of sourcing initiatives that we are driving that will have a direct impact on the P&L over time.","Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Yeah. Just in terms of gross margin, so I looked at this quarter sort of in biggest impact. Our biggest impact was the favorable geographic and channel mix. Improved product costing was our second most favorable impact, followed by initiative to reduce markdowns, especially in our international market.","I do view this as a long-term tailwind for us. Obviously, given the current long cycle times, it'll play out over time. But I do view it as something that we'll see as a favorable tailwind to gross margin.","Stefan Larsson - Ralph Lauren Corp.","This is something that Halide and the team, the sourcing team, they are also taking a partnership approach with our best suppliers and partnering up with them to unlock joint value. And we are seeing good progress on their work.","John Kernan - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay.","Evren Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Okay.","Stefan Larsson - Ralph Lauren Corp.","So, that was the question. So, in closing, I would like to say that I'm excited by the good progress of starting to execute our Way Forward Plan. I'm very grateful for how the team has embraced this and how we step-by-step start to execute and drive improvements and learn from those improvements.","So this will be a continuous improvements journey that we just started, but I'm very excited by that. Excited also by the North American comeback plan that we have a strategy to come back to strength in North America. And I'm pleased that we're keeping the guidance that we set out during the Investor Day.","So, with that, I would like to thank you for joining the call today and look forward to speak with you in a quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mrs. Evren Kopelman. Please go ahead.","Evren Kopelman - Head-Investor Relations","Good morning, and thank you for joining Ralph Lauren's fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2016 conference call. With me today are Stefan Larsson, the company's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Madore, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions, which we ask that you limit to one per caller.","During today's call, we will be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, which may include our financial outlook. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees and our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Our expectations contain many risks and uncertainties. The principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from our current expectations are detailed in our SEC filings.","And now, I will turn the call over to Stefan.","Stefan Larsson - President and Chief Executive Officer, Ralph Lauren Corp.","Thank you, Evren, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying we are making progress in setting and beginning to execute our strategy to return Ralph Lauren Corporation to profitable growth. In doing that, we will balance driving near-term performance with our long-term vision. I look forward to doing a deep dive on our plan and providing a Q1 and fiscal 2017 outlook, as well as discussing how our plan will translate into long-term financial performance at our Investor Day on June 7.","When we last spoke, I shared with you how I spent my first three months in the role; my initial observations and a rough outline of my approach to building the growth plan for this great company. Today, I will provide an overview of our main priorities and recent performance before turning the call over to Bob to discuss the Q4 and fiscal year financial results in more detail. In recent months, while I've been working hard to drive the business here and now, I've also worked closely with our teams to complete the comprehensive review of the business and develop the strategic plan. Through that work, we have gained a very clear understanding of the underlying drivers of the current performance and we now have a detailed view of what's driving the downward trend.","In short, we have not focused enough on nor evolved enough the core of what made us great in product, marketing and the shopping experience. In addition, our underlying business engines are not running at full speed. We also have an inefficient cost structure and an organization that's not nimble enough in the marketplace. What made us great was a crystal clear focus on owning classic iconic style and putting an effortless twist to it to make it current and desirable. We will become more true to our core focused assortment on creating the best iconic style in the market and evolve the way we twist it so it becomes more desirable for today.","Iconic style made current has never been more relevant. While staying true to our DNA, we will also evolve our marketing and the shopping experience to better reflect the aspirational life and style people dream of today. We have many unique strengths to build on. These include our brand strength, being the original for aspirational authentic American and iconic style, a very strong share position, a talented team and a solid infrastructure.","In our diagnosis of the business, I've been deeply embedded with our global teams who create the customer offering. These are the teams that create our products, marketing and shopping experience, as well as run the inventory management, sourcing and supply chain, the core value-creating drivers in our business. They must provide our regions and channels with a consumer offering we need to win versus our best competitors. I've done this deep dive to understand how we create our offering and what drives the underperformance of today. What I've learned is encouraging because we now know what we need to do differently, and we have a clear line of sight to improving the way we connect with consumers and operate the business.","For most of my 18-year career in this industry, I've led teams through the process of turning creative energy and talent into high-performance businesses. I know the value driving components of the creative processes from my time with H&M and then in turning around Old Navy. I'm excited to see so much untapped potential at Ralph Lauren and we will leverage our brand vision into a much stronger consumer offering. This offering will be built by evolving our brand voice, our products, our marketing and our shopping experience, in parallel with developing stronger underlying business engines, rightsizing our cost structure and strengthening our leadership team. Getting these elements right will help us connect more with our existing consumers, expand our reach to new consumers and return the business to strong growth over time.","An important part of getting back to high-performance is strengthening our leadership team on both the design and operation side of the business. I'm pleased with how we're starting to come together here. We're recruiting new talent and challenging our top performers with expanded roles. A few examples are Valerie Hermann, Fredrik Hjalmers and Holiday Alagos (06:18).","Valerie has been with Ralph Lauren for little over two years and has started to build a foundation that will strengthen our luxury business. She has decades of experience in luxury, including CEO of Yves Saint Laurent and Head of Women's Ready to Wear for Dior. She has built a track record of strengthening brands and driving high performance in luxury. She has unique experience in working to commercialize design and drive profitable growth. We have therefore recently expanded Valerie's role as brand president to now also include Lauren, Polo Women's, Chaps and Denim & Supply.","Fredrik Hjalmers joined us in April in the newly created role of Senior Vice President, Global Expansion and Business Development. He has seven years of experience leading high performance global expansion to new markets within the H&M Group. Fredrik will be responsible for globally leading the work to create and execute the strongest possible multi-brand and multichannel distribution and expansion strategy for the company, which is one of the core components in our growth plan.","Holiday Alagos (07:33) is joining our team in June as Head of Global Sourcing. She has 18 years of experience driving high performance within production and sourcing for H&M and her track record is stellar. Holiday (07:46) has been a key driver for H&M's ability to make sourcing a competitive advantage and she created a tremendous amount of value for them. We're looking forward to Holiday (07:33) coming on board as we develop the best-in-class sourcing strategy.","We will continue to strengthen our team in the months and years ahead and I'm happy to say that our teams are aligned and excited about where we're going and how we are going to get there. We will move this company into the future in a way that excites our consumers, beats our competitors and drives value for the company and shareholders. One way Ralph made this company great was by being an entrepreneur and that's what we're going back to. We're going to move fast to begin executing our growth strategy, continuously learn and improve, get closer to the consumer and get back to high performance.","Now let me turn to a few key takeaways from our fourth quarter results. As you saw in the press release, net revenues were in line with our expectations for the fourth quarter, down 1% on a reported basis and flat in constant currency. The key driver for the top line performance in the fourth quarter was as expected pressure in North America which was offset by growth in international markets. Following a challenging fall and holiday seasons, we were focused on clearing end of season's inventories across our channels of distribution in the U.S. I've been focusing much of my time on our U.S. business. I've been working closely with our key customers in the market. As we look to fiscal 2017, we are planning our inventory and receipts very carefully in the U.S. for both the wholesale and retail channels. Our strategic plan will address the issues in our core U.S. market.","Moving on to our profitability, Q4 gross margin was pressured by the inventory clearance activity in the U.S. and continued foreign currency impact. Our operating margin was down significantly, but better than our guidance, driven by strong expense management. While I'm feeling relatively good about how we managed expenses, I want to make it clear that I see this kind of operating income decline as unacceptable. We have significant opportunity to further reduce costs and reinvest some of those savings in engines that will drive brand strength and profitable sales growth.","Before I turn it over to Bob for the details of our financial performance in the quarter and fiscal 2016, I want to reiterate that we are looking forward to sharing our strategic growth plan in detail with you at our upcoming Investor Day.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob.","Robert L. Madore - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you, Stefan, and good morning, everyone. Fourth quarter net revenues were flat with the prior-year period on a constant currency basis and declined 1% on a reported basis to $1.9 billion. This is in line with the guidance we provided in February of a flat to 2% decline on a reported basis. The negative FX impact to revenue growth was approximately 110 basis points, slightly better than our expectation of 150 basis points of negative impact as foreign currencies moved favorably during the quarter.","The company's fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 included a 53rd week that contributed approximately $70 million in sales and was primarily generated within the retail segment. For the full year fiscal 2016 period, net revenues grew 1% in constant currency and declined 3% on a reported basis to $7.4 billion. Gross profit margin was 54.4% in the fourth quarter, excluding restructuring charges. This was 90 basis points below the prior-year period, reflecting proactive measures taken in the U.S. to clear end of season inventories related to the fall season in addition to unfavorable foreign currency effects. For the full year fiscal 2016 period, gross margin declined 70 basis points to 56.8%, excluding restructuring charges, due to negative foreign currency impacts which was partially offset by a favorable sales mix shift to the retail segment.","Operating margin in the fourth quarter was 6.4%, excluding restructuring and other charges. This was 370 basis points below the prior year due to gross margin pressure, unfavorable foreign currency effects and incremental investments in infrastructure and marketing. However, operating margin was better than the outlook we provided in February of a 400-basis point to 450-basis point decline. This was due to disciplined expense management throughout the organization. For the full year fiscal 2016 period, operating margin declined 290 basis points to 10.7%, excluding restructuring and other charges, due to gross margin pressure, fixed expense deleverage, unfavorable foreign currency effects, and incremental investments in infrastructure and new stores.","Net income for the fourth quarter was $74 million, or $0.88 per diluted share, excluding restructuring and other charges. On a reported basis, net income in the fourth quarter was $41 million, or $0.49 per diluted share. For the full year period, net income was $546 million, or $6.36 per diluted share, excluding restructuring and other charges. The effective tax rate of 34% in the fourth quarter on an adjusted basis was higher than the guidance of 32% due to one-time discrete items and compared to an effective tax rate of 28% in the prior-year period.","Moving on to segment performance, wholesale revenues decreased 5% in constant currency in the fourth quarter and 6% on a reported basis to $942 million. This was primarily due to a decline in North America, as business trends remain challenging. We are refining our product assortments and deliveries for fiscal 2017 to improve trends in this channel in what is a very challenging environment. Wholesale operating margin in the fourth quarter was 27.2%, excluding restructuring and other charges. This was 350 basis points below the prior-year period due to proactive measures taken in the U.S. to clear end of season inventories related to the fall season and negative foreign currency effects.","Retail segment sales rose 7% in constant currency and 6% on a reported basis to $889 million. Growth was driven by the benefit of a 53rd week of sales, new store expansion, and e-commerce growth. On a 13-week to 13-week basis, consolidated comparable store sales decreased 5% in constant currency and 6% as reported during the fourth quarter. Brick-and-mortar traffic trends remained negative in the U.S. Sales to foreign tourists were down approximately 25% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and for the full year. E-commerce revenue was up mid-single digits on a global basis in the fourth quarter supported by the 53rd week, while comps were up slightly on a 13-week to 13-week basis.","We continue to expect to move to our new e-commerce platform later this fiscal year. The new platform will not only improve the functionality of our site, but will allow us to improve how we engage with our customers digitally and across our retail channels. We believe this will dramatically improve the customers' experience on mobile devices. We look forward to delivering a best-in-class site experience. At year-end, we had 493 directly operated standalone stores and 583 concessions globally. That represents an increase of 27 net new directly operated stores and 47 concession shops when compared to the end of fiscal 2015. In addition, our international licensing partners operated 93 Ralph Lauren stores and 42 dedicated shops as well as 58 Club Monaco stores and 75 Club Monaco concession shops at the end of fiscal 2016.","Retail operating margin in the fourth quarter excluding restructuring and other charges was 2.4% which was 100 basis points below the prior-year period, reflecting proactive measures taken to clear end of season inventories in the U.S. in addition to negative foreign currency effects. Licensing revenues increased 8% and operating income was up 9% in the fourth quarter, reflecting higher royalties from increased sales of Ralph Lauren, Polo Ralph Lauren and Lauren products worldwide.","Now let me provide some color on performance by geography in the quarter. In the Americas, net revenue declined 1% in constant currency driven by pressure in our North America business that we spoke about previously. Same-store sales were down mid-single digits in the fourth quarter. In Europe, net revenues were up 4% in constant currency. We continued to experience strong sell-through rates at our retail partners across most of our brands and same-store sales were positive in our own retail stores.","In Asia, net revenue growth of 3% in constant currency was muted by a decline in same-store sales, which was negatively impacted by our strategy to reduce markdowns in Japan and Korea, our two key markets in Asia. We experienced gross margin improvement and our average unit retails were up strong double digits in Japan and Korea and our markdown rates were down significantly. We believe that these actions will continue to help us elevate the brand and drive profitable sales growth in this region.","Now let me provide you with an update on our restructuring activities related to the global brand management initiative. The total restructuring charge for fiscal 2016 was $142 million. In addition, we incurred another $22 million of impairment related to underperforming stores subject to potential future closure. We now expect to deliver approximately $125 million of annual cost savings from the fiscal 2016 Global Reorganization Plan, $15 million higher than the $110 million that we communicated previously. This is driven by additional restructuring activities we identified and executed late in the fiscal year. We had a part year benefit in fiscal 2016 from our restructuring activities and will have a full year benefit in fiscal 2017.","Moving on to the balance sheet, consolidated inventory was $1.1 billion at the end of the fiscal year, up 8% year-over-year. This growth reflects investments to support new stores and concession shops and a change in the timing of receipt plans. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had 27 more directly operated stores and 47 more concession shops than a year ago, which is contributing to the growth.","Moving to capital expenditures, we spent $418 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $391 million in fiscal 2015 mostly to support new retail stores, concession shops and infrastructure projects. The company repurchased 1.2 million shares of its common stock during the fourth quarter at a cost of $100 million. This brought our total buyback activity to 4.2 million shares for a total cost of $480 million for the full year.","In addition, we returned $170 million to shareholders via dividend payments. Yesterday, the company's board of directors authorized an additional $200 million stock repurchase program. This amount is in addition to the $100 million available at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 as part of a previously authorized stock repurchase program, bringing the company's total current authorization to $300 million.","We ended the year with approximately $1.3 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet and $713 million of total debt. Looking out to fiscal 2017, as Stefan mentioned, we plan to provide financial guidance at our Investors Day on June 7 for the new fiscal year as well as the first quarter of fiscal 2017.","With that, we will open the call for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The first question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Good morning. Thanks for all the updates and information. Stefan, I know you probably don't want to steal your own thunder for the investor meeting next month, but I'd love to hear if you have any updated thoughts and views as you've had another 90 days to be immersed in the business regarding the complexity of the business structure and the brand structure across channels, price points, sub-brands, categories, globally. It's obviously a very unique aspect of the company, and I'm just wondering how you're thinking about it and what you've learned on that front. And does this excess complexity internally and externally the consumer, is it something that you can address over time or does it need to be addressed? Thanks.","Stefan Larsson - President and Chief Executive Officer, Ralph Lauren Corp.","Thanks, Omar. Yes, you've covered basically the agenda for the Investor Day. So I'm sorry to disappoint you to refer the detailed answer to your question will have to wait until the Investor Day on June 7. What I can say is that we have made progress in assessing and knowing exactly where we stand as a business and we feel really confident in that we have the strategy to build the company back to a high performance. And part of that will be simplicity because simplicity and focus is, as I shared last quarterly call, something that I believe in and I also believe in building on the core of what's made us great and that's what the strategy is going to be built on.","Evren Kopelman - Head-Investor Relations","Okay. Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask, Stefan, you talked a little bit about the focus on the product, iconic styles with an updated twist. As you think about the company's lead times and the work that you've already done, when should we think about the timing for new product to hit? And then separately, if you guys could just give an update on how effective the price increases you took overseas were? I know we heard that in Japan and I think Australia that consumers accepted it and it worked, but we were still waiting to hear on Europe for the early part of this year. Thanks.","Stefan Larsson - President and Chief Executive Officer, Ralph Lauren Corp.","Hey. Thanks, Lindsay. I'll go first. It's Stefan. Yes, so the work to evolve the products will be tightly connected with the work of strengthening our underlying business engine; one being the supply chain. So your question is very relevant. We will address it in detail on June 7, but we have a clear path to how we're going to evolve the product and how we're going to connect that with improvement in supply chain. And I can give high-level thoughts on supply chain, which is that I see big opportunities to start there and in two areas, both inventory management part and the lead time part. So in essence, I see opportunities to sell more with less inventory and I also see an opportunity to drastically increase our speed and our flexibility. So that will help us when we evolve the consumer-facing offering.","Robert L. Madore - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Hi, Lindsay, it's Bob, and I'll take the question around the price increases. We're very pleased with the price increases that we've taken in the major markets where we experienced FX headwinds, mainly Japan, Australia, Canada and Europe. And as an example of that, for instance, our European business revenues grew mid-single digits in the fourth quarter, and we plan to maintain the price increases that we've implemented across all those countries.","As another example of the acceptance by the consumer, within our Asian business we've seen a significant improvement in our quality of sale metrics. Our gross profit percentage has increased, our average unit retails have gone up, we've seen an improvement in our comp gross margin dollar, so overall, as I said, we're very pleased and we're going to maintain those increases going forward.","Evren Kopelman - Head-Investor Relations","Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Michael Binetti with UBS Investment Research.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Thanks a lot. Congrats on a nice quarter, guys. No doubt it's tough out there. So one question and a follow up, I guess. It sounds like we're going to get a lot of detail in June and the look ahead of the plan, but if we could just reference to your prior comment, the revenues will be negative next year as you rebase but that operating margins could still be up. I know we talked about this during the quarter, but the math on that reality seems pretty hard to envision and the market is deteriorating as we've seen earnings reports here this week. Are those guideposts still on the table? And if so, Stefan, now that you've had a look under the hood for a while, where do you see the most opportunity to manage costs to get to that reality?","Robert L. Madore - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes. Michael, I'll take that one actually. I think that general guidance still holds, and I apologize for this, but we'll be able to give much more specific guidance at our Investor Day on June 7. We think it's really important to provide a complete view of our strategic plan and the financial targets that are tied to the plan together. So I'm going to have to ask you to be patient and wait until June 7 Investor Day.","Stefan Larsson - President and Chief Executive Officer, Ralph Lauren Corp.","Yes, just to complement on what Bob just said, when it comes to rightsizing the cost structure, it's something that we have spent a lot of time on over the last few months and we see big opportunities there. So we're looking at every component of the cost structure. We'd go through it and share with you on the Investor Day.","Robert L. Madore - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","And I'll add one other thing, too. Just as a reminder, and we mentioned it in our opening remarks that we did take restructuring actions within fiscal 2016, and as we've noted, that's going to drive approximately $125 million of savings. That $125 million savings number is in excess of the previously communicated $110 million, really because towards the end of the fourth quarter we did take additional restructuring actions and activities that drove the increased savings number.","Evren Kopelman - Head-Investor Relations","Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan Chase.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning. So on the distribution front, Stefan, how do you view your wholesale positioning and off-price exposure out of the quarter? Who do you see as your primary competition today? And then as it relates to e-commerce, what's the best way to think about Amazon as a potential channel of distribution?","Stefan Larsson - President and Chief Executive Officer, Ralph Lauren Corp.","Thanks, Matt. Good question. So when it comes to the U.S. market where it's clear that we have been under the most pressure, my focus is to get back to high performance in the U.S. wholesale channel. So that's to start with. It's our main focus, working very closely with our big customers and feel confident that we have a plan to get back to strength.","In parallel with that, we are expanding our direct-to-consumer channels, and out of those channels, the e-commerce is by far the most important to get back to strength and high performance. And overall when it comes to the channels in the U.S., we are working to make sure that we secure the high-quality distribution, right balance in the distribution between the different channels, and we'll come back and give you more details in June.","Evren Kopelman - Head-Investor Relations","Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Kate McShane with Citigroup.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I think you had highlighted that in the calendar year fourth quarter that you had made changes to retail, which I think is part of that $125 million in savings where you closed some doors. But then I think you also re-bannered some of the retail doors as well. Can you update us on how those changes have impacted the retail base and how you think about that going forward?","Robert L. Madore - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes, hi, Kate. It's Bob. I'll take that question. So for the fiscal year, we actually closed approximately 43 stores. Part of that was incorporated within the restructuring charge activities and some of it was just natural lease expirations and stores that just didn't fit our strategic portfolio or plan. From a rebalancing perspective, our RLS or Ralph Lauren portfolio between full-price stores and Polo stores, we had identified roughly 40% of the fleet that was essentially positioned more towards Polo. We started to undertake conversion of some of those stores to standalone Polo stores versus a hybrid of Ralph Lauren and Polo, and that'll be done over a period of time. These aren't going to incorporate major remodel activities. These are signage changes, an element of minor remodel activity, et cetera, and we've probably touched about 15% of that portfolio thus far with the remainder to be done over the next year, 18 months.","Evren Kopelman - Head-Investor Relations","Great. Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Chris Svezia with Susquehanna.","Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you for taking my question. I guess, Stefan, for you, just when you think about the major U.S. accounts, the wholesale accounts, and all the work you've been having conversations with them of late, when you sit down and have a conversation with them, what do they say about the brand opportunity to grow or return to growth beyond 2017, assuming that you've already sort of enlightened them or shared some of the strategic opportunities and brand positioning as we move forward? Just sort of what are they telling you that Ralph needs to do or needs to be? Maybe that would be helpful.","Stefan Larsson - President and Chief Executive Officer, Ralph Lauren Corp.","Yes. So thanks, Chris. Good question. So when I sit down and spend time with our wholesale partners, they start with how much they respect the Ralph Lauren brand and how important that brand is to them and their consumers. So that's where we start, and then given the nature of how I lead, I ask a lot of questions of how we can build on that strength and how we can evolve our offering and how we can make sure that we start to drive high performance again, which we have done for many, many years. And they are very confident in evolving our products, evolving our marketing, evolving our shopping experience and combining that, when I share how we are planning to high level strengthen our underlying business engines, they get really excited and they want to be a part of that journey. And I see them as an intricate part in evolving the business engines, and I'm excited to do this journey together with them.","Evren Kopelman - Head-Investor Relations","Great. Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from David Glick with Buckingham Research Group.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thank you. Just a follow up on the U.S. wholesale business. I'm just curious, when you look at and you've talked about needing more innovation in the product, but when you look at the positioning of the brand from an initial price point perspective and you look at how sort of key item intensive the business has become and reliant on some of those key selling period promotions to drive key items, how do you see that evolving from a price point perspective and sort of key item versus fashion perspective going forward? Thanks.","Stefan Larsson - President and Chief Executive Officer, Ralph Lauren Corp.","Thanks, David. So when it comes to pricing, I believe that we're in a world where the consumer decides today. So charging (32:58) a premium pricing comes back to having the best products, and that's what our strategy is focused on, to go back to the core of who we are and where we come from and evolve that and make it current for today and have better authentic style, better quality and be more relevant, and that connects to the pricing. And when it comes to the actual product strategy, I look forward to sharing that more in detail when we see each other in June.","Evren Kopelman - Head-Investor Relations","Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Laurent Vasilescu with Macquarie Capital.","Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow up on Valerie Hermann's appointment to President of the Luxury Collection. Last May, you announced six group global brand groups. Are these six groups still in place? And if so, now that these groups anniversary full year, can you parse out how big they are in terms of revenues? Can you rank them in order of performance? And then any color around which division you're most excited about would be great.","Stefan Larsson - President and Chief Executive Officer, Ralph Lauren Corp.","Yes. Thanks, Laurent. So starting with the brand groups and the global brand teams so I spent many, many hours over the last three months together with the global brand teams and they are more important than ever before because the teams there they create global consumer offering. They create the design of the products, and do the overall inventory management and the planning and connects to the supply chain team. So they drive the core value creating engine. And when it comes to Valerie's expanded role, I'm expanding her role because I want to leverage her experience of commercializing design and driving high performance out of creativity. So the brand teams are doing great. I look forward to again sharing the details in June and how the different brand teams relate to each other.","Evren Kopelman - Head-Investor Relations","Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from John Kernan with Cowen & Co.","John Kernan - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. Stefan, can you talk about how you're going to bring some of the best practices of the supply chain from H&M and Old Navy? Obviously the execution there was fantastic while you were there. And does it translate well to a wholesale dominated business? Can you take a lot of those best practices in terms of the speed of design and the speed in the supply chain and translate that into a wholesale business?","Stefan Larsson - President and Chief Executive Officer, Ralph Lauren Corp.","Yes. John, again, sorry to disappoint you. The in-depth sharing of this we'll have to wait until June, but higher level I'm very excited when it comes to unlocking supply chain capabilities. And getting to know the business the way I've done over the last months and getting to know how our customers work, I see big opportunities in implementing a lot of the same best practice. And also excited by seeing that our wholesale partners are very excited and willing to dive into improving the supply chain together with us.","John Kernan - Cowen & Co. LLC","Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Rick Patel with Stephens, Inc.","Rick Patel - Stephens, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Stefan, before you got here, the company invested quite heavily in SAP and e-commerce and I know a lot of that is still going on today. As we sit here today, are you satisfied with the capabilities you have from a technology perspective? Or should we expect a step-up in terms of new investments that might be needed to get the company to where it needs to be?","Stefan Larsson - President and Chief Executive Officer, Ralph Lauren Corp.","Rick, thanks for the question. Having had the chance to dive deeper into the company, I'm impressed by the capability when it comes to the infrastructure. So far it's the strongest I've seen so I feel from a business strategy and execution of the strategies we have set up, the capabilities are going to enable us to do that in a way that I haven't seen before in any of the companies I've been working out. So I'm excited that we have that foundation of infrastructure in place and that will just speed up our implementation of the strategy because the core elements of the strategy are not necessarily capital-intensive.","It's about a methodology. It's about how we approach the business, how we evolve the consumer offering, how we get the business engines, the underlying engines to go, how we get the cost structure to be right sized and how we strengthen the leadership team continuously. So very pleased.","Evren Kopelman - Head-Investor Relations","Okay. We'll take one final question.","Operator","Thank you. The final question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Good morning, everyone. As you think about the levers underneath the gross margin and especially if you're bringing in the new sourcing person, what are the opportunities in those gross margin levers underneath? And what do you see is the opportunity to increase speed to market with sourcing? Thank you.","Stefan Larsson - President and Chief Executive Officer, Ralph Lauren Corp.","Hi, Dana and thanks for the question.","Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Hi.","Stefan Larsson - President and Chief Executive Officer, Ralph Lauren Corp.","A couple of thoughts on that high level and then again June 7 in detail, I'd love to share that with you, but high level, we see opportunities when it comes to evolving the strength of the products. One area is developing a systematic repeatable way of how we create assortment and we'll go through that in detail in June.","But I see definitely value unlock there in terms of gross margin expansion. Also when it comes to the demand driven supply chain, so when it comes to being more balanced in making sure that the inventory we plan and buy, that that matches with the consumer demand. And then thirdly, I'm excited to bring Holiday (39:20) in with her sourcing expertise and her sourcing experience because I know firsthand that she brings best-in-class, best in industry sourcing capabilities and she will have to have a few months of learning the business and then she will start to unlock gross margin dollars there as well.","Evren Kopelman - Head-Investor Relations","And that was the final question.

Welcome to the Ralph Lauren Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2019 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions on how to ask a question will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Ms. Corinna Van der Ghinst. Please go ahead.","Corinna Van der Ghinst","Good morning and thank you for joining Ralph Lauren's fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2019 conference call. With me today are Patrice Louvet, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jane Nielsen, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions, which we ask that you limit to one per caller.","During today's call, we will be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws, including our financial outlook. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees, and our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.","Our expectations contain many risks and uncertainties. Principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from our current expectations are detailed in our SEC filings. To find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our financial results, you should refer to this morning's earnings release and to our SEC filings that can be found on our Investor Relations website.","And now, I will turn the call over to Patrice.","Patrice Louvet","Thank you, Cory. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining today's call. We're pleased to report fourth quarter and full year fiscal '19 results that delivered on our commitments with revenues, operating margin and double-digit EPS growth all coming in ahead of our outlook for both the quarter and the year.","Our fourth quarter performance was driven by double-digit revenue growth in Asia and Europe on a constant currency basis and better-than-expected AUR growth globally. North America also made continued progress on returning to a healthier base with ongoing elevation of our brand and a planned reduction of our off-price channel penetration, though we recognize that we still have more work to do on this multiyear journey.","On balance, our company outperformed on core metrics this year with several areas of our business delivering ahead of expectations and a few that require more work. Moving forward we're focused on leveraging the successes while also applying the learnings from this first year of our next great chapter strategic plan. As we close out fiscal '19, Ralph and I are proud of the work our teams have done this year. We're encouraged by the strong progress we've made on our strategic plan to deliver long-term, sustainable growth and value creation.","In a moment, Jane will take you through the fourth quarter and fiscal '20 outlook, but first let me start by reviewing our fiscal '19 highlights across the five strategic priorities in our plan. As a reminder, these include first, win over a new generation of consumers. Second, energize core products and accelerate high potential underdeveloped categories. Third, drive targeted expansion in our regions and channels. Fourth, lead with digital across all activities and fifth, operate with discipline to show growth.","Starting with over new generation of consumers, as we outlined at Investor Day last June, our goal is to recruit millions of new consumers into our brands each year. To achieve that, we've been elevating our brand building content and increasing our marketing investment, with a focus on channels that matter most to consumers today namely, digital and social.","In fiscal '19, we increased marketing spend by 13% on top of the 10% increase in the prior year. Highlights from the year and key learnings included, two unique fashion shows the generated record levels of global engagement from Ralph Lauren. We are creating differentiated experiences with our shows where we can engage consumers in new ways and amplify our messaging globally to in-store events and digitally.","Our exciting collaboration with UK-based streetwear brand Palace and limited edition launches throughout the year, introduced the brand to new and younger consumers. As part of this, we activated our new POLO mobile app and partnered with influential specialty retailers around the world to reach trend savvy consumers where they shop.","We continue to leverage the power of cultural events and influencers, notably Ralph's incredible custom designs for the wedding of Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas in India and our successful exhibition at Intercept one of China's most innovative platforms for creatives from the world of art, food, fashion, and music.","And lastly, our partnerships and high visibility with Wimbledon, US Open Tennis and the US team at the Ryder Cup, reinforced Ralph Lauren's authentic connection to the world of sports. As a result, we saw healthy growth in our number of Instagram followers with a 45% increase to last year to reach over 15 million followers across our brand handles. In the fourth quarter specifically, marketing highlights included our spring 2019 runway presentation, which transformed part of our Madison Avenue flagship into an immersive, provision-inspired Ralph's Coffee experience.","We're also leveraging key categories like Fragrance to recruit a new generation of consumers. In Q4, we launched a new campaign around the iconic Ralph Lauren Romance fragrance, featuring our new global ambassador Taylor Hill. And just a few weeks ago, you may have seen our Family is Who You Love global campaign, which captures a modern take on family, however you define it. It is a positive and powerful message about inclusion that has resonated with consumers and across Global press.","We are gaining traction with younger consumers as we engage with them in new, relevant, and exciting ways. We are in the early stages of this journey and are focused on building momentum among both millennial and Gen Z consumers globally.","Moving on to our second key initiative, energize core products and accelerate high potential under-developed categories. In the fourth quarter and fiscal year, we made progress on our long-term plan to drive roughly half of our revenue targets through growth in core product and the other half through the expansion of five under-developed categories. Our iconic and updated core styles continue to be a key driver of our top line performance. As Ralph and the design teams generate excitement in the marketplace.","We continue to animate these core styles through the use of print, embroidery, color blocking, graphic POLO logos, our POLO bear and customization offerings. Moving to our under-developed categories that have significant growth potential across our brands. These include denim, outerwear, wear-to-work, footwear and accessories.","Our performance in denim outerwear, which are the further developed of the five categories was encouraging this year, benefiting from an improved product, merchandising and distribution focus. Positive sales trends in these categories for both the fourth quarter and fiscal 2019 indicated a strong consumer response to our new initiatives.","Notably, outerwear growth accelerated as we move through the year, fueled by our focus on key programs such as core nylon, down, bomber and leather jackets. We were able to apply early learnings from this past winter's performance as we launched an expanded outerwear offering and coordinated marketing campaign for fall 2019. And while the accessories are expected to play a more meaningful role leader in our long-term plan, we were excited to introduce our RL50 collection hand back to the market this spring.","Our newest merger classic Ralph Lauren style with modern sophistication and artisanal leather craftsmanship. These developments represent strong progress, but we still have work to do, particularly in product areas that are not yet performing to their potential.","For example, a Lauren wholesale business in North America where we need to drive a greater focus on core categories and better balance core product with fashion. And while our core POLO products drove our performance, we have an opportunity to strengthen the appeal of our fashion concepts. We've already taken decisive action to address both of these areas with a new design direction and category strategy in place for Lauren, which should start to impact spring '20 and onward, and earlier adjustments in place on or POLO design concepts.","Moving on to our third key initiative; drive targeted expansion in our regions, and channels. We are focused on building a cohesive brand-elevating Ralph Lauren experience across our retail, wholesale, and digital commerce presence in key cities around the world. In fiscal '19 we opened 135 new stores and concessions globally and closed 85 locations. This included 94 openings in Asia with 39 in China, our fastest growing market.","For the full year, greater China revenue was up 20% to last year in constant currency, representing about 3.5% of our total company revenue. This included more than 30% growth in Mainland China on top of the 25% growth we reported last year, driven by comp growth and new stores.","In Europe, we opened four new full-price stores and two new factory stores on a net basis. We are still significantly underpenetrated at brick and mortar retail, with only 23-owned full price stores across Europe, and we continue to see a meaningful long-term opportunity to build out our ecosystem strategy in the region.","Overall in fiscal '19 we track slightly behind our annual store openings target, as we remain highly selective on real estate locations to ensure that they elevate the brand and meet our profitability targets.","Moving on to our fourth key initiative lead with digital. Our global digital business including our directly operated sites, departmentstore.com, pure players and social commerce was up 11% in constant currency in fiscal 2019, with strong performance across all regions led by international. Our directly operated North American digital flagship returned to positive growth during the year as planned.","Comps grew 10% compared to a 22% decline in fiscal ' 18 as we lap last year's transition to cloud-based platform. Our directly operated European digital commerce sites also showed strong improvement following the move to our new platform this fiscal year. Comps were up 6% in the fourth quarter and full fiscal year, despite reduced promotional activity to elevate the brand.","We also continue to drive strong performance with digital pure play partners across all regions this year. In the US, in the fourth quarter, we added distribution of Men's Polo the Essence a leading international fashion platform known for its curated selection of luxury and streetwear brands. We also expanded our presence on motor operandi with RRL and the [indiscernible] with Chaps.","Internationally, we added 11 new wholesale digital partners in Europe in the quarter. Including specialty players that resonate with younger trend forward consumers like slamjamsocialism.com in Italy, and kicks.com in Germany. We also continue to expand our digital presence in Asia including enhancements to our WeChat, shop in shop, in China an exclusive online collaborations with high-profile partners in Japan, Korea and Hong Kong.","While encouraged by our digital commerce momentum we see opportunities to accelerate growth of our total digital ecosystem and gain share. For example, by better leveraging our experience and assets in brand building and presentation from our own digital flagship we can apply our best practices with those of our partners to drive higher performance and productivity on wholesale.com.","Let me touch on our fifth key initiatives, operate with discipline to show growth. In fiscal '19 we continue to challenge every cost and improve our efficiencies as we progress towards a mid-teens operating margin target by fiscal '23. Adjusted operating expenses excluding marketing grew 1.4% below our top line growth for the year. This cost discipline enabled us to ramp up our marketing investments and expand our global retail presence, while increasing operating profit and operating margin above our guidance.","Jim will provide more details on how we're continuing to drive productivity. I also wanted to give you an update on citizenship and sustainability the topic we care deeply about. Over the last six months we've undertaken a focused effort to evolve our strategy and further embed sustainability across our organization.","In the coming months, we will share more about our approach to one; creating product, two; managing our environmental impact and three; how we champion and support our employees, the workers across our supply chain and our communities. One recent example of how we are bringing this to life in our products was the launch of the Earth Polo in April. The Earth Polo is made entirely of recycled plastic bottles and uses a waterless dyeing process. Early consumer reaction has been strong and we look forward to sharing more as we progress in this journey.","And lastly we recently announced two key organizational changes to support our strategic initiatives going forward. Jane Nielsen's role was expanded the Chief Operating Officer in addition to Chief Financial Officer. And Howard Smith, who successfully led our international group was elevated to the role of Chief Commercial Officer at the end of March adding North America to his responsibilities. We expect these changes to enable faster re-application of proven successes. Both promotions are extremely well deserved and further highlight the strength of our leadership.","In closing, this year's results demonstrate our progress on putting the consumer at the center of everything we do. Elevating the brand and balancing growth and productivity to deliver long-term sustainable growth and value creation. Our recent global employee survey conducted by Korn-Ferry demonstrates accelerated levels of engagement versus the prior year that now surpass the high performing norm. It's our teams excellent execution that is moving us forward and Ralph, the leadership team and I are inspired and energized by them every day.","With that, I'll turn it over to Jane and will join her at the end, to answer your questions.","Jane Nielsen","Thank you, Patrice and good morning everyone. Our team's performance this quarter and throughout the year, returned our company to top line growth, while continuing to drive higher EURs, expand operating margin and return more cash to shareholders. It's a good start to our journey with a clear path on our work ahead. Fourth quarter revenues increased 1.2% in constant currency and were down 1.5% on a reported basis.","Our international businesses delivered double-digit top line growth in constant currency, more than offsetting both the negative impact of the Easter shift into Q1 and our deliberate reduction in North America off-price sale. Adjusted gross margin expanded 30 basis points in the fourth quarter and 50 basis points in constant currency. Benefiting from reduced promotional activity and favorable product, geographic, and channel mix. Adjusted operating margin in the fourth quarter was 6.4%, up 80 basis points on a reported basis and a 110 basis points in constant currency.","Adjusted operating profit dollars grew 12% to last year. SG&A expense declined to 53.8% of sales, down from 54.2% last year, as we lap the acceleration in marketing investments made in the second half of FY'18.","Marketing spend declined 8% to last year in the fourth quarter but was up 13% on a full-year basis as we focused on winning over a new generation of consumers. Our dollar spending levels in the fourth quarter were roughly similar through the last three quarters of fiscal '19. We continue to make progress toward our long-term objective of increasing marketing to about 5% of sales, while also focusing on productivity to achieve our operating margin expansion goals.","We closed the year with marketing at 4.3% of sale. Our teams are intensely focused on driving operating efficiencies across our business. Initiatives this year included consolidation of our distribution footprint from four buildings to two, in conjunction with the launch of our direct to consumer shared inventory in North America in the fourth quarter. This will enable us to reduce our overall inventories, maximize full price selling and lower our fulfillment and overhead costs in the future. We renegotiated over 80 vendor contracts to drive a 14% reduction in addressable expenses, generating savings without compromising quality. And we continue to simplify our organization to improve agility and empower our leaders.","Moving onto segment performance, starting with North America. Revenue decreased 7% in the fourth quarter, adjusted operating margin was 15.9% with a 150 basis point decrease to last year, as modest gross margin expansion was more than offset by SG&A deleverage on negative retail comps. In the retail channel in North America, comps declined 4% in constant currency, including about 300 basis points of negative impact from the Easter shift into the first quarter of fiscal '20.","Our directly operated digital commerce business was up 6% with strong double-digit AUR increases, partly offset by the Easter shift. Bricks and mortar comps were down 7%, modestly lower than our trends earlier in the fiscal year, largely driven by challenging traffic with foreign tourist traffic down 5% versus a 7% increase in the prior year.","In our stores, we had positive AUR growth this quarter, but at a more moderated rate than in prior quarters. We still expect about a three-point shift in comp into Q1 due to Easter. Moving on to North America Wholesale. Fourth quarter revenue was down 10% more than half of the decline was due to a planned reduction in off-price sales.","As we have previously noted, we are strategically repositioning off-price back towards its original purpose as an excess inventory clearance fee. We will continue to pragmatically manage our off-price penetration down within our broader wholesale channel excluding off-price, our underlying North America wholesale business was down low-single digits in the fourth quarter. We are encouraged by the strength in our core products and are rightsizing our buys in select fashion oriented product.","We continue to monitor selling trends carefully and expect some ongoing volatility quarter-to-quarter. Our North American digital ecosystem including ralphlauren.com, wholesales.com, and digital pure plays was up slightly in the fourth quarter, negatively impacted by the Easter shift, and was up high-single digits for the full year, as we returned to growth on our own digital commerce site. Our teams are working with our digital wholesale partners to strengthen our brand imagery, storytelling and assortments to better realize the growth in this digital channel.","Moving on to Europe, fourth quarter revenue was up 4% on a reported basis and 11% in constant currency. Adjusted operating margins expanded 360 basis points on a reported basis and 340 basis points in constant currency. Operating margin expansion was driven by strong gross margins and SG&A leverage on top line growth.","In the retail channel in Europe, comps were up 5% in constant currency, driven by a 6% increase in our owned digital commerce sites and a 5% increase in our brick and mortar stores. Similar to last quarter, the sequential improvement in our brick and mortar comp trend was primarily driven by our outlet investment to get back into inventory positions, improve the breadth and depth of our product assortment and drive strong AUR growth.","The 6% comp growth in our directly operated European Digital Commerce business was also in line with our expectations, benefiting from platform enhancements and more targeted performance marketing. On our sites, we saw strong quality of sales improvements, double-digit growth in traffic, and high single-digit AUR increases, driven by positive consumer response to our new platform.","Across our Europe direct to consumer channels, our ongoing effort to improve quality of sales continued with AUR up 8% in the fourth quarter. Wholesale revenue in Europe was up 11% in constant currency in the fourth quarter. Despite a planned shift in the timing of shipments into the third quarter, which negatively impacted Q4 Europe wholesale revenues were ahead of our guidance, reflecting the benefit of modest distribution growth with existing wholesale partners.","Turning to Asia, revenue was up 7% on a reported basis and 10% in constant currency in the fourth quarter. We saw a strong performance across every market, including 30% constant currency revenue growth in Mainland China. Our product and marketing initiatives are resonating well in this region, and we continue to increase our digital efforts, expanded and elevate our store fleet, and engage with local influencers and celebrities. Comps in Asia increased 4% in constant currency, driven by 10% AUR growth and positive traffic. We expect continued comp growth in Asia as we invest in our distribution network, and increase our marketing initiatives to amplify and elevate the brand.","Adjusted operating margin was down 90 basis points to last year, as SG&A leverage was more than offset by gross margin contraction due to increased inventory reserves, primarily on select fashion concepts in the quarter.","Moving on to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet is strong and we return capital to shareholders, reflecting our continued operating progress. We ended the year with about $2 billion in cash and investments and 689 million in total debt. Which compares to $2.1 billion in cash and investments and $596 million in debt at the end of fiscal '18. Consistent with our commitment to return cash to shareholders, we repurchased $470 million in shares during the year. Including dividends and share repurchases we returned over $660 million to shareholders in fiscal '19, up from $162 million last year.","We will continue to opportunistically buyback stock with about $600 million in repurchases plan for fiscal '20. we also raised our annual dividend by 10% to $2.75 for fiscal '20. On top of a 25% increase last year.","Moving on to inventory. At the end of fiscal '19, inventory was up 7% to last year, moderating from 11% increase in the third quarter. Similar to the last two quarters, our inventory growth reflects strategic actions to support the following. One, early receipt of goods to maximize full price selling; two, comp growth; three, new retail distribution; and four, getting back to normalized inventories in our Europe factory stores, and we continue to reduce our air freight to lower shipment costs.","Looking ahead, we expect inventories in the first quarter of fiscal '20, to be similar to our fourth quarter trend up high-single digits. As we anniversary our inventory initiatives in the first half, we will leverage shared inventory and a more unified buying process to better align inventory to demand. We are also taking a more cautious approach to inventories, especially in light of the dynamic trading environment. The tariffs enacted to date have a limited impact on our business, but our teams are prepared for multiple scenarios and have accelerated the diversification of our supply chain to mitigate the long-term impact of any potential tariff outcomes.","Now I'd like to turn to guidance for the full year and the first quarter of fiscal '20. As a reminder, this guidance excludes restructuring and related charges, and reflects our best assessment of the global retail landscape in the context of increased volatility for macroeconomic and geopolitical events. For full year fiscal '20, we expect revenues to be up 2% to 3% in constant currency, consistent with our long-term plan. At current spot rates, foreign currency is expected to have about a 90 basis point to 100 basis point negative impact on revenue growth in fiscal '20.","We expect continued growth in our international businesses and stabilization in North America. We expect operating margin for fiscal '20 to be up 40 basis points to 60 basis points in constant currency, driven by a combination of modest gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.","Foreign currency is estimated to have about 10 basis points to 20 basis points of negative impact on operating margin in fiscal '20. We expect the magnitude of gross margin expansion to be more modest than last year due to higher input costs, pressure from transactional FX, and more normalized benefits from channel and geographic mix shifts. We expect modest SG&A leverage as we balance our productivity initiatives with investments in growth.","For the first quarter of fiscal '20, we expect revenues to be up 3% to 5% in constant currency. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by about 190 basis points to 200 basis points in the quarter. The timing of Easter shift from the fourth quarter of fiscal '19 is expected to benefit North America retail comps by about three points in the first quarter. Operating margin for the first quarter is expected to be up about 30 basis points to 50 basis points to last year in constant currency.","Foreign currency is expected to have roughly 10 basis points of negative impact on operating margin in the quarter. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $300 million in fiscal '20, focused on consumer facing initiatives that have demonstrated a proof of concept and healthy rates of return, including stores, and digital, as well as our corporate office consolidation project.","We expect our effective tax rate for fiscal '20 to be approximately 22% above our fiscal '19 adjusted rate of 21%, driven primarily by our expected mix shift of international earnings into some higher tax jurisdictions. First quarter of fiscal '20 tax rate is estimated at about 19%.","In closing, as we continue on our next great chapter journey we have a clear sense of purpose and are guided by Ralph's timeless vision. We are applying the insights we gained as we accelerate wins and navigate challenges. While we recognize the progress is not always linear, our teams are passionate, highly engaged and focused on delivering across all our strategic priorities and creating value for the long term.","With that, let's open up the call for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. You may ask your question.","Ike Boruchow","Hi, good morning, everyone, and congrats on a great year. I guess, one -- first question for Patrice. As you reflect on the first year of the next great chapter plan. I guess my question is, how are you feeling about the long-term strategy one year-end? Maybe could you go on. Let us know, little bit more about where you think you've outperformed versus maybe underperformed versus prior expectations and any need to revise any of the information you gave us at the Analyst Day and then, a quick one follow-up for Jane.","North America wholesale would love a little bit more detail on how to think about Q1 and the rest of the year, tying together the off-price pullback, spring fashion softness that you highlighted for 4Q. Just any other color on that channel would be great?","Patrice Louvet","Hey, good morning, Ike. So I guess on the first part of your question. Overall, we are actually pleased with what we delivered in year one of our next great chapter plan. While there's of course always more work to do, we believe our strategy is working and our plan is on track. So as a result, we remain very comfortable with the five-year targets we laid out last June at Investor Day.","To your point on wins and opportunities, let me just touch on a few on both sides. So in terms of the things that we -- key highlights in terms of performance, one is we returned to growth a year ahead of plan and more importantly, we actually achieved this with a continued focus on profitable, quality growth, right? And you can see that through the progress that we've made on AURs throughout the fiscal year of high-single digits and through the continued expansion in operating margins throughout the year as well.","Second thing I would highlight is the fact that we've significantly increased our brand-building investment, with a strong focus on social and digital to really elevate the brand, energize the brand, and win over a new generation for our first strategy. The third area to highlight is, I think, terrific work by Ralph, the design team and the overall organization on strengthening our core product, which has been a very important driver of the top line improvement over the past year. And then fourth and final point in terms of highlights is the digital space and the expansion space.","So we completed the digital platform upgrades for our flagships in North America and in Europe, we launched our flagship in China. Both Europe and North America businesses insected back to positive comps this year after a few challenging years. We also drove in the digital commerce space expansion on digital pure players around the world, and you've heard some examples in our prepared remarks.","And then of course we continue our international expansion, with a deliberate focus on China and we're really pleased with the acceleration we're seeing in China, delivering 30% growth in Mainland China this year. So those are key highlights. Key areas as we look at what are the learnings and what do we need to double down on moving forward, I'd call out three. One is we want to accelerate our momentum on winning over new generation. We had a strong 50th anniversary year, we gained traction with new and younger consumers I think millennials and Gen Z. We plan to continue building on this momentum into fiscal year '20 and beyond.","With increased investments, better targeting, and stronger digital amplification of our programs. Second point to highlight is we need to improve traffic at our US brick and mortar stores. I think that's a consistent challenge for the industry here. So in addition to enriching the shop -- the shopping experience and enhancing our product offering, we need to better leverage our marketing programs and our ecosystem approach, our omnichannel ecosystem approach, to drive brick and mortar traffic. And then the third point I would highlight, is we have opportunities on products. So as I mentioned, this year we've had notable successes with updates to our core products.","We also had some really nice sweet consumer reactions on our limited addition releases which we're going to continue to drive moving forward. However, we'll also have some gaps that we called on in our prepared remarks and as you heard we're full on focus on actioning those aggressively. But all in all, we're pleased with the way the first year played out and really in the right now it's about running the play as we move forward.","Jane Nielsen","Yes. Ike just on the -- on your question on North America Wholesale. You saw us come out of the year with our full price wholesale business down in the low single digits. As I think about the coming year, our focus is really to get back to stabilize that business really as Patrice called out focus on the wholesale.com business for growth. And as I think about the mix of full price and off-price to stabilize the full price, but off-price will continue to be down throughout the year on a more normalized flow basis, but you will see modest declines, modest to moderate declines, in the off-price business throughout the year, but on a more stable basis. Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. You may ask your question.","Matthew Boss","Thanks. Maybe on the margin front. Could you just help outline the gross margin puts and takes this year relative to the 30 to 50 basis points annual expansion outlined in the five-year plan? And maybe just walk through some of the drivers behind the return to SG&A leverage this year?","Jane Nielsen","As we look at the coming year in terms of gross margin, we expect about half of our operating margin leverage will come from gross profit. The drivers or our tailwinds are really pretty stable. The largest driver has been our pricing activity and our reductions in promotion. that will continue. What you'll see is a moderation of the benefit that we're seeing from channel mix, as our wholesale business will -- our focus is on stabilization and a moderation of the benefit of geographic mix, those are two will still remain tailwinds.","But because North America, our expectation is stabilization and that performance, those benefits will start to moderate versus what you saw this year. Our headwinds that we see coming forward are that we will have some transactional pressure in our gross margin this year.","Product cost that you saw as realized in the fourth quarter will continue notably into the first half. Some of those pressures and then we are taking a more cautious approach to inventory and so there will be some slight pressure from inventory actions that we're taking that will impact our overall COGS. As we look to SG&A overall, we have -- we are going to continue on our journey of cost discipline.","We've had very good results from the cost leadership committee that we've established and we're continue to go against our indirect expenses. You've seen as it takes some significant distribution actions, consolidating our footprint, working on some of our automation within our distribution sites, consolidations of inventory, those will help from an SG&A's perspective. We're also consolidating our corporate headquarters, which will be a slight pressure points this year, but will be a leverage point into the future.","And we're also leveraging more digital technology, leaning into digital design in our design teams, digital sample making. Those are the initiatives that are helping us get to SG&A leverage on top line growth of 2% to 3% in constant currency. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from of the Laurent Vasilescu with Macquarie. You may ask your question.","Laurent Vasilescu","Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Congrats Jane on your additional responsibilities.","Jane Nielsen","Thank you, Laurent.","Laurent Vasilescu","Jane, I believe you talked about 80 vendor and renegotiated contracts in the fourth quarter that drove a 14% reduction in addressable expenses. Can we parse out the dollar benefit in the fourth quarter and will these cost initiatives flow through for the balance of the quarters in FY '20?","Jane Nielsen","The part of what I just talked about in terms of the cost leadership committee, those renegotiated expenses re -- contracts resulted in a 14% decrease in those contracts. But you will see that benefit and it's part of our SG&A leverage story as we move forward.","And of course, we're not done. Those 80 contracts are just the beginning. We intend to review all of our contracts, obviously prioritizing the largest ones and the ones that are at expiry point first. But this is an ongoing effort for us.","Corinna Van der Ghinst","Next question please?","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question.","Michael Binetti","Hey guys, good morning. So thanks for taking our question, Jane let me ask you on the operating margin guidance for this year in U.S. dollars takes you pretty close to 12% next year. So very good progress obviously but if we think back to the Analyst Day when you gave us the range of mid-teens and if I just interpret that as 15% as one of those scenarios that would need about 100 basis points per year after this year to get to that range which is obviously an inflection in the margin improvement rate after this year, what you think is required in the business at this point to get to that scenario to see the operating margins accelerate in the out years?","Jane Nielsen","So several things, one is continuing our journey on gross margin expansion which you'll see us do this year and which we successfully did last year and a big part of that is continuing the AUR journey that we\u2019re on. This is an AUR led strategy and we've made good -- terrific progress on that really in FY 2019 with our AUR up 8%. So we have to continue that.","We will also see accelerated leverage notably on SG&A which we called out in Investor Day as we continue to move through to top line growth and comp growth is an important part of that story. Another part of that story is also the new doors that we\u2019re opening which have higher productivity and higher four-wall margins. So it does come online and stabilize, you'll see those be accretive overall to our operating margin expansion as well.","Corinna Van der Ghinst","Next question, please.","Michael Binetti","And if I could just\u2026","Jane Nielsen","Sure.","Patrice Louvet","Go ahead, Michael.","Michael Binetti","Sorry, so if I can ask a little bit more near-term on the gross margin outlook for how we should think about it for the first quarter given your fourth quarter, I think was a little bit below prior quarters. But obviously against a big, big comparison a year-ago and then you had some noise from I think an outsized off price pullback that I would have thought would have been a tailwind, I guess to gross margins in the fourth quarter, I\u2019m just trying to take the puts and takes we have in the fourth quarter and roll it forward to how you're thinking about first quarter?","Jane Nielsen","So as we think about first quarter, first of all we had a fantastic quarter in AUR growth this quarter. As we think about our guidance moving forward, we don't think it's prudent in this environment to guide to the kind of AUR growth of 8% roughly that we achieved this year into the future. So our AUR growth is more moderated and in line with the Investor Day guidance that we gave of low to mid single digit growth. So that's one factor. And then the other factor is in the first half, we do have more product cost pressures that you saw come into line in the fourth quarter, move into the first and second quarters in terms of gross margin expansion.","Corinna Van der Ghinst","Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Kate Fitzsimons with RBC Capital Markets. You may ask your question.","Kate Fitzsimons","Yes, hi. Good morning. I guess my question would be going back to the Investor Day, you guys spoke to $500 million in incremental digital sales seems like that business took a step back in here at the fourth quarter. But sounds like maybe that was due in part to the Easter shift. Can you just talk about some of the drivers into fiscal 2020 on digital and how we should think about the trajectory of that business going forward? Thank you.","Patrice Louvet","Sure, sure. Good morning, Kate. Listen, the general direction has not changed which is we expect low double-digit growth from our digital commerce business year-on-year to get to the target that you mentioned. And again digital commerce for us is our own site. Its wholesale.com, it\u2019s pure players and that is social commerce and we're seeing social commerce obviously accelerate. As you look at our performance this past quarter, optically, it may look like a slowdown, but actually, it is not a slowdown, this is completely consistent with our expectations.","The Easter shift in North America is really the explanation between the 6% comp we delivered and the high single digit number that we look to deliver quarter-to-quarter, we estimate again the Easter shift is worth about 300 basis points. So very consistent with what we expected, very consistent with our run rate. There are a few things that we actually drove this quarter which should help sustain this type of performance in the area of functionality for our site that may be worth calling out here, relative to search suggestions, our checkout process we're driving greater availability of personalization across a broader range of products and we're also implementing or we have implemented Apple Pay and PayPal Express payment methods to the U.S. side and we're going to continue to raise the bar on functionality, on product and on brand building.","So I think you should expect continued performance around high single digits from a North America site. And then in Europe, Europe is also in line with expectations. We're actually particularly pleased with the contributions of our Spanish sites. First time, we have a Spanish language site which launched a few months ago and so Europe is on a mid single digit trajectory. That's what we delivered in Q4, that's what we expect to deliver moving forward as well. And likewise here, we've also made a number of improvements to our site whether that's enhanced paper click, optimizing our search engine and then also localizing our sites in Italy and Greece and Netherlands and in Poland to make sure that whatever we offer really resonates with the local consumer.","Then finishing the global tour, Asia is a very small business as far as our own site is concerned. So not material here but we were pleased with the results that came through. So all in all, looking ahead we\u2019re still very much in line with what we called out for the $0.5 billion of digital commerce progress over the next few years and Q4 came in consistently with our expectations and we expect to drive this in fiscal year 2020 as well.","Jane Nielsen","And I would just add Kate for a comment that in Q4, we saw the highest AUR growth across our digital, our own digital e-commerce platforms that we saw throughout the year. So consistent with what Patrice shared on Easter but very positive in terms of AUR growth.","Corinna Van der Ghinst","Next question?","Operator","The next question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. You may ask your question.","Omar Saad","Thanks for taking my question. Nice job this quarter. I wanted to ask a little bit more about the shared inventory. Maybe give us more details on what\u2019s really coming online there, how it works, how the consumer will experience the benefits of shared inventory, what's the opportunity to the extent you have an idea and then maybe also if you could give a little bit more detail on your comments. Patrice on Lauren and Polo fashion, what needs to be done there? Thanks.","Jane Nielsen","So shared inventory, from a consumer perspective it\u2019s a benefit to the consumer because we will have less out of stocks, we'll have better management of our inventory and more fluidity to be able to service our e-commerce customers and flow to the stores from a larger stock of inventory. So that's the net benefit to the consumer, for us the benefit is also that we can prioritize inventory to the highest price selling, so we'll realize more full price selling.","We're bringing all the inventory into our one distribution center that is serviced by an automatic -- automated sorter, so we are getting some fulfillment benefits from the leverage of that automation. So that's a benefit for us. And it also reduces pick times because we have shared pick pools, we can reduce the transit time as we go into picks and that's also a labor benefit for us. So we're quite encouraged with about it. The number one advantage is for the consumer but we also think that there are both operational savings and pricing advantages from shared inventory.","We are early in our journey, we went live in Q4, we're happy with the start but we expect that to pick up steam as we move through the year.","Patrice Louvet","And then on the product points Omar, let me start with Lauren. So Lauren what we're talking about, what we talked about in the prepared remarks is really Lauren Women's business actually our Men's business is doing well and that's the combination on the women's side of sportswear, dresses and accessories. And why we're seeing good performance around the world, we are seeing softness specifically driven by our North America wholesale business.","Though as we kind of look at where the brand stands today, we actually feel good about the Lauren positioning and aesthetic, right? We believe that that can actually resonate with consumers. The key causes of the Lauren challenges that we're seeing are first on the product front, we need to focus more on the core categories that the Lauren brand is known for and that our consumers care about and expect. So that means greater focus on knits, greater focus on denim, athleisure and dresses.","There's a category choice here that that we need to pivot on. And then the second point is that we need to strike a better balance between core and fashion and our assessment is we've probably skewed too much towards fashion in recent seasons and need to rebalance that. And then on the distribution front as you know Lauren is primarily in the U.S. a department store brand. And so we're focused on improving Lauren in this channel. We want to gain share, the definition of success for us is gaining share there. And part of the work we're doing is also elevating the brand presentation, investing in our shopping shops. So that we can create a more engaging and energizing environment.","And then again getting the product balance right in those environments. So what are we doing about? First of all, we actually have a new design team in place that we put in place a few months ago and this is a team that we believe really understands the DNA of the brand well as well as target consumer that we're going after. They're really focused on rebuilding the key classifications that the consumer is looking for from Lauren Women's starting with dresses and denim, we're also looking at diversifying distribution.","So while we want win in wholesale and we want to grow share there, we also want to better balance out our distribution for Lauren as we've done in other parts of the world. So there's work going on in that area. And then finally, there's always more work to do in understanding the consumer that we target both making sure we're serving our current consumer base well and also having engaging and inspiring plans for the new consumers that we want to target.","So that's where we stand on Lauren. The plans are being activated and as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we expect to see the impact of these plans as early as Spring 20. As far as the seasonal fashion concepts are concerned, let me quickly define and to make sure we all have a common understanding of what we're talking about here. So we introduced new concepts which are a sort of theme capsule each season along with our core product and in order to inject newness and excitement to our overall presentations.","We believe this is an important part of attracting new consumers to the brand. Now with these themed concepts, there's obviously a high fashion risk component because it's about fashion, right. And sometimes you get it right and sometimes they don't necessarily work as intended. We've picked up in some of our recent seasonal fashion concepts is they've been actually resonating really well with our more trend forward consumers. But they haven't been as appealing to our broader population. And so the insight for us here is that we actually need to better balance. The focus on core which as you heard us talk about has been doing very well for us, and it\u2019s obviously the heart of this company and putting more emphasis on core and deemphasizing the focus, we've had on these seasonal fashion concepts.","We still need them, we still want them but we were going to put less emphasis on them and get the balance right between the two. So that activation is already happening and you'll start to see the impact of that in our fall 2019 products and obviously going forward.","Corinna Van der Ghinst","Last question please?","Operator","Thank you. The last question comes from Paul Lejuez with Citigroup. You may ask your question.","Paul Lejuez","Hey thanks. I just want to have a quick follow-up on your AUR comments, I'm curious if you could provide any color in terms of what you expect by region this upcoming year from an AUR perspective and then just second you mentioned, I think the decline in the tourist traffic might have had an impact on your retail business. I'm just curious if you were happy with how that business is trending with little local customers, how you feel about the outlet business just in general? Thank you.","Jane Nielsen","Sure, why don't I take those three components in order and just in terms of AUR, we don't guide necessarily by region, so we don't guide AUR by regions. But I can tell you that we saw over delivery in terms of expectation in both Asia and Europe. That was meaningfully a part of the over delivery that we had for the year in terms of AUR growth.","We expect that over the course of this year that they will be more in line with our mid single digit AUR growth guidance that we gave for the long-term and that really is one of the biggest changes we have from FY 2019 going into FY 2020. We think that's prudent. We have a lot of confidence in our ability to drive AUR. We\u2019re certainly going to lean into it but we don't think it's prudent right now given the current environment to guide to a much higher AUR growth above our long-term guidance.","On the foreign tourists side, we saw that in foreign tourism it was distinctly different. As you can imagine in North America and in Europe, in North America we saw foreign tourist traffic down 5%, last year at this time it was up 7%. It's been quite choppy through the year and it's been hovering around flat. Last quarter we saw it up 2% and ended the year about down 1%.","It really flows that we see the biggest driver is foreign currency. So with the strengthening of the dollar, if that outcome was not surprising. In Europe, we saw foreign traffic up 8%. We do believe that that benefited our outlet comp in addition to the investments that we made to get back into inventory and the breadth of supply, we're very happy with the results that we've seen there and that we put up today.","But Europe was really a sequential story in terms of foreign tourism, it was down double-digits in the first half and up mid single digits and ending up high single digits as we closed out the year but was down 6% for the year. Overall, as I look at our outlet business across North especially across North America because that's where I think you saw some pull back that was a little bit below where we expected.","Certainly the foreign tourist traffic that we just called out was a factor in that. We also called out some of the products softness that occurred in Lauren and we think we have some price balancing opportunity to make sure that we have some good opening price points and clearance balance for our more price sensitive consumer. We're on it. We\u2019re enhancing our marketing initiatives including window signage and targeted emails to make sure that we can address traffic which is the biggest metric that we're focused on as we move forward.","And of course from a product perspective, we\u2019re looking at our execution in the Lauren brand as we speak knowing that some of our pre-Spring concepts need to be addressed and we're balancing the assortment as we speak from an opening price point in clearance balance perspective for our more value sensitive consumers.","So we see it, we are happy with that business, it's a great margin business and we think we know what we need to do to make sure that we're back on track as we move forward.","Patrice Louvet","Good, well listen thank you everyone for joining our call today. As I think you've probably heard, we're encouraged by our progress on our results as we continue to elevate the iconic business Ralph and our teams have built over 50 years as we continue to strengthen our connections to consumers around the world. We've got clear strength and momentum that we want to build on. We also have opportunities that we need to go and address that we're all focused on and we look forward to sharing our first quarter fiscal 2020 results with you in late July. Thanks and have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation.

Welcome to the Ralph Lauren First Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions on how to ask a question will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn over the conference to our host, Ms. Corinna Van der Ghinst. Please go ahead.","Corinna Van der Ghinst","Good morning and thank you for joining Ralph Lauren's first quarter fiscal 2020 conference call. With me today are Patrice Louvet, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jane Nielsen, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions, which we ask that you limit to one per caller.","During today's call, we will be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws, including our financial outlook. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees, and our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Our expectations contain many risks and uncertainties. Principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from our current expectations are detailed in our SEC filings. To find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our financial results, you should refer to this morning's earnings release and to our SEC filings that can be found on our Investor Relations website.","And now, I will turn the call over to Patrice.","Patrice Louvet","Thank you Cori. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining today's call. We delivered first quarter results in line with our overall expectations including better than expected operating margin and double-digit EPS growth. Our performance this quarter was driven by strong continued momentum in our international markets both Europe and Asia and expense discipline across the organization. At the same time we continued to invest in elevating our brands and stabilize our North America business against a more volatile backdrop. ","As we indicated at the start of this fiscal year we are monitoring the global retail environment closely particularly around trade and macro conditions. Our teams remain intensely focused on managing through potential industry headwinds and executing on our strategic plan to deliver long-term sustainable growth and value creation. The three principles underlying this work include putting the consumer at the center of everything we do, elevating the brand, and balancing growth and productivity.","During the first quarter we continue to drive our performance against the five strategic priorities that we laid out as part of our five year plan. These include first, win over new generation of consumers; second, energized core products and accelerate high potential underdeveloped categories; third, drive targeted expansion in our regions and channels; four, lead with digital across all activities; and fifth, operate with discipline to fuel growth.","Starting with win over a new generation of consumers. In the first quarter we increased marketing investments by 19% to last year. We continued to shift our spend to channels that matter most to consumers today namely digital and social. Our key marketing initiatives this quarter centered around our Earth Polo launch, our new family campaign, and key sporting events that have cultural resonance and global appeal. In April we launched our Earth Polo made entirely of recycled plastic bottles and a waterless dyeing process. While the launch marked an important early step in our long-term sustainability efforts, it is only the beginning of our journey which I'll discuss in more detail momentarily. The product generated a strong consumer response and the campaign had a meaningful impact from a marketing perspective with over a 1 billion earned media impressions globally and strong social media attraction.","We also launched our Family is Who You Love global campaign in April, a positive and inspiring celebration of inclusion in modern families however you define them. This combined with our pride campaign and capsule collection in June also drove over a 1 billion media impressions globally. We kicked off our summer sports program with the golf majors including a special capsule collection with Ralph Lauren Golf Ambassador Justin Thomas. And more recently you may have seen our high impact activations around Wimbledon where we are the official outfitters. We launched an integrated global campaign in July combining Wimbledon heritage with Gen Z activations including a YouTube series, our first gaming experience, an in-store and on site events with influencers, celebrities, and top clients. We have more exciting initiatives still to come including the U.S. Open Tennis Championships next month.","We continued our partnerships with celebrities and influencers globally in the quarter. You may have seen Jennifer Lopez in the Ralph Lauren at the CFDA Awards this June as she collected the fashion icon award. Ralph Lauren earned the highest media impact value across all brands from the event according to the CFDA. We also announced JLo's fianc\u00e9 Alex Rodriguez as the new face of our Polo Blue fragrance. Other celebrity dressing this quarter included Selena Gomez at Coachella, Emma Roberts, Oprah, J.J. Lynn and K-pop band BTS. And lastly you may have seen that Ralph received honorary knighthood from Great Britain in June in recognition of his extensive philanthropic efforts, influence on global style, and longtime love of British heritage and culture. Ralph is the first American designer to receive this honor which garnered worldwide media attention. It was a very special moment for Ralph, his family, and all of us at Ralph Lauren.","Moving on to our second key initiative, energize core products and accelerate high potential under developed categories. We continue to drive our product assortment across three different areas which for clarity we are defining as core, seasonal core, and seasonal fashion. Core includes iconic Ralph Lauren styles like the classic mesh polo shirt, Chino pants, army jacket, cable knit sweater, or Oxford button down shirt. Seasonal core products are iterations of our core items that are animated with fresh seasonal color ways or finishes. And seasonal fashion consists of more fashion oriented and embellished products that center around a seasonal theme or collection. This includes our limited edition series that deliver newness and excitement. ","In Q1 our core and seasonal core styles resonated well across channels and continued to be a key driver of our top line performance. We're excited about the work Ralph and the design teams have done to reenergize the heart of the business. These styles are not only appealing to existing consumers but also to new and younger consumers. As we discussed last quarter we are working to get the mix right across these three product categories for each channel better aligning to consumer demand. In Q1 we took clear actions to focus our teams on the strategic rebalancing. ","First, we expanded the scope of our experienced international merchant team to lead a new global merchandising effort that now includes North America. This team is now leveraging their proven track record of sharply aligning buys to consumer demand and successfully targeting a new younger consumer to the North American market. Second, our design teams have increased our penetration of core and seasonal core versus seasonal fashion products to focus on our most productive and appealing styles starting with our spring 2020 collections. While our penetration of seasonal product will become more balanced we will continue to leverage these propositions along with our special projects and limited edition capsules like this quarter's Polo Sport to bring newness and excitement to the marketplace. ","Moving through our five high potential underdeveloped categories that have significant growth potential across our brands, these include denim, outerwear wear, wear to work, footwear, and accessories. We saw strong continued momentum this quarter in denim and outerwear which were the furthest developed of the five categories. Sell in and sell out trends for both categories exceeded total company performance. Based on an encouraging launch last fall we are rolling out an expanded presentation of outerwear at our own DTC and wholesale channels for Fall Winter 2019. Touching on product pricing which Jane will address in more detail in her prepared remarks, our total direct to consumer AUR was up 1% in the first quarter on top of a strong 8% increase in the first quarter of last year. While still positive this moderation primarily reflects the steps we are taking to reduce our disproportionate seasonal fashion inventory in North America. ","Moving on to our third key initiative, drive targeted expansion in our regions and channels. As we previously discussed we are building a cohesive brand elevating Ralph Lauren experience across our retail, wholesale, and digital commerce presence in key cities around the world. During the first quarter we opened 21 new stores and concessions globally and closed nine locations. This included 13 openings in Asia with seven in Greater China, our fastest growing market. Our eco system approach continued to drive strong growth in Greater China in the quarter with sales up 12% the last year in constant currency including nearly 30% growth in Mainland China driven by comp growth and new stores. In Europe we opened four owned and partnered full price stores and two factory stores. While we are making good progress we still have significant expansion opportunities with only 36 full price stores across Europe.","Moving on to our fourth key initiative lead with digital. Our global digital eco system including our directly operated sites, department store dot-com, pure players, and social commerce increased 1% in the first quarter in constant currency. Strong growth of nearly 10% in international was partly offset by mixed results in North America. Across international we continued to expand our distribution notably with digital pure players. In Asia we added two exciting new digital partners in the first quarter, ZALORA in Southeast Asia and the social commerce platform of Kakao, the largest messaging platform in Korea. ","In Europe we added six new wholesale digital partners in the quarter. These included Browns Fashion, a key specialty player that resonates with younger trend leading consumers and curated luxury retailers Fenwick both in the UK. Our directly operated digital sites in Europe also saw strong momentum delivering 22% comp growth this quarter.","Turning to North America, our overall digital eco system in this market performed below our expectations in the quarter. Very strong double-digit growth in digital pure players was more than offset by softer trends on Ralph Lauren and Wholesale Dot Com. First starting with digital pure players, we continued to see strong momentum with partners who are extending our reach to new and younger consumers. In the first quarter we launched men's polo on PacSun.com and men's and women's polo on ASOS. We also added distribution of women's polo to Rent the Runway joining Lauren and Club Monaco on that platform which resonates with our target next generation consumer. ","Second, comps in our own North America digital site were flat. Softness was primarily driven by a decline in sales to international consumers on our U.S. site due to FX headwinds and increased import regulations in key Asian markets and select underperforming products within Lauren in men's polo seasonal fashion styles. And lastly North America Wholesale.com was also weaker than expected driven primarily by the product issues we discussed on Lauren similar to Q4 trends. North America digital commerce is clearly an area of intense focus for us as we work toward consistently delivering our long-term target of low double-digit digital growth globally. Under our new global merchandising effort we've taken decisive action to rebalance our assortments and expect these changes to start flowing through in the back half of fiscal 2020. ","Let me touch on our fifth key initiative, operate with discipline to fuel growth. We continued to challenge every cost and improve our efficiencies in the first quarter. Adjusted operating margin expansion of a 110 basis points exceeded our expectations driven by disciplined expense management and SG&A leverage. This cost discipline enabled us to continue expanding our marketing investment and global retail presence while increasing operating profit and operating margin. ","And lastly I'd like to touch on the citizenship and sustainability strategy we launched in June which we call Design the Change. Our strategy and accompanying report represent our commitment to create more sustainable products, reduce our overall environmental footprint across our operations, and support and empower our teams and partners around the world. We introduce 16 key citizenship and sustainability goals that touch every area of our business and drive accountability across our organization. Key targets we expect to reach by 2025 range from reducing water usage by 25% across our operations and value chain to achieving gender parity within our leadership at Ralph Lauren. As we continue to cultivate the best talent to deliver on our strategy, we are proud that Ralph Lauren achieved certified status as a great place to work in the U.S. for the second year in a row. We were also recognized in the Top 50 on Forbes annual list of America's best employers for women. ","In closing we are focused on executing our strategic plan to deliver long-term sustainable growth and value creation. Each member of our engaged and motivated global team is contributing to deliver on our plan and I know I speak for Ralph and the entire leadership team when I say that we are inspired and energized by their dedication and excellent execution every day. With that I'll turn it over to Jane and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions.","Jane Nielsen","Thank you Patrice and good morning everyone. Our first quarter financial results were in line with our expectations led by ongoing strength in Europe and Asia and growth in North America despite a more volatile retail backdrop. Globally our teams delivered solid top and bottom line results including operating margin expansion and double-digit EPS growth and we made progress against several of our key strategic initiatives globally. First quarter revenues increased 5% in constant currency and 3% on a reported basis. Our international business which represents about 45% of our sales delivered 7% top line growth in constant currency while North America delivered growth of 3%. ","Adjusted gross margin was up 10 basis points in the first quarter on a reported basis and flat in constant currency slightly better than our expectation of flat to down in the first half. Gross margins benefited from favorable product, geographic and channel mix largely offset by increased promotional activity in North America. Total company retail comps grew 2% in the quarter, AURs were up 1% with low single-digit growth in international. This was partially offset by a 1% decline in North America AUR due to increased promotional activity in our bricks and mortar channels to move through excess seasonal fashion inventory from spring. Looking ahead we still expect to drive AUR over the next three quarters consistent with our guidance of low to mid single-digit growth for fiscal 2020 and longer-term. ","AUR growth this year will be driven primarily in Europe and Asia by our ongoing strategy to elevate the brand, improve pricing and promotions, and accelerate product mix shifts such as an increased penetration of fleece and outerwear. We also expect positive albeit more moderate levels of AUR growth in North America as we one, rebalance assortments across core, seasonal core, and seasonal fashion products; two, mix into higher priced product categories; and three, take targeted price increases in select categories based on competitive benchmarking and where we have a proven opportunity to play. Our guidance assumes that these North America AUR drivers will be partly tempered by a continuation of increased liquidation pressure in the near-term to clear seasonal fashion product for Lauren and select men's polo fashion. ","We will continue to balance an appropriate level of promotional activity with our long-term strategy of improving quality of sales and elevating the brand. Adjusted operating margin in the first quarter was 12.2% up 110 basis points as our teams drove SG&A leverage on top line growth. Adjusted operating profit dollars grew 14% to last year. SG&A expense declined to 52.3% of sales down 100 basis points to last year driven by top line leverage and cost reduction initiatives. Marketing spend increased 19% in the first quarter. We continue to make progress towards our long-term objective of increasing marketing to about 5% of sales while also focusing on productivity to achieve our operating margin expansion goal. ","Our teams remain focused on driving operating efficiencies across our business. Some key areas of savings to highlight in the first quarter are first, our supply chain end to end remains an important opportunity for productivity. We reduced our Q1 air freight expense by 50% to last year as we optimized our ocean freight programs. We also realized opportunities on the products side. We reengineered our outerwear to use innovative, recycled materials in our jackets. This enabled us to upgrade an existing product to a more premium and sustainable version for the consumer while driving savings on raw material costs. ","Our work on corporate expenses also continued. Our focus on reviewing and putting nearly all our vendor contracts out to bid is generating savings without compromising quality. We continue to see a double-digit reduction in associated expenses through our renegotiated contracts. In Q1 we reduced our media partners around the world from 12 agencies to 4 and consolidated our media buys under one global lead partner to drive scale and efficiency. We also completed the sale of our corporate jet in the first quarter and donated the entirety of the proceeds to the Polo Ralph Lauren Foundation as we work to drive meaningful cultural shift in our organizations cost and corporate responsibility mindset. And we will continue to simplify our organization to improve agility and empower our leaders as illustrated by some of our recent changes.","Moving on to our segment performance starting with North America, revenue increased 3% in the first quarter with growth from wholesale and newly renovated stores partly offset by weaker than expected retail comps. Adjusted operating margin was 21.9%, a 100 basis point decrease to last year largely due to gross margin contraction on higher promotional activity across channels. In the retail channel in North America comps were up 1% including about a 300 basis points of benefit from the Easter shift into the first quarter. Brick and mortar comps increased 1%, softness was driven by continued traffic, challenges and a modest decline in AUR due to increased promotions this spring to clear select seasonal fashion product and keep inventories healthy. In the first quarter foreign tourist traffic was down 3%.","While traffic trends were disappointing in the quarter notably in May we were encouraged by improvements we implemented towards the end of the period including an outlet. Moving forward we will continue to test and implement additional measures to mitigate traffic challenges such as improved search optimization, marketing partnerships with our mall center operators, and more targeted signage. Comps in our North America directly operated digital commerce business were flat below our expectations. We believe this was due to a combination of two factors; first, we saw diverging trends between sales to domestic versus international shoppers in the quarter. Domestic sales which comprised the majority of our digital business were up in the quarter while foreign sales were down double-digits.","Similar to foreign tourists declines at our U.S. brick and mortar stores, we attribute this decline to increased headwinds from FX along with more punitive import restrictions in key Asian markets. Second, last quarter we called out a few areas where we were over assorted including select Lauren and men's polo seasonal fashion styles. We're actively addressing these issues by rebalancing our product offering as Patrice discussed. We expect declines in international shoppers to continue pressuring our North America digital comps through the rest of fiscal 2020 based on FX and tighter import restrictions with the biggest decline in Q2. However, we expect improved trends from our domestic online shoppers starting in the back half of the year. Our teams are focused on driving higher conversion among domestic consumers through one, favorable product mix towards categories like outerwear and two, investing in improved mobile functionality and personalization to drive more relevant content. ","Moving on to North America wholesale, first quarter revenue was up 2%. Excluding off-price our underlying North America wholesale business was also up slightly in the first quarter. We still expect Q1 will be the strongest quarter of the year as the North America retail environment has become somewhat more volatile in recent months. Moving on to Europe, first quarter revenue was up 2% on a reported basis and 7% in constant currency. Adjusted operating margins expanded 100 basis points on a reported basis and 10 basis points in constant currency. Operating margin expansion was driven by strong gross margins. ","In the retail channel in Europe comps were up 4% driven by a 22% increase in our own digital commerce sites and a 2% increase in our brick and mortar stores. Our increase in directly operating European digital commerce business was above our expectations driven by solid merchandising execution and a strong double-digit traffic increase. Our sites benefited from platform enhancements and more targeted performance marketing and further localization of our Spanish and Italian sites in the quarter. ","Across our Europe direct to consumer channels our ongoing effort to elevate the brand and improve product mix continued in the first quarter with AUR of 2% on top of a strong 9% increase last year. Wholesale revenue in Europe was up 5% in constant currency in the first quarter and ahead of our expectations reflecting solid sell in trends and modest distribution growth with both digital and wholesale partners similar to the last few quarters.","Turning to Asia, revenue was up 4% on a reported basis and 8% in constant currency in the first quarter. We saw solid performance across nearly every market in Asia led by Mainland China sales growth of nearly 30% in constant currency. Our product and marketing initiatives are resonating well in this region and we continue to increase our digital efforts, expand and elevate our store fleet, and engage with local influencers and celebrities. Comps in Asia increased 5% driven by 3% AUR growth and a strong contribution from our newer doors. We expect continued comp growth in Asia as we invest in our distribution network and increased our marketing initiatives to amplify and elevate the brand. Adjusted operating margin was up 150 basis points to last year driven by strong gross margin expansion. ","Moving on to the balance sheet, our balance sheet remains strong and we continue to return capital to shareholders. We ended the year with about 2 billion in cash and investments and 692 million in total debt which compares to 2.1 billion in cash and investments and 587 million in debt at the end of last year's first quarter. We repurchased a $150 million in shares in the first quarter, we will continue to opportunistically buy back stock with about 600 million in repurchase plan for full fiscal 2020. ","Moving on to inventory, at the end of the first quarter inventory was up 11% to last year. The highest growth rate was in Asia to support our strategic expansion of retail distribution in that market. This was followed by Europe where we started making investments to get back into normalized inventories in our Europe factory stores during the second quarter of fiscal 2019. We still expect to anniversary these increases as we move into the second half of this fiscal year. ","And lastly inventory growth in North America modestly outpaced top line growth in the first quarter which was partially driven by our decision to accelerate select portions in inventory to get ahead of potential China tariffs. We continue to expect inventories in the second half to be more closely aligned to our sales outlook. In light of the dynamic trade environment particularly China and BREXIT we will continue to opportunistically evaluate our inventory shipments to North America and the UK and diversify our global supply chain. ","Now I'd like to turn to guidance for the full year and second quarter of fiscal 2020. As a reminder this guidance excludes restructuring and related charges and reflects our best assessment of the global retail landscape in the context of increased volatility for macroeconomic and geopolitical events. For the full year fiscal 2020 we continue to expect revenues to be up 2% to 3% in constant currency. Foreign currency is expected to have about a 90 to 100 basis point negative impact on revenue growth in fiscal 2020. We expect continued strength in our international businesses and a more challenging outlook for North America. ","We continue to expect operating margin for fiscal 2020 to be up 40 to 60 basis points in constant currency driven by a combination of modest gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage. Foreign currency is estimated to have about a 10 to 20 basis points of negative impact on operating margin in fiscal 2020. For the second quarter of fiscal 2020 we expect revenues to be up about 1% in constant currency. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by about 90 to 100 basis points in the quarter. ","Operating margin for the second quarter is expected to be up 40 to 60 basis points in constant currency. Margin expansion is more weighted towards the first half of the year based on the timing of our marketing and new store investments. Foreign currency is expected to be about a 20 basis point headwind in the second quarter. We continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately 300 million in fiscal 2020 focused on consumer facing initiatives that have demonstrated a proof of concept and healthy rates of return including stores and digital as well as our corporate office consolidation project. We continue to expect our effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 to be approximately 22%. Second quarter tax rate is estimated at 23%. ","In closing we are committed to delivering on our next great chapter plan while navigating a more volatile global retail backdrop. We believe we have the key elements to achieve our long-term strategic targets, a strong balance sheet, a clear strategic roadmap, Ralph's enduring creative vision, and the passion and commitment of our 24,000 team members around the world. With that let's open up the call to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. ","Michael Binetti","Hey guys, good morning Jane and Patrice, thanks for all the -- a lot of detail there. ","Jane Nielsen","Good morning Michael.","Michael Binetti","Hey guys, so if I tried some of the quarter looks like North America is still a little sluggish but your international business is very, very strong. Your reiterated guidance I would like to assume has taken into account better international trends. What gives you confidence your international regions will be able to carry the top line especially if North America backdrop remains sluggish like you said and then I had a quick follow-up if I could?","Patrice Louvet","Good, let me answer that one first and we will do your follow up later. ","Michael Binetti","Sure.","Patrice Louvet","Okay, well listen good morning. We are indeed pleased with our continued momentum both in Europe and Asia. If you kind of step back and look what the key drivers were for the performance there, they really center around the work our teams have done on brand, product, and distribution, alright. So let's actually start with product. Our product is actually resonating well with the Asian and European consumers and our team has done a very good job balancing our offering between core, seasonal core, and seasonal fashion across all the channels as well as and this is important as we think through AUR plans as well as mixing into higher AUR categories like outerwear or fleece. ","On the brand front it is actually I find really inspiring to see the work that our teams are doing to elevate the brand and connect with our target consumers whether that's an existing consumer group or the new generation that we want to bring into the family. That's probably most visible in the recent highly impactful activation that the teams have done around Wimbledon in Europe and actually in parts of Asia as well and the unique connections that we've built with the key celebrities and influencers in China for example. ","And then on the distribution front our teams are elevating our presence in existing quality distribution points while expanding both online and you heard a few examples through our prepared remarks and in full price stores leveraging our new Polo boutique formats both in Europe and in Asia. And all of that is translating into what we are working to build in key cities which is this consumer centric eco system which means the consumer wherever he or she wants to shop. So those are I would say three key drivers that have supported the Asian and European performance. ","As we look ahead we're actually really energized by the growth opportunities for the many years to come. If you just think about two simple data points right across Europe and Asia, first is we only have 36 full price stores across all of Europe. Once you benchmark that versus where the consumer opportunity is versus where the competitive set is significant growth opportunities. Second is China only represents today despite a good progress that the group has made there over the past few months, only represents 3.5% of our total global business. Again when you benchmark that with a number of our peers you get a good indication of the upside opportunities there. So were encouraged and excited about what's ahead in both Europe and Asia. ","What's also really important is many of the success drivers that we're seeing in Europe and Asia actually were very relevant for us in the U.S. as we continue to work on stabilizing and pivoting this important market back to growth. And I think you've seen that we've made a number of organizational changes over the past few months that will enable us to rapidly leverage these learnings in North America.","Michael Binetti","Sure, thanks for the detail. If I could just ask Jane back to your comments on AUR details that you gave, still positive globally but negative one in North America. You said you cleared some product, can you talk about the guidance, you signaled slight -- it seems like you're signaling a slight reacceleration of low to mid single-digits for the remainder of the year. In particular you mentioned some targeted price increases in North America. We haven't heard that from you in a while. Can you talk about where you see opportunity and maybe help us reconcile that with some of the ongoing expectations to stay competitive on the promotional backdrop in the North America industry?","Jane Nielsen","Sure, well as we look at pricing Michael we really see opportunities that we've called out in the past. So we continue to work on sharper promotion, we are continuing to move into better product and category mix, and a better balance of our merchandising assortment which is going to be favorable to pricing as we move forward. And then as you noted we called out that we have done competitive benchmarking and looked at select opportunities to take to get pricing in targeted and select areas. It is a part of our overall pricing approach and will really start to play out for us in the second half. But we've incorporated that into our guidance, we expect that our AUR journey will improve as we move into the second half while being cognizant that in North America with our efforts especially in the second quarter to move through some of our spring products, there will be a little more pressure on that AUR growth although we do expect overall AUR growth to improve more moderately in North America. ","Michael Binetti","Okay, very, very helpful. Thanks again for all the details.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Boss with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. ","Matthew Boss","Thanks, a nice quarter in a tough backdrop. ","Jane Nielsen","Thanks Matt.","Matthew Boss","Maybe Patrice on the North American Apparel landscape both at wholesale and your own retail, I guess what exactly have you seen change versus maybe three or six months ago and I guess in light of that any changes specifically in your strategy necessarily to navigate the underlying reaching at cross currents [ph]?.","Patrice Louvet","Sure, so listen as we look at the overall picture actually the U.S. consumer remains relatively healthy, right, in our space. But we have taken a slightly more cautious view of the retail environment for the year ahead. We continue to clearly see challenges with brick and mortar traffic like both full price and outlets including foreign tourist volatility. And our focus now is really to make sure we offset this through higher conversion and accelerated efforts in marketing across channels in North America. Probably three things I would call out here, the first one is taking steps to mitigate the brick and mortar traffic and the promotional headwinds, right. ","So if you look at the factory channel in particular we have a number of interventions underway. One is making sure we've got the right product mix and improving our offering across all the price points including elevated products as well as having the right entry price points. Two is working on our store marketing and particularly the window signage which is very important for this business. And then also working on marketing outside of the center to bring people into the center. So we're partnering with the landlords and leveraging all their platform probably more than we've ever done to really activate traffic and bring traffic into the center. ","And then we were also raising the bar in terms of quality and targeting of our e-mail marketing. We have a very strong database that we can leverage and we're getting a lot more precise in terms of the messaging for the specific target group. So the combination of those factors we believe will lead to an improvement. And then you heard Jane talk about targeted price increases as well, right, where we believe we have largely driven by what we think the consumer reaction will be but where we believe we have pricing opportunities versus competition driven by I think the brand elevation work that we've done over the past few years. And the resulting increased value to the consumer. So let's say that's first intervention. ","Second intervention as we look to really control our destiny with DTC it is actually focusing on digital improvement. We were really pleased with the traffic performance in North America RalphLauren.com this quarter up a very healthy 20%. Alright, so we want to fuel that but we also want make sure we're also translating that into strong conversion. So a number of interventions underway here, investments in mobile, about two thirds of all of our transactions are in mobile so it's very clear that that's how the consumer wants to interact and we're investing in strengthening our mobile capabilities whether that's how the visuals show up, how quickly the downloads happen, and so on and so forth. But you'll see significant progress on this front. Investment and personalization which we know is highly effective and that's actually coming in on stream over the next few days and weeks.","Working on our omnichannel capabilities, we are really connecting the website to our stores so recently we just launched find in-store which allows you to identify in your local store through the website what products are available, you can book appointments on our website for your local store, and so on and so forth. And then finally realigning as we talked in our prepared remarks our buys to be better balanced across core, seasonal core, and seasonal fashion. And then the other parts of controlling our destiny with DTC is the marketing activities that you've seen us do and you'll see us continue to do and accelerate in parallel with the increased investments and that's building exciting brand experiences with events like the upcoming U.S. Open, like limited editions we just dropped Polo Sport this past quarter which did very well both in denim and the silver edition. And then continuing to strengthen our connections and our activations of influencers and celebrities. ","Then finally we are investing in kind of the store experience and also exploring new channels particularly in the digital front alright so new channels like [indiscernible] Rent the Runway we now have three of our brands on Rent the Runway; Lauren, Club Monocle, and more recently Polo Women's was launched on Rent the Runway and we're seeing very positive response, we're excited about progress we're making there. And obviously the whole social commerce platforms that are expanding across the country. ","And then finally and this is a new thought, we've talked since we started the next chapter plan is really elevating our brick and mortar experience, investing in the overall store layout, in the lighting, in the fixtures, and in the overall experience we provide consumers both in wholesale, in factory, and in our full price stores. So the combination of these factors and this slightly more volatile environments give us confidence that we can continue to make progress in North America to stabilize the business and its growth.","Matthew Boss","Great, and then maybe just a follow up Jane, help us to think about the components of the North American comp maybe between e-commerce and brick and mortar, if we were thinking about the second quarter versus the back half of the year?","Jane Nielsen","Yeah I think on North America comp I think we're seeing that there will be some pressure on the digital compass we move through the year from these international flows that we called out in this quarter. But in the second half we believe that on digital some of the investments that we're making in personalization and driving better mobile conversion will start -- you'll start to see those pay out in the back half. And then in terms of the overall bricks and mortar comp you will see some improvement as we move through the year, again part of that is AUR led and so it'll be back more weighted in the second half as we move into the layers of pricing that we talked about.","Matthew Boss","Great, best of luck. ","Jane Nielsen","And that's all Easter adjusted Matt.","Matthew Boss","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Kernan with Cowen. Your line is open.","John Kernan","Hi, good morning Patrice and James. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to go back to international, obviously a point of strength. And maybe go back to some of the targets you laid out at the Investor Day about a year ago. Can you talk about the $500 million in revenue you expect in China, it feels like there's obviously a lot of momentum there right now, maybe you can talk about both the digital and physical direct expansion that's going on there right now and then maybe have a follow up on Europe? Thank you.","Patrice Louvet","Sure, you will attack this one Jane. So yes our goal is to indeed get Greater China to $0.5 million in revenue. We're making good progress. Again this quarter Mainland China up 30%, Greater China up 12%, continuing to see a strong progress across both digital and brick and mortar. To your point on those different platforms, I mean our thinking is really six big cities [indiscernible] Shanghai, Beijing, Taipei, and Hong Kong. And we build omnichannel eco systems across all of these with both brick and mortar presence, some more iconic elevated presence, and some kind of hard working from the revenue productivity stand point with our new Polo Boutiques coupled with our work with pure players and we've got a really nice partnerships and momentum with JD, with Timor [ph] and with WeChat and then also some strong partnerships from the concession stand point. And we're continuing to drive where we are and expand. ","So we expect from a brick and mortar standpoint to open about 40 stores this fiscal year so about one a week if you remove the holidays. And on our way to achieving what we talked about last year on Investor Day which is around 150 stores across Greater China and then we continue to invest in expanding our digital presence through existing platforms and new platform and take advantage of all the key events that are happening there. So, we participated in 618 recently and actually had strong performance across the board with our various partners on that whether that was team JD or others. And we're doing specific programs with WeChat. And just so in general we feel good about where we are relative to the guide path that we had laid out for ourselves on our way to $0.5 billion and we sometimes get the question are you seeing any changes with the consumer in China right now and the answer so far is no. But the brand continues to resonate well with consumers and we're actually pleased with the mix of consumers we're getting both from a gender standpoint men and women, pretty balanced and also from an age standpoint, we're bringing in a lot of young consumers into the franchise. ","Jane Nielsen","Hey John I would just add that we were very pleased with our digital commerce this quarter in China and across Asia. It was up 26% so a real comp accelerator. We expect that dynamic to continue. We were also pleased with what we saw overall in terms of the comp acceleration that was coming from our newer Polo Boutique stores that Patrice called out notably in China which has been the focus of our new doors. So that is durable and we're encouraged by that continued momentum. ","John Kernan","Just a quick follow up on Europe, your strength there both in wholesale, retail, and within digital as well. So just wondering how we should think about Europe as your frame of guidance for the rest of the year, I know there's some moving pieces in macro environment so just how should we think about the quarterly flow of Europe as we go into the rest of the year? Thank you. ","Jane Nielsen","Yeah, John what we've seen in Europe and let me just give you the component pieces, we still see the underlying trends for your wholesale as about mid single-digit. There are obviously some shipment timing that goes on in Europe but we've been talking about that as the underlying trend and we see that as sort of the ongoing underlying trend for Europe wholesale. On the bricks and mortar side you've seen us have a pretty steady positive comp. We'd expect that to continue especially as we are overlapping the investments that we made in our factory outlet channel. That overlap will start to -- the benefit of that overlap with the investments that we made in inventory will start to tail off in the second half as we anniversary that but we're still encouraged by our bricks and mortar comp in Europe. And then as we anniversary the replatform of our digital site in Europe the first half will be stronger than the second half as we anniversaried that overlap but positive trends in Europe in e-commerce.","John Kernan","Got it, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Kate Fitzsimons with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Kate Fitzsimons","Yes, hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Jane my question is more on the cost saving efforts that you have done year-to-date. As you think about fiscal 2020 where do you see buckets of opportunities on the expense side as the year progresses, you spoke to some supply chain -- media buy here in Q1, any other movers [ph] you can share with us as the year progresses just in light of this more volatile environment that you're seeing? And then secondly, any update on the distribution center consolidation product or the headquarter relocation project, any update there would be helpful? Thank you. ","Jane Nielsen","Sure, so Kate as we look to FY20 we do expect that the DC consolidation is going to be durable throughout this year in terms of the benefit that we got from consolidating those in addition to the activities that allowed which was inventory consolidation. So that will continue and are procurement work on indirect expenses is also durable through the year. So we take on obviously the largest vendor contracts first but we are systematically moving through nearly all of our indirect vendor renegotiations and those are paced through the year as those contracts expire and are renewed. So you can expect to see that continue through the year. And supply chain efficiencies that we are working with our wholesale partners on should also be positive as we move through the years. So not only just repacking our product, using cross stock activities but also some of the work that we called out on product suppliers where we can make products more sustainable and more cost advantaged is ongoing work. ","In terms of and also just organizational agility, based on some of the work that we've called out recently that we've done to simplify our organization you'll see some of that come through the payroll benefits as we move through the year notably in divisional cost structures and headquarter cost structures. Our work in terms of our headquarter consolidation is going well. You will not see that impact come through the financials until FY21. This is the year as we move that we do have some double rent expenses but you will see that be a durable benefit as we move through and we're very pleased with the supply chain consolidation. I'd say it's right on track with our expectations.","Patrice Louvet","If I could just add, we were also reworking the different capabilities we have externally. So, indeed you have seen the work on media going from 12 agencies to 4, doing that across all social and digital as well. We are getting nothing but better and cheaper so better capabilities and lower cost.","Jane Nielsen","Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Laurent Vasilescu with Macquarie. Your line is open. ","Laurent Vasilescu","Good morning and thanks for taking my question. On the last call it was noted that half of the operating margin leverage expected for us by 2020 will come from the gross margin. Jane is that still the case and how should we think about the GM progression by quarter of the year? And then on marketing spend up 19%, how should we think about the second quarter and the full year?","Jane Nielsen","Yes, so let me take your gross margin progression. We still -- as we've maintained our guidance and we still expect about half to come from gross margin expansion for the full year and about half to come from SG&A leverage again for the full year. As we look at the second quarter Laurent I see more, about two thirds of the operating margin expansion will come from gross margin expansion and about a third from SG&A leverage. So that's how you can think about the quarter. ","In terms of marketing expenses as we move through the year we had a strong first quarter and I would expect that second quarter will be slightly less robust in terms of marketing expansion as we anniversary a lot of our 50th anniversary activities. You'll see some leverage from marketing in the second quarter but then you'll see marketing growth in the third and fourth quarter. ","Patrice Louvet","We expect marketing all to increase ahead of sales again this fiscal year as we work our way towards marketing investments representing about 5% of total revenue. ","Laurent Vasilescu","Very helpful, thank you. ","Jane Nielsen","Thank you, last question please. ","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Your line is open. ","Dana Telsey","Hi, good morning everyone. As you think about the digital business and the progress that you're making there, how do you dissect it by region and also the AUR progress on digital promotions versus full price by region? Thank you.","Jane Nielsen","So in terms of digital progress as we talked we're very pleased with what we're seeing in Asia and the benefit that we've had from our replatforming in Europe and the growth of those markets. We are investing in North America. I think Patrice call highlighted some of the pressures from international and we expect those benefits to start to play out in the second half and we're encouraged by that. In terms of our AUR are progression on digital, a) our digital AURs will really follow what we're putting in place across all of DTC and so the second half as we take some targeted pricing will be more robust than the first half. And the first half is weighted by clearing out of some of our spring product. But you'll see those promotion and list prices go into effect more in the second half.","Dana Telsey","Got it and then just lastly as you think about inventory levels, how do you see them progressing through the year, should we continue to see this rate of increase given the uncertainty with tariffs?","Jane Nielsen","Starting in the second half you will see inventory that's closer aligned with our sales. We are trying to be quite flexible Dana as we manage BREXIT implications as well as China duty implications. And so we're going to be opportunistic as we were in this quarter and we accelerated some inventory into North America. So we're going to -- we're going to remain flexible on that but I think that as we move forward you will see inventory more closely aligned to sales. ","Dana Telsey","Thank you.","Patrice Louvet","Alright, very good. Well listen, thanks to all of you for joining this morning and we look forward to our next call early November. Have a great day.

After prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions, which we ask that you limit to one per caller.","During today\u2019s call, we will be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws, including our financial outlook. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees. And our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.","Our expectations contain many risks and uncertainties. Principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from our current expectations are detailed in our SEC filings.","To find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our financial results, you should refer to this morning\u2019s earnings release and to our SEC filings that can be found on our Investor Relations website.","And now, I will turn the call over to Patrice.","Patrice Louvet","Thank you, Cory. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining today's call. We continue to make strong progress on our Next Great Chapter plan with third quarter results, ahead of our overall expectations, including better-than-expected revenues, operating margin and double-digit EPS growth.","Over the important holiday season, our teams consistently executed across each of our strategic priorities, enabling us to elevate our brand and deliver for our consumers across every touch point.","The solid foundations we've put into place to reposition and elevate our brands, helped to drive positive comp growth across all three regions, excluding the impact of Hong Kong this quarter.","We were also encouraged by AUR growth of 6% as we invest in brand elevation through our products, marketing, distribution and unique consumer experiences. At the same time, we continue to execute key initiatives to stabilize our North America business against an evolving retail landscape.","As I've shared before, the three principles underlying this work include, putting the consumer at the center of everything we do; elevating the brand across all consumer touch points and balancing growth and productivity. And we are doing all of this while managing through volatile industry dynamics, including the recent coronavirus outbreak, which we are actively monitoring.","Our top priorities are to keep our employees and consumers safe and to heed the advice of local and international health authorities. The situation is a dynamic one and we will continue to assess the implications for our business across retail, corporate and our supply base. Our thoughts are with the many impacted by this virus.","During the third quarter, we drove our performance across the five strategic priorities that we laid out as part of our five-year plan to deliver long-term, sustainable growth and value creation. These include, first, win over a new generation of consumers, second energize core products and accelerate high-potential underdeveloped categories, third, drive targeted expansion in our regions and channels; fourth, lead with digital across all activities; and fifth, operate with discipline to show growth.","Starting with win over a new generation of consumers. We're investing in media channels that matter most to consumers today, namely, digital and social and remain on track towards our long-term marketing investment target of 5% of sales.","In the third quarter, marketing increased 16% to last year as we shifted investments back into the key holiday selling period. We are encouraged by consumer engagement across generations through our campaigns and programs. Notably, our total social media followers surpassed 40 million in the third quarter, a double-digit increase to last year led by a 30% organic increase on Instagram.","Let me touch on some of the highlights from our holiday campaigns this quarter. First, we launched a fully integrated holiday campaign across social media, television, our own stores and digital sites and wholesale environments, which we called Every Moment is a Gift.","Among the exciting activations online, we drove strong engagement through our Snapchat holiday shopping filter and our first ever global digital game, The Holiday Run where our iconic Polo bear dash through the streets of New York City, Paris and Tokyo to collect festive bubbles and signature Ralph Lauren products.","We also launched a digitally-targeted campaign for our Lauren women's ready-to-wear business in North America this season, featuring supermodel and mom, Lily Aldridge along with her family. It was the first dedicated campaign for the brand in many years that had significant media support behind it. We were encouraged by the early consumer response as we work to get the Lauren women's business back on a positive trajectory.","On our North American mobile app, we drove a successful 7Days\/7Drops program, featuring limited edition releases and one-of-the-kind experiences. A highlight of the week was our 5 Horseman Rugby shirt, which sold out in just 15 minutes online.","And congratulations to Ralph Lauren Golf Ambassador Justin Thomas. He captured his 12th career win at the Century Tournament of Champions last month, wearing RLX to capture the number one spot in the FedEx Cup standings.","Moving on to our second key initiative energize core products and accelerate high-potential underdeveloped categories. In the third quarter, Ralph and our design team drove excitement in core product categories, while also expanding into our five high-potential underdeveloped categories.","While we were pleased with the overall performance of these categories, our outerwear and fleece programs were the clear standouts this holiday outperforming our total sales trends on both the sell-in and sell-out basis. Popular styles included heavyweight parkas, quilted car coats, light and midway down jackets, windbreakers and sharper styles.","Other successes this season included woven shirts, sweaters and denim. In addition to the holiday drops in our mobile app, we released our limited edition Polo sports outdoors collection in November. The products retailed on our own digital commerce sites North America app and select flagship stores around the world. We also partnered with influential specialty retailers including Bodega, Fred Segal, Essence, Browns in the U.K., and Beams in Asia.","Other exciting projects this quarter included an exclusive holiday capsule with Zalando, the Polo Sport collaboration with Musinsa, one of the largest fashion online retailers in Korea, and the Wechat mini program for Singles Day, in China.","Moving on to our third key initiative, drive targeted expansion in our regions, and channels. Our long-term expansion strategy remains focused on building a cohesive, elevated Ralph Lauren experience, across our retail, wholesale, and digital commerce presence in key cities around the world.","During the third quarter, we opened 48 new owned and operated stores and concessions globally, and close 31 locations. This included 37 openings in Asia. We also continue to invest in door refreshes across our own stores and wholesale partners in key markets, as we work to elevate our fleet across every touch point.","Our city-by-city ecosystem approach drove strong results in the quarter, with Chinese Mainland sales up more than 30% in constant currency, driven by comp growth, and new stores. Total China sales were up 6% to last year in constant currency, despite headwinds in Hong Kong, that we discussed last quarter.","In Europe, we opened six owned and partnered full-price stores, including Polo boutiques, in Covent Garden in London, Torino, Exxon Province and Lisbon. We're making good progress, but we still have significant expansion opportunities with only 46 full-price stores across Europe, with all of this complemented by our successful expansion into new specialty wholesale accounts and digital commerce growth.","Which brings me to our fourth key initiative, lead with digital. Our global digital ecosystem including our directly operated flagship sites, departmentstore.com, pure players and social commerce, increased low-double digits in the third quarter in constant currency.","The strong performance exceeded our expectations across all three regions. This was driven by double-digit growth in Europe and Asia, with North America up high-single digits, improving from flat performance in the first half.","Starting with Europe, digital sales were up high-teens in the quarter, with solid performance across both owned and wholesale digital accounts, led by digital pure-play retailers. We added six new partners, including LuisaViaRoma in Italy, SockShop in the U.K. and Brown Hamburg, in Germany.","Our directly operated digital sites in Europe also saw further momentum, delivering 15% comp growth this quarter. Highlights included the November launch of Polo mobile app in the U.K., our first app launch outside of North America, and the new digital commerce flagship for Switzerland, as we expand our localization efforts by market.","In Asia, digital ecosystem sales were also up double-digits, led by the Chinese Mainland. We launched new partnerships this quarter with, Myer in Australia, as well as Tmall's luxury selected platform in China.","Lastly, our digital growth in China accelerated on the launch of buy online, ship from store fulfillment to leverage our store inventories. These omni-channel orders contributed to roughly half, of our digital growth in the quarter.","Turning to North America, third quarter comps on ralphlauren.com were up 6%, largely in line with our expectations. We saw softness from international consumers due to FX and import restrictions in Asia, similar to the first half of the year.","However, sales to domestic shoppers grew single-digits as we started to drive improvements in mobile, tight personalization and rebalancing our buys to emphasize stronger selling core and seasonal core products.","Lastly, we continue to build partnerships with newer digital platforms in North America, which are extending our reach to new and younger consumers.","In the third quarter, we launched Women's Polo on Daily Look, the premium subscription-based personal styling service; and Men's Polo on Simmons, a specialty designer boutique online. We also added kids to Rent the Runway joining our Lauren, Women's Polo and Club Monaco brands on the platform.","Touching on our fifth key initiative, operate with discipline to show growth. In the third quarter, we focused on challenging every cost and improving our efficiencies.","Adjusted operating margin expanded 10 basis points, slightly ahead of our expectations with stronger than expected top-line growth, partly offset by the planned timing of higher investments around holiday marketing and new stores.","One important margin driver for us and a central part of our Next Great Chapter strategy is raising AUR to elevate the brand globally and create value. We're using multiple levers to realize AUR increases, including lower discounts, elevated product mix, geographic and channel shifts and strategic ticket price increases.","We began phasing in strategic ticket price increases in our North America factory outlet channel in late September, followed by our North America full price wholesale and direct-to-consumer doors in spring 2020.","Leveraging the success, we've had implementing this strategy in Asia and Europe, these ticket increases reflect our competitive benchmarking analysis and our focus on providing a superior value proposition for our consumers. We were encouraged by the impact of these initial price increases this fall.","While traffic was still a headwind for our factory business, we were able to drive positive comps in this channel through an 8% increase in AUR in the quarter. This was on top of 8% AUR growth last year and well above our expectations. Though it is still early in this journey, we are focused on elevating our brand positioning in the North American market and globally as part of our AUR-led strategy.","And finally, I want to provide an update on our journey to further integrate citizenship and sustainability into our business. More than 50 years ago, Ralph built our company based on the idea of timelessness, creating products that are meant to be worn, loved, and passed on to the next generation.","This continues to inspire everything we do as we build the business to deliver value for our shareholders and all of our stakeholders for the next 50 years. As part of this work, in December, we announced a new commitment to power all of our globally owned and operated offices, distribution centers and stores with 100% renewable electricity by 2025.","We also took the Arctic shipping pledge committing to reroute shipping to avoid the environmentally delicate Artic area. Driving diversity and inclusion across our business is another important piece of this work, and we are pleased to report that we have achieved our gender parity goal of equal representation in our leadership positions at the VP level and above more than three years ahead of our target.","In closing, Ralph and I are energized by our team's execution over the important holiday quarter and we are encouraged by the progress we are making on our Next Great Chapter plan across the business.","While we are mindful of the challenges across our markets globally, we are intensely focused on delivering on the commitments we have made across every aspect of our business as we look to drive long-term, sustainable growth and value creation for all of our stakeholders.","And before I turn it over to Jane, sadly I want to note the recent passing of our longtime board member and friend, Arnold Aronson. On behalf of Ralph and the entire organization, I want to express our deepest gratitude for his kindness, wisdom and service to our company over nearly two decades.","Now, over to Jane and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions.","Jane Nielsen","Thank you, Patrice and good morning everyone. Our third quarter results demonstrate solid execution of our strategy through this holiday season and our team's agility and navigating a dynamic global, geopolitical and retail environment. We delivered top and bottom-line growth and good progress across key metrics, including 6%, AUR growth, double digit growth in digital commerce and growth and operating margin expansion, coupled with solid inventory control.","Third quarter revenues increased 1% on a reported basis and 2% in constant currency. Every region posted positive revenue growth, driven by mid-single-digit constant currency growth in Europe and Asia despite the ongoing headwinds in Hong Kong, as well as slight growth in North America.","Excluding the impact of Hong Kong, total company topline grew 2.5% in constant currency and every region delivered positive comps as we work to elevate our brand across every consumer touch point, drive product quality, reduce promotional levels and enhance our digital presence.","Adjusted gross margin was up 60 basis points in the third quarter, both on a reported and constant currency basis. Gross margins benefited from AUR growth of 6% on better pricing, lower promotions and elevated product mix, along with favorable channel and geographic mix, these more than offset investments in product elevation and sustainability and diversification of our supply chain.","Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the early results of our fall pricing actions and expect our AUR strength to continue through the rest of the year, driving our full year expectation of low single digit AUR growth for fiscal 2020.","Our inventory positions for both our direct-to-consumer and wholesale businesses are current and well controlled coming out of this holiday season. And we remain focused on managing our inventories with discipline and leveraging our supply chain agility and responsiveness.","Adjusted operating margin in the third quarter was 14%, up 10 basis points on a reported basis and in constant currency. Adjusted operating profit dollars grew 3% to last year.","Adjusted operating expense increased to 48.2% of sales, up 50 basis points to last year was on a reported basis and in constant currency. Marketing was the key driver with spending up 16% in the quarter, as we shifted investments back into the key holiday selling period versus last year's focus on our 50th anniversary show and related events in the second quarter.","We still expect marketing spend to grow ahead of sales for the full year fiscal 2020 as we invest behind our brands with an emphasis on digital media. Excluding marketing, our adjusted operating expense leveraged 20 basis points to last year as our teams generated operating efficiencies across our business. ","Some key highlights from third quarter include: first, we continue to drive efficiencies across our end-to-end supply chain including incremental savings across facilities, labor, airfreight and consolidation of materials, all contributing to mitigate the impact of tariffs. This work is also delivering an improved experience for our consumers including faster delivery speeds on digital orders.","Over the peak holiday period for example we more than doubled our penetration of orders delivered in two days or less over the prior year. We also piloted a new fast track model in the quarter where we were able to meaningfully accelerate the development of special product concepts from design to shelf.","Leveraging our investments in digital product development, we designed, produced and delivered an exclusive fleece sweater to a key wholesale customer in just 16 days, right in time for Black Friday. While just one early example, we expect this model to be a growing part of our supply chain as we continue our progress toward our three, six, and nine-month lead-time targets.","Moving on to segment performance starting with North America. Revenue increased slightly in the third quarter as strong growth in our retail business more than offset wholesale revenue declines.","Adjusted operating margin was 22.3%, a 30 basis point decrease to last year with operating margin expansion in our retail businesses more than offset by SG&A deleverage in our wholesale business on lower sales.","In the retail channel in North America comps were up 4% and ahead of our expectations driven by 4% brick-and-mortar comps and 6% comps on our owned digital commerce site.","Brick-and-mortar comps were driven by an 8% increase in AUR on top of 7% growth last year. This strong growth reflects our targeted price increases and a reduction in promotions along with an improved product offering, new marketing activations and rebalanced assortments towards stronger selling core and underpenetrated categories.","We also made key operational improvements such as the roll-out of RFID technology across our fleet to improve out-of-stock replenishment sales. In addition, new staffing optimization tools in our stores drove productivity and improved service in peak periods.","Our factory business led our AUR increase in North America with improved conversion. While traffic continued to be a headwind in the channel, we are focused on driving better traffic trends through enhanced digital marketing and refreshed and differentiated store experiences.","Comps in our North America directly operated digital commerce business were up 6%. Our investments in mobile, personalization and site navigation drove positive growth from domestic consumers in the third quarter.","Our digital business also benefited from favorable product mix towards categories like outerwear and fleece along with a timing shift into the third quarter as we saw higher sell-through in the holiday period, versus clearance period, in Q4.","Excluding this shift, we still expect second half comps to improve incrementally compared to first half comps. Sales to international shoppers purchasing on our U.S. site and shipping to U.S. addresses remained soft, in the third quarter and should remain a headwind through the rest of fiscal 2020.","Moving on to North America wholesale, third quarter revenue declined 8%, in line with expectations. Excluding a decline in off-price sales, our underlying North America wholesale business was also down high-single digits.","However, our full price sellout improved from recent trends. In the near-term, we are focused on improving the consumer experience in the wholesale channel, through in-store refreshes, expansion into under-penetrated categories and increased marketing.","Our inventories in the wholesale channel are clean and down, on a year-over-year basis. We are driving a more favorable product mix, emphasizing core categories and testing targeted brand marketing, for Lauren Women's.","We continue to expect, it will take some time for our wholesale business to start reflecting these strategic improvements, which have shown success in our direct-to-consumer channels.","Moving on to Europe, third quarter revenue was up 3% on a reported basis and 5% in constant currency. Adjusted operating margin expanded 300 basis points both a reported and constant currency basis.","Operating margin expansion was driven by strong gross margins and SG&A leverage. In retail channels in Europe comps were up 3% driven by a 15% increase in our own digital commerce sites. And a 2% increase in our brick-and-mortar stores.","The increase in our directly operated European digital commerce business was above our expectation, driven by strong AUR growth, solid merchandising execution and traffic increases along with the shift in seasonal product sales, similar to our North America site.","Across our Europe direct-to-consumer channels, our ongoing efforts to elevate the brand and improve product mix, continued in the third quarter, with AUR up 10% on top of an 11% increase last year. This is consistent with our long-term strategy to drive higher quality of sales and price harmonization, in the marketplace.","Wholesale revenue in Europe was up 5% in constant currency and also ahead of our expectations. Similar to Q2, the strong performance reflected solid sell-out trends driving stronger reorders, particularly with our digital pure-play partners.","Turning to Asia, revenue was up 5%, on both a reported and constant currency basis in the third quarter. Excluding the impact of Hong Kong where protest-related store closures and tourism declines were an ongoing headwind, Asia revenues were up 9%.","This solid performance was driven by several markets in Asia, led by Chinese Mainland sales growth of over 30%, in constant currency. Our product and marketing initiatives are resonating well in this region. And we continue to drive our digital efforts, expand and elevate our store fleet. And engage with local influencers and celebrities. Comps in Asia decreased 1%, with slight AUR declines.","Excluding Hong Kong, Asia comps were up 2%. Store closures and traffic decline to Hong Kong remained a challenge in the third quarter, but we were able to partially mitigate some of this impact by pulling forward a friends-and-family event in our factory stores. We continue to expect Hong Kong to remain a near-term headwind, especially with the emerging impact of the coronavirus, as Patrice mentioned.","Adjusted operating margin was down 50 basis points to last year on a reported basis, and down 70 basis points in constant currency driven by SG&A deleverage in Hong Kong. Excluding Hong Kong, margins were up 130 basis points in constant currency.","Moving on to the balance sheet, our balance sheet remains strong and we continue to return capital to our shareholders. We ended the quarter with about $1.9 billion in cash and investments and $694 million in total debt, which compares to $2.1 billion in cash and investments and $687 million in debt at the end of last year's third quarter.","We repurchased $98 million in shares in the third quarter for a total of $498 million in repurchases year-to-date. We will continue to opportunistically buy back stock and remain on track to complete our target of about $600 million in repurchases for full fiscal 2020.","Moving on to inventory, at the end of the third quarter inventory was down 1% to last year and flat in constant currency. We still expect to end the year with inventories relatively aligned to our sales outlook.","Now, I'd like to turn to guidance for the full year and fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. As a reminder, this guidance excludes restructuring and related charges, and reflects our best assessment of the global retail landscape in the context of increased volatility from macroeconomic and geopolitical events. Specifically, our outlook still incorporates the impact of tariffs, Brexit and protest-related business disruption in Hong Kong.","At this early stage, our guidance does not include potential impact from the coronavirus outbreak given the dynamic nature of the situation. However, we are monitoring developments closely and will be transparent about the expected impact providing updates if needed.","For full year fiscal 2020, we still expect revenues to be in the range of 2% to 3% growth in constant currency. Based on a better than expected holiday, revenue should be slightly better than the low-end of the range we guided to last quarter.","Foreign currency is expected to have about 110 to 130 basis points of negative impact on revenue growth based on currency shifts. We now expect operating margin expansion at the high-end of our previous range of 40 to 60 basis points in constant currency, driven primarily by gross margin expansion and slight SG&A leverage. Foreign currency is estimated to have about 10 basis points of negative impact on operating margin in fiscal 2020.","Based on the timing of shipments, our guidance now assumes a little less than $10 million of negative tariff impact to our fiscal 2020 cost of goods. We expect the majority of this impact in our fourth quarter.","However, based on our supply chain diversification out of China and recent tariff reductions, we estimate tariffs will have about $12 million to $15 million of total impact in fiscal 2021. We now expect our full year tax rate to be about 20%.","For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we expect revenues to be up slightly both on a constant currency and on a reported basis. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by about 50 basis points in the quarter. We expect protest disruptions in Hong Kong to negatively impact our Asia comp by about five points in the quarter.","Operating margin for the fourth quarter is expected to be up slightly in constant currency and on a reported basis. Similar to Q3, this is primarily due to timing of SG&A investments with our highest number of new store openings weighted to the back half of the year, largely offsetting gross margin expansion in the quarter.","Fourth quarter tax rate is estimated at 26% above our full year expected rate based on our expectation of discrete onetime items. We look forward to sharing the details of our fiscal 2021 guidance when we report our fiscal year-end in May.","In closing, we are proud of the focus, agility and passion, our teams around the world demonstrated this holiday quarter. Guided by Ralph's vision, our teams elevated our brand, delivering comp AUR and profit growth, all while maintaining disciplined on inventories and costs.","While we are navigating and watching the challenges in the broader environment closely, we are first and foremost committed to the safety of our employees', partners and consumers. We believe we have the right strategy and team to deliver across our strategic priorities and create value for the long-term.","With that, let's open up the call for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","The first question comes from Adrienne Yih with Barclays Capital.","Adrienne Yih","Good morning and congratulations on continued progress in a very tough environment.","Patrice Louvet","Good morning, Adrienne. Thank you.","Adrienne Yih","Good morning. So Patrice, I wanted to -- you gave such great color on sort of the AUR and what was driving the pricing increases. It's accelerated in the back half of the year from the first half despite the tougher compares.","Obviously, you talked about where you were taking selective price increases. What have you learned about the price elasticity particularly in North America? And does this give you confidence in your ability to continue to take pricing up over the next year or so? Thank you.","Patrice Louvet","Great. Thank you for your question. Well, let me just step back a little bit to kind of give you the overall with how we're thinking about this. The first thing I would say is, brand elevation is really at the core of our strategy, right and AUR is obviously then a key component to that.","The second point on AUR is we have four drivers for AUR that we're working on. One is pulling back on promotional support. And actually in the last quarter, we reduced our promotional pressure. The second is leveraging product mix and you saw us invest in categories that had higher AUR like outerwear and fleece. The third is obviously leveraging geographic and channel mix. And then the final point is indeed targeted pricing.","Now we've actually started this journey of taking target pricing in the context of this broader AUR strategy. In international I'd say past 18, 24-months and we've been pleased with the results that we've achieved there. But it's really important to understand that it isn't just pricing in isolation. It's the result of work that we've done on elevating the brand across all the touch points. The work we've done on inventory, on product, on brand from distribution that enables that.","We are at a stage now where we think the conditions are set for us to execute that in North America. So as you mentioned we now have about a quarter under our belt in the factory outlet channel which is where we started. We're encouraged both by the way the teams have executed, they've done a terrific job, and the consumer response across the board because we saw significant AUR growth. Now AUR growth in isolation doesn't make any -- growth that needs to drive comps and we're pleased with the 4% comp growth that we achieved in North America.","In terms of then expanding this across the ecosystem for North America the plan is actually to do that now. So, literally as we speak, we are implementing pricing for the consumer on the floors both in our full-price stores that have wholesale, leveraging the learnings that we've picked up in our execution in factory outlets.","And we're at the very beginning of this journey we were quite encouraged by what we've seen so far. And to the point on your guidance long-term relative to our expectations for AUR growth, we continue to expect AUR to grow low to mid-single digits throughout the lifetime of the plan. ","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. ","Michael Binetti","Hey, guys. Let me start with congrats on a really nice quarter and what sounds like a tough holiday.","Patrice Louvet ","Hi, Michael.","Jane Nielsen","Hi, Michael. ","Michael Binetti","I want to ask you in North America wholesale down 8% -- was a bigger decline than we've seen since maybe fourth quarter last year and you were going against big off price correction in the fourth quarter last year, lapping a negative 10. I kind of -- if I add this to you know some comments you just made on now starting to raise prices in wholesale.","I am trying think how you guys think about the North America wholesale numbers going forward from here obviously the compare gets easier, you\u2019ve got some pricing but then, due you think we are a point where we can -- you can see turning a corner on North America wholesale turning positive yet at some point during the course of fiscal 2021?","And then I also want to ask you about how you're thinking through all the dynamics you just laid out about margins for next year. It sounds like you're happy with how the increased marketing is going.","Obviously, the results are there on the top-line. But I'm wondering how your thinking about gross margin as well for next year, which has been a nice contributor for several years now. I mean you did say AUR should keep moving in the right place you're happy with ticket.","So, I'm wondering if we can -- if you still think the gross margin and SG&A dynamics we've seen in the first two years the plan should be similar next year. ","Jane Nielsen","Yes, Michael, it's Jane. So, let me answer the AUR gross margin question first and then I'll go to North America wholesale. So, we're really encouraged with we saw in North America in Q3 from a gross margin standpoint, led by the AUR increases with comp growth.","Those AUR increases really reflected our ability to both continue our discount reduction journey. We are starting to see a nice contribution from product mix and the elevation of products.","Better assortments, better rebalancing in the core the things we've been talking about. So early stages, but we're starting to see that in this quarter. And then the consumer response to, the ticket increases were also very positive.","So, that's what's giving me confidence, in continued gross margin expansion. Obviously, we've guided that for Q4. But I do think that the things that we've called out as durable, reductions in promotions, targeted consumer value-oriented price increases, product mix benefits.","And then, some tailwind benefits from geographic and channel shifts, those things are durable. And we're able to manage some of the cost inflation. And tariff impact through the work -- through working those levers.","So, I continue to remain optimistic that gross margin is a driver for us today. Obviously, we have guided to for the future. But it's also durable to the plan. Now the magnitude will have -- we're pretty clear on our guidance.","But I'm encouraged and I think its strength for us. So, good progress there. Then, if I turn to your North America wholesale question, I would tell you that again off-price was down, I would say meaningfully more than our full-price business, so double-digit decline last year, double-digit decline this year.","And again, the flow of off-price is related to excess flow. Our inventory is clean. And so we're really I think looking at that channel from a strategic standpoint than where it should be which, is the good partners to us. They're an opportunistic way for us to liquidate excess. And that's what you're seeing come through.","In terms of the timing of North America wholesale covering, we know that that will take some time, right? So what is encouraging to us is that we're on the right track, strong comp growth in DTC in North America, this quarter.","The underlying trend is encouraging. Well, I still think quarter-by-quarter there will be some choppiness, the underlying trend is encouraging and we believe that we're taking the right actions wholesale, as Patrice called out in terms of rebalancing assortments, focusing on sell-out which we did see improve, this quarter.","And we're starting some targeted marketing within the channel, that's showing some very early signs of positive trends. So, we're pleased with that. And we're overall pleased with our marketing investments. And the way they're enabling our brand elevation and price increases. So, still encourages how that will flow through on OI margin.","Corinna Van der Ghinst","Next question, please.","Operator","Thank You. The next question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Matthew Boss","Great, thanks and congrats on a nice quarter.","Patrice Louvet","Thanks, Matt.","Matthew Boss","Maybe Patrice and I know this is somewhat higher level. But, as we think about differentiated versus undifferentiated retail, I guess maybe what inning overall do you see the brand today in North America?","So, maybe if you could touch on wholesale distribution, how you feel about your existing department store doors, maybe the number and the quality of the doors that you're in. I know Jane just touched on off-price.","And then at retail, where you see the opportunity from a footprint perspective in terms of what you have today and the opportunity that you have going forward?","Patrice Louvet","Jane is very happy that we're back to baseball analogies. So listen, on the differentiation front, I think we're in the very early innings in North America actually, right. So, if you'd ask me for a number, I'd probably say two out of nine. I think we see opportunities to actually in the context of the brand elevation strategy to increase our presence in higher end wholesale where we see opportunities both in North America and actually around the world.","We're also in kind of the current wholesale footprint you know we've reduced it significantly already, right. We're down 25% from where we were about three years ago to make sure that the brand shows up in the right place. We continue to assess the locations on a very regular basis working closely with our partners. So, this is also a dynamic process.","As far as DTC is concerned, we believe we have opportunities obviously to continue to fuel our dot-com operations right, which is a very important factor of the DTC part of our business. And also similar to our thinking internationally with the introduction of Polo boutiques, we believe there is an opportunity in North America to expand our DTC footprint smaller format stores. So that won't happen tomorrow morning.","But as we look at kind of the next few years and where we want to take the brand and how we want to drive interactions with consumers across the country, we do believe there are opportunities to expand the footprint so that the brand is better represented in a more dispersed way across the entire country, all guided by our brand elevation strategy, right.","That's really the filter that we use to decide where we should be and then how do we ensure the differentiation is very clear by channel for the consumer both online and brick-and-mortar, so that he or she knows exactly what to get in which location and how the brand will show up differently based on the different environments.","Corinna Van der Ghinst","Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad","Thanks. I\u2019d add my congratulations, nice quarter guys. I appreciate all the information.","Patrice Louvet","Thanks Omar.","Omar Saad","I wanted to ask a follow-up on the sales guidance. You obviously a really strong quarter your comps accelerated. You came in above your number. You kind of kept the full year guidance the same. Are there any timing issues going on? Especially with all the AUR upticks, it feels like an easier comparison in the fiscal fourth quarter. It feels like there could be some opportunity for revenue upside there. Is there something I'm missing?","And then, a follow-up on the coronavirus and maybe it's related. We're hearing stories of double-digit million population cities that are like ghost towns right now and some pretty significant comp declines. Wondering if you're seeing any meaningful impact in your business in real time? And is there anything on the supply chain side we should think about in terms of disruption there potentially? Thanks.","Jane Nielsen","All right. Why don't I unpack your question in terms of the guidance first and in terms of revenue upside? What we are seeing, and I think we called it out in the script is obviously Hong Kong will have a more meaningful impact as we head into the fourth quarter.","We've seen travel bookings deteriorate from the third to the fourth quarter and this is obviously a big quarter for Hong Kong, given that it was a Lunar New Year. And so we called out that we had about a three-point impact to Asia comp in the third quarter that leads to about a five-point impact in the fourth quarter. So, that's one factor this going into that.","And then we called out some digital commerce that we had a very big stronger-than-expected digital commerce. As we look at that and underneath the covers of that in both Europe and in North America, what we saw is that we sold out stronger at full price. We had less inventory seeding clearance in the fourth quarter. That's a good quality of sales move and we're pleased with this.","And so, you'll see some of that sitting on our digital comps in the fourth quarter as we move forward. We also have some -- given the shorter holiday season. We move to fulfill demand to make sure consumers had a good service experience. And we'll have slight -- we'll have some more process returns in the fourth quarter and we were less promotional at the end of the third quarter. So, those are some things that are sitting in digital. So those two things are the biggest things that are guiding our fourth quarter revenue call.","Patrice Louvet","And then on the coronavirus and obviously, it's a highly dynamic situation, right? But if we take a snapshot, today for us in China, we have about half of our fleets closed. So about -- we are about 110 stores, so roughly half of that is closed as we speak today.","Obviously, we monitor that very closely. As far as supply chain is concerned, well first the other thing I would say relative to our business penetration in China just for the benefit of the whole group is, while the China opportunity is a massive growth opportunity for us to some extent, it's a blessing to be underpenetrated today because our business today China represents less than 4% of the total company business. Now, we still are very bullish about our ability to win long-term in that region and very excited about what we can do there.","On the supply chain front, I'd say same thing on a very dynamic situation. We have been working as you know over the past year, two years to diversify our supply chain, so that we're less dependent on one market, less dependent on China. So we have a greater ability to leverage a footprint that's much broader and much more flexible.","We're in the middle of the Lunar New Year vacation. We'll need to see and which has been extended by week. We'll need to see how employees return to the various factories post the vacation. So we're watching it. We are working on being as agile as possible and we'll make sure we make the best of the situation that we're dealing with.","The priority in all of this right because this is a human -- we can't lose sight of the human dimension of all. This obviously is to make sure that our employees are safe, our consumers are safe and that we follow very closely the guidance both from the local and the global authorities on this health crisis.","Corinna Van der Ghinst","Next question?","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Erinn Murphy with Piper Sandler.","Erinn Murphy","Great, thanks, good morning. Just a couple of questions for me. I guess Patrice, just on the speed to market opportunities you gave that 16-day example. Could you just talk a little bit more about where that product was produced? And as you assess the opportunity, how repeatable is this process?","And then, just a follow-up for Jane on the North American wholesale, can you talk a little bit more during the quarter of what did you see with Men's Polo versus Lauren within the full price business? Thank you. ","Patrice Louvet","So Erinn, I just took note of that example. That's actually really good. You know -- it was a pilot exercise for us. It was a sweat shirt that we developed with one of our wholesale partners. And we did execute it from ideas to delivery to the partner in 16 days.","We're not going to move our entire supply chain to 16 days. What's key our lens is to understand what is the timing required to be well-positioned to win a specific category, in a specific geography, in a specific channel? So we still have kind of our nine, six, three-month lead-times.","And then there are some projects where we want to have this ability to react in the span of days. The specific project Erinn so sweatshirt I believe manufactured in Mainland China. And something that's replicable which is why we shared it as an example. It's a pilot, but I think it's an indication also that our organization is becoming more agile, more aggressive in terms of how we manage time lines and also more creative.","So, I think you're going to continue to see from us faster lead-times not just for the sake of lead-times also just to understand what's required to win in the marketplace.","Jane Nielsen","And Erinn, I would just add that we remain confident in the -- in achieving the goal that we laid out at Investor Day that we will get to more than 50% of our product on a six-month or less lead-time and we're making great progress on some of our key categories in moving almost 80% of our quarter on to six months or less and even working on faster track. So great progress by our supply chain in that area.","And then to the second part of your question, regarding what we're seeing -- what we saw on Polo and the Lauren brands. We did see across the company that the Polo brand really drove our -- and we saw -- and it's specifically in North America wholesale we saw the Polo brand be stable and a driver for us.","The Lauren brand -- we're seeing some positive times, but they're very early based on the marketing that Patrice called out and some targeted work that we're doing with our wholesale partners that one makes us believe that the Lauren opportunity is an opportunity in North America wholesale that our consumer is still there, and that when we assort into the right categories with the right product quality and right consumer value that the consumer will respond. And so we saw some encouraging trends there. I'd say too early to call the turnaround. It will take some time but it's an encouraging sign. ","Corinna Van der Ghinst","Okay. Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Alex Walvis with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Walvis","Good morning. Thanks so much for taking the question. ","Patrice Louvet","Good morning, Alex. ","Alex Walvis","You commented on some pretty strong performance in the outerwear segment through the quarter which was a tough category for some others. So some good progress there. I wonder if you could share some comments on the other underdeveloped categories. And you mentioned denim was strong. Any comment on where we are in the progression for accessories, but where -- wear to work and so forth?","Patrice Louvet","Sure. Yes, we were actually really encouraged by the growth on outerwear. And frankly, I'm becoming even more bullish on the size of price on that part of the business as we build capabilities in-house. So, good momentum on outerwear.","Denim also performed well for us. And that actually contributed to the solid trends, on our men's business. I think the team is doing a very good job, in terms of understanding the customer we want to serve, developing product that resonates, and then finding a way to communicate and execute it in-store, in a way that really connects with the consumer.","We're making good progress on wear-to-work. Probably the key thing to highlight here is the way we are complementing our line on -- particularly on Polo Women's. And some of the work that's also underway on Lauren, to really make sure that we have the right offering, to meet that kind of wear-to-work consumer need, so good progress there.","And if you remember, this is an oversimplified. But we really want to shift to being a kind of seven day brand solution as opposed to maybe two or three days, a week, both for men and women. So I'm encouraged by the progress we're making there.","As far as footwear and accessories, so we had talked about the fact that Investor Day that footwear and accessories progress and impact would be more back loaded in the five-year program, which is why you're seeing further acceleration on outerwear and denim first. But we are making good progress on footwear and accessories.","Job one, first is really building capability right, working with Ralph, and having the right design talent both on bags and on shoes. We brought some extraordinary talent from key players in this space that have joined us over the past year, year and a half. So, that we make sure we've got people that really understand fundamentally, how these categories work.","And then, now working on bringing these products to life, in the market, these things take a bit of time. So, I expect the impact to be most visible in the outer years of the plan. But we're starting to see some encouraging signs on different parts of the portfolio, that give us confidence that we're making, the right progress and that we will see the benefits that we expect from those two categories, as well.","Corinna Van der Ghinst ","Last question please, Angela.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Rick Patel with Needham & Co.","Rick Patel","Good morning guys. Thanks for squeezing me, and I'll add my congrats as well. I was hoping you could provide some more color on Europe wholesale. You reported some nice growth there despite the negative impact of some timing shifts.","Is there anything to call out aside from digital wholesale accounts? And how sustainable is this growth as we think about the run rate for this segment?","Jane Nielsen","I think we're encouraged. We've been consistently calling out our Europe wholesale underlying trend is being in the range of what we called out for the long-term sort of in that low to mid-single-digit growth.","Obviously, our pure-play partners are leading that growth. But we're also encouraged with what we're seeing in our core bricks -- more traditional bricks-and-mortar partners in terms of their trajectory both on a comp basis.","So store -- same-store sales growth within those areas and some distribution expansion that we're seeing on a more regional basis with partners that we've had for from a number of years, so that's very encouraging to us.","I think we see this as durable growth. And we're encouraged by the progress that we're making, and where the brand sits within the wholesale European ecosystem. I think it's elevated. The pricing is accretive to our overall portfolio. And our inventories are in good shape there. So, we're very pleased with the progress in that business.","Patrice Louvet","Good. So thank you everyone for joining us today. We look forward to sharing our fiscal year end results and fiscal year 2021 guidance with you on our next call in early May. Between now and then, have a great time. Thank you. Bye.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"17613":["Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE:RL) Q2 2020 Results Earnings Conference Call November  7, 2019  9:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Corinna Van der Ghinst - Vice President of Investor Relations","Patrice Louvet - President, Chief Executive Officer","Jane Nielsen - Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer","Conference Call Participants","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank","Michael Binetti - Credit Suisse","Matthew Boss - JPMorgan","Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo","Kate Fitzsimons - RBC Capital Markets","Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group","Rick Patel - Needham & Co.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Ralph Lauren second quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions on how to ask a question will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn over the conference to our host, Ms. Corinna Van der Ghinst. Please go ahead.","Corinna Van der Ghinst","Good morning and thank you for joining Ralph Lauren's second quarter fiscal 2020 conference call. With me today are Patrice Louvet, the company's President and Chief Executive Officer and Jane Nielsen, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions, which we ask that you limit to one per caller.","During today's call, we will be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including our financial outlook. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees and our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Our expectations contain many risks and uncertainties. Principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from our current expectations are detailed in our SEC filings.","To find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our financial results, you should refer to this morning's earnings release and to our SEC filings that can be found on our Investor Relations website.","And now, I will turn the call over to Patrice.","Patrice Louvet","Thank you Corey. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining today's call. We delivered second quarter results slightly ahead of our overall expectations including better than expected revenue, expanded operating margin and double-digit EPS growth. Our performance this quarter was driven by ongoing momentum in our international markets both Europe and Asia and balanced gross margin expansion and expense management. Meanwhile, we continue to invest in brand elevation and execute key initiatives to stabilize our North America business against a more volatile backdrop.","As we indicated at the start of this fiscal year, we are monitoring the global retail environment closely, particularly around trade and macro conditions. Our teams remain intensely focused on managing through volatile industry dynamics and executing on our strategic plan to deliver long term sustainable growth and value creation. As I have shared before, the three principles underlying this work include putting the consumer at the center of everything we do, elevating the brand and balancing growth and productivity.","During the second quarter, we continued to drive our performance across the five strategic priorities that we laid out as part of our five-year plan. These include first, win over new generation of consumers, second, energize core products and accelerate high potential underdeveloped categories, third, drive targeted expansion in our regions and channels, fourth, lead with digital across all activities and fifth, operate with discipline to fuel growth.","Starting with win over a new generation of consumers. We continue to invest in media channels that matter most to consumers today, namely digital and social and are on track toward our long term marketing investment target of 5% of sales. In the second quarter, marketing declined 10% to last year due to timing of investments as we anniversaried our landmark 50th anniversary celebrations last fall. Our key marketing initiatives this quarter centered around our September fashion show experience, Wimbledon and U.S. Open Tennis partnerships as well as the Ralph Lauren and Friends collaboration.","This September, we presented an exciting Fall 2019 collection through a one-of-a-kind immersive experience of fashion, hospitality and live entertainment we called Ralph's Club. Our jazz age inspired nightclub seamlessly integrated guests into the show itself as the multitalented Janelle Monae inspired us with a performance for the ages. Influencers and celebrities from around the world from Taylor Hill to Cate Blanchett, Mandy Moore to A$AP Ferg, Henry Golding, JJ Lin and Luodan Wang joined in the evening. It was our most viewed live stream to-date. As we continue to leverage our global digital reach, we have more than 10 billion total media impressions around the event. In Asia alone, we generated over 32 million live and video views of the show.","Moving on to our sports engagements. We closed out our summer sports program with our official sponsorship of the U.S. Open Tennis Championships here in New York. The U.S. Open, combined with our high visibility Wimbledon partnership earlier in the summer, drove over 17 billion media impressions globally. Building on the April release of our Earth Polo shirt made entirely from recycled plastic bottles, the official ballpeople were outfitted in uniforms using the same innovation. The tennis ball cans collected from the tournament this year will be used to produce mix-use uniforms. This is a great example of our Design the Change sustainability strategy coming to life across our products.","To further amplify our sponsorship, we partnered with TikTok, the social media platform beloved by GenZ becoming the first luxury brand to drive a digital commerce campaign on the platform. Our campaign leveraged influencers and custom content to drive more than 0.5 million views and significant click-through to ralphlauren.com.","And lastly, we finished up quarter with our Ralph Lauren and Friends 25th Anniversary capsule collection in September, a playful ode to lead character Jennifer Aniston's fictional work experience at Ralph Lauren. Featured exclusively at Bloomingdale's and on ralphlauren.com, the campaign generated over one billion media impressions alone.","Finally, as you may have seen, we recently celebrated the upcoming HBO release of Very Ralph directed by the award-winning Susan Lacy. The documentary follows Ralph's journey from his childhood in the Bronx to building an iconic lifestyle business and becoming an emblem of American style around the world. I hope you will all watch it live on HBO on November 12.","Moving on to our second key initiative, energize core products and accelerate high potential underdeveloped categories. In the second quarter, Ralph and our design team continued to drive excitement in core product categories while also leveraging the halo of limited edition releases and expanding into high potential underdeveloped categories. Top-selling categories for Fall 2019 to-date have included lightweight down jackets, windbreakers, fleece and casual woven shirts, including Oxford shirts.","We continue to work to consistently get the balance of core, seasonal core and fashion right across each brand and distinct channels. This quarter, we released a limited-edition draw, Indigo Stadium, in September inspired by our original 1992 Polo Stadium collection. Pieces included signature silhouettes such as our popover jacket, windbreaker, tearaway track pants and fleece updated with indigo dye treatments. The release was available exclusively on our Polo app, influential specialty accounts like Opening Ceremony, Fred Segal, HBX and Bodega as well as select Ralph Lauren stores and retailers internationally.","Other exciting projects this quarter included an exclusive youth oriented capsule collaboration with ASOS available globally online and the special collections celebrating our 35th Anniversary of Polo Ralph Lauren in Korea. We continued to make solid progress this quarter on our five underdeveloped categories as well. These include denim, outerwear, Wear To Work, footwear and accessories. Denim sell-out outperformed our total topline trends in the second quarter. And as we approach the upcoming winter season, outerwear sell-in are strongly outpacing our overall sales trends. Meanwhile, our Ralph Lauren and Friends collection leverage our expanding Wear To Work initiative with modern pieces for both men and women rooted in the Ralph Lauren aesthetic.","In fragrance, we launched the latest iterations of Romance for women and Polo Red for men. Focused on reaching a new generation of consumers, the campaign featured our Ralph Lauren ambassadors, Taylor Hill for Beyond Romance and Ansel Elgort, Polo Red Remix.","Moving on to our third key initiative, drive targeted expansion in our regions and channels. Our long term expansion strategy remains focused on building a cohesive brand elevating Ralph Lauren experience across our retail, wholesale and digital commerce presence in key cities around the world. During the second quarter, we opened 20 new stores and concessions globally and closed 21 locations. This included 15 openings in Asia. We also completed door refreshes in key markets around the world, including our Place de la Madeleine flagship store in Paris and factory door renovation in North America and China, where we continue to elevate our fleet across every touch point.","Our consumer centric ecosystem approach drove strong results in the quarter with China Mainland sales up more than 20% in constant currency, driven by comp growth and new stores. Total China sales were up modestly to last year in constant currency including Hong Kong headwinds, which Jane will discuss in her remarks. In Europe, we opened four owned and partnered full price stores. While we are making good progress, we still have significant expansion opportunities with only 40 full price stores across Europe with all of this complemented by our successful digital commerce expansion.","Which brings me to our fourth key initiative, lead with digital. Our global digital ecosystem, including our directly operated flagship sites, departmentstore.com, pure players and social commerce increased low teens in the second quarter in constant currency. The strong performance was driven by more than 30% growth in international. While this was tempered by more modest growth in North America, our North America digital sales were positive and ahead of expectations improving sequentially from first quarter trends.","Starting with Europe. Digital sales were up double digits in the quarter with strong performance across each channel. We added 17 new wholesale digital partners including La Redoute, one of the largest digital pure players in France. Our directly operated digital sites in Europe also saw continued momentum delivering 13% comp growth this quarter. Recent enhancements included optimizations to our mobile site and checkout process and a new digital commerce flagship for Ireland as we continue to drive our localization efforts by market. We also recently launched Instagram in Europe.","In Asia, digital ecosystem sales were also solid led by China. We added five exciting new digital partners in the second quarter, including Secoo, a luxury e-commerce platform in China, GS Shop, the number one multimedia retailer in Korea and Marui, a leading omnichannel retailer targeting younger consumers in Japan. We also continue to elevate our presence with key digital pure players like Tmall during the quarter.","Turning to North America. Second quarter comps on ralphlauren.com were up 2% and better-than-expected. Similar to the first quarter, we continued to experience declines from international consumers on our U.S. site due to FX headwinds and increased import regulations in key Asian markets. However, sales to domestic shoppers were up single digits and slightly better than first quarter trends as we started to improve our mobile user experience and drive more targeted email marketing.","Under our new global merchandising effort, we are also rebalancing our buys to emphasize stronger selling core and seasonal core products going forward. Our digital performance should start to reflect these initiatives, along with further improvements in mobile and personalization to drive conversion more in the back half of fiscal 2020.","Lastly, we continued to build partnerships with new digital platforms in North America, which are extending our reach to new and younger consumers. In the second quarter, we launched men's polo sportswear on revolve.com and its sister site, FWRD. We also launched Lauren ready-to-wear and dresses on Nuuly, the new subscription service from Urban Outfitters, targeting our next-generation consumer.","Touching on our fifth key initiative, operate with discipline to fuel growth. In the second quarter, we continued to challenge every cost and improve our efficiencies. Adjusted operating margin expansion of 100 basis points exceeded our expectations, driven by gross margin expansion, disciplined expense management and lower marketing spend in the quarter. This cost discipline enabled continued expansion of our global retail presence while increasing operating profit and operating margin.","Looking at our supply chain. Year to date, we have continued to increase its flexibility and efficiency. With the enactment of this List 4 tariffs from China in the quarter, we have continued our multipronged effort to mitigate the cost impact. This includes, first, working with our existing partners within China to drive increased productivity. Second, further diversifying our supply chain outside of China. Over the past two years, we have reduced our U.S. exposure to China from over 40% to about 22% by the end of this fiscal year and moving to approximately mid-teens for fiscal 2021. And third, while we are focused on driving the first two strategies to mitigate as much of the tariff headwind as possible and minimize the direct impact to the consumer, we are also planning targeted global price increases.","As previously discussed, the central part of our next great chapter strategy is raising AUR to elevate the brand globally and create value. We began phasing in strategic ticket price increases in our North American outlet channel in late September. Our North America full price wholesale and direct to consumer doors will reflect targeted price increases, starting with our Spring 2020 assortments. Leveraging the success we have had implementing this strategy in Asia and Europe, these ticket increases reflect our competitive benchmarking analysis and are focused on the value proposition for our consumers. Jane will provide further detail on AUR and the expected financial impact of tariffs in her prepared remarks.","In closing, in the context of a more volatile environment, we continue to deliver solid progress on our next great chapter plan. Ralph and I are proud of our teams' execution this quarter as they delivered across each of our strategic pillars with passion and excellence. Together, we remain focused on driving each of these areas to deliver long term sustainable growth and value creation for all of our stakeholders.","With that, I will turn it over to Jane and I will join her at the end to answer your questions.","Jane Nielsen","Thank you Patrice and good morning everyone. Our teams delivered solid top and bottomline results in the second quarter with expansion in both gross and operating margin driving operating profit growth and double digit EPS growth. Globally, we also continue to make progress against our key strategic initiatives in the quarter with encouraging early signs of progress in our direct to consumer business in North America, our largest market. These included positive brick-and-mortar and digital comps in North America as well as Europe and Asia, sequential AURs improvement on top of difficult compares and inventory more closely aligned to our topline growth.","Second quarter revenues increased 1% on a reported basis and 2% in constant currency. Our international business, which represents about 45% of our sales, delivered 7% topline growth in constant currency while North America was down 1%. Total company retail comps grew 2% in the quarter. Adjusted gross margin was up 60 basis points in the second quarter on a reported basis and up 80 basis points in constant currency. Gross margins benefited from AUR growth of 2% with favorable channel and geographic mix, coupled with pricing, promotion management and product assortment. All three regions delivered positive AUR growth.","Looking ahead, we expect second half AUR to be incrementally stronger than the first half of the year, driving our full year expectation of low single digit AUR growth for fiscal 2020. This will be driven by, one, targeted price increases in select channels and categories based on competitive benchmarking and where we have a proven opportunity to play, two, accelerated product mix shifts such as an increased penetration of fleece and outerwear for fall holiday which are already resonating well with consumers and three, our ongoing strategy of pulling back promotions to improve quality of sales and elevate the brand globally across each of our distribution channels. While we are closely watching the broader competitive environment and in-season trends, we are pleased with our inventory position and remain focused on managing our inventory with discipline in order to mitigate promotional risk.","Adjusted operating margin in the second quarter was 14.9%, up 100 basis points on a reported basis and up 130 basis points in constant currency. Adjusted operating profit dollars grew 8% to last year. SG&A expense declined to 46.6% of sales, down 30 basis points to last year, driven by cost reduction initiatives and lower marketing expense. Marketing decreased 10% in the quarter as we anniversaried last year's higher investments around our 50th Anniversary show and related events. However, we continue to expect marketing spend to grow ahead of our sales for full year fiscal 2020.","Our teams remain focused on generating operating efficiencies across our business. Some key highlights from our second quarter include, first, we realized continued efficiencies across our supply chain including incremental productivity with our existing strategic sourcing partners, reduced freight cost contracts and lower air freight cost, all contributing to mitigating the cost of List 4 tariffs.","On the product side, we reduced product cost in outerwear while also improving our on-time delivery rate by over 30% in order to drive sales and margin in this high potential underpenetrated category. At the same time, we also improved our overall value proposition by significantly increasing the use of sustainable materials in our outerwear production. Our continued work on corporate expenses delivered a 10% reduction in corporate overhead. This includes our ongoing vendor renegotiations process where we are addressing over 100 global indirect spend contracts this year, driving savings of about 15% from our previous contracts and we continue to digitize the way we work to drive both productivity and a better consumer experience.","We recently completed the successful transition of our order management system for ralphlauren.com in North America, which will enable the implementation of new omnichannel functionality and improved mobile experience, personalization and more, all at a significant saving to our previous provider.","Moving on to our segment performance, starting with North America. Revenue decreased 1% in the second quarter, as growth in our retail business was more than offset by our wholesale revenue declines. Adjusted operating margin was 22.7%, a 100 basis point decrease to last year with operating margin expansion in our retail businesses more than offset by gross margin contraction and SG&A deleverage in our wholesale business on lower sales. In the retail channel in North America, comps were up 2% as both brick-and-mortar comps and sales on our own digital commerce site, each grew 2%. Brick-and-mortar comps were driven by a 2% increase in AUR.","In the second quarter, we tested targeted email offers, improved outlet window signage and leveraged page search optimization to mitigate traffic challenges. At factory, AUR and comp conversion both improved in the quarter and we continue to focus on driving better traffic trends through increased marketing, refreshed store experiences and product improvement, including expansion in underdeveloped categories like outerwear. Comps in our North America directly operated digital commerce business were up 2% above our expectations.","Positive growth from domestic consumers was partially offset by lower sales to international shoppers on our U.S. site, as Patrice discussed. We expect to reduce sales to international shoppers to continue to pressure our North America digital comps through the rest of fiscal 2020. Through the second half, digital sales to our domestic online shoppers are expected to improve. Our teams are focused on driving higher conversion among domestic consumers through, one, favorable product mix towards categories like outerwear or fleece and two, investing in improved mobile functionality, site architecture and personalization to drive more relevant content.","Moving on to North America wholesale. Second quarter revenue declined 6%. Excluding off-price, our underlying North America wholesale business was down high single digits in the second quarter, as expected. While our market share increased slightly in our men's polo business, we continue to see modest share declines in women's as Lauren underperformed the market. We continue to work on improving our product mix while also driving a return to core categories in Lauren's women's.","Additionally, we continue to improve the consumer experience in the wholesale channel through in-store refreshes, expansion into underpenetrated categories and increased marketing. With North America now mobilized under new leadership at both wholesale and regional level, it will take some time for our wholesale business to start reflecting these improvements.","Moving on to Europe. Second quarter revenue was up 3% on a reported basis and 8% in constant currency. Adjusted operating margins expanded 170 basis points on a reported basis and 220 basis points in constant currency. Operating margin expansion was driven by strong gross margins and SG&A leverage. In the retail channel in Europe, comps were up 3%, driven by a 13% increase in our own digital commerce sites and a 2% increase in our brick-and-mortar stores.","The increase in our directly operated European digital commerce business was above our expectation, driven by solid merchandising execution and traffic increases. Our sites continue to benefit from platform enhancements, more targeted performance marketing and further localization of regional sites. Across our Europe direct to consumer channels, our ongoing effort to elevate the brand and improve product mix continued in the second quarter, with AUR up 6% on top of a strong 8% increase last year.","Wholesale revenue in Europe was up 7% in constant currency in the second quarter and also ahead of our expectations. The strong performance reflected solid sell-out trends driving stronger reorders particularly with our digital pure play partners, modest distribution growth with both digital and wholesale partners similar to the last few quarters and a shift in timing of shipments to a key digital pure play account from the back half of fiscal 2020 into Q2.","Turning to Asia. Revenue was up 4% on a reported basis and 5% in constant currency in the second quarter. We saw solid performance across nearly every market in Asia including China Mainland sales growth of over 20% in constant currency. Our product and marketing initiatives are resonating well in this region and we continue to increase our digital efforts, expand and elevate our store fleet and engage with local influencers and celebrities.","Comps in Asia increased 1% with positive AUR growth and a strong contribution from our newer doors. In Hong Kong, where we have several important retail doors, heavy protest disruption drove the equivalent of 48 full days of store closures during the quarter. These closures, along with significantly lower tourism, drove declines in our Hong Kong business and negatively impacted our total Asia comp by about three points. While we expect Hong Kong to remain a near term headwind, we are encouraged by continued momentum in the rest of Asia and we still expect positive fiscal 2020 comp growth for this segment as we invest in our distribution network and drive marketing to amplify and elevate the brand. Adjusted operating margin was up 140 basis points to last year driven by strong gross margin expansion.","Moving onto the balance sheet. Our balance sheet remains strong and we continue to return capital to shareholders. We ended the year with about $1.6 billion in cash and investments and $693 million in total debt which compares to $1.9 billion in cash and investments and $684 million in debt at the end of last year's second quarter. We accelerated our share repurchases to $250 million in shares in the second quarter. We will continue to opportunistically buy back stock and remain on track to complete our target of about $600 million in repurchases for fiscal 2020.","Moving on to inventory. At the end of the second quarter, inventory was up 2% to last year, improving significantly from up 11% at the end of the first quarter. Inventory growth was driven by Asia to support our strategic expansion of retail distribution in that market. North America inventory growth was moderately above sales trends, but improved sequentially. And Europe inventories were down significantly as we started to anniversary last year's investments in our factory stores. We continue to expect second half inventories to remain relatively aligned with our sales outlook.","Now I would like to turn to guidance for the full year and third quarter of fiscal 2020. As a reminder, this guidance excludes restructuring and related charges and reflects our best assessment of the global retail landscape in the context of increased volatility from macroeconomic and geopolitical events. For the full year fiscal 2020, we are maintaining guidance of 2% to 3% revenue growth in constant currency introduced at the beginning of this year, but now expect results closer to the low end of this range.","Foreign currency is now expected to have about 130 basis points of negative impact on revenue growth based on currency shifts. We are maintaining our operating margin guidance for fiscal 2020 of 40 to 60 basis points expansion in constant currency, driven primarily by gross margin expansion and slight SG&A leverage. Foreign currency is estimated to have about 20 basis points of negative impact on operating margin in fiscal 2020.","While these topline expectations are still within our original guidance, our outlook now incorporates intensifying headwinds and some continued temporary door closures in Hong Kong, pressuring both Asia comp and retail expense leverage. Nevertheless, we are maintaining our full year operating margin guidance despite the headwinds from Hong Kong along with increased tariff related startup costs as we buildout new regional sourcing operations and our initiatives to prepare for a potential Brexit.","Based on the tariffs enacted to date, our guidance includes about $10 million in negative impact to our fiscal 2020 cost of goods. Meanwhile, we have maintained our commitment to accelerate marketing investments to position the company for sustainable long term growth. We now expect other income of approximately $10 million for the year, down to the prior year, as a result of lower interest rates and accelerated share repurchases, reducing our interest income.","For the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we expect revenues to be flat in constant currency. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by 70 to 90 basis points in the quarter. We expect disruptions in Hong Kong to negatively impact revenue by about $10 million in the quarter. Operating margin for the third quarter is expected to be flat to down 20 basis points in constant currency. This is primarily due to the timing of SG&A investments with our highest dollar marketing in the third quarter this year and temporary duplicate rent as we consolidate our New York headquarters, more than offsetting gross margin expansion in the quarter. Foreign currency is expected to have a minimal impact on the operating margin in the third quarter. Third quarter tax rate is estimated at 21%.","In closing, we continue to be vigilant regarding the geopolitical and macroeconomic environment and we are committed to maintaining discipline on costs and inventory as we elevate the brand and return the company to sustainable growth and value creation. We are proud of the work our teams around the world are doing to execute on our next great chapter plan. Guided by Ralph's creative vision, our teams are executing with agility and a passion for the brand.","With that, let's open up the call for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Paul Trussell","Good morning and congrats on quite solid results.","Patrice Louvet","Good morning Paul.","Jane Nielsen","Thank you Paul.","Paul Trussell","There are a number of notable headwinds in the marketplace, some of which have led your peers to reduce their go-forward expectations. In your view, what drove your performance in Q2? And what are you seeing in the business that enables you to maintain your earnings guidance for the full year? And on North America specifically, could you speak to your surprising positive comps and the outlook for the region? Thank you.","Patrice Louvet","Hi. Good morning Paul. Thanks for your question. The first thing I really want to say is, I am really proud of the way our teams executed this quarter because, as you mentioned, we were able to exceeded expectations while dealing with a wide range of challenges from tariffs, the Hong Kong situation, the Brexit uncertainty and the further acceleration of our supply chain moves. This coupled with the organizational changes that we talked about over the past few months really gives us confidence that we should just continue to running the play through our next great chapter plan, obviously with a higher degree of agility that's required in today's context.","On the specific drivers of this quarter's performance that we believe are sustainable, there is probably four I would call out. The first one is the fact that we are seeing brand momentum both with new consumers and with current consumers and we have had, I think as you have heard during our prepared remarks, a number of high impact marketing activities during the quarter. One I would highlight is the application we did on Wimbledon globally through celebrities and influencers around the world. Second driver is product, right. I think we have seen this quarter is the beginning of a better balance between core, seasonal core and fashion product, coupled with exciting growth in outerwear as we go into the holiday season.","Third area is distribution. And one of our big priorities is to continue to elevate the brand presence, the shopping experience for consumers wherever they shop, be that in brick-and-mortar or in digital. And we are also continuing to expand both in Europe and Asia and have significant growth opportunities moving forward in those two regions. And the final point is, while we are investing behind all these initiatives, we are continuing to drive operating efficiencies and cost discipline.","Now specifically to your question on North America. We were very pleased with the comp performance this quarter of 2%. The key thing I would highlight here is the during progress we made in our full price stores were the result of marketing and really bringing consumers into the store, the result of engagements with our VIPs and the change we made in our compensation structure to really drive a total team push in our respective stores has really played out very nicely. We are also encouraged by the progress we are making on our website, particularly with domestic consumers and also continued to see good progress in our factory outlets.","Jane Nielsen","Yes. I would say, Paul, that we were really pleased with Q2 and our ability to maintain our fiscal 2020 guidance. As we look at some of the headwinds that we named, from Hong Kong to tariffs to Brexit, it's about $0.25 to $0.30 to EPS. And what we have really been able to do is to have our teams react in a very agile fashion and what we are seeing is that continued momentum on AUR, plus our brick-and-mortar conversion improvements that we are seeing in our stores, notably in North America and continued strong performance across Europe and Asia are what's enabling us to hold our overall operating margin guidance and our revenue guidance through the year. So really proud of the teams. And we see those drivers as durable throughout the rest of this year.","Corinna Van der Ghinst","Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Michael Binetti","Hi guys. Good morning. Thanks for our questions. I add my congrats on a good quarter, specially the North American comp. I know it's the best number you have seen in a while.","Patrice Louvet","Thanks Michael.","Jane Nielsen","Thank you.","Michael Binetti","Any initial response to those U.S. price increases would be helpful. But I did want to talk about the outlook for second half for a minute, Jane. The guidance you give us implies the operating profit growth rate to slow and even potentially turn negative on a year-over-year basis at the end of the year. The 20118 Analyst Day guidance assumes operating profit growth each year. Can you give us some high level thoughts on how to think about the lower, even negative, growth rate at the end of this year? And how you see that starting to improve into next year, in particular North America where your operating margins have been negative on year-over-year basis? I think it's really a sentiment of the ongoing declines in wholesale and you guys make very good money in that channel. So those losses are profitable. Can you speak to how you look at North America margins in the second half? Thanks.","Jane Nielsen","Sure. In terms of the first part of your questions, which is U.S. price increases, we are still in early days. As you will recall, Michael, we set first tranche of prices in late September, early October. While it's too soon to call, we are encouraged by what we saw through back to school and through the early days of the work that. So that is sort of guiding our own guidance for AUR growth in the low single digit range for the full year and an increase in AUR as we move through the back half.","While we anticipate some headwinds in third quarter from an OI margin perspective, we still are guiding and maintaining our guidance for OI expansion for the fiscal year, which puts us in line for continued operating margin expansion through the course of our next great chapter plan. As we laid out the guidance, we knew that some things would respond better than others. With their puts and takes we are certainly encouraged right now by our gross margin progress that we are making.","And then other things would take longer to turn like North America wholesale. We are just really focused on our pressure areas, the Lauren brand, the Polo brand is performing in wholesale. Were back to investing in marketing with our wholesale partners and are really focused on sell-out in that channel. That will be the ultimate metric pf performance in that channel. And so we still feel good as we look to our five-year guidance with that mid-teens operating margin target that we laid out over a year-and-a-half ago.","Corinna Van der Ghinst","Next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Matthew Boss","Thanks and congrats on a nice quarter.","Patrice Louvet","Thanks Matt.","Jane Nielsen","Thanks Matt.","Matthew Boss","So on the gross margin, maybe Jane, what was the break down of the 80 basis points constant currency expansion in the second quarter? How best to think about puts and takes for the back half of the year? And then as we think multiyear, I guess maybe Jane again, how would you rank the buckets of continued gross margin expansion opportunity versus any headwinds to consider as we are thinking beyond this year?","Jane Nielsen","Sure. So let me lay out what happened in this quarter first because I think it provides good context to the back half of the year. As I look at pricing, promotion management and assorting in to higher AUR and gross margin overall product, that is a little over half of the benefit that we saw from gross margin expansion. We also got some benefits from channel and geographic mix.","As you know, we expect those to be durable through the course of the plan with greater and lesser puts and takes. And obviously, we called out the pressure points from FX and some ongoing tariff benefits, which is small today based on the tariffs that were enacted in Q2, but we expect to be the biggest point of increasing pressure as we move through the back half of the year.","Now counterbalancing that as we move into the back half, we expect that some of our pricing actions will start to kick in. And we go in with tighter inventory positions and edited but improving assortments that should improve our excess positions as we move through the back half of the year. So an encouraging start, a little ahead of where we thought we would be but a driver through the remainder of FY 2020.","Corinna Van der Ghinst","Next question.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Ike Boruchow","Hi. Good morning everyone. Let me add my congrats. Two quick ones for Jane, I think. Could you just help us understand what's embedded in the North America wholesale plan for the back half and if there is any variability between Q3 and Q4? And then any color around off-price versus the traditional U.S. wholesale within that? And then just really quickly, you had commented I think that the Q2 digital comp had some benefit from timing from a very big partner. Should we be expecting the digital European comp to be much less robust in the back half or any specific quarter? Just trying to understand what's going on there. Thank you.","Jane Nielsen","Sure. A multi-part question. All right. Let me start with the first part which is what's embedded in our back half outlook for North America wholesale. We don't guide regions and certainly not channels but I can tell you, Ike, that what we see today with our sell-out trends down mid to high single digits, we are expecting that to continue through the back half of this year.","We are focused on our sell-out trends. We believe that we will be making some edits into the spring that will be better. But until we have better sell-out trends, that's our expectations for the revenue that we will report which is sell-in and so that's our expectation and that's embedded in the back half of the year. Always working to improve and we think that you will start to see that as we maintain a new leadership set but that will be closer to the start of our next fiscal.","If you think about the color on overall North America off-price, this quarter off-price, especially in North America, was essentially about flattish. We had a pullback in some of our cut it business that we, in order to keep our inventories clean, had some flow of overall excess. I expect that that trend, as we use it as an excess channel, it will be a little choppy as we move through the back half of the year.","And then on Q2 and back half European digital trends, we did in preparation for holiday accelerate a little bit of shipments into Q2 to one of our larger customers and that we expect that for fiscal 2020 digital comps will be at a more normalized level following last year's replatforming in the second half. But the total ecosystem will be a low double digit comp for the year.","Corinna Van der Ghinst","Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Kate Fitzsimons with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Kate Fitzsimons","Yes. Hi. Good morning, I will add my congratulations. I wanted to dig a bit more into the North American digital comp plus 2%. Can you just speak to what drove that sequential gain? It sounds like you saw some resonance with some mobile investments domestically. So just wanted to hear more about what changes were made in the quarter and what gives you confidence that business can continue to improve go forward? And I guess when you benchmark your digital and mobile experience relative to peers, where do you really see as the opportunity go forward on as we look to 2020? Thank you.","Patrice Louvet","Sure. So we had a number of things that kicked in, in the quarter and we continue to see it raise the bar, right. So for me, it's a continued journey. First intervention is the mobile dimension which you touched on. So optimizing the mobile experience through both better site navigation and better search functionality. The second piece is, we launched Apple Pay, right. And we want make sure that we have all the payment approaches that our target consumers want to use.","The third area is, as we looked at our email segmentation, we were more precise in our email targeting and so we are seeing some benefits from that and I expect that to actually strengthen over time. And then the last one, which is important because we want to make sure we provide great customer service, we moved to actually 24\/4 customer service call support during this quarter and obviously we are going to continue to do that.","And then as you look at the next phases of capability that we are building on the site, continuing to build out the mobile functionality, personalization, big focus areas for us. And then the whole connected retail piece, whether it's buy online, find in store and buy online store, pickup in store. So those have been drivers that have helped our business this past quarter.","The progress was, remember last time we talked about how there is a bifurcation between our domestic consumers and our international business. So our domestic consumer progress was solid this quarter. Our international business continues to be pressured because of the foreign exchange dynamics and because of the import restrictions, particularly in China and in Korea.","Jane Nielsen","Yes. I would just add that we expect that some of that international pressure will continue through the balance of this year.","Patrice Louvet","Will continue, yes, right.","Corinna Van der Ghinst","Next question.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Your line is open.","Dana Telsey","Hi. Good morning everyone. And I also want to say congratulation on the nice progress. As you think about Hong Kong and obviously the uncertainty there, how you are planning that going forward? The down 27% that you had this quarter, how do you see that progressing? And then on new channels of distribution that you mentioned, Patrice, how do you balance out new channels with wholesale? Where do you see the endgame winding up with wholesale as a percent of sales and perhaps some of these new channels? And is there a margin differential? Thank you.","Jane Nielsen","Yes. Dana, why don't I start on Hong Kong and then I will turn it over to Patrice. So as we look at Hong Kong this quarter, it was about a three point pressure to overall Asia comp. As we look forward to Q3, we are expecting that pressure to accelerate and it will be about four to five points of negative impact on Asia comp as we move forward. We have seen like many others, the tourist falloff has accelerated and door closures due to protest, we don't expect to improve. And it's embedded in our guidance for Q3.","Patrice Louvet","And then on the channel play. So listen, we have a very simple principle. We want to be where the consumer wants to shop us. And it's clear that there is new model that consumers are excited about where we want to play. So rental, subscription, retail, all right.","So on rental, I think we have actually been on rental runway for several months. We just started on Nuuly. We are excited about that. And there are other platforms that we are looking at. Initial results are quite encouraging. So very early days, but encouraged by the progress.","Subscription, whether that's Stitch Fix or Trunk Club, are also performing well for us and we want make sure we are there and we play to win there.","And then we are starting on retail. We had an activity with Depop in the U.K. where results were quite encouraging. And obviously given the nature of our brand, timelessness, basically more style driven than seasonal fashion driven, more focus on quality, we think we are actually very well-positioned to play to win in that segment.","Listen, your crystal ball is going to be as good as mine, Dana, on this one in terms of what share of the business it will be down the road. The consumer, I think, will tell us that based on their behaviors and the services that we can offer. But our mindset is, we want to build an ecosystem that's consumer centric and within that ecosystem wholesale still has a very important to play, both brick-and-mortar and.com. And so we want make sure we are where the consumer expects us to be. We are well set up for success in those channels where the brand can show up in the right way as well as in the developing new channels.","I think the key thing from me here and I am very proud of the work that the teams are doing here, is the agility that the organization is demonstrating because typically we wouldn't necessarily be as nimble on some of these new opportunities. And I think there has been a lot of wonderful work done internally to take advantage of these opportunities and to have a bit of a first-mover advantage on some of them.","Corinna Van der Ghinst","Last question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Rick Patel with Needham & Co. Your line is open.","Rick Patel","Good morning and well done managing the tough environment. I had a question on marketing. So it sounds like some of the efforts to leverage the targeted performance channels are working very well. Should we expect more of this in the back half? And does that mean that you will move away from some of the brand-building investment you have made in the past? Or should marketing grow across all channels? Thank you.","Patrice Louvet","Thank you Rick. Well, listen, first of all, our end goal is one-to-one marketing, right. I mean that's where we want to go. Now that's probably a few years away still. But that's certainly the personalization journey we are on across all elements of our marketing. So you will see, no, we are not going to get down to quarter-by-quarter specifics on this, but you will see us continue to increase personalization focused both mobile, on our site and in our email activities, so that the page that you get when you sign on to our site is dramatically different than the page that I get when I sign on.","That will not be done at the expense of overall brand-building activities like our shows, like our partnerships with sports, like our limited editions. But it's really about being more efficient in the way we spend our money. And I think what we will find with personalization is actually we will be able to be a lot more effective and efficient with each dollar being spent. We are still on the trajectory to get to 5% of sales expense in marketing by the end of the five-year phase.","We expect marketing to continue to grow ahead of revenue this year as well, just like we had over the past two fiscal years. So think of us playing across the pallet of marketing tools, but indeed with a deliberate focus on ultimately getting to one-to-one marketing.","Jane Nielsen","And expect marketing dollars to grow in the second half, Rick.","Patrice Louvet","All right. Well listen, thanks to all of you for joining us today. We look forward to sharing our third quarter fiscal 2020 results with you in early February. And in the meantime, have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions on how to ask a question will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mrs. Evren Kopelman. Please go ahead.","Evren Kopelman - Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations","Good morning and thank you for joining us on Ralph Lauren's First Quarter Fiscal 2016 Conference Call. The agenda for this morning's call includes an overview of the quarter and an update on our broader strategic initiatives from Jacki Nemerov, our President and COO; followed by financial perspective on the first quarter from Bob Madore, our CFO; and concluding with commentary on our organizational restructure as well as our expectations for fiscal 2016 from Chris Peterson, our President of Global Brands. After the company's prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions, which we ask that you limit to one per caller.","During today's call, we will be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including our financial outlook. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees and our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Our expectations contain many risks and uncertainties. The principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from our current expectations are detailed in our SEC filings.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to Jacki.","Jackwyn L. Nemerov - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Thank you, Evren, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter of our new fiscal year, we delivered revenues in line with our guidance and profits that were better than our expectations. This was driven by the company's attention to careful, disciplined operational and expense management. We are pleased with these results in the context of the environment in which we operate and we are on track to deliver our plan for the fiscal year.","We see the year developing as one of steady quarter-by-quarter improvement. Looking at the first half, we are negatively impacted by the Easter calendar, significant foreign exchange pressure and our infrastructure investments. In the second half, we expect to see both sales and profit improvement due to the launch of Polo Sport and the opening of our new stores, the impact of product cost savings and pricing actions, and the benefit of our restructuring activities. In addition, the foreign exchange pressure will lessen as the year progresses.","Now let me turn to the quarter. There were several factors impacting our results: first, the shift in global tourist traffic patterns around the world; second, but related to the first point, the changes in foreign exchange rates; and third, the increasingly promotional U.S. retail environment. We are taking decisive actions to most effectively operate in this changing environment. We always take a long-term view to protect both our brand and our profitability. While our infrastructure investments have pressured our operating margin in the short term, we believe these are the right investments that will pay off in the future. Let me give you more texture on each of these topics.","In the first quarter, the impact of currency movements on global tourism was especially pronounced. We saw significant increases in traffic in Europe and Japan, and a decline in the U.S. We see that the customer is more astute than ever and adjusts travel and purchasing plans to make the smartest spending decisions. Our business was up double-digits in Europe and Japan, where the local currencies have weakened and tourism has increased. In Japan, an increase in traffic from Chinese tourists and more domestic consumption from the Japanese, as they traveled less overseas due to their weaker currency, drove the business. We also had specific merchandising and marketing initiatives implemented by our teams that were quite successful.","Europe experienced similar strength as tourist traffic increased with the weaker euro, and demand was especially strong in wholesale.","In the U.S., the impact was disproportionate for us, as our distribution skews to the larger cities that have experienced the most significant slowdowns in traffic and spending from the foreign tourist. Roughly half of our U.S. Ralph Lauren and Club Monaco stores are in major gateway cities, such as New York, Miami and San Francisco. Many of our largest points of wholesale distribution are also in major gateway cities. And finally, our factory outlet presence is heavily skewed to centers that tend to attract more foreign tourists. In the balance of our distribution across the rest of the country, our performance has been on or above plan, which tells us that the strength of our brands and appeal of our products remain high.","Now, let me turn to the retail environment in the U.S. The industry saw a late start to the spring season due to issues related to the West Coast port delays and an unseasonably cold weather pattern, as well as the lower tourist traffic I spoke about earlier. These conditions created an excessive inventory and, therefore, more promotional environment in North America. We made the decision to be less promotional than the landscape, because we believe it's critical to protect our brand. Looking at comp growth across some of our largest customers, we are in line or better than their stores' average performance.","For our retail business, revenue was up 3% in constant currency in the first quarter. Global same-store sales were down 2% due to a slowdown in e-commerce. e-commerce revenue was up 2%, which was softer than prior quarters. As I referenced earlier, the environment in North America was highly promotional in the quarter, and this was more pronounced online. And again, we chose to stay less promotional than the landscape and achieved a higher average unit retail over the prior-year period as a result.","While we knew this decision could slow our revenue growth, we believed it was the right thing to do for our brand. We have seen a pick-up in sales at the beginning of the second quarter. However, we remain cautious as most of the quarter remains ahead of us.","Now, I'd like to provide some perspective on international sales trends. As I mentioned, Europe had a strong quarter, with revenue up 10% in constant currency. Wholesale demand was particularly strong, with robust sell-throughs and reorders, and all brands across the portfolio are performing well. By region, Northern and Central Europe performed the best.","In Asia, revenue was up 9% in constant currency. Japan, which is our largest business in Asia, had a strong quarter with double-digit revenue growth in constant currency, driven by successful merchandising and marketing initiatives as well as the increase in traffic from Chinese tourists that I previously mentioned.","In Korea, we experienced a strong trend until the MERS outbreak in June, which negatively impacted traffic. China was strong, once again, with double-digit comp growth. Hong Kong and Macau traffic remain pressured, but we saw improvement in our conversion rate. We continue to see strong performance of women's Polo and the expansion of the Lauren brand through new distribution in Japan and Korea, which represents an additional opportunity for growth.","Turning to some of the product highlights, let me begin with luxury. I spoke on our last call about the merging of our luxury labels to create a singular Ralph Lauren Collection label for women and Ralph Lauren Purple Label for men. I'm delighted to report that this is on track for the spring 2016 season, with positive feedback from both the retail and editorial communities, who immediately understood the clarity of our offering. For the first time in many years, Ralph Lauren participated in Milan Men's Fashion Week with an elegant and exclusive presentation of the spring 2016 Purple Label collection. This took place at the Ralph Lauren Palazzo in the heart of Milan that beautifully represents the aesthetic and sensibility of Ralph Lauren luxury.","Within the accessories part of the luxury business, we are continuing to expand the signature Ricky handbag line with the newest style, the Drawstring Ricky that was featured in our most recent advertising campaign. We will continue to grow our luxury accessory assortment and broaden the price tiering of our product offering.","Turning to the Polo brand, we unveiled our new Polo Sport line in mid-June on ralphlauren.com in the U.S. and have seen strong interest through our preorder capability. Starting with men's and boys' product, this performance-oriented collection not only brings forward an important aspect of the Polo heritage and DNA, but also speaks to the performance-inspired active trend. Polo Sport will be available in our own stores and select department stores worldwide later this month and will be introduced at DICK'S Sporting Goods in late fall.","Our Polo Tech shirt, which combines the aesthetic of Polo Sport and industry-leading advancements in wearable technology, will also be available for purchase later this month. This high-performance shirt will be supported by an interactive Polo Tech app that will feature exclusive video content that allows the wearer to optimize training performance.","We presented our spring 2016 collections for Polo sportswear, Polo tailored clothing and Polo Sport as part of the first-ever New York Men's Fashion Week last month, and the reception across the board was very strong with a tremendous amount of favorable commentary on the evolution of the brand.","Turning to the women's component of our Polo brand, as we enter its second year, we will be broadening the product line to address additional dimensions of our customer's lifestyle. Denim & Supply continues to see strong growth in both men's and women's. Both Polo for Women and Denim & Supply feature product that spoke to some of the season's biggest trends, such as bohemian looks and fringe details, which are core to our DNA. And across all brands, we had terrific consumer response to our denim offerings. Our dress business, Lauren footwear and Lauren accessories are also performing well. In our licensed businesses, men's Polo furnishings, Lauren tailored clothing and home continue to grow and gain market share in the department store channel.","We remain focused on managing the business and the brands for the long term. We continue to be disciplined about expense management, especially given the challenging macro operating environment, in order to allow us to thoughtfully invest in our long-term strategic growth initiatives. I would like to recognize the talent, experience and dedication of our senior leaders and their teams.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bob.","Robert L. Madore - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you, Jacki, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin with a brief recap of the quarter. On a constant currency basis, revenues were in line with the prior year, driven by double-digit revenue growth internationally. This is in line with the guidance we provided in May. The negative FX impact to revenue growth was approximately 500 basis points, which is slightly better than we anticipated as the euro performed slightly better against the U.S. dollar. On a reported basis, net revenues declined 5% to $1.6 billion in the first quarter.","Gross profit margin was 59.8% in the first quarter excluding restructuring-related non-cash charges of $3 million. This was 120 basis points below the prior-year period. The decline in gross profit margin was due to unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating margin in the first quarter was 8.8% excluding restructuring and related non-cash charges. This was 550 basis points below the prior year; however, better than the outlook we provided in May of 600 basis point to 650 basis point decrease. The operating margin came in better than our guidance due to disciplined operational management across the organization. Lower operating margin was attributable to the timing of revenue receipts in our wholesale business, incremental investments in infrastructure, and negative foreign currency effects.","Net income for the first quarter was $95 million or $1.09 per diluted share excluding restructuring and related non-cash charges. On a reported basis, net income was $64 million or $0.73 per diluted share.","The effective tax rate of 30% in the first quarter, on an adjusted basis, was in line with our guidance and compared to an effective tax rate of 31% in the prior-year period.","Moving on to segment performance, wholesale revenues declined 6% in constant currency during the first quarter. Wholesale revenue was negatively impacted by our customers' receipt plans due to an earlier Easter this year, which was partially offset by double-digit constant currency growth in Europe.","Combining the two quarters to take a more holistic view of the Spring\/Summer season, global wholesale revenues were up approximately 2% in constant currency. On a reported basis wholesale revenues of $642 million were 9% below the prior-year period.","Wholesale operating margin in the first quarter was 21.8% excluding restructuring related non-cash charges. This was 370 basis points below the prior-year period due to the change in customer receipt plans. Retail sales increased 3% in constant currency to $935 million. Growth was driven by incremental contribution from new stores and e-commerce expansion. Comparable store sales declined 2% in constant currency and declined 8% on a reported basis.","In Europe and Asia, same-store sales growth was positive with particular strength in Japan and China. In North America, the strong U.S. dollar pressured tourist traffic in the overall retail environment. As Jacki mentioned, comps in brick-and-mortar stores were similar to last quarter in the range of down 2% to 3%; however, e-commerce growth was softer than prior quarters at up 2%. Again, the online environment in North America became highly promotional in the quarter and we chose to stay less promotional than the landscape. We achieved a higher average unit retail and higher average order value over the prior period as the results.","Excluding restructuring related non-cash charges, retail operating margin in the first quarter was 12.6%, which was 490 points below the prior-year period, reflecting fixed expense deleverage and negative foreign currency effects. Licensing revenues increased 6% in constant currency during the first quarter and licensing operating income was in line with the prior-year period.","Moving on to the balance sheet, consolidated inventory was $1.3 billion at the end of the first quarter, up 8% year-over-year, reflecting investments to support new store openings, the launch of Polo Sport and increased shipments of Polo Women's, as well as a change in the timing of receipt plans. In addition, we spent $68 million on capital expenditures compared to $85 million in the prior-year period. The company also repurchased 1.1 million shares of its common stock during the first quarter at a cost of $150 million, and at the end of the first quarter approximately $430 million remained available for future share repurchases. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.2 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet.","Overall, we're pleased with the better-than-expected first quarter results. Disciplined planning and day-to-day execution enabled us to offset meaningful FX and environmental headwinds.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Chris to give you an update on our global brand reorganization effort and guidance for fiscal 2016.","Christopher H. Peterson - President-Global Brands","Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to share an update on our transition to the new global brand management organization structure we spoke about on our last call, as we have made significant progress.","In the last 90 days, we established six global brand groups, and I'm pleased to report that we have filled all of the global brand president roles. These presidents reflect an equal balance of Ralph Lauren veterans with significant experience inside our organization, and outside talent with critical category expertise.","In addition to the six brand presidents, we have also begun to identify the design, merchandising, marketing and finance leads for their respective teams and are pleased with the way these groups are forming.","A key element of our new operating model is the introduction of a global line planning process. This is the end-to-end process by which we design, merchandise and plan our assortments. We have kicked it off in our Polo Men's business as a pilot for the fall 2016 season. We will use learnings from this pilot to inform its roll-out across the other brands in spring 2017 and beyond. We expect this new process to improve brand equity and revenue growth by creating better assortments and more consistent brand messaging, and drive operating efficiencies at the same time. The new organization structure and its accompanying processes will lead to a significant reduction in SKUs as well as sample and design costs, which will lead to better inventory turns, higher gross margins and meaningful SG&A cost savings. We expect to see the benefits from the global line planning process in the next 18 months to 24 months as it rolls out across the portfolio.","We also implemented the head count reduction that we spoke about on our last call. These were difficult, but necessary, decisions and we are on track to realize the $100 million in annual expense savings we spoke about previously, driven by the move to the new organization model. Only a modest amount of the benefits will be realized in fiscal 2016, with more significant savings to come in fiscal 2017 and beyond.","We expect to incur restructuring and other one-time related charges of approximately $70 million to $100 million as a result of this reorganization, and we've recognized $45 million of this expected charge in the first quarter. This charge encompasses the cost of separation associated with our workforce reduction as well as the cost of store and shop adjustments to provide greater clarity of brand presentation.","We're very encouraged by the early stages of our transition and pleased to report that it has gone smoothly. We now feel even more confident that it will allow us to maximize growth and achieve meaningful operational and financial efficiencies.","Before I turn to guidance for fiscal 2016, I wanted to give an update on some of our key initiatives around new store development, infrastructure investments and our efforts to mitigate foreign exchange impacts.","In the first quarter, we opened six directly operated and 15 licensed stores around the world. We are on track to open 40 to 50 directly operated stores in fiscal 2016. We continue to expect that these new store investments will be neutral to year-on-year margins in fiscal 2016 as the accelerated store opening pace is now in our base.","Regarding infrastructure investments, our e-commerce re-platform is on schedule and ramping up as planned. This is a multiyear initiative to significantly improve the company's omni-channel capabilities and the customer's shopping experience. Our SAP implementation in Europe is also on track. We continue to expect our infrastructure investments to create a year-on-year drag of approximately 60 basis points on operating margin in fiscal 2016, largely driven by the critical e-commerce re-platforming investment.","Moving to foreign exchange, let me give you an update on our previously announced actions to mitigate the negative currency impacts. We have raised prices for cruise and spring seasons in those markets that have been impacted by currency devaluation, including Japan, Canada, Australia and Europe. These pricing actions are generally in the mid to high single-digit range. Our retail partners have been very receptive to the price increases, and we believe our competitors are implementing pricing actions as well. We expect to see the benefits on our income statement in the back half of the fiscal year. In addition, we continue to expect lower product cost in the back half of the fiscal year from lower raw material and oil prices.","With that as backdrop, I'd like to now turn to guidance for fiscal 2016. We are maintaining our outlook for the fiscal year. We continue to expect mid-single digit constant currency revenue growth for the full year. This will be supported by significant contributions from the strategic initiatives in which we have invested over the last several years. Retail segment revenues are expected to grow faster than wholesale. And based on current exchange rates, foreign currency will have about a 450 basis point negative impact on fiscal 2016 revenue growth.","Moving to operating income, on a constant currency basis, we expect an improvement in operating margin from continuing operations in fiscal 2016. We intend to reinvest this improvement in our infrastructure build-out, primarily the new global e-commerce platform and ongoing SAP implementation. On a reported basis, we continue to expect our full year 2016 operating margin to be approximately 180 basis points to 230 basis points below fiscal 2015's levels due to the unfavorable currency impact. This guidance excludes restructuring and other one-time related charges associated with our global brand reorganizations.","In terms of the sensitivity on our operating income to movements in exchange rates, a change of about $0.05 in the euro to U.S. dollar rate would impact our operating income by about $20 million on a full year basis. Our fiscal 2016 tax rate is expected to be 30%.","We are planning approximately $400 million to $500 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 to support our global direct-to-consumer and infrastructure investments. For the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect net revenues to grow 3% to 5% in constant currency. We estimate the negative currency impact on sales growth in the second quarter to be 550 basis points. Our operating margin for the second quarter is expected to be approximately 275 to 325 basis points below the prior-year period, due to negative foreign currency effects, infrastructure investments and timing of expense savings initiatives. The second quarter tax rate is estimated at 30%.","We are confident in the company's potential for future growth. We believe that the new global brand management operating model will allow us to more fully leverage the power of our brands, and we continue to make strategic decisions to minimize the impact of near-term market realities and maximize shareholder returns over time.","With that, we'll open up the call for your questions. Operator, can you assist us with that?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The first question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Morning. Thanks for the update. I wanted to ask my questions around the retail business. The minus 2% comp, sounds like North America is the key driver there. Do you have a sense for what the comp might have looked like if you had chosen to go down the promotional path? And then what are your expectations for the environment? Do you expect the promotionality across retail to moderate and comp store sales trends to resume to more of a positive level? And also an update on the Polo store specifically would be great. Thanks.","Christopher H. Peterson - President-Global Brands","Sure. So let me start with the comp trends. It was really a mixed environment that we were operating in around the world with a lot of different factors. So I would start by saying that about 20% of our sales are driven by foreign tourists globally in our retail stores. And you correctly mention that if you look at the international business, our retail comps were positive. So we were up internationally in our retail comps, both in Europe and in Asia. Part of that was driven by strong acceptance of the product. Part of that was driven by increased traffic flows from foreign tourists, particularly in Japan and Europe. In the U.S., the business was under a little bit more pressure, and that was largely driven by the foreign tourist trend. And so I think that's been one of the biggest drivers, as we spoke about previously.","With regard to the e-commerce impact, it was a little bit of a different dynamic. So in the e-commerce comps, we saw strong double-digit growth in e-commerce comps in the international business where we continued to operate in a somewhat less promotional environment. In the U.S., as we saw the promotional environment escalating, we chose to stay focused on driving full-price sell-through and increasing the brand equity. And so we chose not to go down the promotional game. And we saw, as a result of that, that our average unit retails were up versus year ago. Our average transaction size was up versus year ago, but we did see a slowdown in the revenue growth as a result. And that's really what held back the overall e-commerce comp growth in the quarter, but we think it was the right move from a long-term perspective in terms of protecting the brand equity.","The Polo Fifth Avenue store, I think we continue to be very encouraged about the Polo Fifth Avenue store in terms of the job that it's doing of showcasing the brand aesthetic and brand sensibility. We're continuing to learn in that store based on the consumer response. And we're continuing to adjust the product assortment to not only showcase the direction that the brand is moving with new product, but also getting the product assortments right for that consumer that's walking into the store. So I think we continue to feel very good about where we are with that store. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for a great update. Chris, since you like multipart questions, I want to ask you one here. I know it's been a topic of intense discussion, but fiscal 2017, as we look to our longer-term models particularly on the margins, you guys have a lot of projects going on with varying durations. And as we look at next year, you guys have been commenting with us all intra-quarter on a lot of these things, maybe just an update on a few of the buckets? I think you said e-commerce and SAP are going to peak out in dollar terms this year, maybe not decline next year, but no longer inflationary. There's the restructuring savings, if you could comment on how much of that you think would flow through to margins? Because if all of it did, that would be obviously very impactful to earnings. So want to maybe help us context that. And then currency, I know most competitors now are starting to talk about the lagging impacts of hedges rolling off next year. Maybe you could just help us contextualize that as we look at next year, will FX be a bigger or smaller impact to the margins versus this year? Thanks.","Christopher H. Peterson - President-Global Brands","Yeah, sure. So I think you've got the three big elements that you mentioned in the question, but maybe I'll start with FX. So for FX, I think we said on the last call that we expected FX to be a hurt of about $185 million to operating income this year, which effectively accounts for most, if not all, of the margin decline in operating margin this year. If you look at that FX impact this year, about half of that is translational and half of that is transactional. The translational impact of currency rates stay where they are today, we would not have continuing into next fiscal year because we would have fully anniversaried it by the time we get to next fiscal year. We do expect, if FX rates stay where they are today, that we will have a lagging transactional hurt from FX that goes into next year, but we expect the magnitude of that transactional hurt to be slightly smaller than the transactional hurt that we're experiencing this year because of the timing of when our hedges roll off.","On the infrastructure investments piece of that, I expect that the e-commerce re-platforming investment is likely to ramp up next year versus this year as we get closer to implementation. And so we're expecting to be spending more money on the e-commerce re-platforming project next year. But on the SAP project, we expect that investment to ramp down year-over-year. And so when you look at the infrastructure investments in total, it's too soon to say exactly how we net out, but probably we'll be in a similar place in fiscal 2017 in total when you look at the two projects together as where we are this year.","And then, let's see, the third part of the question was on restructuring. And on restructuring savings, I think we've said that we expect to have a portion of the savings this year and a much more significant portion of the savings next year. So I do expect the restructuring savings to be a help to operating margin next year in a meaningful way. But obviously, how that nets out against the currency impact, I think it's still premature for us to say.","Operator","Thank you. The next question's from Kate McShane with Citi Research.","Katharine McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. Good morning. I wondered if you could be a little bit more specific about some of the promotional pressure that you saw during the quarter, how that differed quarter-over-quarter, what categories were more promotional than other categories, and finally how it differed between your wholesale partners and your own retail stores. Thank you.","Christopher H. Peterson - President-Global Brands","Yeah. So I guess I'd characterize it by we didn't really see a change in promotional pressure in the international business. So what we're talking about here is really the U.S. business and the U.S. retail and wholesale environment. And I think as Jacki mentioned in the prepared remarks, what we saw was with the West Coast port slowdown, with the unseasonably cold winter, there was an overhang generally of product in the industry that resulted in a desire to clear some of that inventory across the industry. And that led to a number of our wholesale partners as well as a number of our branded competitors going deeper and more frequent in their promotional cadence than what they had done a year ago.","And so I think we felt good about the way that we navigated through that because we tried to navigate through that in a way that both protected our brand equity and dealt with the market realities from a competitive environment. And I think we've got a strong track record of being able to navigate through those types of short-term issues both protecting the brand and dealing with the market realities that we're facing.","Jackwyn L. Nemerov - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","And we saw it broadly across pretty much every product category. In the men's business, the women's business and the children's business as well the home business. So it seemed to have affected all businesses in a very similar way. None of our businesses stood out in any specific way.","Christopher H. Peterson - President-Global Brands","The one other comment I would make on that is we also saw that the foreign tourist decline to the U.S. also I think was a contributing factor that affected the whole industry in terms of inventory levels and promotional environment.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from David Glick with Buckingham Research Group.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thank you very much. Two questions, one, Jacki, if you can give us an update, obviously accessories is a big growth initiative for the company, that category seems to be getting more challenging, and the progress you're making toward growth in that business. And then secondly, if you look across your U.S. wholesale business, historically you guys have talked about here a low to mid-single digit growth. And I'm just wondering given the more challenging season that we just went through, whether you can still expect that kind of bookings and growth as we head through and into next year. Thank you.","Jackwyn L. Nemerov - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yes. Well, our accessory category continues to grow faster than our overall company average. So we're really seeing very good momentum, both for our Ralph Lauren brand and our Lauren and Polo brands. And we've grown our accessory business at a 20% CAGR since 2008, and that really, today, represents a high-single-digit percentage of our total sales. We're seeing strength in both handbags and footwear, and our international full-price sell-throughs have been extremely strong, both in men's, women's and across footwear and accessories. So we're seeing great traction in the world of Ricky. We have double-digit sales growth this year in that category. So we're really continuing to fuel that opportunity and we're expanding that line through new colors, silhouettes and materials. With the introduction of the Ricky Drawstring, we've had great success with that and are expanding that as well.","In the U.S. wholesale business, I think the low to mid-single is something that we are comfortable with, and we continue to perform at or better than the customer. So I think that particularly with some of our new introductions in our Polo Sport opportunity that we're just in the beginning stages of this month, the continuation of Polo Women's, so I think we've got a lot of opportunity ahead of us in terms of some of these new introductions. The Denim & Supply business has been extremely strong. Denim, as a foundation of that business, has continued to grow and strengthen and we are feeling that in the undercurrents of that business and we play strongly in that category across Polo, across our women's business, in Polo Women's in particular, our Lauren brand, and so that category and Polo Men's as well. So I think that category we see as an increasing strong part of our opportunity going forward as well.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Christian Buss with Credit Suisse. Christian, your line is open. Please go ahead with your question.","Christian Roland Buss - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yes. Hello. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about inventory levels in the channel and your comfort with your own inventory levels.","Christopher H. Peterson - President-Global Brands","Sure, yeah. We saw our inventory was up about 8% at the end of the quarter, and we feel very comfortable with the inventory levels in the content of that inventory. If you look at the inventory at the end of the quarter and what drove the increase, it really was impacted by the timing of receipt plans as well as getting ready for the launch of Polo Sport, the expansion of Polo Women's and the opening of new stores. So when we look at the underlying factors that we're getting ready for going forward, we feel very confident and comfortable with the inventory content and level.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay B. Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I just wanted to follow up on two things. Number one, Jacki, you commented that you saw business pick up at the beginning of the quarter. I was hoping you could just put a little more color around channel, region or where you saw some of the strengthening. And then second, if you could just go through in a bit more detail the drivers of your EBIT margin outlook, what are the kind of bucket, the key drivers of compression or where you're seeing any offset for your Q2 outlook? Thanks.","Jackwyn L. Nemerov - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","I think that from our perspective, we saw a strengthening in our e-commerce business. We saw a strengthening in our overall retail business. And while the first month of our quarter tends to be more promotional, because that's just the nature of the July timing, we started to also see a strengthening of the full-price business. As we continue to sell down whatever sale we had left at this point, we also saw a nice uptick in our full-price business across the board. So I think, pretty much across all of our segments, we saw a nice increase.","Christopher H. Peterson - President-Global Brands","And if you look at the EBIT margin or the operating margin compression in the second quarter, I think it's really driven by the way that the fiscal year lays out. So in the second quarter, we're still impacted in a significant way by foreign exchange and we're impacted by the investments in the infrastructure investment, the e-commerce and the SAP investments. But we don't yet have the benefit, which we expect to start getting in the back half of the year, of the pricing actions that we've taken to offset the foreign exchange; the cost reductions that we've negotiated with our manufacturing and sourcing partners, which flow more directly into the back half of the year; the beginning of the restructuring savings, which we expect to flow more in the back half of the year; as well as the benefit of new store openings, which we expect to be more pronounced in the back half of the year. We also expect the foreign exchange impact to be smaller in the fourth quarter.","And so I think the second quarter is still bearing the brunt of all of the foreign exchange and the infrastructure investments without the benefit of the actions that we've taken to offset that, which we expect to flow more into Q3 and Q4.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Paul Swinand with Morningstar.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Research","Hi. Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to ask, some of our investors have said with all this restructuring, is there any chance that there could be damage to the brand in the long run and is there any way you can give us some color or assurance that \u2013 I mean I think it could actually be positive for the brand, but could you explain that, maybe?","Christopher H. Peterson - President-Global Brands","Sure. I think we believe that this is going to be very positive for the brands as we move into the new structure, because effectively what we're doing is we're going to be focused in creating organizations that are single-mindedly focused by brand at driving the brand equity and brand consistency around the world. So one of the reasons that we've moved into this model was that, as we looked at our previous operating model, as we started to take back licenses from the different geographies and license partners around the world, what we found was that we had different merchandise assortments around the world in like locations. We had a fragmented set of marketing campaigns because of that disparate assortments around the world.","And we think, by moving to this global brand structure with the global line planning process, we're going to be able to drive a more consistent look and feel of the brand, more consistent marketing campaigns. And that's going to drive an improvement in brand equity, which we think will allow us to showcase more clearly the design vision of the brand in all of the locations that consumers interact with our products around the world.","Operator","Thank you. The next question's from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning. So from a margin perspective, the retail operating margins have been negative, say, the past six quarters straight. As we move forward, and if you try to parse out foreign exchange, I guess I'm trying to dig in, what kind of retail comp do you think you need to see the fixed cost deleverage either stabilize or actually turn to leverage in the model? And then separately, excluding the Easter receipt shift, would operating margins at wholesale have actually been up this quarter?","Christopher H. Peterson - President-Global Brands","So let me take the second piece first. So the Easter shift accounted for about $50 million or so of revenue shift between Q4 and Q1. So if you looked at the wholesale business between Q4 of last year and Q1 of this year, if you put those two together, the wholesale business globally would have been up 2% in constant currency. And if you look at the wholesale business just in Q1 without the Easter shift, the wholesale business would have been up marginally even in the first quarter on a standalone basis without that Easter shift impact. The Easter shift really accounted for all of the margin compression, effectively, in the wholesale business. So we don't think that there is an underlying trend issue with regard to margin compression in wholesale that we're seeing.","If you look back to the first part of your question, which is around the retail comp trend, I think the margin compression that we're seeing this year is really a function of foreign exchange more than a function of retail comps. And so I don't think we've got an issue that we're relying on significant retail comp growth in order to drive operating leverage going forward. I think we believe we can drive operating leverage going forward even in a environment of relatively muted retail comp growth. That being said, we're shooting to try to improve our retail comp figures going forward and we think that the global brand structure is going to play a key role in that process.","Operator","Thank you. The final question comes from Jay Sole with Morgan Stanley.","Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning. I've got two questions. The first, the press release mentioned in the last 90 days the company established six global brand groups and filled a lot of roles. What's the next step? Can you set up a roadmap for us for what to look for over the next 90 days? And then the other question is on Polo Women's. Polo shirts, khakis, underwear are such staples in the Polo Men's business. Can those categories also be staples in women's Polo? And if not, what's really going to drive Polo Women's from a product perspective?","Christopher H. Peterson - President-Global Brands","Sure. So I'll take the brand part of the question. So over the next 90 days, what we're expecting with the global brand groups is to get the balance of the teams formed. We've made good progress. As I mentioned, we've filled all the president roles. We've made good progress on many of the key leadership positions in those, but we still have work to do to finalize the entirety of those brand structures. We also are beginning a strategy process in each of the global brand groups to look at what the global strategy is for that and we expect to make progress on that in the next 90 days. We won't be complete on that, but we're going to make significant process.","The other key piece, which I spoke about in the prepared remarks, is the global line planning process, which we expect to have kicked off, at least initiated, in almost all of the brand groups over the course of the next 90 days. We're starting with men's Polo for the fall 2016 season. We kicked off that pilot in May. And so that group got a head start, which we have learned a significant amount from, and I think we're very encouraged by what we're seeing from that line planning process approach. And I think we'll begin to kick off in many of the other brands for the spring 2017 season and those kick-offs of that process will happen in the next 90 days.","Jackwyn L. Nemerov - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","On the women's Polo business, you're absolutely right, but what's so interesting about the women's business is that we're finding key core categories in Polo Women's that are as meaningful as those categories in Polo Men's. Starting off with items like our cable cashmere sweater, in the spring season we do a cotton version, those categories have performed extremely well. We have a great Polo shirt business that is consistent and strong in women's. We do, similar to men's, an expanded woven shirt business that we are really known for and that crisp shirt, whether it is the white shirt or multiple stripes and checks and so forth, also are as valuable in women's to us as they are in men's.","And then, of course, we have key bottoms, if not the chino pant. But for us, the DNA is around our jogger (49:59), which continues to perform extremely well, as well as well as our cargo pant, another key thing that we are known for that have been extremely important and powerful as key bottoms statement. So while the women's business is driven certainly by fashion, we're able to augment that with these key strategies. Our signature blazer also is part of that core strategy. So in women's, it's more of a balance, but we have multiple staples that travel through our Polo Women's business that are important to us.","Christopher H. Peterson - President-Global Brands","Okay. Thank you very much for dialing in today. I think we're very pleased with the start that we've had to the fiscal year in the first quarter. We're maintaining our outlook for the year and we're excited about the progress that we're making on the global brand management reorganization. As always, Evren, Bob and myself will be available for follow-up calls, and Jacki as needed. Thanks again.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.

The 42% earnings per share growth that was achieved for the fourth quarter and the 14% increase for the full year, excluding the Rugby-related charges, were a function of strong product acceptance and exceptional profit flow-through on sales.

This is particularly true for fiscal 2013 as our global teams successfully manage through a challenging macroeconomic environment during the year.","Fiscal '13 was a year of important progress on each of our long-term strategic growth objectives. With respect to our direct-to-customer efforts, retail segment sales increased high single digits in constant currency and that growth was mostly comp driven led by e-commerce.","During the year, we commenced an exciting multiyear initiative to grow our brand presence in Asia, with a particular focus on Greater China. We also significantly enhanced our global e-commerce capabilities. We have built a talented team with global oversight, supported by 3 strong regional teams. In addition, we extended our reach in Western Europe, launched our first Asia site in Japan and launched Club Monaco e-commerce capabilities in the United States and Canada. We are also in the final months of doubling the size of our customer fulfillment center in North Carolina. E-commerce will remain a critical area of focus and investment for us over the next several years.","Retail now accounts for 52% of our consolidated revenues, up from approximately 40% 5 years ago, and we expect much of our future growth to be direct-to-customer led.","Our second major strategy has been our desire to expand our international presence. European revenues were up low single digits in constant currency during the year as strength in our retail operations more than offset a proactive pullback in wholesale distribution. We're able to grow our Europe profitability at an even stronger rate as the locally based team prudently managed the business, distorting resources to higher performing channels and countries.","In Asia where we are just beginning a long and exciting journey, we now have most of the major building blocks in place of our new shared service hub in Hong Kong with strong country management to focus on growth. And even as we've made outside investments in new stores and e-commerce, we were able to improve the profitability of our Asian operations with disciplined management.","The increased global acceptance of our products is a validation of our sustained commitment to investing in innovation and world-class supply chain capabilities, and supporting those efforts further with highly strategic merchandising initiatives, compelling advertising and marketing campaigns and extraordinary shopping environments. Continued market share gains in many of our core merchandise categories in North America, which is our most developed market, is a clear indication of the incredible vitality of the Ralph Lauren brand.","We are making great progress with our accessories, denim and home offerings since assuming direct control of those categories, and we look forward to nurturing the recently transitioned Chaps men's sportswear in a similar manner. Over time, we believe these emerging merchandise categories can become meaningful drivers of instrumental growth in the U.S. and around the world.","During fiscal '13, we successfully completed the first phase of a multiyear implementation of an integrated global systems platform. We believe the consistent strengthening and evolution of our corporate infrastructure will boost the global information we need to run our growing business.","The clarity and purpose of our company's vision and strategy is well understood throughout the organization. Ralph and I are proud of the progress the team is making with our long-term growth objectives and with the company's ability to consistently invest in those long-term strategies, while executing the day-to-day and consistently delivering annual results.","We are excited about the many compelling opportunities that lie ahead and we intend to match this excitement with an accelerated investment back into the business over the next several years. We are confident we have the right strategies and teams to execute our goals, and with $1.4 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet, we certainly have the means to fund our strategies.","Those of you who are familiar with our company understand that our consistent reinvestment back in the business has been an important driver of sales and profit performance.","Over the last decade, we've delivered 16% compounded annual earnings per share growth on 11% compounded annual sales growth and have returned $3 billion to shareholders via repurchase or dividends. The net result of our actions have been over a 700% increase in total shareholder return, which reflects the focused execution of our global strategies.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jacki.","Jackwyn L. Nemerov","Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to expand on 2 of the themes Roger touched on in his opening remarks, the first being the operational excellence that is a defining characteristic of our company; and the second being the incredible market share gains of our North American wholesale business.","The operational expertise of our global supply chain organization is one of the company's most significant competitive advantages. Over the years, our sourcing and logistics team have navigated through not only the growing scope of our global operations across regions, channels and product categories, but also dynamic changes in input costs, all while meeting the company's high standards of innovation and quality. Their ability to consistently execute with excellence, delivering exquisite, high-quality product while still achieving cost savings and other efficiencies, has been an important driver of our sales and profit growth.","Much of the organization's success is the result of the steady investment in talent and capital we've made to develop these world-class capabilities as our business has evolved.","In fiscal 2014, our supply chain organization will ensure the seamless integration of Chaps men's sportswear and our Australia and New Zealand operations, the doubling in size of our U.S. distribution center for RalphLauren.com and our organic business expansion. I know that many of you have an interest in input cost dynamics, so I'll offer some perspective on our input costs for this year.","Fall '13 costing is expected to be modestly below the prior year period. This is a function of lower raw material costs that are mostly offset by higher wages and our own plans to invest back into the product, whether through materials and trim or construction details, in order to deliver the most compelling product to the consumer.","As we look even farther ahead to spring\/summer 2014 season, we expect to see higher prices for our most important raw materials, but I'm confident in our team's ability to meet this challenge and find ways to mitigate that pressure.","The continued expansion of our North American wholesale business is a testament to the strong aspirational appeal of the Ralph Lauren brand. The mid-single-digit increase in our comparable operations during fiscal '13 was a continuation of a multiyear trajectory that has far outpaced industry growth. Much of this growth has been achieved through our core men's, women's and children's apparel offerings. But our newer women's accessories, footwear, dresses and our Denim & Supply brand were also important contributors. We look forward to thoughtful wholesale distribution expansion of these categories and believe they have the potential to support our continued growth.","On a related note, we just opened 2 freestanding Denim & Supply stores in the U.S., one on Newbury Street in Boston and the other, today, on University Place in New York City. These stores are an outstanding expression of the Denim & Supply brand and I encourage you to visit them. We believe that selective retail expansion of Denim & Supply worldwide will foster greater awareness for the brand and serve as a positive complement to its wholesale distribution.","In addition to the strong wholesale performance of the Ralph Lauren brand in North America, Chaps also performed very well in the fourth quarter and full year periods. Established 35 years ago as a men's only brand, Chaps has evolved over the last decade into a complete lifestyle offering with a robust product assortment across men's, women's, children's, accessories and our home categories. The combination of classic style and great quality at an accessible price point has made Chaps a highly regarded and aspirational national brand.","We are in the process of integrating our previously licensed Chaps men's sportswear business into our company as a directly operated wholesale business. We have in place a transition service agreement to ensure a seamless process without disruption for our customers over the coming months. With all of the largest merchandise categories now directly managed by our company, we will further enhance the clarity and consistency of the brand. We also believe there is a consumer appetite and a compelling opportunity to develop the Chaps brand on a global scale over time.","Everything we do across all of our brands at Ralph Lauren is borne out of a sensibility and an aesthetic that are reflected across each of our merchandise categories. The extraordinary creativity that is a hallmark and point of pride for our company is matched only by tremendous merchandising discipline that has enabled us to maximize our market share potential.","I want to share with you how we've transformed the historically strong U.S.-based merchandising organization into a truly global one. Since we've assumed direct control of most of our strategically important merchandise categories and regions, we've learned that there's a great commonality to our worldwide bestsellers. This insight is a foundational principle that grounds our global merchandising organization.","Centralized in New York in order to work in close proximity to Ralph and his design teams, we have built teams made of merchants representing our key regions around the world to work side-by-side in a highly collaborative manner, to conduct global line reviews and plan global buys. These teams work very closely with their respective brand teams across sales, planning and marketing in order to inform their thought process with real-time feedback on sales trend, product performance and marketplace dynamics. We are confident that over time, greater consistency of the product story will drive both product development and production efficiencies that will allow us to leverage our global growing scale and provide opportunity for continued gross margin expansion.","We believe a more centralized approach will ensure greater singularity of message, and therefore, global consistency of advertising, marketing and in-store presentations. Creating an even more direct link between Ralph's vision and the consumer experience across all distribution channels becomes increasingly important as tourists traveling all over the world become a larger subset of our customer base.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Chris.","Christopher H. Peterson","Thank you, Jacki, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen in this morning's press release, we're reporting strong fourth quarter profit results today.","Let me start with a brief recap of the quarter. Consolidated net revenues rose 1% to $1.6 billion, reflecting retail segment growth that was partially offset by a decline in wholesale shipments. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange and strategic decisions to discontinue American Living and close certain stores in Greater China, revenues increased 4% in the fourth quarter. The revenue results were below the expectations we articulated in February due to unseasonably cold weather that hurt early spring merchandise sales and foreign exchange.","For the full year fiscal 2013 period, net revenues grew 1% to $6.9 billion and were up 5%, excluding the impact of the strategic decisions and foreign exchange.","Gross profit margin of 59.3% was 220 basis points greater than the prior year period. The improvement in gross profit margin is primarily attributable to lower input costs, beneficial channel and product mix and operational discipline.","Operating expenses of $792 million were in line with the prior year, as we were able to offset higher investment in our growth initiatives and approximately $15 million of impairment and restructuring charges with operating expense savings through productivity gains. Operating expense rate of 48.2% reflects 50 basis points of leverage compared to the prior year, which was better than our expectations due to disciplined expense management across the organization.","Operating income rose an impressive 33% to $182 million in the fourth quarter, and operating margin improved 270 basis points to 11.1%. Strong profit flow-through was a function of the extraordinary operational discipline of our global teams. For the full year fiscal 2013 period, operating income increased 8% to $1.1 billion, and operating margin improved 100 basis points to 16.2%. Excluding Rugby-related impairment and restructuring charges; the fiscal 2013 operating margin improved 130 basis points to 16.5%.","Net income for the fourth quarter was $127 million, 35% greater than the prior year period, and net income per diluted share increased 38% to $1.37. Excluding Rugby-related charges, net income per diluted share grew 42% to $1.41 in the fourth quarter. Higher operating income was the principal driver of the substantial increases in net income and net income per share. EPS also benefited from a lower effective tax rate of 25%, which was 300 basis points below the prior year due to a favorable discrete tax item and geographic mix. For the full year fiscal 2013 period, net income rose 10% to $750 million and net income per diluted share increased 12% to $8. Excluding Rugby-related charges, net income per diluted share grew 14% to $8.13 in fiscal '13.","Moving on to segment highlights for the quarter. Wholesale sales of $796 million were 4% below the prior year period, primarily due to the discontinuation of American Living in fiscal '13 and a proactive reduction in shipments to certain European wholesale customers. Wholesale operating income grew 16% to $175 million in the fourth quarter, and wholesale operating margin improved 380 basis points to 22%. The substantial improvement in wholesale operating margin was primarily due to higher gross profit margins as a result of lower input costs, favorable product mix and operational discipline.","Fourth quarter retail segment sales rose 7% to $804 million, supported by the contribution from new stores and e-commerce operations, and a 4% constant dollar comparable store sales increase. Sales trends continued to be strongest online and at factory stores worldwide. Despite the challenges of the overall macro environment and unseasonable weather conditions, the fourth quarter's 4% constant dollar comp growth was achieved on top of difficult multiyear comparisons and was primarily a function of improved traffic and conversion. Retail segment operating income grew an impressive 73% to $74 million in the fourth quarter, and the retail operating margin expanded 350 basis points to 9.2%. The robust improvement in retail operating income and operating margin reflects stronger profitability in all major geographies, particularly in international markets and was achieved despite higher restructuring and impairment charges and continued investment in global e-commerce development.","Licensing revenues of $43 million in the fourth quarter were in line with the prior year, as higher apparel product licensing revenues were offset by lower home product licensing revenues. Operating income for the licensing segment declined 3% to $29 million.","Consolidated inventory was up 6% at the end of the fiscal year, and we spent approximately $276 million on capital expenditures to support new retail stores, shop installations and infrastructure investments.","The company repurchased 3 million shares of its common stock during fiscal '13 at an average cost of $149, utilizing $450 million of our authorized share repurchase programs, and returned an additional $128 million to shareholders via dividend payments.","At the end of the fourth quarter, the company had $577 million available under previously authorized share repurchase programs for future buybacks, and we ended the year with approximately $1.4 billion in cash and investments.","We are very pleased with the strong fourth quarter and full year results. The prudent planning, operational management and financial discipline that characterize the company have enabled us to maximize margin opportunities and deliver double-digit earnings growth. We've achieved these results even as we've continued to make substantial reinvestments to support our longer-term growth objectives.","Now I'd like to turn to fiscal '14. As we articulated to you in February, we expect revenue growth to improve in fiscal '14 and we are planning to increase our investments in the business to support long-term shareholder value creation. Key areas of investment in fiscal '14 include accelerated retail store development, global e-commerce capabilities and upgrades to our management information systems.","With respect to retail store development, we currently plan to invest in approximately 30 new retail stores, mostly concentrated in international markets. This accelerated rate of store investment means we expect to have a substantial increase in preopening costs, particularly since our plans include a handful of large high-profile stores that are scheduled to open in the next 2 years. Among these stores are new Ralph Lauren flagship stores in Asia, as well as our first flagship store for the Polo brand in New York City.","We are in the early stages of an exciting plan to open Polo stores worldwide. Supported by more than 45 years of Ralph's extraordinary vision and commitment, Polo is one of the most recognized brands in the world. Our efforts are focused on leveraging the tremendous innovation and expertise that exists in our design and merchandising organizations to satisfy the growing global demand for our Polo and Blue Label products. We believe Polo stores will be a good compliment to the important wholesale distribution that exists today in North America and parts of Europe. They will likely become the primary platform by which the brand is distributed in certain international markets, such as Asia and parts of Latin America, where the wholesale channel is less developed.","We recently opened our first Polo store in East Hampton and we intend to open a second Polo store at the Short Hills Mall in September. We've also committed to open a 35,000-square foot flagship store on Fifth Avenue in New York City that will be a major brand statement, featuring a full assortment of Polo men's, women's and children's merchandise, as well as a restaurant. Scheduled to open in the fall of next year, we believe the flagship store will really set the stage for the broader global strategy, especially since it is located in one of the world's most popular tourist destinations. We are actively engaged in and committed to finding additional Polo locations around the world, which will be a mix of flagship stores in key gateway cities and smaller formats in appropriately-sized markets.","We also plan to increase our investment in e-commerce around the world, as the consumer is clearly choosing to shop more online. Over the last year, we've created a stronger global digital and e-commerce team to capitalize on this trend and provide a more holistic approach to managing this dynamic channel of distribution. Specific plans for fiscal '14 include a new Korean website, expanding the number of countries we can ship to in Europe and in Asia, evolving the online customer experience in existing markets and investing in expanded distribution and fulfillment capacity to support our long-term growth expectations for the channel.","With respect to infrastructure investment, the largest area of incremental investment for us will be in a globally integrated ERP system. As a reminder, during fiscal '14, we plan to convert global product procurement and our North American wholesale order-to-cash processes from legacy systems to SAP. After several months of testing, we go live with our pilot wave later this quarter. While the pilot wave only represents a small part of our consolidated revenues, it allows us to test 95% of the functionality of the new system, allowing us to mitigate risk and make any necessary adjustments before rolling out to larger businesses. Over time, we believe the SAP implementation will yield productivity improvements and procurement savings, in addition to providing the company with a stronger platform for future growth.","We expect each of these investments to deliver a rate of return that is well in excess of our cost of capital. However, for fiscal '14, they will represent a significant step-up in spending. The combined year-over-year impact of these investments is estimated to affect operating profits by approximately $75 million for the full year period.","Foreign currency exchange rates will also be a significant headwind for us in fiscal '14, both in terms of translational and transactional impact. The recent devaluation of the Japanese yen is expected to have the greatest impact. Comparing the current yen to dollar exchange rate to the average JPY 83 exchange rate we experienced in fiscal '13, the yen is down approximately 25%. To mitigate the cost impact of the yen devaluation, we instituted price increases in Japan 3 weeks ago, but those actions will not provide a complete offset to the devaluation.","For the full year period at today's rates, we expect about 150 basis points of negative currency translation on the company's top line, and that the combination of translational and transactional currency effects will negatively impact operating profit by about $75 million.","With that as backdrop, I'd like to review our initial outlook for the year, which was outlined in this morning's press release. As we've developed a plan for fiscal '14, the year can be characterized as a tale of 2 halves, with the operating margin down in the first half and up in the second half. The first half of the year is impacted by upfront expenses related to the integration of the Chaps business and Australia and New Zealand, as well as preopening costs for new stores. The second half is expected to benefit from the integration of the new businesses, as well as the new store openings.","For the first quarter of fiscal '14, we expect consolidated net revenues to increase at a low single-digit rate, with wholesale segment sales growing slightly faster than retail segment sales as a result of the Chaps integration. Foreign currency effects are estimated to negatively affect revenue growth by approximately 150 basis points in the first quarter and will have more of an impact on our retail segment given its geographic business mix.","Our operating margin for the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately 200 to 250 basis points below the prior year period, due to higher operating expenses related to the timing of investments to support the company's strategic growth objectives, the Chaps integration and the foreign exchange impact.","First quarter tax rate is estimated at 32%.","For the full year fiscal '14 period, we expect consolidated revenues to increase by 4% to 7%, which includes a 150 basis point net negative impact from foreign currency. Wholesale sales are expected to grow slightly faster than retail revenues due to the disproportionately -- disproportionate impact that currency translation has on our retail segment.","We estimate that newly transitioned operations, which include Chaps men's sportswear in Australia and New Zealand beginning in the second quarter, account for approximately 350 basis points of our consolidated revenue growth.","We expect our full year fiscal '14 operating margin to be approximately 25 to 75 basis points below fiscal 2013's record level, due to the integration of newly assumed operations, accelerated investment and strategic growth initiatives across geographies, distribution channels and infrastructure, and to the FX impacts I highlighted earlier. Excluding the impacts of the incremental investment and the company's strategic growth initiatives and foreign exchange, underlying operating income growth would be up low double digits for the year.","Our fiscal 2014 tax rate is expected to be 31%. The higher level of investment that's flowing through the P&L is also reflected in our capital spending plans. We are planning approximately $350 million to $450 million in capital expenditures in fiscal '14, primarily to support our global direct-to-customer and infrastructure investments. Approximately 75% of our capital is allocated for our global direct-to-customer activities, including new store investments and the expansion of our dedicated distribution and fulfillment center for our North American e-commerce operations.","Our commitment to investing in our strategic growth initiatives and infrastructure is clear, as is our expectation for return on capital. We are excited about what we believe we can achieve over the next several years as we continue to focus our capital and managerial resources on the most compelling long-term opportunities.","At this point, we'd like to open up the call for your questions. Operator, can you assist us with that, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from Omar Saad with ISI Group.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Hoping to focus a little bit on the revenue line in the quarter. I know you guys had guided to something like a mid-single-digit increase in the fourth quarter. Obviously, it came in a little bit below that. I assume the yen was part of the factor there. Could you talk through some of the other factors that led to the slight revenue disappointment? Are there macro things going on out there? Is it weather related? Is it broad-based? Is it focused in certain areas? And then as you think about the guidance -- the revenue guidance and the top line kind of profile for this company for '14 and above, where do you think the kind of key factors are and the opportunities, or do you still see just a kind of very broad-based growth across geographies and categories and channels?","Christopher H. Peterson","Okay, I'll -- thanks, Omar. Let me start with the revenue underperformance versus our guidance. So when we provided the guidance at the beginning of February, we were coming off a month of January where we had a very strong revenue growth, and we were expecting February and March to be somewhat comparable conditions to the prior year. There were really 2 things that happened during the months of February and March that led to the revenue being slightly below our previous guidance. The first was we had an incredible weather pattern this year, with much colder conditions in both North America and Europe, as well as Northeast Asia, that led to a tough February and March for seasonal spring product. The second was, to your point, on foreign exchange was foreign exchange. The yen continued to devalue during the quarter and Japan, for perspective, is our second largest country from a revenue standpoint. So those were really the 2 factors that drove the revenue versus guidance in the quarter.","Roger N. Farah","I'll take the second part. So Omar, in terms of the go forward, I think we would identify the following as the key growth engines that would provide the distortion. Obviously, e-commerce and retail, we've talked about it, others have, customers making a clear choice to shop online, whether that's through our wholesale partners where we're experiencing strong growth with our wholesale partners online or whether it's in our own direct-to-consumer, whether it's Ralph Lauren or Club Monaco. We've seen an extraordinary response to the Club Monaco website in the first 9 months it's been open. And so on and on and on around the world, the customer is indicating to us they're comfortable shopping or getting product information, buying in the stores. And a lot of that interest is shifting to mobile. So the growth in mobile that you're seeing in the industry in general continues for us. I would say, the other headline is the Asia Pac region, with all the puts and takes, should provide distorted growth over the next couple of years. The bolt-on of Australia is relatively small, but it completes the region for us in terms of owned territories plugged into our shared service hub network through a lot of the infrastructure. I think it will be a nice positive addition. And then I think the new product categories that we danced through quickly in the script that we brought back in-house over the last 3 or 4 years, that have gone through some form of rehab, are now beginning to show their future potential, whether it's Denim & Supply, which Jacki talked about, or some of the accessory categories, or even some of the changes we've made in the Home business. And we think those will provide future growth. I think we're viewing Europe cautiously. The trends there continue, with strength in the northern part of Europe and then softer in the southern part. I think our team did an outstanding job managing through that to deliver a top line and even a better bottom line performance in the year. But I think we're planning that a little more cautiously going forward.","Operator","And next, we'll move on to Kate McShane with Citi Research.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","In your guidance, you highlighted it was a tale of 2 halves with the operating margin. However, can you give a little bit more detail around the cadence of spend throughout the year, and how we should think about gross margins for the year as well?","Christopher H. Peterson","Yes. So I think on that, I would say the investments in the strategic growth initiatives are really going to be spread relatively evenly throughout the year. But if you look at the licensed businesses that we're taking back in Chaps, in Australia and New Zealand, we're spending a disproportionate amount of money transitioning those businesses to be wholly owned in the first half of the year and we expect them to be significantly more profitable in the second half of the year. We also -- FX is relatively evenly spread throughout the period. And so I think it's really a function of the take back of the licensed businesses that result in the operating margin improvement in the back half versus the front half.","Roger N. Farah","I guess the other thing I would add to what Chris said is that there are certain subjects like the Fifth Avenue store that we've talked about that we're planning to open next fall, September or October, that are very expensive and carry a lot of rent and we'll be carrying that for over a year without the benefit of any sales. So there are some of these big projects in Asia, here in New York on Fifth Avenue, that we think are extraordinary opportunities for us long term, will establish the brand, Asia will be Ralph Lauren, here will be Polo, and there's a cost of carrying those for 12 months until they come online with sales. So that's feathered in. I remember this time last year, we talked about fiscal '13 being a tale of 2 halves and I think there was some concern that we had anticipated more of the profit to come in the back half of the year. We're pleased to have delivered on that. And for different reasons, we're facing a similar situation, as really our profit profile is being rebalanced more to a 50\/50 split than what it had been for many years, which was a heavier orientation on first and second quarter and a little bit lighter in the third and fourth quarter. Some of that's also coming from the growing retail business, where we get some distortion in the back half of the year versus the first half.","Operator","Next, we'll move to Liz Dunn with Macquarie.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","I guess my question was regarding the Polo stores. Can you [indiscernible]","Operator","Yes, we'll move on to the next question. Ms. Dunn, your line, they cannot hear you. We'll move to Christian Buss with Credit Suisse.","Christian Buss - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was wondering if you could provide some perspective on what's embedded in your expectations for the European business for fiscal '14. And if you could provide some color on when we start lapping the distribution closures or some of the trimming of distribution.","Christopher H. Peterson","Sure. So I think, as Roger mentioned in the prepared remarks, the underlying business in Europe this year was up low single digits on a comparable basis. We're expecting that to actually accelerate a little bit as we get into next year, from low single digits to a little bit faster than that, mid-single digits type of range. Part of the reason for that is because we have a plan to enter some of the under-penetrated geographies of Central and Eastern Europe and the Middle East that we expect to contribute to the sales. Relative to the proactive reduction in shipments that we've made in the wholesale channel in Southern Europe, which you saw generate strong profit results in the European numbers that we just reported, we'll largely be through that from an annualization standpoint after the end of this first quarter of fiscal '14. So when we get to the second quarter, we feel like we will have appropriately rebased that business.","Operator","Next we'll move to David Glick with Buckingham Research Group.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Just 2 questions. One, Chris, if you could help us understand what the constant currency direct-to-consumer comp guidance is for FY '14. And then secondly, Roger, any early learnings from your new store openings in China? And it sounds like you're potentially accelerating some of those openings, talking about a flagship, which obviously is an important investment and presence for you in China. So some of your early learnings and the pace of expansion in China.","Christopher H. Peterson","Yes, I guess we've shied away from giving, as I mentioned, I think, on the last call or the call before, constant currency comp guidance. But what I would point you to on the first question is our guidance for the year is 4% to 7% revenue growth. Within that, there's 150 basis points of negative foreign exchange. So that would get you to 5.5% to 8.5% sort of all-in growth. And included in that is this 350 basis point improvement from the result of the Chaps and Australia business. So I think you can sort of back into the range that we're shooting for, for the year, which is sort of an underlying growth rate in the mid-single digits type of range.","Roger N. Farah","And I would respond to the second part of your question as follows. We've had a very interesting year learning about the Chinese consumer. And while the first profile is how do they perform in China, they're obviously a big part of the shopping trends in Korea, other parts of Southeast Asia, Europe and the United States. So we're learning about that customer through the really global footprint we have. But fundamentally, and I think Jacki touched on this, the best products sell worldwide. And so with our orientation towards apparel, we have to be mindful of the geographic and climate range in China. The northern part of China is almost similar to the coast of Maine in terms of its weather and it goes all the way down...","Operator","[Technical Difficulty]","Mr. Hurley, please go ahead.","Roger N. Farah","In case nobody heard it, we were up 42% in EPS. I don't know if that got through. Maybe I'll start again. I was talking about China. I'll quickly summarize. We've learned a lot about the Chinese business. We've gotten a lot of feedback from the customers both in China, in Southeast Asia, in Europe and the United States. The good news is they are gravitating towards the same looks and categories and items. They clearly want luxury. We've created some unique products that respond to that market and they've really bought that well. And so every day, we're learning. We know we have a long way to go to tell the Ralph Lauren story in that market. We are investing and committing to key flagships, but in the key cities. I think one of the things we'll try to avoid is chasing the second- and third-tier cities too early on in our development of that market. I think we have to be important in Hong Kong, in Beijing, in Shanghai and some of the key markets before we start going out to the second- and third-tier cities. I also expanded my answer to include Denim & Supply, and in fact, the Polo stores. Because while we're in the early stages there, we think those are key high growth, brand-specific, high-margin stores. And the early reads on a more classified approach in East Hampton has been very strong, with color multipliers selling. Denim & Supply stores that we've opened internationally, about a dozen, 1, and today, 2 in the U.S. are really selling denim. And the key to that customer is getting a fit on the denim bottoms that resonates with them and then you can build the top business. The early trends there are reflecting a 30% penetration of denim bottoms, which is very high in that world. So I think the direct-to-customer business, whether it's flagships in Asia or more classified smaller locations, we're beginning to feel confident about the path we're on.","Operator","Next, we'll move to Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffrey.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I appreciate the detail, Chris, on kind of the key investment areas for this year. I wanted to focus just on the SAP in the second phase. So I appreciate the kind of key detail on the investments for the year, and I wanted to focus on the second phase of the SAP implementation. I guess, just given the global complexity of your business model, once this phase has been tested and implemented, could you just maybe provide a little more context on some of the key applications of this kind of second phase of this system, and how we should think about kind of the meaningful margin leverage going forward in the model as we kind of exit fiscal '14 and get into fiscal '15?","Christopher H. Peterson","Sure. So the phase of the SAP implementation that we're in right now really focuses on the global product procurement and the North America wholesale order-to-cash, which is a significant part of our global systems infrastructure. And as background, just to step back, because in the history of the company, the company started by licensing a lot of the geographies and a lot of the product categories, as the company brought those businesses back in, those businesses came back in with each on a different legacy system. And so the company's starting point from a systems infrastructure is a large number of systems that are not integrated and not as connected as they could be. And so we believe the implementation of SAP will allow us to get to an integrated global system that will drive significant productivity because, for example, we'll be able to put in a style once and that style will be consistent around the world, whereas today we have to do that multiple times around the world with multiple different codings and with manual interfaces from one system to the next. That process will all become automated. The second thing is that we'll increase our visibility to data. So today, where it's very difficult to understand, for example, how many of a specific item we're selling around the world, once we get to common nomenclature and common system, that will become much easier and we believe we will be able to leverage that information to drive procurement savings. The other point I would make on this is that, because it's a fairly significant endeavor, we've broken up the implementation into 3 waves because we didn't want to go with an approach where we tried to implement everything at once. And so the first wave, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, will be a wave that tests the majority of the functionality, but on a limited percent of the revenue from a branding standpoint. And then we'll go to a second wave and a third wave. We expect most of this implementation to be completed during fiscal '14, and we expect the benefits to start to really kick in starting in fiscal '15.","Operator","And our last question, we'll hear from Barbara Wyckoff with CLSA.","Barbara Wyckoff - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I guess, for Roger and Jacki, can you talk about efforts to modernize the Blue Label in Lauren? Women's product, obviously, staying within the brand aesthetic. And then secondly, can you talk about your plans to accelerate growth and penetration of key accessories? I know it's been growing, but there've been -- such categories as handbags and footwear have been so strong across the industry, how are you going to be accelerating that growth?","Jackwyn L. Nemerov","We've put a lot of focus on the development and the continued modernization of our Lauren brand. And we've had a very successful fall holiday season, followed by what is a great beginning of spring into summer. Whereas the women's business, over the last few years, had been very challenging, we are finding over this past year, with a lot of increased efforts from our design team to excite the customer and from our merchandising team to focus on the right strength of the line and the presentation of products, as I said, the results of that have been fantastic. In the most recent NPD, of course, Lauren stands ahead. We're 12% above plan, against last year, for the season. And the results of that keep us in that #1 position, distanced way above our competition. We have then, as we have the focus of our Lauren brand, we have a Lauren footwear and accessories business that we see very, very nice momentum in. And then of course, our luxury accessory business is also moving along nicely. We have our leather goods business there, our shoe business. And as the penetration to our company, we're moving into the mid- to high single-digit range at this point in our revenues. It's a higher percentage of our business in the Ralph Lauren stores, where we have beautiful and dedicated space to present our merchandise. And certainly, our longer-term growth plans and goals for accessories is for it to be a more substantial part of our business over time. We have introduced a bag, which we called the Soft Ricky and it's a new interpretation of our most iconic bag and it's been very strong worldwide. And we're in the middle of a big rollout for that bag, which we believe will have tremendous results within the fall season. And as you know, the accessory business tends to be an item business. Focused on the centerpiece of the Ricky, we believe we can develop a very strong accessory business with that as our centerpiece going forward.","Roger N. Farah","Okay. With that, I'll thank you, all, for your listening and your patience with the audio communication. Appreciate your support.

Welcome to the Ralph Lauren's Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. James Hurley. Please go ahead.","James Hurley","Good morning. Thank you for joining us on Ralph Lauren's Second Quarter Fiscal 2014 Conference Call. The agenda for this morning's call includes Jacki Nemerov, our President and Chief Operating Officer, who will comment on our broader strategic initiatives and provide some merchandising highlights from the quarter; Chris Peterson, our Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer, will provide operational and financial perspective on the second quarter, in addition to reviewing our outlook for the balance of fiscal '14. After the company's prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions, which we ask that you please limit to one per caller.","During today's call, we will be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including our financial outlook. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees and our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Our expectations contain many risks and uncertainties. The principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from our current expectations are detailed in our SEC filings.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jacki.","Jackwyn L. Nemerov","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Since this is the first call Chris and I are hosting in our new roles, let me take this opportunity to talk about the recent change in our organizational structure. As most of you are aware, we've created the Office of the Chairman that includes Ralph Lauren, our Founder, Chairman and CEO; Roger Farah, now our Executive Vice Chairman; myself as President and Chief Operating Officer; and Chris Peterson, Executive Vice President, Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer.","The Office of the Chairman is a leadership structure designed to enhance the company's ability to support the growth of our business in an increasingly complex global environment and to allow us to capitalize on new opportunities that will drive the evolution of the company in the coming years. This new leadership team has a remarkable combination of tremendous and highly relevant experience starting, of course, with Ralph's unmatched vision, creativity and excitement about the future, and extending to this team's product and merchandising experience, operational discipline, global perspective and track record of leadership.","Roger and I have worked both so closely with Ralph over the past 13 and 9 years, respectively, and Chris brings us all a fresh perspective, as well as his financial acumen and global operational sophistication. This collaborative structure will enable us to translate Ralph's extraordinary vision for the company into focused growth and long-term success. It is important to clarify that this new structure is intended to sharpen and deliver against, rather than change the company's strategic focus.","Chris and I have spent much of the last 2 months meeting with our new team and visiting our offices and points of distribution around the world. We've come back from our travels so impressed by the exceptional talent that runs throughout our entire organization. There is no question that we have the right people with the knowledge, experience and passion to help us take this company to the next level.","The diversity of the Ralph Lauren portfolio, the strength of our lifestyle positioning and our increasingly global reach are enviable assets that position us for strong long-term growth. As a leadership team, we are very excited about our future.","And now shifting gears to the strategy. I'd like to spend some time today reviewing the 3 core pillars of our growth plans, which are building our international presence, extending our direct-to-consumer reach and investing in merchandise innovation. Let me take each of those in turn.","First, the expansion of our international presence. We've articulated a goal of having the Americas, Europe and Asia, each represent 1\/3 of our revenue. Today, the Americas represents approximately 2\/3, Europe accounts for about 20% and Asia is a low double-digit percentage at this point. Over the last 10 years, we've made excellent progress on growing our global reach. International revenues have gained about 1,300 basis points of share in our consolidated revenue mix. The outlook for global growth is equally compelling as we focus on additional market share gains in existing markets and explore high-potential emerging territories, such as Greater China and Central and Eastern Europe. We're developing each market with the optimal mix of retail, wholesale and licensed distribution in order to maximize our opportunities.","We'll support our global growth aspirations with world-class merchandising and marketing strategies that have always been both a defining characteristic of the Ralph Lauren brand, and an integral component of the company's success. Our recently created global merchandising organization is off to a strong start already, addressing local market needs across all channels of distribution, while simultaneously driving greater consistency across our assortments worldwide. We expect this consistency to deliver several benefits over the long term, including better leverage on our global sourcing, manufacturing and marketing efforts.","Extending our direct-to-consumer reach is our second core strategic pillar. Today, our direct-to-consumer activities encompass a broad range of global retail formats, both physical and digital. Our physical Ralph Lauren, RRL, Denim & Supply, factory and Club Monaco stores, as well as our concession shops and licensed stores in Europe and Asia, showcase our brand messages and product assortment. And of course, we are excited about the launch of our Polo store on Fifth Avenue in the fall of next year, which will offer a beautiful assortment of men's and women's apparel and accessories and a restaurant. We believe that Polo stores are a compelling new way for us to leverage the powerful global appeal of our most iconic brand.","On the digital front, e-commerce is another critical component of further extending our direct-to-consumer reach. This has been our fastest-growing distribution channel over the last several years, and we expect the momentum to continue as the consumer continues to respond to the convenience, selection and pre-shopping research capabilities of the online space.","Because of the ongoing importance of these online stores, there has been an area of significant investment for us. During the second quarter, we opened a greatly expanded distribution center for our North American e-commerce operations, launched e-commerce in South Korea and are now transacting online in 10 European countries. We've invested over $1 billion in capital in our global retail development over the last 10 years, which has led to strong retail segment operating profit improvement in that same time frame. Looking to the future, we expect a growing portion of our capital will be allocated to our direct-to-consumer efforts, particularly as we see the worldwide appeal of our brand. We are simultaneously investing in the people and processes that will enable us to accelerate this growth over the next several years.","The third core pillar is merchandise innovation. As you heard me say before, our products are the hallmark of our brand and the lifeblood of our business, and our ability to consistently deliver innovative products is one of our most powerful competitive advantages. The combination of Ralph's vision and the investment we've made in our world-class design, merchandising, sourcing and production talent is unmatched. The bandwidth of the Ralph Lauren brand and the desirability of our products have fueled strong multi-year growth. Consistent innovation has enabled us to intensify our leadership position in core merchandise categories and establish both excitement and credibility with new brands and product categories, such as Denim & Supply, our handbag business, footwear, watches and fine jewelry.","Ralph has always believed in the combination of the finest quality, the most aspirational appeal and the most enduring value. Our women's Collection, men's Purple Label, luxury accessories and Ralph Lauren watches and fine jewelry lines are the purest expression of his vision. The intricacy of design and quality of materials from hand-beaded Collection gowns or a bespoke Purple Label suit to a crocodile Ricky handbag or our tourbillon movement watch, are now appreciated by our customers who recognize the craftsmanship behind these extraordinary luxury products. The magnificent store environments and global advertising, marketing and PR efforts, bring Ralph's spectacular world to life and establish the halo for our entire product portfolio.","Our recent Paris fashion show, in support of the company's contribution to the restoration of L'\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts is the most recent example of our world-class brand coming to life in a unique and highly impactful way. And for those of you who may have missed it, I encourage you to visit RalphLauren.com to view the dog walk. The first runway show for dogs that was both an interesting way to showcase our fall Luxury Accessories Collection and a successful philanthropic effort for the ASPCA. This global effort has already drawn a tremendous editorial and social media attention around the world, with close to 140 million impressions today in broadcast, print and online, and over 10 million social media impressions globally.","While sell-throughs for our entire product portfolio have been strong across most of our major distribution channels and geographic regions in the first half of the year, performance of our Luxury products was particularly noteworthy during the second quarter. The introduction of new products, such as the Steel Link Stirrup watch, the Safari watch and the soft Ricky Bag, each of which draws inspiration from our extraordinary design vocabulary and are quintessentially Ralph Lauren, have been extremely successful.","Accessories will continue to be the main focus of our global merchandising, advertising and marketing efforts over the next several months. This fall, we had an impactful pop-up shop presentation for the soft Ricky in key wholesale locations around the world, from Harrods in London and colette in Paris to Saks Fifth Avenue in New York City. Our upcoming holiday campaign builds upon this momentum with a fully integrated product focus message behind our newest accessories icon that will be consistent across all key consumer touch points. If the women in your life does not already have a soft Ricky, we can't think of a better holiday gift.","Our results for the first 6 months of fiscal '14 continue to demonstrate the strength and resilience of our diversified operating model. In the face of an uneven global operating environment, we plan the business prudently and experience solid results in our largest markets, even as we continue to make significant investment in the infrastructure necessary to support our long-term growth objectives.","As many of you know, we have consistently made outsized, near-term investments with an expectation of achieving greater functional and financial leverage down the road, as high-growth channels, regions and merchandise categories evolve into the future. The consistency of this approach has allowed us to deliver strong shareholder returns over the last 3-, 5- and 10-year periods.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Chris.","Christopher H. Peterson","Thank you, Jacki, and good morning, everyone. The second quarter sales and profits we're reporting today are in line with the expectations we provided in August, and I'd like to start with a recap of the quarter.","Consolidated sales grew 3% in the second quarter, which was at the high end of our expectations. Excluding the impacts of discontinued businesses and unfavorable foreign currency translation, revenues were 4% higher than the prior year period. Growth in the Americas, Europe and most of Asia was partially offset by lower sales in Japan.","Global sales trends were uneven during the quarter. July and August were slower as we cycled out of the more promotional spring\/summer season, and trends were stronger in September as we transitioned into fall. Footsteps to brick-and-mortar stores remained challenging worldwide, although we continued to experience robust growth on the various online platforms where our product is distributed.","Gross profit margin of 56.6% for the second quarter of fiscal 2014 was 220 basis points below the prior year period, primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency dynamics, the mix impact from integrating the Chaps men's sportswear business and lower profits from concession shops.","Operating expenses of $789 million in the second quarter were 6% greater than the prior year period. The higher operating expenses primarily reflect cost associated with newly transitioned operations and continued investment in the company's strategic growth initiatives. The growth in operating expenses was partially offset by disciplined operational management. Operating expense rate of 41.2% was 110 basis points above the second quarter of fiscal 2013.","Operating income was $295 million and operating margin was 15.4%, 330 basis points below the second quarter of fiscal 2013. Operating margin was in line with the guidance we provided in August.","Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2014 was $205 million, 4% below the $214 million achieved in the comparable period of fiscal 2013, and net income per diluted share declined 3% to $2.23. An effective tax rate of 29% in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 includes the benefit of restructuring certain international operations and compares to 38% in the prior year period, which included the net negative impact of a onetime discrete tax item.","Moving on to segment level details. Wholesale revenues grew 1% to $928 million in the second quarter, primarily a result of the contribution from the newly transitioned Chaps men's sportswear operations and continued growth in core North American merchandise categories, which continue to gain market share. A planned reduction in shipments to certain European customers, lower Japanese wholesale sales and a shift in the timing of certain wholesale shipments due to SAP implementation, partially mitigated wholesale revenue growth during the quarter. Wholesale operating income of $202 million was 13% below the prior year period due to the foreign exchange dynamics and lower international wholesale sales.","Retail segment sales rose 5% to $944 million in the second quarter, reflecting the incremental contribution from new stores, including the recently transitioned Australia\/New Zealand operations, and growth for the company's e-commerce operations. Excluding the impacts of discontinued businesses and foreign currency, retail sales increased 8% from the prior year.","Consolidated comparable store sales declined 1% on a reported basis and were up 1% in constant currency during the second quarter, on top of challenging multi-year comparisons. Positive comp growth of freestanding stores and e-commerce operations was more than offset by negative comp growth at Japanese concession shops.","With the exception of e-commerce, customer traffic trends were soft across most retail formats during the quarter. However, the teams continue to mitigate lower traffic levels with exceptional customer service efforts that have contributed to improved conversion and higher average dollar transactions at most of our retail formats worldwide.","Retail operating income of $135 million was 14% below the prior year period, primarily due to investments in the company's global store and e-commerce development efforts, foreign currency effects and lower profitability at concession shops.","Licensing revenues of $43 million were 6% below the prior year period due to lower Chaps licensing revenues as a result of the men's sportswear license take-back. Licensing operating income of $35 million was in line with the prior year period.","Consolidated inventory of $1.2 billion at the end of the quarter compares to $1.1 billion in the prior year, reflecting the integration of formerly licensed operations as directly operated businesses, investment to support anticipated sales growth and the accelerated receipt of inventory related to the SAP implementation. We spent approximately $148 million on capital expenditures to support infrastructure investments in new retail stores and shop installations.","The company repurchased about 285,000 shares of its common stock during the second quarter at an average cost of approximately $176. $427 million remains available under previously authorized share repurchase programs for future buybacks.","We ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in cash and investments. Included in our cash balance is $300 million of new bonds that we issued at the end of September. The proceeds from that offering were used to repay the euro bonds that matured in early October, which is why our consolidated cash and investments increased versus the prior year. Our net cash balance of approximately $835 million is essentially the same.","Now I'd like to turn to some important developments on our strategic growth initiatives. We made excellent progress on our SAP implementation during the quarter. At the end of September, we successfully completed a major conversion of our systems platform from legacy systems to SAP. This latest wave represented about 1\/2 of our North America wholesale business. We successfully converted millions of pieces of data, including materials, purchase orders, sales orders and inventory records with accuracy rates in excess of 99.9%.","We went live on the new system in early October and quickly got to full operational capability. We'd like to thank the team for their extraordinary efforts and acknowledge the great partnership of our wholesale customers as we've executed this important project.","With a series of successful codeovers [ph] behind us, we are confident in our approach to the conversions and are well on track to realize the benefits of SAP over the next several years. These benefits include more ready access to information, cost leverage through procurement savings and gross margin leverage through global merchandising.","We also completed the integration of our Chaps men's sportswear operations during the quarter, and that business is now fully on Ralph Lauren systems and supply chain. The take-back of our Australia\/New Zealand operations was also executed seamlessly, and that business is also fully operational on Ralph Lauren systems and supply chain. The successful SAP conversion and smooth integrations of formerly licensed operations were achieved while managing complex day-to-day operations and are great examples of the company's ability to execute with excellence.","The foundational work that we've done in the first 6 months of the year is expected to be a critical enabler of our long-term sales and profit growth. We are pleased to be delivering highly resilient profitability in the context of these substantial investments, particularly with the global operating environment characterized by considerable political instability and fragile consumer confidence. As you will recall, fiscal 2014 was planned with increased investments in retail store and e-commerce development worldwide, the transition of certain formerly licensed products in-region to directly controlled operations and upgrades to our management information systems.","Now let me turn to our expectations for the balance of the year. Based on the timing of our specific projects, we've characterized fiscal 2014 as a tale of 2 halves, with modest sales growth and outsized investment spending in the first half of the year, transitioning to accelerated revenue and profit growth in the second half of the year. Our year-to-date results have materialized exactly as we expected, and I want to provide some insight into why we are confident in the accelerated growth we anticipate for the back half of the year.","There are 3 key drivers supporting our revenue outlook. First, we have good visibility in our wholesale orders for the balance of the year, and we expect them to be significantly stronger in the back half. Second, we anticipate greater contribution from new stores worldwide, including a larger benefit from the transition of our Australia and New Zealand operations to directly owned. Finally, we've seen strong customer reaction to our fall assortments in both our wholesale and retail channels.","With that as backdrop, I'd like to review the outlook we provided in this morning's press release. For the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we expect consolidated revenues to increase by 8% to 10% with wholesale segment sales growing faster than retail segment sales. Foreign currency is estimated to negatively impact revenue growth by approximately 100 basis points in the third quarter, and will primarily affect our retail segment given its geographic business mix.","Discontinued businesses are estimated to mitigate third quarter sales growth by an additional 100 basis points. Operating margin for the third quarter is expected to be approximately equal to the prior year's 16.5%, as a lower gross margin is essentially offset by operating expense leverage. The third quarter tax rate is estimated at 30%.","For the full year fiscal 2014 period, we are raising our revenue expectations to 5% to 7% growth, which is toward the high end of our previous range of 4% to 7%. Our revenue outlook includes an approximate 200 basis point negative impact from foreign currency effects and headwinds from discontinued operations. Adjusting for those factors, we expect to achieve high-single-digit revenue growth for the full fiscal year period.","Based on the momentum we are currently experiencing and the growth we have planned for the remainder of the year, we have decided to intensify our investment in our global retail operations in the second half of fiscal 2014. This investment includes incremental spending on store operations and for our omni-channel efforts, in addition to more advertising and marketing spending. As a result, we currently expect our full year fiscal 2014 operating margin to be at the low end of our outlook, which called for a 25 to 75 basis point decline from the prior year's 16.2%, which was a record level for us.","As a reminder, the year-over-year contraction in the operating margin outlook primarily reflects the integration of newly assumed operations, accelerated investments in our various our strategic growth initiatives and foreign exchange impacts. Without that pressure, operating income growth would be up low-double digits for the year. The fiscal 2014 tax rate is now estimated at 30%, down from the previous 31%, based on the favorable impact of restructuring certain international operations.","We are one of the world's strongest and most admired brands and we are highly profitable and we have a strong balance sheet. The leadership team is excited about the clear and compelling growth trajectory ahead of us. Fiscal 2014 is a year of important investment for the company. We are allocating talent and capital to our most compelling, high-return opportunities and we intend to continue operating the business according to the clearly defined strategies and disciplined execution that are the hallmarks of the organization.","Our expectation for accelerated sales momentum in the second half of the year is a testament to the growing desirability of the Ralph Lauren brand across an expanding range of merchandise categories and on an increasingly global platform. Improved sales growth is expected to be matched with even stronger profit expansion as we leverage the investments we are making in the business.","We are confident that the strategic decisions and investments we are making will support substantial shareholder value creation over the long term. The board's decision to raise the quarterly cash dividend by 12.5%, demonstrates its conviction in the company's operating strategies and growth prospects.","Now we'd like to open the call for your questions. Operator, can you assist us with that?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Omar Saad with ISI Group.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Jacki and Chris, congratulations on your new roles and in your first kind of conference call with your new responsibilities. I'd love to hear your take on the Polo store opportunity. I know it's still early. The flagship on Fifth Avenue doesn't open for a while, but I'd love to hear your vision for what it will look like, what kind of categories, price points, any sub-brands, the kids or RLX, kind of the long-term potential for that business. It seems to me that kind of Blue Label category has been mostly a wholesale business, historically, and the distribution expansion has been limited. And how do you view this opportunity as a way to take that kind of the heart of the brand there and expand it globally, and will there be any impact on your wholesale business?","Jackwyn L. Nemerov","Excited to talk about this opportunity. As you know, you're absolutely right. The Polo store opportunity is a core strategy for us going forward. We opened our first Polo store, actually, in East Hampton this summer and met with outstanding results. Followed that, last month with an opening in the Short Hills Mall, the new Polo concept, primarily men's Polo. And in this case, women's Blue Label as over the next year we'll be transitioning to a new defined line called Polo Women's. That line will open in concert with our Fifth Avenue opening next fall, and we're very excited about that. So the categories will be men's and women's apparel. Our price points in women's, as you know our price points in men's, will be very consistent with our men's price points. So aspirational, exciting product but affordable and democratic in its reach and its audience. Our intention is to expand this concept globally and we already have a site planned and located in London, and are very excited about that location, as it is highly visible and heavy traffic. So we're really working hard on the new women's Blue Label line. It will be distributed for retail and wholesale. We're currently in conversations with our wholesale customers over new points of location within their stores, and we have met with a lot of excitement. That line will open over the next couple of months and it might be an opportunity to invite everyone to the showroom to see our new launch of Polo Women's, which we're obviously quite excited about.","Christopher H. Peterson","Omar, the only thing I would add is that, certainly, we see the Polo store rollout as a key plank in the company's growth strategy over the next 3 to 5 years. And we're looking very actively at real estate locations in the U.S., in Europe and in Asia to rollout the Polo brand. And I think your observation is correct which is, today, the Polo brand is largely distributed in wholesale, and we think we've got an opportunity to expand the distribution of the Polo brand given the strength of the brand and the desirability of the brand through a direct retail store rollout.","Operator","The next question comes from Kate McShane with Citi Research.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","My question is around the incremental investment that you highlighted today. I wondered if you could tell us a little bit more about where you're allocating that spend. Is it more towards Europe and Asia or is it more evenly distributed? And then how should we think about -- I know it's a little early, but how should we think about how this success towards fiscal year '15? Are you bringing any spend forward because of what you announced today and how does that impact spend for next year?","Christopher H. Peterson","Sure. Well, first of all, with regard to the incremental investment, I would say that the incremental investment is really focused on 3 areas. The first is we're intensifying our investment in store operations. The second is we're focused on investing more money in some of our omni-channel capability that's directed against the retail segment. And the third is some of our marketing and advertising spend, where we're intensifying investment, based on some of the strong results that we've seen to date from the consumer response to a couple of our marketing campaigns, which I'll talk in a minute about -- I'll talk in a minute more about. We believe that this incremental investment is going to result in improved traffic trends and conversion for our retail stores going forward. And that's part of the reason why we're taking our revenue guidance up for the balance of the fiscal year versus our initial outlook. A couple of the examples on the marketing spend, just to give you a flavor, the first is we've -- for the first time, really, across the company, globally, come out with an advertising campaign around the Ricky handbag, the soft Ricky product, and we've coordinated that as a big idea where we've got it holistically supported in every market in the world. We have the product in our stores and we've -- are doing a holistic marketing and advertising campaign that's really hitting the consumer across multiple touch points. And we started to see that really resonate and drive an acceleration in our accessories business. And given the holiday season that's upcoming, we felt like that was a good one to continue to support and spend money behind going forward. The other one that you may have seen is, we have the Olympics that the company sponsors, which is coming up in Sochi in February. And we put a fairly significant effort behind an advertising campaign around Made in America, where the product that we're going to be rolling out for the Olympics will be made in America and we put an intense sort of advertising campaign and PR campaign around that product. So those are a couple of examples of where we're spending the money, and we're expecting to see a good return from the incremental investment that we see. With regard to fiscal '15, well, it's a little bit early for us to provide guidance on fiscal '15, we're just about to kick off our planning process. I suspect we'll have some initial thoughts to share on our next earnings call with regard to fiscal '15, and then we'll provide guidance for fiscal '15 as we always do at our end of fiscal year call.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Two questions. First, Chris, obviously, the noise on gross margins has been significant this year. I know you just said you're not -- we're not looking ahead to fiscal '15 yet. But as we think out about -- as we think past fiscal '14, how should we look at the gross margins? How much of that do you think you could start to recapture and maybe where will it come from? So when did the Chaps margin start to improve and when does the mix shift benefits you guys have start to override the current headwinds? And then secondly, can you talk a little bit more about Europe trends with the 2 businesses, where we're at on wholesale, and is that on track to still return to positive growth by spring?","Christopher H. Peterson","Sure. So on gross margin, I'd say a couple of things. So the first is, if you look at the gross margin in the second quarter, the biggest driver of the gross margin decline in the second quarter was foreign exchange. That accounted for about 1\/2 of the gross margin decline in the quarter. The second big driver in gross margin decline was the take-back of the Chaps men's sportswear business which, of course, goes from a license business, which has a very, very high gross margin, to a directly-operated business, which has a lower gross margin. So if you were to strip out those 2 elements, the gross margin this year was actually not down nearly as much as what the reported numbers would be. To your point on where we go going forward, I do think that we believe that gross margin can grow over the next 3 to 5 years versus where we are today, and there's a couple of reasons for that. I think as the business shifts more from a wholesale business to a retail business, that tends to have a positive mix effect on gross margin because, obviously, our gross margins in our retail business are higher than our gross margins in our wholesale business. The second thing I would say is that as our business shifts to stronger growth internationally, that international growth tends to come with higher gross margins because of the price points, particularly in Asia, tend to be higher with higher gross margins than they are in the core U.S. business. And then the third thing I would say is, some of the product categories that we're focused on, particularly the accessories product category, as that business continues to grow faster than the balance of the merchandise categories, can have a positive gross margin mix effect. So I think we're dealing with a couple of isolated events this year. But I think over our planning horizon, over the next 3 to 5 years, we expect some of the broader mix drivers to begin to take hold. And then on Europe, I would say on Europe that -- we were fairly encouraged in the quarter on Europe. And the reason we're fairly encouraged that the quarter on Europe is because about half of our business in Europe is wholesale now and about half of our business is retail. The retail including both our full-priced stores, our e-commerce business and our outlet business. And if you look within the European revenue results, what you would see is that our retail business in Europe in the second quarter was up double digits on revenue. And our wholesale business, we had planned to be down in the quarter, which largely offset the retail growth during the quarter, because we had proactively pulled back on shipments into the wholesale channel as we wanted to reduce our exposure from an inventory standpoint from some of the specialty stores, particularly in Southern Europe. As we look to the back half of the year, we're expecting the wholesale business in Europe, in the back half of the year, to be up versus year ago. So we now think that we have cycled through that planned pullback in shipments into the European wholesale channel.","Operator","The next question comes from David Glick with Buckingham Research Group.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","A question on capital allocation and leverage. You announced a nice increase in the dividend today. It does appear you have excess cash balance and certainly some balance sheet capacity to borrow. You just refinanced one of your issues. And some of the feedback we got from investors is that there's potential to more meaningfully increase the dividend, more meaningfully increase share buybacks. As someone relatively new to the team, is that one of your strategies to be more aggressive in utilizing the balance sheet and returning more cash to shareholders?","Christopher H. Peterson","Yes. I would say a couple of things. In fact, we just had discussion on the capital structure with the board earlier this week. But I would say, our strategy on capital is, first and foremost, we want to make sure that we're fully funding investments into the organic growth of the business going forward, and that will always be our sort of top priority. Beyond that, we believe the company is going to generate excess cash that we intend to return to shareholders. And I think that the decision by the board to increase the dividend this quarter is a reflection of that fact that we are committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. I don't think that we have a strategy of trying to hold excess cash on our balance sheet. And as -- if you look over the past couple of years, we've tended to repurchase anywhere from $400 million to $500 million of stock a year and I think we planned to continue that trend as well. From a debt ratings standpoint, I think we like being about in the single A tolerance area, which is where our current ratings are. And so I would expect our strategy on, from a credit rating standpoint, to be relatively consistent. I wouldn't expect a change in strategy there. And then the final thing I would say that we're managing along with many other companies is not all of the cash on our balance sheet is in the U.S. We have a mix of cash that's in the U.S. and a mix of cash that's outside of the U.S. And obviously, the cash that's outside of the U.S., we believe, is better used investing in growth opportunities outside the U.S. rather than bringing back into the U.S. at this point, given the tax friction that would be created from that.","Operator","The next question comes from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffrey.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Just a question on Asia. The concession seemed to be still a little bit of a headwind. Can you just contextualize some of the pressure points in the key markets there? Is it more macro, is it more competitive environment changes? And then in particular in Japan, can you just maybe parse out how the Denim & Supply stores versus the Ralph Lauren stores are performing? And then I guess as it relates to the acceleration in growth in Q3, what are your expectations around the Asian markets there?","Christopher H. Peterson","Okay. I'll start with Asia. And I guess what I would say on Asia is, if you looked at the Asian revenue results, excluding Japan, the company revenue was up double digits in the second quarter. The Japan business was down significantly, and really there were 2 things that were driving that revenue decline in Japan. The first, as many of you have been following, is the Japanese government has embarked on a macroeconomic strategy of weakening their currency with the attempt to accelerate GDP growth in the region. The currency impact year-over-year in Japan to the company was greater than a 20% drop from a translation standpoint in the sales results in the Japanese market for us. So that was kind of a first impact that hit us in Japan. I think as we talked previously, we have priced to try to recover some of that, but not all of that currency impact. The second big driver that's impacted us in Japan in the second quarter is that the traffic trends in the department stores continue to be challenging, and our business today is heavily weighted in the department stores. So the vast majority of our business in Japan is in the department stores. What we're trying to do there in the market is both reinvigorate our growth in the department stores and try to create a little bit more of a direct-to-consumer model with the launch of e-commerce and with the opening of some of our freestanding stores. You mentioned Denim & Supply, and I think we've got a handful of Denim & Supply stores open now in Japan. It's a little early to tell fully the results because it's still a new brand that we're driving brand awareness, but we're off to an encouraging start in the Denim & Supply stores in Japan.","Jackwyn L. Nemerov","We have a couple of new stores that opened. Our store on Cat Street, which is near the Omotesando District. And most recently about a month ago, we opened our Denim & Supply store in Osaka, and that has met with outstanding results. So we're very encouraged in terms of the Japanese consumer, both loving our RRL brand, which is a cornerstone of authenticity and has been wildly successful in that market, and now followed by Denim & Supply, which is we feel we're off to a very good start in that market.","Operator","The final question comes from Dave Weiner with Deutsche Bank.","David Weiner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So I just wanted to ask about, earlier in the call when you started the call, you talked about some of your long-term initiatives, which was pretty helpful. I guess, I was wondering if you could maybe, without speaking exclusively to guidance to next year, but just over time over the next several years, talk about how you think about sales and earnings growth? I think in the past you've talked about historic trends in the 10% to 11% range for sales and more like mid-teens for EPS growth. Is that still kind of how you think about this business given all the transitions that are happening kind of over the long term?","Christopher H. Peterson","Yes. I guess I would say a couple of things on that. So I think if you look back over the last 10 years, the numbers you're talking about of 10% to 11% revenue growth and mid-teens EPS growth is, historically, what the company has delivered over that time period. I think if you look over the last 10 years, part of what's characterized the company's growth has been the take-back of significant license businesses, which have added to the top line. I think the path going forward is going to be a little bit different than the path that the company has come on over that last 10-year period, because the path going forward is going to be more about growth through the strategies that we have articulated, direct-to-consumer, international expansion and product and merchandise category innovation. So I think we haven't provided long-term guidance in terms of what we expect over the next 3 to 5 years. But certainly, we anticipate delivering results going forward that we believe will be very competitive in the industry and we believe will lead to shareholder value creation.","James Hurley","Great. Are there any additional questions, operator?","Operator","We have no further questions.","Christopher H. Peterson","All right. Thank you very much.","Jackwyn L.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Now for opening remarks and introductions, I will turn the conference over to Mr. James Hurley. Please go ahead, sir.","James Hurley","Good morning, and thank you for joining us on Ralph Lauren's First Quarter Fiscal 2013 Conference Call.","The agenda for this morning's call includes Roger Farah, our President and Chief Operating Officer, who will give you an overview of the quarter and comment on our broader strategic initiatives; Jacki Nemerov, our Executive Vice President, will provide some merchandising highlights; and Bob Madore, our interim Chief Financial Officer, will provide operational and financial details for the first quarter, in addition to reviewing our expectations for fiscal 2013. After that, we will open the call up for your questions, which we ask that you please limit to one per caller.","During today's call, we will be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including our financial outlook. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees, and our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Our expectations contain many risks and uncertainties. The principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from our current expectations are detailed in our SEC filings.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Roger.","Roger N. Farah","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. We reported better-than-expected first quarter results this morning, delivering 4% revenue growth and diluted EPS that was 7% above the prior year period.","The first quarter sales growth and margin structure were both better than we anticipated, and they demonstrate the tremendous operating discipline of our organization. I'm proud of these results, considering the global retail environment was increasingly challenging during the quarter, particularly for apparel merchandise.","Revenue growth was well balanced across main channels of distribution, and were achieved on top of extraordinary gains in each of the prior 2 periods, 32% in the first quarter of last year and 13% in the first quarter of fiscal '11.","This multiyear growth is a real testament of the diversity of our operating model. Strategic changes, we decided to make in our business, which include the impact of closing 60% of our Greater China distribution network and winding down American Living, combined with unfavorable foreign currency effects, suppressed our consolidated sales growth by approximately 500 basis points in the quarter. Organic growth in the quarter was close to 9%.","Looking at our wholesale segment performance in the quarter. We continue to experience double-digit growth in North America, as we intensified our leadership position in core merchandise categories and in growing distribution of emerging products. Jacki will provide more insight into resilience of our North America wholesale trends later on this call.","In Europe, where retailers and consumers alike are contending with unprecedented economic and political challenges, our first quarter wholesale results primarily reflect our decision to proactively scale back shipments at the specialty channel in order to calibrate inventories to more muted customer demand trends. Our first quarter European wholesale revenues were also negatively impacted by the shift in seasonal merchandise shipments and currency exchange rates.","Retail segment sales were modestly below our initial expectations for the quarter, primarily as a result of challenging traffic trends at our Ralph Lauren stores in Europe and concession shops in Korea and Japan. Volatile equity markets and global economic challenges have clearly had an impact on highly discretionary luxury apparel sales. They have also created reduced stores' traffic in key locations, some of which is also a function of unfavorable exchange rate dynamics.","However, our strategic marketing efforts and focus on world-class customer service, particularly for our most important and loyal customers, have enabled us to mitigate lower traffic levels with improved conversion rates at most of our retail formats worldwide.","As customers have become more cautious and value-conscious with their discretionary spending, our factory stores are providing -- are proving to be extremely resilient worldwide. Our brand and shopping experience is commanding a greater share of the value customer's wallet, as we also continue to see an increase in acceptance of shopping online, where traffic and sales trends to our e-commerce operations worldwide maintained double-digit rates of growth in the quarter.","As you saw on this morning's press release, beginning with a new fiscal year, we have moved to reporting comp store sales growth as a single consolidated metric. With the integration of South Korea last year, we now directly control our distribution at our largest and most strategically important markets.","Given the broad range of retail formats associated with the Ralph Lauren brand that the company operates worldwide and the growing importance of having an omni-channel approach to the customer intelligence and relationship management, we believe the single metric better aligns our discussions with you on how we manage our multichannel approach as a much more integrated and global organization.","The resilience of our gross margin in the first quarter is noteworthy since our retail segments are still cycling through the tail end of the extraordinary spikes in raw material costs that started to affect our margins last year. Lower wholesale shipments to specialty stores throughout Europe put additional pressure on the gross margin, since those accounts tend to be among our most high margin relationships.  With inventories in line and lower product costs for the fall, we feel good about our gross margin prospects for the remainder of the year.","Our better-than-expected operating profitability in the quarter was a result of expense leverage in certain large and growing operations that mitigated the impact of the investments we are making in resetting our brand presence in Greater China and our global e-commerce development in customer intelligence and customer relationship management platforms in our systems and infrastructure.","Stronger operating profits were also supported by diligent management expense in the face of a more challenging environment, and included a shift in the timing of certain expenses out of the first quarter into the balance of fiscal '13.","We executed against decisions to align our expenses with the softening global market trends, and that is particularly evident in the resilience of our retail segment profitability in the quarter. This delicate balance between near-term market realities and our commitment to our long-term growth objectives is a defining characteristic of our organization. Historically, it has been a competitive advantage for us in unsettled market conditions.","With over $1 billion in cash and investments, very little debt, well-controlled inventories, our financial condition is very strong. Our cash flows remain robust, allowing us to continue to invest for the long-term growth, while simultaneously returning capital to shareholders by a strong share repurchase program and higher dividends.","As we communicated to you in May, we are planning a year of tale of 2 halves. The first 6 months have profit pressures from raw material cost inflations, incremental investments in our growth initiatives and comparisons to very strong first half results from last year. The second 6 months are projected to see strong growth in operating profits. Our perspective has not changed. And while our new fiscal year is off to a strong start, we are maintaining a cautious view of the global retail environment for the balance of the year. Bob will walk you through some of the specifics of our guidance later, but we are essentially maintaining the full year outlook we provided in May.","It's early in the year and we continue to operate in highly uncertain market conditions around the globe -- around the world. Global financial, economic and political conditions are not only having an impact on the underlying demand trend, but are also resulting in more unfavorable currency dynamics than we initially planned for.","We don't expect to have a true read on the health of the consumer until we're through fall and holiday selling periods. By then, we should also have a better understanding of the political landscape in the U.S. and in China and more insight into how the European Union is dealing with the debt crisis and the implementation of their austerity measures.","In the context of this uncertainty, we want to maintain the flexibility to respond to the market conditions as they evolve.","But we remain committed to staying the course with our investments in our long-term strategic initiative this year, particularly in Asia, for global e-commerce and for customer relations management.","Our first quarter results confirm the quality of our brands and our products. And as Ralph Lauren said in the release today, our products are the lifeblood of our success. We will continue our leadership position in apparel as we create excitement in categories like accessories, footwear and watches. Great products supported by the management teams\u2019 commitment to world-class global execution will help us navigate through difficult times.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jacki.","Jackwyn L. Nemerov","Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. The growth we achieved across channels and regions in the first quarter affirms the strong consistent appeal of the Ralph Lauren aesthetic across a large and growing range of merchandise categories. We continue to enjoy a leadership position with more established categories while gaining excellent  momentum with emerging ones.","And our reported results only tell part of the story, because sales growth among products that we license to third parties, particularly for Polo and our Lauren brands, were also very strong in the quarter.","Our first quarter sales results were supported by strong marketing and advertising for Lauren at Mother's Day, Polo at Father's Day and children heading to camp for the summer. The Ralph Lauren brand continues to resonate as the perfect gift choice across women, men and our children's category.","Our association with world-class sporting events such as the U.S. and British Open Golf Tournament, Wimbledon and the Olympics, heightened the global exposure of our brand during the quarter. The elevated and iconic presentation of the Ralph Lauren brand through these high visibility partnerships will become even more valuable as we continue to develop our international businesses over the next several years.","Today, I'd like to share with you what's behind our sustained success in the North American wholesale channel, where we've grown our revenues by more than 30% over the last 2 years. This growth is even more noteworthy when you consider the scale of our North American wholesale operations, which exceeded $2 billion in fiscal year '12.","I'm extremely proud of not only the volume, but also the quality of this growth. In addition to the rigor of our sales planning process, we generate extremely high productivity for our core merchandise categories through the disciplined management of our department store distribution, which is, as you know, limited to the best locations in the best doors. We leverage the strength of this foundation to execute high-profile introduction of exciting new merchandise categories such as handbags, footwear, dresses and our newest brand, Denim & Supply.","In the past, you've heard me talk about how design and product development has been important contributors to our market share gains. Another critical ingredient to our success is the tenure and experience of our North American wholesale team. We have an impressive roster of leaders who are constantly raising the bar by driving innovation through compelling strategies and disciplines that not only accentuate the strength of our product, but also drive exceptional profit and growth.","I believe that the passion and the commitment of this team is unparalleled, and the progress we've made over the year truly speaks for itself.","Our success is also a function of the deep, long-standing relationship we have with our key North American wholesale partners. Over the years, we've developed the spirit of collaboration that ensures seamless alignment of priorities and objectives and enables mutual success.","That collaboration has also inspired the creation of compelling new opportunities. Many of our wholesale partners who are in the midst of exciting transformation in how they are managing their growing their businesses, and we are right by their side to support these plans with financial and strategic resources, as well as infrastructure and expertise to ensure their success.","A good example of this is in the area of e-commerce and online marketing, where we have built a dedicated team of experts to fully exploit this rapidly growing channel with each of our partners.","With respect to the first quarter, double-digit growth in our North American wholesale operations was primarily fueled by comp store productivity gains from our men's, women's and children's apparel. Our growth also reflected incremental distribution in Canada for Denim & Supply, Lauren accessories and footwear and Lauren dresses.","The tremendous momentum of Polo in department stores and Black Label in specialty stores contributed to strong performance in the men's category. We had a powerful Father's Day, and it was supported by elevated marketing campaign and the additional halo of our Sports of Summer initiative that drove high interest in our men's product heading into this important holiday.","Our performance in children's was also strong across boys, girls and babies, driven by key items and updated classics.","As many of you know, Lauren is our dominant women's brand in the North American wholesale channel and is the embodiment of the iconic Ralph Lauren lifestyle. The broad appeal of the Lauren's sensibility has allowed the brand to grow in what's been an extremely challenging environment for women's sportswear.","Over the last few years, the Lauren brand has successfully evolved to meet the customer's need for more casual and contemporary product that suits her style and her life. Updated silhouettes in the core sportswear assortment and continued expansion of Lauren Jeans, Lauren Active, Lauren dresses and of course, Lauren accessories and footwear has hit the mark with the customer.","During the first quarter, the focus on color, prints and novelty across all categories of the Lauren portfolio was an important contributor to sales growth across the brand.","Our Mother's Day marketing efforts in-store, in-home and online beautifully brought the product stories to life and emphasized the brand's unique breadth across product classification in a highly impactful way. This was instrumental in driving both gift-giving and self-purchase activity.","Lauren Active and Jeans were particularly strong in the quarter and dresses continued its momentum with double-digits comp growth.","The performance of Lauren footwear was also spectacular with productivity continuing to climb as we introduce more lifestyle sensibilities to the product mix and delivered strong results on trend-right espadrille and sandal styles. Thanks to our success here, we are expanding distribution with our largest accounts.","Distribution is also growing for Lauren handbags and small leather goods. In addition to new points of sale, we are successfully acquiring incremental real estate in our best performing doors. We are especially excited about our new main floor shop at Macy's Herald Square that will be unveiled in September as part of the first phase of the magnificent renovation of that iconic store.","Before I turn the call over to Bob, I do want to call out that we have worked our way through this incredible spike in the cost of cotton that has weighed on our gross margin for the last few seasons. We started to experience some margin relief beginning with summer shipments, and we expect further improvement in the fall season.  As we head into spring '13, we will be operating on a more apples-to-apples basis with more normalized cotton prices.","I also want to acknowledge the strong partnership and sophistication of our global sourcing and supply-chain organizations for their remarkable achievements in helping us steer through that challenge with such great skill.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bob for a review of our financial performance in the quarter.","Robert L. Madore","Thank you, Jacki, and good morning, everyone. As Roger mentioned earlier, our consolidated first quarter net revenues rose 4% to $1.6 billion, which was better than we anticipated, primarily as a result of higher wholesale shipments.","Double-digit North American sales growth was mitigated by lower international revenues, primarily as a result of lower European wholesale volumes and the impact our a Greater China store network closures.","Foreign currency effects negatively impacted consolidated sales growth by approximately 2% in the first quarter, which was primarily due to the weakness of the euro. Excluding strategic decisions to terminate certain North American and Asian operations and the impact of foreign currency translation, revenue growth would have been approximately 9% in the quarter.","The gross profit margin of 62.3% was 70 basis points below the record level we achieved in the prior year period, and was in line with our expectations. The decline in gross profit margin was mostly a function of sustained impact of raw materials cost inflation at our retail segment, in addition to overall geographic and wholesale customer mix, primarily in Europe.","Operating expenses rose 3% to $700 million in the quarter. Although the operating expense margin of 43.9% was 60 basis points below the prior year period, which was much better than the outlook we provided in May. The lower operating expense margin was primarily a result of disciplined operational management, particularly at our retail segment, and included a shift in the timing of certain expenses out of the first quarter and into the balance of fiscal 2013.","Operating income of $292 million was 4% greater than the prior year, and the operating margin of 18.3% was 20 basis points below the prior year period, the net result of the lower gross profit margin and operating expense leverage I just discussed.","First quarter net income rose 5% to $193 million and net income per diluted share increased 7% to $2.03. The growth in net income and diluted EPS was primarily a function of our higher operating income, in addition to lower effective tax rate in the first quarter of fiscal 2013.","Diluted earnings per share also benefited from lower average weighted shares outstanding this year.","Turning to some segment-specific highlights for the first quarter. Wholesale revenues rose 3% to $694 million, a result of continued momentum in North America, but it was offset by lower international wholesale revenues, primarily due to lower European wholesale sales and the continued transition of certain former Japanese wholesale distribution to directly operate concessions shops.","As a reminder, the decline in European wholesale sales mostly reflects lower shipments to specialty accounts in Southern Europe, changes in the shipment cadence that we called out last quarter and the net negative impact of foreign currency translation.","Wholesale operating income grew 3% to $156 million in the first quarter and the wholesale operating margin was 22.4%, 10 basis points below the prior year period. Improved profitability in North America was more than offset by a decline in Europe as a result of lower sales and overall customer mix.","Retail segment sales grew 5%, $857 million in the first quarter, supported by the contribution from new stores and incremental e-commerce operations, in addition to 1% comparable store sales growth on a reported basis and 3% in constant currency.","Retail sales growth was partially offset by store closures associated with our Greater China network repositioning efforts.","Sales trends were strongest online and at our factory stores worldwide. Lower tourist travel and restraint among local customers continued to weigh on Ralph Lauren stores in Europe. Double-digit declines in traffic to department stores in Korea and Japan negatively impacted sales at concessions shops during the quarter.","Retail segment operating income of $180 million was 4% greater than the prior year period and the retail operating margin was 21%, 30 basis points below the all-time high achieved in the first quarter last year.","The growth in retail operating income reflects strengths in our international operations and for e-commerce worldwide. While the decline in retail operating margin reflects gross margin pressure from the continued net negative impact from raw materials cost inflation that was partially offset by disciplined operational management.","Licensing royalties of $42 million in the first quarter were 5% greater than the prior year period on higher apparel and fragrance-related royalties that were partially offset by a decline in home product licensing royalties due to assuming direct control over our home textile operations. The higher licensing royalties contributed to increased licensing operating income in the first quarter.","We ended the first quarter with inventories up 8% from the prior year period, primarily in support of our retail-led expansion worldwide. We spent approximately $62 million in capital expenditures during the first quarter for our retail store and wholesale shop development worldwide, in addition to our continued investment in our global systems and infrastructure.","We purchased 2 million shares of our Class A common stock for approximately $300 million during the first quarter and had approximately $277 million remaining under our authorized share repurchase programs at the end of the period.","After funding all of our capital needs and working capital requirements and returning capital to shareholders, we ended the quarter with $1.1 billion in cash and investments, which is a 14% increase from the prior year period.","Now I'd like to review the financial outlook we provided in this morning's press release. For the full year of fiscal '13 period, we continue to expect revenues to increase at mid-single-digit rate.","Strategic changes we decided to make, such as closing a large portion of our Greater China distribution network and winding down American Living, combined with unfavorable foreign currency effects that are expected to persist throughout the year are estimated to suppress our consolidated sales growth by approximately 5% in fiscal 2013.","We continue to expect our full year operating margin to be modestly above fiscal 2012's level, as a recovery in gross profit margin in the balance of the year is largely offset by an increase in operating expense rate to support our investments in our strategic growth initiatives.","The increased expense rate is also reflective of our higher retail mix this year.","Relative to our initial outlook in May, our full year operating margin outlook also includes incremental costs associated with the acceleration of our real estate development and store openings in Greater China, expenses related to the suspension of certain operations in Argentina and higher advertising and marketing expenditures.","The full year tax rate continues to be planned at approximately 33%.","For the second quarter, we expect consolidated net revenues to decline at a mid-single digit rate as a low double-digit decline in wholesale revenues is partially offset by a mid-single digit growth at our retail segment.","Reduced distribution in Greater China and for American Living and unfavorable foreign currency effects are estimated to mitigate consolidated revenue growth by approximately 7% to 8% in the second quarter. As a reminder, we will be comparing against last fall's large initial shipments for the launch of Denim & Supply during the second quarter.","Operating margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2013 is expected to be down approximately 175 to 225 basis points from the prior year period. The decline in operating margin is entirely attributable to an anticipated deleveraging of operating expenses, that is partially offset by an improvement in gross margin.","The increase in the second quarter's operating expense rate is primarily due to lower wholesale revenues and reduced sales in Greater China, where we're still absorbing the cost of our infrastructure and investing for growth and to incremental costs associated with our investments and our strategic initiatives.","At this point, we'd like to open up the call for your questions. Operator, can you assist us with that?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]  And we'll take our first question from Omar Saad with ISI group.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Roger, wanted to see if I could ask you about the retail business. It's a big focus for the company globally. You mentioned -- you had some interesting comments in your prepared remarks about maybe some of the shifts going on and the factory business is really holding up very well and that luxury apparel side in the full price might be a little bit more challenging. As you try to manage the brand kind of across these price points and diverse customer bases, what are the key elements there? Is it the macro factor that is playing the biggest piece? Are there product fashion issues that might be going on affecting as well? How do you think about managing that whole -- that retail business holistically across the channel, the price points, the different sub-brands, et cetera?","Roger N. Farah","Yes. I think it's a good question, Omar, because we obviously have been focusing a lot on retail over the years since you've been following the story, as well as anybody, you notice our ongoing ability to develop a very profitable business model. I think what you're alluding to is some of the channel mix issues that go on between e-commerce or factory stores, the Ralph Lauren stores we own or even the licensed stores that we don't necessarily report as part of the retail comps. I think what's happening is in the first quarter and probably the first half of the year, we're going against some extraordinary comps last year. First quarter last year was plus 19% and double LOI was plus 7%. So we are up against some extraordinary changes. I also think what's happening on a macro basis is we're really dealing with a worldwide customer. We're seeing more and more the high end customer who shops in London and shopping in Paris or Dubai or New York or Beverly Hills or Asia, and so our efforts around a global customer consistency, merchandising consistency, marketing, the same standards for service is a big push for us around the globe. Now in the first quarter, the Ralph Lauren store business was softer than prior trends. I think most of that has been a footfall issue with the higher-end luxury apparel customer was not shopping in Europe or in key markets with the same kind of urgency they've had in the past. I think the accessory businesses, watch, jewelry businesses have held up better perhaps than the apparel customer. The other thing affecting that is the shifting of the tourist business. There is no doubt that Chinese tourists today are the #1 consumer who are traveling around the world and are distorting sales in stores or cities or markets to a much higher degree. We have a very low penetration at the moment with the Chinese customer. I think we talked about it last time, it's less than 2%. And we think, over time, as we build our presence in China and build our brand, we'll begin to see them in some of the other markets. Very interesting to me is the data point, even a smaller business like Club Monaco that today has almost 20 stores in China. The second largest tourist that they're seeing in New York are Chinese. We're in the Ralph Lauren business, where we've closed our distribution and we don't have a big network there, the Chinese customer doesn't make the top 10. For us, the largest tourist groups are Brazilians and Russians and people from the U.K. So it's a very interesting global dynamic playing out across the world landscape. The factory business is strong worldwide, and we feel good about that. Not really through door expansion, it's just through the way we're executing and running that business, and  we think that does complement the value customer's need for product at a price. And then, of course, the ongoing overlay of e-commerce continues to be very strong double-digit growth here in the United States. Our business in Europe has almost doubled, given the expansion of countries and markets, and we continue to see growth there. We're very excited with the Club Monaco launch here in the United States and Canada in March and April. We think that's going to have a real strength with the customer. And then, we'll launch in Japan this fall. So it's really multichannel customer today in terms of some of our customers access all 3, and we expect that to continue. The other, again, subject that's not reported in that number is the license market, like the Middle East or Russia, where we've had great strength and continue to have great consumer acceptance, which we think is why those customers when they travel throughout Europe or the United States are fans of the brand. So it's getting to be integrated, complicated world. And I think that our ability to reach all of those customers with consistency is going to help us in the long run.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Kate McShane with Citi.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Roger, I was wondering if you could comment at all about inventories at retail and clearance activity -- I'm sorry, inventories at your wholesale accounts and clearance activity in both the U.S. and the European market.","Roger N. Farah","Sure. The inventories within our wholesale channel are very clean. As a matter of fact, Jacki and I were just talking about the August performance, which is strong, really, on the back of new fall receipts. So with a very strong double-digit spring, summer performance we've had, we're in good shape domestically. In the European markets, consistent with what we said earlier in the call, we actually chose not to ship some products into the market that were originally on order, combination of our concerns about their ability to sell through it, as well as some deteriorating credit with some of the customers. So the actual inventory levels in Europe are down, and the inventory in the channel is clearing through, perhaps a couple of weeks slower than this time last year in Europe. Domestically, we're fine.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Adrianne Shapira with Goldman Sachs.","Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Roger, it's impressive that you're maintaining your full year guidance despite the incremental stem that you talked about, and you've always spoken about the year -- as the year of 2 halves. I think we can appreciate the margin opportunity at the back half, but it clearly calls for revenues to accelerate in the back half. So if you could share with us why you and why should we be confident in that acceleration at the back half given some of the softer footfall issues you've talked about with the higher-end consumer impacting retail sales today.","Roger N. Farah","Okay, Adrianne. Well, thank you for putting me on the spot as to whether I'm comfortable. But as you know, we try to be thoughtful in our guidance, we make no guarantees. It really did lay out, as a year that had 2 halves, the first half being impacted by all the things we've talked about. Many of those things begin to become less meaningful in the back half. So particularly in Asia, where we closed a lot of stores and that continued through the year, we do have the beginning of 15 new stores coming online during the fall. So that will begin to mitigate some of that. And the American Living shipments begin to get to be a smaller percent in the back half of the year as well. Obviously, FX is anybody's guess, and our forecast today really just reflects what the currency exchange rates are. So there's no new news there. We happen to think that the comparisons in comps get more favorable in the back half of the year. We've had extraordinary comps in the first half, and then they flattened out in the second half, we think, as customers began to accept the new pricing. We are fundamentally maintaining that pricing as cost of goods come down, so we'll get margin expansion, we hope, beginning next quarter. And we think we've got a great roster of products position for the retail channel, as well as the visibility we have into the wholesale channel at this point, at least through holiday, gives us some confidence in the guidance and the forecast we've given. Our willingness to invest long term, as you said, Adrianne, continues. But what's offsetting some of that is exchange rates are softer than we thought. We are closing our operations temporarily in Argentina that will be a small hit to the original guidance. And we've got an opportunity to take a couple extra great locations in China, which will also hurt the second half a little bit. But given the strong first quarter and given the visibility we have, that's our best thinking at the moment.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Roger, maybe I know we've talked a little bit about the global retail outlook today. But maybe if I could focus in on Europe for just a minute, a little more color on what you're seeing in your own stores in Europe. And we heard from you guys in late May, and it seems like things got a little worse than what you were thinking, you would see Roger since then. So maybe some color on whether you think it's stabilized at this point? Or what gets you comfortable with what you're seeing over there right now as far as how you talk to us about the guidance on the retail side today? And then any -- maybe any -- just to follow up that, maybe any help you could give as we look at our models for gross margin outlook for the year beyond what you've given us to help out with the second quarter would be helpful -- in the back half of the year.","Roger N. Farah","Okay. Well, let's talk about Europe. There's a lot of macro issues to deal with, and I'm not going to attempt to go through all of that with you. Our first quarter, when you put retail, wholesale together, on a constant currency basis was plus 3%. And while that's certainly down from where we've run in seasons past and years past, I think it's a very respectable number. We're seeing skittishness by our wholesale partners and orders, future bookings and forward orders. They are operating cautiously as their footfalls and business has been down. So they're trying to increase their turns and therefore, are looking more cautiously at initial orders. I think if business picks up, we'll be able to get some of that business back through replenishment. But net-net, by the end of the year, if we hit our forecast, we're looking to be flat to single digit up in Europe, depending on exchange rate. I think it's going to be lower wholesale businesses and higher retail businesses. And so we'll keep updating you every quarter, but that's our current point of view. The margin, as Jacki touched on and you've heard from others, we have certainly seen return of cotton, which is our primary raw material to pre-spike levels, somewhere in the low-80s, mid-80s per pound, which is a more normalized level. I think we'll begin to see that impact in the second quarter in the balance of the year. We talked in the past about wholesale inventories turning much faster. And therefore, new receipts with lower cost of goods go into the markup on sales, and that's what we're reporting. Markup and margin on sales, not receipts, but it comes through the wholesale distribution faster because of the turning inventory. Comes through more slowly in retail, where you've got on hand that have prior cost of goods, which were higher. And as the new receipts come in and they blend and they work their way through, I think we'll see the retail impact later in the year. So all in all, we're pleased with the retail prices, as I said earlier, we'll maintain. Cost of goods will start to come down. Obviously mix product categories will make that move around a little bit. But we think you'll start seeing that return in the second quarter.","Operator","We'll go next to Liz Dunn with Macquarie Capital.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","In terms of the retail commentary, I just kind of want to dive in a little bit to the factory, because I was surprised at your positive comments on factory stores given the traffic drop-off that others have noted there. Is there something that you're doing differently? Or is it just the conversion that you kind of highlighted? And then also, as it relates to the China customer, does that also impact your business in Europe that you don't have as much mind share with that Chinese tourist customer.","Roger N. Farah","Yes. Liz, I think the factory business has held up well, high single digits. That was really achieved on slightly negative footfalls early in the quarter that began to flatten out later in the quarter, and then as slightly positive as we head into the beginning of a new quarter. So we've seen some firming in the foot traffic there. I think our ability to outperform was really a tribute to the higher unit sales, the higher average price of the products, which became a higher unit in dollars sales and higher conversions. So we track rigorously how we convert the footsteps into sales, and we saw an increase both in the ticket pricing and the conversion rates, so that's good news, particularly if the footfall continues to creep up as we work our way into the critical back-to-school and early fall selling.  The Chinese customer is, quite frankly, critical at the moment to the global sales of luxury products. Our conversations with many luxury brands is that it can be 25%, 30% or 40% of the European sales. But when you see reports of strong European sales for other luxury brands, 25% to 40% of it is coming from Chinese tourists. So us of the moment that's less than 2%. So until we get our network and our brand presence in China and better educate the customer, I think we're going to continue not to get a high penetration of Chinese in our international markets.","Operator","We'll go next to Christian Buss with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Christian Buss - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was wondering if you could talk a bit about your accessories penetration, where's that gone, and also about how the responses been to new lines in the accessory side.","Jackwyn L. Nemerov","Well, we've introduced our Ralph Lauren Collection handbag business and footwear business over the last couple of years, and have really built on the fashion in that product, the quality in that product and the broader appeal of that product. And we're very pleased with the direction of where we're headed with that accessory and footwear product. And we are really playing that as an important aspect of our own retail stores. So in all the new stores we've built, what you'll notice when you walk in is a great presentation of accessories, which includes handbags, belts, scarfs, a great presentation of footwear from the dressiest style to the most casual, and we've been working very diligently on the growth of those opportunities. We've seen some great penetration in the success of those businesses. But as I said, they're small and they're growing. In our department store business, where we have our Lauren brand and Polo brand, in Lauren, we began in footwear a few years ago, and we're seeing a great penetration and increase in sales. We just came off a marvelous season in our Lauren footwear business. We introduced Lauren handbags just under 2 years ago, and that is really starting to take on some great success, again, a great season and great growth. We've added Lauren handbags and Lauren footwear to Europe as well, and we're pleased with the early results there. Our Polo footwear has really accelerated very successfully, and we are now the #5 brand in men's footwear, which is quite an accomplishment from starting a couple of years ago, sort of not having a footwear business. And we are introducing our Polo men's accessories into our top doors for this fall. And because of, certainly, the power of our Polo brand, we're anticipating some very nice early results there on that product, which our intention is to build on the loyalty of that Polo customer, the introduction of this new category, the positive reaction we've gotten from our customers to the look of that product and the price point that we're introducing it at makes us feel very positive and very excited about what the future of that business can be as well.","Operator","We'll go next to David Glick with Buckingham Research Group.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Roger, just want to clarify your comments on Europe for your outlook for the year. You said flat to low single digits. Was that on a constant currency or a reported basis? And I was wondering if you could get into a little more detail on your comps in Europe in constant currency in Q1, how you're thinking about that for the balance of the year. And any color on Northern versus Southern Europe will be appreciated.","Roger N. Farah","Okay. So my comments were really based on a constant currency. At this point, I'm not quite sure how to forecast it. We have, like others, seen weaknesses in Europe in the southern tier, not that we have big businesses in Greece, but certainly Italy, which at one point, was our largest country in Europe. Spain, which is also another large country, have seen the greatest impact of their businesses. Italy, almost all specialty store distribution; Spain, almost all department store distribution. The northern countries, whether it's Scandinavia, whether it's England, France, Germany all have performed better, and they continue to show more high potential parts of it. The other part of Europe that I talked about earlier, which we add in, the Middle East and Russia have also been very strong. So it's really a range of performances, depending on where in Europe you want to talk about. We see online growing. We see the retail growing. And I said earlier, we're going to be cautious about wholesale sell-ins. We want to manage the flow of product into the marketplace. We're also going to manage those places that in a specialty channel may have deteriorating credit metrics. So all of that rolls into my comments about viewing Europe for the year as kind of flat to mid-single digits on a comparable currency basis.","Operator","We'll go next to John Kernan with Cowen & Company.","John D. Kernan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So looks like this year, you expect to finish the year around a little bit above 15% operating margin as you reposition some of your distribution and you continue with the rollout of some of your newer product categories. What's the long term -- what's your long-term view on your operating margin? And is there any reason to believe that there isn't a meaningful long-term operating margin expansion potential as you continue your international rollout?","Roger N. Farah","Okay. Well, I think you've been a student of our business. And other than the spike in the raw materials in the recent past, we've seen tremendous progress in growing our merchandise margins, and we would expect, as we continue to go out over the next couple of years, to see some of that growth rate return. Now the other thing that gives me some confidence about the long-term margin opportunities of the company is our ongoing ability once we fully integrate Asia, is a desire to get some expense leverage. As we spent many years integrating merchandise categories, product categories, regions, we do think we will get some expense leverage. The other piece that we think is exciting for the long-term prospects and margin is many of our new initiatives successfully accomplished should be high-margin businesses, not only the accessory business, but the margins in Asia should be meaningfully higher than the margins in either the United States or Europe. So a lot of the areas we're focusing on, I think, do speak well for the long-term margin opportunities of the company, and we'll see how they play out.","I think at this point, operator, we've hit the time limit. So I thank everybody for their interest and their questions. Appreciate the focus this morning. We're very excited about the back half of the year, and think we're well positioned to navigate some of the short-term turbulence. So thank you very much.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"17604":["Ralph Lauren Corp.

Instructions on how to ask a question will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mrs. Evren Kopelman. Please go ahead.","Evren Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Good morning and thank you for joining Ralph Lauren's first quarter fiscal 2018 conference call. With me today are Patrice Louvet, the company's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jane Nielsen, Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions, which we ask that you limit to one per caller.","During today's call, we will be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal securities laws, including our financial outlook. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees. And our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.","Our expectations contain many risks and uncertainties. Principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from our current expectations are detailed in our SEC filings. To find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our financial results, you should refer to this morning's earnings release and to our SEC filings that can be found on our Investor Relations' website.","And now, I will turn the call over to Patrice.","Patrice Jean Louis Louvet - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Thank you, Evren, Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. It's great to be at the company and partner with Ralph and the entire team. The last few weeks have been exciting for me as I spent time in the marketplace and had the chance to meet with many of our team members as well as our consumers, wholesale partners and key industry opinion leaders.","What is clear to me is that we have an iconic brand, a passionate team and a lot of opportunity ahead. Seizing our opportunity requires us to evolve how our iconic brand is experienced and expressed to win the hearts and minds of consumers globally. It's something Ralph and I are deeply committed to.","As you can see in this quarter's results, we're making good progress with setting a strong foundation for future growth. The team continues to deliver on our commitments to improve quality of sales and distribution, with increased efficiency.","On my first call with you, I thought it would be valuable to share what motivated me to join the company, my observations to-date and our areas of focus to get back to growth and value creation. Then, I'll turn it over to Jane to walk through the details of the quarter and our guidance. At the end, we'll take your questions together.","To start, I've long admired Ralph and I am honored to partner with him. We are both committed to preserving the essence of our brand, while actively evolving it to renew long-term growth, profitability and returns. To achieve that, Ralph and I are clear on how we will partner together. Ralph is the Chief Creative Officer in charge of the creative brand aesthetic decisions. As CEO, I will lead the company's strategy, execution and business results.","Ralph has already been a great partner, and I could not be more enthusiastic about our collaboration. I appreciate the confidence and latitude he has given me in leading this company forward.","During this time of transformation for our industry and our business, I am confident we will accomplish a great deal together. Our opportunity is to take an iconic brand and advance it in ways that drive new growth and value in an industry that is undergoing unprecedented change. Our experiences and expertise will be a powerful and winning combination.","People who know me well describe me as a builder of both brands and teams. Building up people and teams to accomplish amazing things motivates me. I believe this is one reason Ralph and I click. He was looking for somebody to come in, understand what makes this place so unique and special, and build boldly from that point.","I am also committed to objectively evaluating the business and identifying both the strengths on which we can build and the areas that need focused attention and improvement.","I am passionate about building brands that consumers love. To do that, we must understand the target consumer, his or her interests and motivations, clearly define what the brand stands for in today's world and then, most importantly, connect the two in a way in which the brand becomes irresistible.","To say the retail industry is at an inflection point would be an understatement. Technology has transformed the way consumers shop and connect with retail brands. Retail store closures are near a 20-year high as the fundamental shift to e-commerce continues. To stand out and compete in this environment, consumers expect an omnichannel shopping experience that's unlike anything they've seen before. While not easy, I see it as our job to redefine the shopping experience of the future.","All these changes are creating challenges, but they're also creating opportunity. The Ralph Lauren brand was built on a belief that we all dream of living a fulfilling life, a life that makes you feel good. I think that is a universally-aspirational ideal. It's an idea that transcends boundaries and generations. And it's as relevant today as it has ever been. Our role is to make it feel vivid and exciting today for consumers everywhere, from Boston to Barcelona to Beijing.","We are starting with a great foundation. Our brand is iconic and the underlying fundamentals of our business are solid. I am focused on continuing to execute on the operational improvements that were part of the Way Forward Plan, and the team is making good progress in driving efficiencies and improving the quality of our sales by reducing excess discounts, excess inventory, supply chain lead times, unproductive distribution in SKUs, as well as aligning our creative more closely with the consumer.","Further, I've been incredibly impressed by the caliber and dedication of the people here at Ralph Lauren. We have a team of talented and hardworking employees who are eager to get back to winning. And with their enthusiastic support, we will push ahead to create more value for our shareholders.","It is too early to talk about the evolution of our strategy; however, as I start to work with the team, we have a strong focus on growth that creates value. We are focused on exploring our opportunities in becoming more digital and more global, as well as how we evolve and elevate the offerings and experiences we provide to consumers in order to drive growth.","It is important to note that we will balance driving growth with improving efficiencies. We aim to increase our productivity by continuing to simplify and streamline our operations company-wide so we can invest in growth.","With the consumer as our touchstone, we're also going to focus on how we work as an organization, so our employees are more empowered, more connected and more energized. Getting culture right is critical for us.","In closing, as I shared earlier, we are eager to evolve how the brand is experienced and expressed to win the hearts and minds of consumers globally. While our transformation is in its early days, we are progressively strengthening our position to create new value and renew long-term growth.","With that, I'll turn it over to Jane to walk you through the details of the quarter and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions. Thank you,","Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Thank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by saying that our entire team is thrilled to welcome Patrice to the company. He joins at a critical moment when we are executing on initiatives to strengthen the foundation of our business that will allow us to position for future growth.","Our first quarter results demonstrate the strong and continued progress we are making in this area. As you know, last year, we started the important work of enhancing our operational efficiencies by improving our cost structure, evolving towards a demand-driven sell-through culture and improving our quality of sales and distribution. As we started this fiscal year, we are encouraged by the progress in the first quarter and are confident that our efforts are the right ones to lay the groundwork for our future growth initiatives.","Let me take you through the key strategic and financial highlights of the first quarter. This quarter, we continued to deliver against our strategy to drive quality of sales and elevate our brand. Key areas of operational focus were: aligning receipts to underlying demand; reducing promotion frequency and depth; optimizing our distribution; and improving our inventory position with increased productivity.","Our financial results were consistent with this focused execution. As you saw in our press release, revenues declined 13%, in line with guidance. Adjusted operating margin was 10.2%, 200 basis points above last year and above our guidance of 9.5% to 10% in constant currency.","Gross margin also reflected this work and was up 210 basis points to last year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, the gross margin was 260 basis points better than last year. Importantly, we are delivering both average unit retail increases and discount rate reductions. Across our global retail network, discount rates were down and AUR was up almost 4%.","Gross margin also benefited from favorable geographic and channel mix, as our high gross margin international and retail businesses represented a large percentage of sales compared to last year. We expect these factors to drive gross margin expansion for the remainder of the year. This work has come in conjunction with continued progress on rightsizing our cost structure.","Operating expenses were down 13% to last year in the first quarter. This was driven by: one, streamlining the organization to reduce head count; two, closing unprofitable stores; and three, changing product development processes through SKU optimization. We are on track with our expense savings targets for the year, and this will allow us to invest some of the savings into product, marketing and distribution renovations to drive future sales growth and improve the customer experience.","Our current and upcoming product marketing initiatives highlight our iconic core products, emphasize the core values of the brand, while adding interest and newness. As an example, last month, we launched our new limited-edition Polo shirt collection. We are releasing a new shirt every month through November; each inspired by one of our signature design motifs. The launch is supported by social media as we collaborate with influencers on Instagram. Our goal for this program is to position our Polo shirt as an item to covet, reach a new consumer and garner fashion editorial coverage of our icon.","We also recently introduced our new fragrance, Ralph Lauren Woman. The face of this new fragrance is two-time Oscar-nominated actress, Jessica Chastain. Digital and social media support for the launch started in July and the product is available this month.","In September, we will launch our new global family marketing campaign with strong outdoor and digital components. This, too, highlights Ralph Lauren's core values that our brand is built on.","Moving on to our segment highlights, as you know, we are now reporting under our new segments, North America, Europe and Asia. This offers increased visibility into our sales and profitability by region and increased transparency into the development of our business and the progress of our initiatives around the globe.","In North America, we continued to execute our plan to come back to profitable growth. Revenue was down 17% in the first quarter and reflected important progress across our quality of sales initiatives. As a result, we expanded gross margin and prudently reduced expenses, delivering 110 basis points of expansion in adjusted operating margin.","In North America wholesale, we continued our work to right-size our business for the long-term health of the brand. We strategically reduced shipments to better align with underlying demand, exited brands, lowered our sales to the off-price channel and closed underperforming doors. We are on track to close 20% to 25% of our U.S. department store points of distribution by the second half of FY 2018.","We are about halfway through these closures as of the end of the first quarter. These deliberate actions accounted for almost 20 points of the 27% decline in U.S. wholesale in the quarter. Consumer demand and channel dynamics remained a challenge as well.","To address this and improve the positioning of our brand, we are investing in refreshing our wholesale store environments to improve the consumer experience and we are evolving our product and marketing to turn around this trend. The sweet spot of U.S. wholesale is their growing digital business.","Our retail sales on our U. S. department store customers' websites continue to post positive growth versus last year and as a percentage of our total department store business. We will continue to drive growth through our online partners in FY 2018 and evolve our digital strategy to move with the consumer where, how and when they choose to shop.","Moving on to our directly-operated e-commerce business in North America, we are aggressively addressing our high level of promotion activity to both ensure price coherency across our channels and to enhance the overall brand and shopping experience in this, our most important door. These actions in North America drove strong gross margin expansion of 220 basis points to last year; however, they put significant pressure on revenue. North America e-commerce comps were down 22% in the first quarter, reflecting lower levels of promotion activity.","To improve the consumer experience online and move beyond promotion-led sales, one of our key digital initiatives is the transition of our platform to a cloud-based solution. With our new consumer interface, we will continue to directly operate and fulfill our e-commerce business with reduced transaction friction for our consumers, improved ability to execute dynamic changes and enhanced omnichannel capabilities. We are on track to launch by the second half of fiscal 2018. This solution will deliver a more brand-enhancing and consistent experience for customers and provide a more flexible and nimble solution for us.","Moving on to our international regions, in Europe, in constant currency, revenue was down 10% in the first quarter; however, adjusted operating margin was up 90 basis points. Wholesale revenue in Europe was down 28% in the first quarter. About half of this decline was due to a shift in timing of shipments to bring delivery closer to demand. Brand exits and reduced off-price sales accounted for the remainder of the decline. Excluding these factors, the underlying trend of the Europe wholesale business is flattish.","In Europe, retail sales were flat to last year in constant currency, with comps down 8% as we continued our work with quality of sales initiatives. While this ongoing work impacted comp growth negatively in the first quarter, it drove an 8% increase in AUR, 500 basis point decline in discount rate and 500 basis points of gross margin improvement across our retail network. This contributed to the improvement in operating margin for Europe. And we will continue this strategy for the remainder of the year.","In Asia, in constant currency, revenue was up 1% in the first quarter and adjusted operating margin was up 610 basis points. As we mentioned on previous calls, we have been focused on improving quality of sales in Asia over the past 12 to 18 months. We are beginning to see comp stabilize in the region. And in the first quarter, they were up 2% in constant currency, driven by increased traffic.","Quality of sales metrics continued to be strong as well. Average unit retails were up. Discount rates were down and gross margin was up significantly in Asia. We expect continued comp growth as we upgrade our distribution network and continue our marketing initiatives to amplify the brand, specifically by increasing engagement with celebrities and influencers in Asia.","Turning to our store fleet, we continued to improve our retail network in the first quarter through closure of underperforming locations and opening new stores with improved adjacencies. We opened six and closed five standalone stores. And in concessions, we opened nine and closed four doors, ending the quarter with 467 standalone stores and 624 concessions on a global basis. At year-end, we expect our standalone network of doors to be about flat to last year and have a net increase of 35 to 40 concessions, primarily in Asia.","Moving on to the balance sheet, our progress with our plan is reflected in our strengthened inventory and cash positions. At the end of the first quarter, inventory declined 31% to $860 million versus last year. This inventory reduction is driven by prior-year restructuring actions and more effective buying processes, including a proactive pullback in receipts. We will continue to focus on inventory productivity and matching inventory flows with demand.","We ended the first quarter with approximately $1.7 billion in cash and short and long-term investments, up from $1.2 billion at the end of last year's first quarter. Total debt at the end of the first quarter was $590 million.","Now, I'd like to turn to guidance for the full year and the second quarter of fiscal 2018. As a reminder, this guidance excludes restructuring and other charges. We are reiterating our guidance for fiscal 2018. We continue to expect revenues to decline 8% to 9% for the year, excluding the impact of foreign currency.","Brand and distribution exits in both wholesale and retail account for approximately half the decline, with quality of sales initiatives and challenging traffic trends representing the remainder. We expect the sales trend to improve as we move through the year.","Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is now expected to have minimal impact on revenue growth in fiscal 2018. This is more favorable than our previous guidance of 150 basis points of negative impact.","As you know, over the last several months, the euro has strengthened against the U.S. dollar. While clearly volatile, we are now assuming a euro, U.S. dollar exchange rate to be 1.14 versus our previous assumption of 1.06.","The change in our euro, U.S. dollar exchange rate assumptions is much more impactful on our sales growth than on our gross and operating margins. This is a result of our approach to hedging. We hedge our transaction risk, but not our translation risk.","Our hedging programs for our inventory purchases enables us to have less volatility for our margin from exchange rate movements. We continue to expect operating margin for fiscal 2018 to be 9% to 10.5%, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is now expected to pressure operating margin for fiscal 2018 by approximately 40 to 50 basis points, less than the 50 to 75 basis points we guided to in May.","For the second quarter, we expect revenues to be down 9% to 10%, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Based on current exchange rates, the foreign currency is expected to pressure revenue growth by about 40 basis points in the second quarter.","Operating margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 is expected to be up 40 to 60 basis points, excluding currency impacts. Foreign currency is estimated to pressure operating margin by approximately 40 basis points.","As we move through FY 2018, we expect SG&A declines to moderate as we begin to lap last year's reductions and start to invest in growth initiatives around products, marketing and store concepts that demonstrate high potential for returns. We believe this is the right decision for the long-term, as we balance near-term margin pressure with setting up the company to return to growth.","In addition, our SG&A rate is affected by sales mix shifts. Similar to gross margin, as retail becomes a larger percentage of our mix, it pressures our SG&A rate because retail has a much higher SG&A rate than wholesale. As a reminder, we record all our store occupancy and payroll expenses in our SG&A line. It is also worth noting that FX is becoming less of a tailwind and, in fact, is turning into a headwind for SG&A.","In terms of restructuring and other charges, we continue to expect approximately $200 million for the year. We recognized $47 million of the charges in the first quarter. Regarding tax rates, as a reminder, the adoption of the new accounting standard, ASU 2016-09 for the accounting of employee share-based payments, affects our effective tax rate and increases its variability, with one of the key variables being the price of our stock.","Our tax rate guidance assumes a stock price of $78 per share for the remainder of the year. We expect our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 to be approximately 24% to 25% and for the second quarter to be approximately 24%, including ASU [2016-09].","The guidance for fiscal 2018 tax rate is lower than previously forecasted. This is due to recent favorable movements in foreign exchange rates, as we now expect to generate a larger portion of our earnings from jurisdictions where our earnings are taxed at a lower rate than the U.S. In addition, there were some modest favorable adjustments to our tax reserves that resulted in a net benefit to full-year forecasted effective tax rate.","Let's me finish by reviewing our priorities for cash and capital structure. In times of dynamic change, a strong balance sheet is a strategic asset. We are committed to maintaining our strong balance sheet and investment grade credit rating to provide strategic flexibility, liquidity and access to capital markets.","Within that context, our first priority for cash is to invest in our business and lay the foundation for future profitable growth. Our second priority is to return capital to shareholders, with a commitment to maintaining our dividend. Excess cash flow beyond current and future investment and dividend needs will be considered for future potential share repurchases.","We are not planning share repurchases for fiscal 2018. We make this determination based on the cash needs of our business, sector dynamics and with consideration for the uncertain environment around U.S. tax reform.","We continue to expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2018 to be approximately $300 million, driven by select new store openings, renovation of our retail environments and infrastructure investment.","In closing, we are moving in the right direction. And I am incredibly proud of our team of 23,000 committed, passionate and dedicated Ralph Lauren employees around the globe. Together, we are committed to creating a strong foundation to evolve this iconic brand, consistent with Ralph's enduring vision. With Patrice's leadership, we will continue to intensely focus on execution as we, together, create a pathway toward sustainable growth.","With that, let's open up the call for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The first question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. You may ask your question.","Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, good morning, Jane, and welcome, Patrice.","Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Morning.","Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey. Patrice, so you're inheriting the company's Way Forward Plan. I guess my question is, will you continue to implement the plan as it currently stands or maybe after taking a hard look at it, do you see any opportunities to tweak the original strategy in any way?","Patrice Jean Louis Louvet - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Good morning, Ike, great question. Listen, I think the Way Forward Plan is an operationally sound way to run the business. So, we remain fully committed to it and trust that we're not going to miss a beat when it comes to executing both the operations and the efficiency interventions that we've called out. I'm actually very proud of the team's progress with setting a strong foundation for future growth, whether that's the work on improving the quality of sales or distribution, whether that's the reduction in excess inventory and SKUs and also the progress that you've seen on efficiencies.","Now, we also know that if we look at the future, we're going to have the balance progress on productivity with revenue growth. And so moving forward, while we'll continue to drive the operational and efficiency elements of the Way Forward Plan, we're going to put more emphasis on the revenue growth dimension of our program moving forward.","And specifically here, I'd call out a few things. One is we're exploring our opportunities to become more digital. We're also looking at our opportunities to be more global, because this brand obviously has incredible relevance around the world. And then Ralph and I are very committed to make sure that we evolve how this iconic brand is expressed, how it's experienced to really win the hearts and minds of consumers around the world. So that's kind of the focus on the growth pieces, early thoughts.","We will obviously continue to drive productivity, and the focus here will be on continuing to simplify and streamline our operations company-wide. And then, the focus on how we work is also important to me and to Ralph and to us as leaders of this company. So you'll also see us put more emphasis on new ways of working. Initial thoughts are going to be around making sure our teams are more connected, our teams feel more empowered and, ultimately, we increase the level of energy that we have across all 23,000 employees of the company.","Evren Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Okay, next question, please.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Binetti with UBS. You may ask your question.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning. Congrats on a nice quarter and nice to hear your voice on the first call, Patrice.","Patrice Jean Louis Louvet - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Thank you.","Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Hi, Michael.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Let me just ask, I guess, two questions. First on the guidance for the year, Jane, it looks like with the second quarter, the EBIT margins are going to be up about 80 to 100 [basis points], if we ignore currency. But then, if we just back out the second half from the year, it looks like the guidance [ph] is for the (33:15) margins be down quite significantly in the back half. I know you said the year-over-year SG&A improvement will moderate through the year. Maybe just a little bit more on are you leaving room in the back half due to some kind of uncertainties on the top-line or is it truly that we expect to accelerate the investments for growth?","And then, secondly, you guys talked a lot about how you're thinking about the net revenue outlook for the year and moving towards quality of sale initiatives, reducing levels of discounting, but I think most people are wondering when you think at this point revenues could return to growth. Are you seeing anything in your conversations as you start to look out into the spring and fall of next year where you're starting to get some traction with product where you could say to yourself, look, there's a point on the horizon where we think all this work we're doing is out of the way and we could return to revenue growth?","Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Well, certainly, I'll try to unpack your question, Michael.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you, Jane.","Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.","But certainly, as I look near-in for the balance of this year, as I said, we're very comfortable with our guidance. As we look at the top-line, there's no change to the top-line. We do see gross margin as we move through the second half of the year that will have at least 100 basis points of gross margin expansion.","Now, with the guidance that we've given in terms of what SG&A will be down in the second quarter, we see operating margin expansion coming out of that. As we move into the second half, we'll have that continued 100 basis points of gross margin, but we expect that our SG&A will be flattish. And with that, that brings us to our overall guidance that you will see some compression on a constant currency basis in operating margin.","As we look longer-term, I think you've heard Patrice very, very clearly and passionately state, we are looking to balance efficiency with getting back to growth, but it has to be sustainable, profitable growth. And, at this time, we're not ready to call the inflection point precisely. That is the question. We do think that we're building a plan that will return us to growth, and we'll come back and give you more specifics on the timing as we move forward.","Evren Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Okay, next question, please.","Operator","The next question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. You may ask your question.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Thanks, good morning.","Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Morning.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Good morning. I wanted to ask you about social media. I think, Jane, maybe you mentioned it in one of your prepared remarks and I'd love to get Patrice's views on the topic as well. It seems like it's a growing channel for connecting with consumers and a marketing channel, if you will. How are you guys thinking about it and other digital marketing activities? And, Jane, I also think I heard you mention, I don't know if it was accelerating growth or strong growth from the digital platforms of some of your wholesale partners. I thought that was an interesting comment, given the just general challenges of the wholesale channel. Thanks.","Patrice Jean Louis Louvet - Ralph Lauren Corp.","So, Omar, nice to meet you on the phone. Let me maybe just step back on how we look at e-commerce and online brand-building and, hopefully, that will address both of your questions.","So first of all, the way we look at the e-commerce opportunity is really through three lenses. The first one is our own site, and I'll come back to that in a second. The second one is our retailers' sites. And then, the third one are the pure plays. So if you look at the plan on our own site, I think this has been talked in the past, but we're in the process of completely transforming our RalphLauren.com site. And we expect by the end of the fiscal year to have something that we're excited about, both in terms of brand-building and in terms of e-commerce, right.","The expectation really for the team is this site needs to be our flagship. It's the kind of flagship store of the future, and it hasn't been that in the past. So there's an important pivot there. And then, obviously, we need it to be an e-commerce machine.","As far as our retailers' .com operations are concerned, I've had the chance with my first couple of weeks on the business to actually meet with the CEOs of a number of our top retail partners. And it's actually been exciting to see the focus they're putting on e-commerce and some of the numbers some of them are posting, right, which is actually quite strong. So we want to make sure we're taking advantage of that momentum and working very closely with our retail partners on the way the brand shows up, both again from the brand-building standpoint, our storytelling and from a e-commerce standpoint.","Then the third area is pure plays, which is obviously growing significantly. And we're starting to participate in that. We just signed with zulily a few weeks ago. And you can expect us to expand our presence among the pure players, both here in North America and around the world.","And then we double-click on social media. You heard in our remarks that Ralph and I are really committed to evolving how the brand is expressed and experienced. And, obviously, social media, Omar, you're absolutely right, has got to be a key part of that. We have a new CMO, a new global CMO that came in a few months ago, who's dead-focused on understanding the landscape, getting super clear on which consumers we really go want to after and then leveraging all the social media platforms that you can think of, both here and around the world, because this is how we will further modernize the brand and really make it even more relevant to the younger populations coming into the market.","Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Yeah, Omar, I just thought I'd give you some dimension on what we see across our wholesale e-commerce business, both department stores and pure plays, that it's about $0.5 billion business for us at retail value globally, about 10% of our total wholesale business in FY 2017. That's an important part of our digital ecosphere, if you will, and it's growing in the first quarter and has been growing, so very positive trend there.","As we look at our own e-commerce site, I think we've been really clear about two things. One is job one this entire year is reducing the promotions on the site. You're going to see that. You saw that in the first quarter. You'll see that through the year in terms of the pressure that will have on sales growth. It's critical to deliver price coherency in the market. It's critical from a pricing architecture standpoint, so we're committed to doing that through the year.","The growth is going to come as we launch, as we move out of this fiscal year and into the next year and we right-size that pricing architecture and that promotion base. And that will be enhanced by our new e-commerce platform, where we're going to have a better consumer experience and better digital assets and storytelling on the site. And you'll see that as we move through the second half of the year.","So I think we are very excited about this space. We are putting resources on it for both our wholesale partners and for ourselves. But it's really going to be FY 2019 when you'll start to see that show up in the top-line numbers. You will see it show up in improved margins, as you're seeing.","Evren Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Okay, next question, please.","Operator","The next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. You may ask your question.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Hi, good morning, everyone, and welcome, Patrice.","Patrice Jean Louis Louvet - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Thank you, Dana.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","As you think about the business and as you evaluated it, how do you view the channels of distribution for the business over time? And how should they look maybe different or evolve from where they are today? And, Jane, the gross margin improvement opportunity going forward, how do you see that evolving, whether it's lead times, speed to market and e-commerce? Thank you.","Patrice Jean Louis Louvet - Ralph Lauren Corp.","So very nice to meet you, Dana. First, I would say, we're going to follow the consumer, right? We're going to be driven by where the consumer wants to shop and we will be wherever it makes sense for the brand to show up and where the consumer wants to experience it. So we have an omnichannel play, which we're going to continue to drive. And I expect all these channels will continue to play an important role moving forward, whether that's department stores. Yes, they're under pressure right now, but there's a lot of work going on to also improve the experience that consumers have there. So obviously, that continues to be an important channel for us.","Our own stores, whether it's our factory stores or our full-price stores and then, obviously, e-commerce, as we were just talking in the context of Omar's question. And then, there is a role for off-price to play within our overall strategy. So I expect this to continue to drive across these channels. Obviously, the relative size of them and growth rates will vary over time and will vary by country and by region. But we're committed to making sure that we are set up to win, where the consumer wants to shop consistently moving forward.","Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Dana, as I look at gross margin, that dynamic that Patrice just described, which is really that you're going to see digital be a long-term driver of growth as well as direct-to-consumer overall. And so that will play positively into what you'll see in terms of long-term gross margin expansion. Also, the international opportunity is a tailwind long-term to gross margin expansion. I expect those to be both durable and long-term. They'll play into our gross margin expansion this year and also into the long-term.","What's also playing into gross margin, as we talked about the at least 100 basis points of expansion as we look at balance of year, is our AUR improvements and promotion reduction in terms of depth and frequency, and that's also a tailwind through this year of gross margin expansion.","As we, long-term, pursue our strategy and execute the strategy to elevate the brand, I do see AUR also as a long-term driver to gross margin expansion.","Evren Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Next question, please.","Operator","The next question comes from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I had two questions. Patrice, you talked about in your opening remarks a need and a desire to redefining the shopping experience for consumers. Can you give us a little more detail on what that means to you? What is a redefined shopping experience in all the key channels you talk about doing business?","And then, secondly, for Jane, you talked about in your prepared remarks also that excluding certain actions in Europe, shipment timing, et cetera, European, I think you said wholesale sales, were roughly flattish. Do you have that detail for North America? In other words, excluding some of your inventory actions, et cetera, what is the trend for wholesale, for sales at retail at your wholesale partners? Thank you.","Patrice Jean Louis Louvet - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Good morning, Lindsay. So I'll probably be in a better position to answer your question a few months from now. But the way I'm thinking about it with the team is how do we further engage the consumer in our brand, really find a way to tell our story, going well beyond just selling items, but really telling our story and portraying the world that we offer and then closing the sale, all right, closing the sale and driving loyalty. So all these are that's the general conceptual direction, I'd reserve the right to get back to you in our next call with more granularity as we work through the plans with the team.","Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.","So, Lindsay, just to parse your question now, in Europe, as we looked at the shipment timing, that accounted for about half of the decline in the wholesale sales this quarter. The other half was really brand exits and reduced off-price. And that, if we exclude that, that's how we get to be about flattish wholesale trend in wholesale, and really what we expect to see roughly as we move through the year.","And as I look at North America, and we step back from overall wholesale, so we declined 27 points in the quarter. About 20 was really attributable to what I would say is brand exits, a pullback in receipts and door closures. Those three factors were about 20 points of the decline. So if you look at that over time, we're looking at wholesale underlying trends at about down mid to high single digits.","Evren Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Next question, please.","Operator","The next question comes from Laurent Vasilescu with Macquarie. You may ask your question.","Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. And welcome, Patrice. It's nice to see continued progress around the gross margin, but I wanted to ask about the SG&A margins. First, near-term, can you possibly quantify in dollar terms the key buckets which drove the 13% decline in this quarter? And secondly, longer-term, where do you think SG&A margins can go? As you invest in marketing and product creation, are there any SG&A buckets where synergies can be gained in order to offset these investments?","Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Sure. So as I think about, in the first quarter, where did the benefit come, it really is in terms of we saw a significant reduction in payroll, reduction in occupancy expenses associated with the store closures that we completed, a reduction in depreciation and then some trimming of what you'd expect, consulting expenses, T&E, rounded out the reductions. But if I had to prioritize them, it would be in that sort of ingredient label order.","As we look at longer-term efficiencies, what I think is clear is that we're committed to elevating this brand. And that implies that as we get back to growth, that marketing will grow hand-in-hand with growth. But we do believe there are opportunities for streamlining and efficiencies through our operating processes, through production processes, through streamlined and better leverage of our distribution facilities. And, of course, the ultimate lever is comp growth, which will leverage our fixed costs infrastructure. But that's where I see the longer-term opportunity.","Evren Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Next question, please.","Operator","The next question comes from Simeon Siegel with Nomura Securities. You may ask your question.","Simeon Avram Siegel - Instinet LLC","Thanks, good morning. Congrats on the progress.","Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Thank you.","Simeon Avram Siegel - Instinet LLC","So, Patrice, your comments on the growing digital in the pure plays, Amazon, obviously, comes up in just a few conversations. Can you share your view there? And then, congrats on the strong gross margin. Could you just quantify what mix shifts were and then what you'd expect them to be for the rest of the year? Thanks.","Patrice Jean Louis Louvet - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Good morning, Simeon. So, yes, obviously, I know Amazon is top-of-mind for all of you and it is for all of us, obviously, as well. So going back to our strategy, we are looking at these three buckets: Our own site, our wholesale .com and pure plays. Within pure plays, we're actually doing a very thorough exercise, as we speak, both for North American and around the globe to understand where we need to show up, where is the consumer shopping, what's the better fit for our brand. And so nothing to announce at this point, but know that we're actively working through what are the right pure play partnerships for this business moving forward.","Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Yes, and just as I look at drivers of gross margin expansion in the quarter, about half of it was channel and geographic mix. And the other half was really driven by what I will call pricing and promotion reductions and AUR improvements. And those dynamics, I expect them to continue through the year with about that level of contribution.","Evren Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Next question, please.","Operator","The next question comes from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray. You may ask your question.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. Thanks, good morning and welcome, Patrice.","Patrice Jean Louis Louvet - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Thanks, Erinn.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.","I guess, Patrice, I had a question for you. I know you've been there just a few months. But when you take a step back and just think about the prognosis of the Ralph Lauren brand, how do you think about it as it relates to today's millennials and keeping the brand relevant? It just seems like that's a cohort of consumers that's been a little bit harder to reach in the last few years.","And then, Jane, just for you, in North America, as it relates to international tourist flows, what did you see during the first quarter? Thanks.","Patrice Jean Louis Louvet - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Good morning, Erinn, a very good question on the millennial consumer. Well, I kind of step back, and Ralph and I have actually had a number of conversations on this that says, okay, what are the core values of the Ralph Lauren brand, all right. And we would say they're entrepreneurship, creativity, stylish living and authenticity, and all that is coupled with a very rich heritage of real storytelling. All of that is timeless, right, if you think through the values that are relevant to today's consumer, millennials would raise their hand and say that makes lot of sense to them.","The second thing I would say is as we look at the millennial consumer, is that they are looking for meaning in brands. Again, they are not just buying a product. They're buying into a world. They're buying into a set of values. And they place a lot of emphasis on where do you come from, what do you stand for, what's your story, what are your values, are you giving back to the world. I think, again, the Ralph Lauren brand is incredibly well-positioned on this whole meaning space.","So the challenge for us is, okay, with these strong value foundations, with this sense of meaning, how do we translate it today for that consumer group, right? And that's the work Ralph and I and the team are committed to. That's why we talk about evolving and elevating the way the brand is expressed and experienced, because we know we are going to have to make some changes in terms of how we engage the consumer, where we engage the consumer. Go back to the earlier conversation we're having on social media, back to the earlier discussion we're having on driving digital harder because we know a number of the millennial consumers are not interested in going into brick-and-mortar.","But I feel very confident coming in with the foundations of this brand. And now the challenge and the task for us, and I'm very confident we can do this well, is to translate it in a way that connects with today's consumers and the millennial population coming up.","Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.","And, Erinn, just in terms of the foreign tourist trends that we're seeing, as we normalize for some of the calendar pushes and pulls as we move through 2017, really, 2017 foreign tourist traffic, we saw down about 15%. And we're seeing some positive signs. Foreign tourist traffic is still down in the first quarter, but really in the high single-digit range. So again, some improvement as you normalize out of last year and adjust for some of the calendar shifts from down 15% to down high single-digit.","Evren Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Okay, we'll take one last question.","Operator","The last question comes from Christian Buss with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question.","Christian Roland Buss - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Jane, could you provide an update on the design cycles and how you're feeling about the progress on speeding design cycles in speed to market?","Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.","We feel great. We are on track to deliver what we said, which was 90% of our product in a nine month timeframe. And additionally, we are looking to have 35% of our product now on a six month timeframe. So we're very encouraged by the work that we're doing. We know it gives us greater ability to read the market and react to the market and manage our inventory flows productively, so very encouraged with that.","Patrice Jean Louis Louvet - Ralph Lauren Corp.","And I would second that. And I think as I've engaged with the teams, we have real energy to continuously raise the bar. So, as Jane's mentioned, we're making great progress against the original targets that we had set for ourselves. We're not going to stop there, all right. We're going to continue to raise the bar till ultimately we get into a best-in-class position across the board for lead times.","Patrice Jean Louis Louvet - Ralph Lauren Corp.","Good. Well, listen, this closes out our call. Thank you for joining us, and then we look forward to speaking to you again next quarter. Thanks. Have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."]}}
